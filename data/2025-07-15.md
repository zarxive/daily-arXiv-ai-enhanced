### [1] [Universal Scaling Laws in Freeway Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09530)
*Garyoung Lee,Aryaman Jha,Kurt Wiesenfeld,Jorge Laval*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: 该论文利用I-24 MOTION测试平台的高分辨率车辆轨迹数据，通过实证分析显示出，交通流量在相变点之后表现出自组织临界状态和Kardar-Parisi-Zhang泛函的性质，这为理解和管理交通拥堵提供了新的方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市化进程加速，交通拥堵问题日益突出，寻找有效的解决方法至关重要。该研究通过实证和理论分析，揭示了交通流量的统计特性，有助于建立更高效的预测和管理策略。

Method: 该研究使用了I-24 MOTION测试平台的高分辨率数据，分析了交通流量的自组织临界性和Kardar-Parisi-Zhang泛函的特性，结合了理论建模和实证分析的方法。

Result: 论文实证表明，交通流量在达到相变点后表现出自组织临界状态和Kardar-Parisi-Zhang泛函的特性，这提供了新的理论框架和实用的方法来应对交通拥堵问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解交通拥堵提供了实证数据支持，并提出了一种基于自组织临界性和Kardar-Parisi-Zhang泛函的解决方案，对交通科学的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Traffic congestion, a daily frustration for millions and a multi-billion
dollar drain on economies, has long resisted deep physical understanding. While
simple theoretical models of traffic flow have suggested connections to
critical phenomena and non-equilibrium universality, direct empirical
validation is lacking. Using extensive, high-resolution vehicle trajectory data
from the I-24 MOTION testbed, we show that traffic flow exhibits both a
percolation phase transition that is self-organized critical and fluctuations
consistent with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in 1+1 dimensions. This
suggests that the complex and seemingly chaotic formation of traffic jams has
predictable statistical properties, which opens new avenues in traffic science
for developing advanced forecasting and management strategies grounded in
universal scaling laws.

### [2] [Machine-Precision Prediction of Low-Dimensional Chaotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09652)
*Christof Schötz,Niklas Boers*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: 通过使用高精度计算和多项式特征，该研究在低维混沌系统中实现了从无噪声观测数据中学习动力学模型的高精度。在Lorenz-63系统中，预测时间达到了32至105个Lyapunov时间，显著超过了现有方法的最多13个。还在更高维的Lorenz-96模型中重复验证了结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者们常使用低维混沌系统如Lorenz-63模型来测试学习动力学的方法。本文提出了一种通过高精度计算和多项式特征 learning的方法，显著提高了预测时间，展示了在噪声数据中学习动力学模型可能变得容易。

Method: 研究者使用了普通最小二乘回归，并基于512位精度的高阶多项式特征，且通过理论分析计算了在使用精确计算的条件下，机器精度可以被超越。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractors中，方法的预测时间分别达到了32至105个Lyapunov时间和更长的持续时间。而即将发布的方法在更高维和更复杂的Lorenz-96系统中也进行了验证，结果一致。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，使用高精度计算和多项式回归方法，从无噪声数据中学习低维混沌系统的动力学模型在机器精度下是可行的，看似解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Low-dimensional chaotic systems such as the Lorenz-63 model are commonly used
to benchmark system-agnostic methods for learning dynamics from data. Here we
show that learning from noise-free observations in such systems can be achieved
up to machine precision: using ordinary least squares regression on high-degree
polynomial features with 512-bit arithmetic, our method exceeds the accuracy of
standard 64-bit numerical ODE solvers of the true underlying dynamical systems.
Depending on the configuration, we obtain valid prediction times of 32 to 105
Lyapunov times for the Lorenz-63 system, dramatically outperforming prior work
that reaches 13 Lyapunov times at most. We further validate our results on
Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractor, a non-polynomial chaotic system that is
considerably more complex than the Lorenz-63 model, and show that similar
results extend also to higher dimensions using the spatiotemporally chaotic
Lorenz-96 model. Our findings suggest that learning low-dimensional chaotic
systems from noise-free data is a solved problem.

### [3] [Left-Right Husimi Representation of Chaotic Resonance States: Invariance and Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10431)

Motivation: 研究混沌系统中的量子态表示及其经典对应关系，有助于理解量子与经典之间的关系，特别是在复杂系统中的量子 signatures。

Method: 使用左-右Husimi表示法研究动力学性质，结合数值模拟验证理论预测。

Result: 左-右Husimi表示在半经典极限下表现出量子不变性，并分解为经典分形因子与量子波动因子。各示例系统均支持这些结论。

Conclusion: 量子不变性可能提供研究复杂散射系统的重要视角，有助于理解量子与经典关联。未来可能探索更多复杂系统中的类似结构。

Abstract: For chaotic scattering systems we investigate the left-right Husimi
representation, which combines left and right resonance states. We demonstrate
that the left-right Husimi representation is invariant in the semiclassical
limit under the corresponding closed classical dynamics, which we call quantum
invariance. Furthermore, we show that it factorizes into a classical
multifractal structure times universal quantum fluctuations. Numerical results
for a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and quantum maps
confirm both the quantum invariance and the factorization.

### [4] [Enhanced Electromagnetic Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09555)
*Jann Zosso*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文展示了电磁的记忆幅度可以显著提高，特别是在具有降低光速的洛伦兹破坏相位中，存在关键的时空方向，使得记忆源发射后的总偏移得到了数量级的增加。这种增强的观察可能为记忆现象的首次观测以及验证渐近对称性和软定理提供了实验室测试的机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者们希望探索电磁记忆现象的增强可能性以及其对洛伦兹破坏和保留相位的影响。

Method: 论文通过理论分析和计算，研究了不同洛伦兹对称性的相位中电磁记忆的增强效果，特别是在高能极限和特定发射方向上。

Result: 结果表明，在特定条件下，电磁记忆的幅度显著提高，为未来的观测提供了理论基础和实验方向。

Conclusion: 研究结果说明，通过调整系统条件，可以显著增强电磁记忆，这对于理解引力波和光的行为具有重要意义，同时也为验证基本物理原理提供了新工具。

Abstract: We show that the amplitude of electromagnetic memory can be significantly
enhanced in comparison to known estimates. In a Lorentz breaking phase of
lowered phase velocity of light, there exist critical spacetime directions of
memory-source emission along the effective light cone, about which the total
memory offset receives order of magnitude increases. The same amplification is
already present in the Lorentz preserving case by considering
ultra-relativistic memory-source charges. These observations may pave the way
for a first observation of the phenomenon of memory and laboratory tests of the
concepts of asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems.

### [5] [Observational signatures of scalar field dynamics in modified $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08897)
*Amit Samaddar,S. Surendra Singh*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  paper investigates a tanh-parametrized scalar field model in f(Q, Lm) gravity, finds good parameter constraints with a transition from deceleration to acceleration, and suggests compatibility with cosmic acceleration and black hole phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Cosmological models often explore modified gravity theories to explain cosmic acceleration. This paper uses a specific parametrization of a scalar field in $f(Q, Lm)$ gravity to model scalar field dark energy and explore its implications.

Method:  The paper uses MCMC methods and combines multiple datasets (cosmic chronometers, BAO, etc.) to constrain model parameters, finding $H_0$, $equire{mhchem}m{ho_m}$, and $B$.

Result:  The model successfully transitions from deceleration to acceleration at $z=0.5914$, with asymptotic convergence to de Sitter phase and compatible with existing observations.

Conclusion:  The tanh-scalar field model in the given $f(Q, Lm)$ gravity framework is viable for describing cosmic acceleration and gravitational aspects like black hole accretion.

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of a tanh-parametrized scalar
field model in the framework of modified $f(Q, L_{m})$ gravity by adopting the
form $f(Q, L_{m})=\beta Q+\delta L_{m}$ along with a scalar field energy
density $\rho_\phi = \rho_{c0} \tanh(A + Bz)$. Using MCMC methods and combining
$31$ cosmic chronometer data points, $15$ BAO, DESI DR2 BAO and $1701$
Pantheon+ samples, we constrain the model parameters and obtain
$H_{0}=74.284^{+4.155}_{-4.275}$, $\Omega_{m0}=0.326^{+0.093}_{-0.072}$ and
$B=-0.001^{+0.030}_{-0.030}$. The model predicts a transition redshift
$z_{tr}=0.5914$ and a present deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.5167$, consistent
with a Universe transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. We further
analyze the evolution of the EoS parameter, density components and statefinder
diagnostics in which all parameters show asymptotic convergence to a de Sitter
phase. Additionally, we study black hole mass accretion, showing its dependence
on the scalar field dynamics. This work highlights the compatibility of
tanh-scalar field forms with $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity in describing cosmic
acceleration and gravitational phenomena.

### [6] [Electromagnetic Energy Extraction from Kerr Black Holes: Ab-Initio Calculations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08942)
*Claudio Meringolo,Filippo Camilloni,Luciano Rezzolla*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper uses collisionless kinetic simulations to study black hole magnetospheres and finds strong evidence that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism works reliably, with results matching both analytic calculations and simulations.achment: This is a too long; didn’t read summary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to validate the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism, which is crucial for understanding energy extraction from rotating black holes. By employing advanced simulations, the authors seek to provide empirical support for this mechanism and determine its applicability across different black hole spins and masses.

Method: General-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres are conducted over a broad range of spin parameters. They utilize a classical split-monopole magnetic field configuration to model the system and compare the outcomes with analytic calculations and other simulation approaches.

Result: The simulations demonstrate that the Blandford-Znajek luminosity is in excellent agreement with analytic predictions and compatible with magnetohydrodynamic simulations through a simple rescaling. This indicates the robustness of the BZ mechanism and provides precise electromagnetic luminosity estimates for scenarios involving various mass black holes.

Conclusion: The study solidifies the reliability and effectiveness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism as a reliable tool for modeling energy extraction from rotating black holes. The findings are consistent across different models and simulations, offering accurate expectations for electromagnetic luminosity in various astrophysical contexts involving black holes of different masses.

Abstract: The possibility of extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism represents a cornerstone of relativistic
astrophysics. We present general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations
of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres covering a wide range in the black-hole spin.
Considering a classical split-monopole magnetic field, we can reproduce with
these ab-initio calculations the force-free electrodynamics of rotating black
holes and measure the power of the jet launched as a function of the spin. The
Blandford-Znajek luminosity we find is in very good agreement with analytic
calculations and compatible with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
simulations via a simple rescaling. These results provide strong evidence of
the robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and accurate estimates of the
electromagnetic luminosity to be expected in those scenarios involving rotating
black holes across the mass scale.

### [7] [Frozen states of charged boson stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08946)
*Yves Brihaye,Betti Hartmann*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了带有电荷的玻色星的固有状态，通过U(1)规范标量场模型与引力的最小耦合，找到了适合耦合常数的全局正则解。这些解类似Mazur-Mottola解，内部是de Sitter，外部是黑洞，并通过薄层连接，取代了事件视界。使用标准的电动力学可以找到这些固有状态，但自交互是必要的。添加Horndeski向量-张量引力后，固有状态的存在与自交互无关。固有状态有两个稳定或不稳定的小光环，一个在薄层内部，另一个在黑洞外部。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究固有状态在理论物理中的意义，特别是在引力和规范场理论中的应用，能深化对量子引力的理解。

Method: 数学模型分析，通过求解规范 scalar场模型的最小化方程来寻找解决方案。

Result: 发现了新的全局正则固有状态，具有特定的光学环结构。

Conclusion: 证明通过规范场调节压力梯度可以得到稳定的黑洞解。这些解为研究量子引力和相变提供了新方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we study frozen states of charged boson stars. These solutions
are globally regular and exist in a U(1) gauged scalar field model minimally
coupled to gravity for suitable choices of the coupling constants. These
configurations are field theoretical realizations of the Mazur-Mottola solution
with a de Sitter interior, a black hole exterior and a thin shell that
interpolates between the two and replaces the event horizon. We demonstrate
that standard electrodynamics is sufficient to find these frozen states, but
that the self-interaction of the scalar field is crucial. Adding Horndeski
vector-tensor gravity to the model allows the frozen states to exist without
self-interaction though. The frozen states possess one stable and one unstable
lightring, the former inside the thin shell, the latter in the black hole
exterior.

### [8] [Topological dressing method for the Einstein-Maxwell equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09017)
*Juri Dimaschko*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的精确解方法，通过拓扑改造将电真空爱因斯坦-麦克斯韦方程组的标准解转化为带有throat的wormhole解，具有有效的质量和电荷分布在throat周围。将施瓦茨child解拓扑改造得到一个可穿越的wormhole解，并且在外部压力存在时仍保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 wormhole 的存在性和稳定性是现代理论物理的重要课题，尤其是电真空条件下 wormhole 的构造可能引发新的物理见解。

Method: 该论文采用了一种称为“拓扑改造法”的方法，通过以可穿透解为基础，对爱因斯坦-麦克斯韦方程组的精确解进行变形修饰，构造出带有wormhole的新精确解。工作中核心是对已知解的结构进行调整，使其能够包含wormhole的特性，同时保持精确性。

Result: 研究得出能够通过拓扑改造法将任意电真空标准解转化为带有wormhole的新解。具体而言，施瓦茨child解被拓扑改造得到一个可穿透且具有稳定性的wormhole解。

Conclusion: 通过该方法，不仅能够构造出新的 Wormhole 穿越解，而且该解在外部压力存在时仍保持稳定，为 wormhole 的存在提供了新证据，并可能为 wormhole 的实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: A regular method is proposed that makes it possible to obtain a new exact
solution with a wormhole from any topologically trivial exact solution of the
Einstein-Maxwell equations in an electrovacuum (topological dressing method).
This solution has a structure similar to that of a thin-shell wormhole, but
unlike it, it is exact and, therefore, does not require the presence of any
other field sources. The wormhole itself is shown to create both gravitational
and electromagnetic fields. The corresponding effective mass and effective
charge are distributed over the surface of its throat and around it. The
topological dressing of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution with zero effective
mass and non-zero effective charge gives a new solution describing a
traversable wormhole. This solution is shown to be stable in the presence of
external pressure.

### [9] [Perturbations of Kerr with approximate Killing spinors -- Part 1: Wave version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09033)
*Thomas Bäckdahl*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for analyzing non-linear perturbations of the Kerr spacetime, which is a solution to Einstein's equations representing a rotating black hole. The authors develop a framework using a Killing spinor, enabling the construction of various quantities that measure deviations from the Kerr spacetime. They derive evolution equations for these quantities and covariantly construct structures on the perturbed spacetime without relying on a reference solution, aiming to provide a simpler and more efficient analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is aimed at simplifying the study of deviations from the Kerr spacetime, a key solution in general relativity, by leveraging a Killing spinor and avoiding traditional reference solutions, thereby potentially making complex perturbation analyses more manageable.

Method: The authors introduce a new framework characterized by a Killing spinor. On the perturbed spacetime, they construct an approximation of the Killing spinor and use it to define quantities measuring the deviation from Kerr. These quantities are then used to derive evolution equations. Rather than constructing structures relative to a reference background, the approach builds them covariantly on the perturbed spacetime itself.

Result: The result is an evolution equation framework that avoids a reference solution, providing a better framework for analyzing non-linear perturbations of Kerr spacetime, particularly useful for studying black hole dynamics and other relativistic effects without the complicating factors of a reference solution.

Conclusion: The method circumvents the need for a reference background solution, offering a more intrinsic approach to studying spacetime perturbations around Kerr black holes, which could lead to more accurate models and analyses of black hole behavior in non-linear scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a new framework for non-linear perturbations of the
Kerr spacetime. This is based on a characterization of the Kerr spacetime in
terms of a Killing spinor. On the perturbed spacetime, one can construct an
approximation of the Killing spinor. Based on this, a number of quantities are
constructed measuring the deviation from Kerr. Evolution equations for these
quantities are derived. Approximations of the Killing vectors, the mass and
angular momentum parameters etc., are constructed along with a full set of
equations for their derivatives. In this setting, we don't need a reference
background solution. Instead, we covariantly construct the relevant structures
on the perturbed spacetime itself. This can eliminate many issues and allow for
a cleaner analysis.

### [10] [A comprehensive dynamical and phenomenological analysis of structure growth in curvature-modulated coupled quintessence scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09169)
*Anirban Chatterjee,Yungui Gong*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了一个暗物质-暗能量相互作用模型，并通过相空间分析找到了稳定的加速吸引子条件。结果显示模型对观测数据具有良好的拟合度，且可以自然解释宇宙混合问题。结果表明，当参数适中时，模型在背景和 Perturbations 方面都表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索暗物质和暗能量相互作用的模型，特别是它们如何相互作用以及如何影响宇宙的加速膨胀，这对于理解宇宙的演化非常重要。通过相空间分析可以更好地理解系统的动力学行为，这有助于找到稳定且符合观测数据的模型。

Method: 使用五维爱因斯坦场方程，引入标量场和能量密度相关的相互作用项，然后将宇宙学方程转化为一阶自治系统，使用相空间分析方法找出吸引子。计算密度波动和增长指数，以及计算降加速参数和距离模数，与观测数据进行比较。

Result: 通过相空间分析，条件参数范围被确定，模型在小 β 值下表现出良好的稳定性。结果表明，模型与观测数据拟合良好，尤其在满足宇宙混合问题方面具有蹲势。结果还表明，当相互作用参数在中间范围时， matter perturbations 进一步增长，能够有效捕捉背景和 Perturbations 的动态。

Conclusion: 该模型提供了一个在暗物质和暗能量之间合理互动的框架，不仅符合观测数据，还能解释宇宙混合问题，因此在理论上和应用上都是可行的。

Abstract: We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the
quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa
\rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R^2/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field
evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa
\phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the
cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless
variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable,
non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by
$\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with
attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also
analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast
$\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the
deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus
$\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally
addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking
behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow
into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics
effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable
approach to interacting dark energy.

### [11] [Combining (post-)Newtonian ideas with quasi-equilibrium (QE) sequence analysis for black hole-neutron star (BHNS) gravitational wave events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09175)
*Antonio Lanza,Samuel D. Tootle,Andrea Lapi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses quasi-equilibrium models of BHNS binaries, analyzing ISCO and mass shedding within simulations inspired by GW200105 and GW200115. They find ISCOs at larger separations and suggest that the NS may fill its Roche lobe before ISCO, leading to mass transfer and a third possible outcome for NS in BHNS mergers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on BHNS binary systems and their implications for gravitational wave observations, aiming to understand outcomes beyond BH mergers.

Method: The authors used quasi-equilibrium models with FUKA initial data to determine properties like ISCO and mass shedding separations in BHNS binaries.

Result: They found that in most cases, ISCO is at larger separations, and NS may fill its Roche lobe before ISCO, suggesting a third fate for NS.

Conclusion: The study indicates that NS in BHNS binaries may undergo mass transfer before ISCO, preventing electromagnetic counterparts and leading to a distinct outcome compared to BH mergers.

Abstract: In this paper we present quasi equilibrium models of black hole-neutron star
(BHNS) binaries with mass and spin values compatible with parameter estimates
derived from gravitational radiation events GW200105 and GW200115, events
consistent with the merger of BHNSs. Using the FUKA initial data framework, we
determine the location of ISCO (Innermost Stable Circular Orbit) and radius of
mass shedding. In most of the cases studied here the innermost stable orbit is
located at larger separations. This is consistent with the fact that for those
two events no electromagnetic counterparts have been observed since it is
believed that the NS will enter into the plunge phase in a short time once the
separation of the components of the binary will be smaller of ISCO. In analogy
with classical binaries, we have associated to these QE sequences a Newtonian
and Post Newtonian Roche Lobe analysis to verify whether the NS is filling its
Roche Lobe before approaching the ISCO. For selected configurations explored
here, the location of ISCO and of the orbit at which mass shedding occurs are
at separation smaller than the last converged solution of our sequences. Our
analysis shows that in such cases the neutron star is filling its Roche lobe
suggesting that mass transfer might occur well before encountering the last
stable orbit, and this should happen in catastrophic way in order to prevent
any electromagnetic emissions. If this is the case, we are suggestion a third
fate of the neutron star beyond the plunge or tidal disruption ones.

{\alpha} we obtain the Lagrangian and equations of motion. we obtain two type
solutions for these models. The first case leads to Schwarzschild-de Sitter
(anti de Sitter) solution and the other one, results in a new metric. At last,
the event horizon, the Hawking temperature and the generalized second law of
thermodynamics in the framework of the modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity for this
solution as a black hole are investigated.

### [13] [Constraining cosmological dynamics of scalar-tensor models of dark energy in teleparallel gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09241)
*Naser Mohammadipour*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Scalar-tensor teleparallel gravity theory with non-minimal scalar field and torsion interaction shows that for constant sigma or lambda, specific forms of f(phi) and V(phi) lead to viable cosmological behaviors, with dark energy acting like radiation or matter domination, and conditions for a viable trajectory established.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze cosmological models in modified gravity theories to understand potential dark energy scenarios and structure formation evolution.

Method: Derived field equations, studied cosmological evolution using cosmological parameters and dynamic systems analysis, performed phase space analysis, determined conditions on model parameters for viable universe expansion phases.

Result: The model supports conditions where scalar field behaves like radiation or matter domination, with parameters lambda >1 necessary for transition between eras and small sigma ensuring dominance phases.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to viable teleparallel dark energy models capable of explaining early universe expansion and late-time acceleration through different energy density dominated epochs with variable equation of state.

Abstract: We consider a scalar-tensor theory in teleparallel gravity where a general
function of the scalar field, f(phi), is non-minimally coupled to the torsion
scalar T. First, we derive the field equations in this framework. Then, we
study the cosmological evolution in a spatially flat, homogeneous, and
isotropic universe described by the FRW metric, containing radiation and
non-relativistic matter with energy densities rho_r and rho_m, respectively. We
analyze the system as an autonomous dynamical model of dark energy. The
cosmological behavior depends on the coupling function sigma =
f'(phi)/sqrt(f(phi)) and the potential parameter lambda = [V'(phi) * f(phi)] /
[V(phi) * f'(phi)]. A constant coupling sigma leads to a quadratic form f(phi)
proportional to (phi + c)^2, while a constant lambda results in a power-law
potential V(phi) proportional to f(phi)^lambda. These forms are supported by
mathematical and physical considerations. We perform phase space analysis and
show that lambda much greater than 1 is a necessary condition to obtain a
radiation-dominated era with effective equation of state w_eff approximately
1/3 and a matter-dominated era with w_eff approximately 0. Moreover, small
sigma^2 ensures radiation and matter dominance in the respective eras. Finally,
we derive the necessary conditions for a viable cosmological trajectory in this
setting.

Motivation: 研究引力理论模型中的经典和半经典特征有助于深入理解这些结构的物理特性，特别是在不同解决方案下的表现

Method: 使用分立解模型，分析了不同解决方案和对应的物理量，包括引力子和狄拉克场的摄动的方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明在不同条件下，Proca-Gauss-Bonnet模型的解表现出提升和变化。

Abstract: We investigate classical and semiclassical signatures of black holes in a
recently proposed Proca-Gauss-Bonnet gravity model that admits asymptotically
flat solutions with primary hair. Two distinct classes of spherically symmetric
metrics arise from different relations between the coupling constants of
scalar-tensor and vector-tensor Gauss-Bonnet interactions. For each geometry,
we examine the range of parameters permitting horizon formation and analyze the
motion of test particles and light rays. We compute characteristic observables
including the shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO) frequency, and binding energy. Additionally, we study scalar and Dirac
field perturbations, derive the corresponding effective potentials, and
calculate the grey-body factors (GBFs) using both the sixth-order
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method and their correspondence with
quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our results show that the QNM-based approximation of
GBFs is accurate for sufficiently large multipole numbers and that deviations
from Schwarzschild geometry become pronounced for large values of the Proca

### [15] [Solving an Interacting Quintessence Model with a Sound Horizon Initial Condition and its Observational Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09258)
*Wenzhong Liu,Yabo Wu,Supriya Pan,Weiqiang Yang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses a coupled quintessence dark energy model that adjusts the sound horizon at the recombination time. It suggests that interactions could influence the Hubble constant and early universe parameters, though the effect is minimal and doesn't fully resolve the Hubble tension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aimed to explore quintessence dark energy models and their implications on cosmological constants and Hubble tension.

Method: The authors used quintessence models with coupling, considered the sound horizon scaling, applied MCMC to parameter space, and analyzed background and CMB data.

Result: The model slightly improves H0 and S8, partly alleviating the tension but not completely.

Conclusion: Coupled quintessence models with sound horizon scaling at recombination could help in early dynamics, but more significant effects are needed for full tension resolution.

Abstract: Astronomical observations suggest that the current standard $\Lambda$-Cold
Dark Matter model in modern cosmology has some discrepancies when fitting the
data during the whole expansion history of the universe. To solve the Hubble
constant ($H_0$) tension, usually an unknown mechanism is considered that
shifts the sound horizon at the decoupling era. On the other hand, dynamical
dark energy models are also considered to resolve the problems of the
cosmological constant, and the additional degrees of freedom require initial
conditions for a solution. In this article we have considered a coupled
quintessence dark energy model with a special focus on its early-time
behaviour. In our solution the initial conditions are naturally decided by
setting the value of the sound horizon at the recombination time, $\theta^*$.
We find that during this process, $H_0$ could be derived and its value rises
with the coupling strength of the interaction. We also performed the background
and cosmic microwave background power spectrum analysis, and find that the
existence of the interaction term affects the energy density during a narrow
time interval range and shifts the early cosmic microwave background spectrum.
We also constrained the parameter space of the underlying scenario using the
markov chain monte carlo analysis. We find that the best-fit values of $H_0$
and $S_8$ are improved slightly for the interacting model, but not enough to
release the tensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limits of observable universe and its expansion is crucial for teaching cosmology, prompting a review of key concepts using modern models and visual tools.

Method: The paper presents a structured review, using graphical aids for better comprehension of light propagation in expanding universe.

Result: Explains cosmological horizons and Hubble sphere, aiding teaching of cosmology through visual representations and Lambda CDM model.

Conclusion: Useful resource for educators to explain complex cosmology topics effectively through simple visual aids and modern theoretical framework.

Abstract: The recently unveiled deep-field images from the James Webb Space Telescope
have renewed interest in what we can and cannot see of the universe. Answering
these questions requires understanding the so-called "cosmological horizons"
and the "Hubble sphere". Here we review the topic of cosmological horizons in a
form that university physics teachers can use in their lessons, using the
latest data about the so-called standard "Lambda Cold Dark Matter"
($\Lambda$CDM) model. Graphical representations are plotted in terms of both
conformal and proper coordinates as an aid to understanding the propagation of
light in the expanding universe at various epochs.

### [17] [Possible Formation of Traversable Wormholes and Their Thermodynamic Analysis in $\mathcal{F}(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m},\mathcal{T})$ Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09327)
*Rounak Manna,Krishna Pada Das,Ujjal Debnath*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents static, spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions in F(Q,Lm,T) gravity, using specific functions to ensure viability. They establish conditions like flaring-out, asymptotic flatness, and require exotic matter near the throat. Thermodynamic analysis suggests stability with equilibrium. Conclusion: wormholes need exotic matter, extending thermodynamics and promoting new research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores wormhole solutions in modified gravity theories, which is a significant area in theoretical physics. Investigating the role of exotic matter and thermodynamic stability provides insights into potential astrophysical applications.

Method: The authors used the F(Q,Lm,T) gravity framework, chose specific functions for redshift and shape, applied the Karmarkar condition, and analyzed energy and thermodynamic conditions.

Result: Wormholes require exotic matter near the throat, are thermodynamically stable, and the setup is consistent with equilibrium. This is notable as it extends previous findings and needs further stability tests and observational checks.

Conclusion: Exotic matter is essential for traversable wormholes. The paper advances our understanding by applying thermodynamic principles and suggests future work on dynamical stability and astrophysical implications.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate static and spherically symmetric traversable
wormhole solutions within the framework of the extended symmetric teleparallel
gravity, specifically the $\mathcal{F}(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m},\mathcal{T})$ gravity
theory, where $Q$, $\mathcal{L}_{m}$, and $\mathcal{T}$ are the respective
representations of the non-metricity scalar, the matter Lagrangian, and the
trace of the energy-momentum tensor. By employing a specific redshift function
and deriving the shape function through the Karmarkar condition, we examine the
fundamental geometric features required for a viable wormhole structure. The
analysis confirms the satisfaction of key conditions such as the throat
condition, flaring-out condition, and asymptotic flatness. A detailed study of
energy conditions for various values of model parameters reveals that the null
energy condition and averaged null energy condition are violated near the
throat, indicating the presence of exotic matter. Additionally, thermodynamic
quantities such as temperature, pressure, specific heat, work density, and
energy flux are analyzed, all of which support the thermal and equilibrium
stability of the wormhole. Our findings demonstrate that even in extended
theories like $\mathcal{F}(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m},\mathcal{T})$ gravity, exotic
matter remains essential for sustaining traversable wormholes. This work lays
the foundation for further investigations into their stability under dynamical
perturbations and potential astrophysical implications.

*Bo Mu,Zong-Kuan Guo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to separate non-tensor modes of stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds using space-based detectors. They found that the co-inclination configuration of LISA-Taiji is effective with high signal-to-noise ratios, suggesting a path for testing alternative gravity theories at mHz frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing alternative gravity theories is a primary goal of studying gravitational waves. To achieve this, accurate detection and analysis of their modes are essential.

Method: The researchers used networks of space-based detectors with different data reconstruction schemes to analyze co- and anti-inclination configurations of LISA-Taiji.

Result: The co-inclination configuration proved effective, achieving high signal-to-noise ratios for vector and scalar modes, enabling measurements beyond GR polarization modes at mHz.

Conclusion: This method provides a new avenue to test alternative gravity theories by measuring advanced gravitational wave modes at the mHz band using space-based detectors like LISA-Taiji.

Abstract: We propose a method for separating and detecting the non-tensor modes of
stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) using networks of space-based
gravitational-wave detectors. We consider four distinct data-reconstruction
schemes for the co-inclination and anti-inclination orbital configurations of
the LISA-Taiji network. We find that the co-inclination configuration offers
its advantages over the anti-inclination one and can achieve signal-to-noise
ratios up to 17.3 for the vector modes and 10.4 for the scalar modes with the
energy density spectrum as $\Omega_{GW}^p(f)=10^{-12}$. Our method can be used
to measure beyond-general-relativity polarization modes of SGWBs at mHz
frequency band, opening a new avenue for testing alternative gravity theories.

Conclusion: 支持通过相空间调整解决正则黑洞热力学问题的方法有效和普遍。

Abstract: The thermodynamic inconsistency observed in regular black holes is resolved
through the framework of reduced thermodynamic phase spaces. We demonstrate
that regular black holes are essentially induced from singular black holes by
adding an extra requirement, which imposes a constraint among black hole
parameters. This constraint reduces the thermodynamic phase space, rendering
the standard form of the first law of black hole thermodynamics inapplicable.
Accordingly, we propose a novel methodology to study the thermodynamic
properties of regular black holes. Thermodynamic quantities must be defined in
the full, unconstrained thermodynamic phase space of the underlying singular
black holes, only afterward is the constraint imposed to derive the consistent
and meaningful thermodynamic quantities of the regular black holes. Crucially,
this framework extends beyond regular black holes and applies universally to
any black hole with this kind of constraint.

Conclusion: 结论显示非冻结复星体导致多个光环，而冻结复星体类似于施瓦兹child 黑洞；负 cosmological 常数影响光圈结构，导致光环在特定视图角度下被遮挡。

Abstract: In this paper, we employ numerical methods to investigate the fundamental
properties of Hayward boson stars and the optical appearance of their accretion
disks in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Our results show that
variations in the negative cosmological constant significantly affect the
relationship between ADM mass and frequency, the critical magnetic monopole
charge, the size of the photon ring, and the kinematic characteristics of
particles at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Through ray-tracing
studies of the accretion disk's appearance, we find that for non-frozen boson
stars, the absence of an event horizon leads to multiple photon rings appearing
within the central shadow region. In contrast, for frozen boson stars, the
presence of a critical event horizon causes their images to resemble those of
Schwarzschild black holes, with no additional photon rings appearing within the
shadow region. Furthermore, the negative cosmological constant significantly
alters the image structure: a smaller ISCO radius leads to photon rings being
obscured at specific viewing angles, preventing their appearance within the
shadow region.

*Albert Munyeshyaka,Praveen Kumar Dhankar,Joseph Ntahompagaze*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the matter power spectrum in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity using dynamical system analysis, finding it non-scale-invariant compared to General Relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the efficiency of $f(G)$ gravity in fitting various observational data, both at the background and perturbation levels, which motivates the focus on studying the matter power spectrum through dynamical systems in the context of modified gravity.

Method: The authors employ the $1+3$ covariant formalism to define dynamical system variables for a power-law $f(G)$ model, derive the governing equations for energy density perturbations of matter and Gauss-Bonnet fluids, solve these equations, and compute the matter power spectrum. They analyze first-order perturbations and consider the impact of initial conditions.

Result: The study reveals that the matter power spectrum in $f(G)$ gravity is not scale-invariant, unlike in General Relativity.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that modifications in Gauss-Bonnet gravity alter the scale-invariance of the matter power spectrum, offering new insights into the nature of cosmic structure formation and the potential impact of modified gravity theories on cosmological observations and structure growth.

Abstract: Cosmological models based on $f(G)$ gravity are efficient in fitting
different observational datasets at both background and perturbation levels.
This motivates the current study to take into account dynamical system analysis
to investigate the matter power spectrum within the framework of modified
Gauss-Bonnet gravity. After defining the dimensionless dynamical system
variables for a power-law $f(G)$ model, We derive the full system of equations
governing the energy density perturbations for both matter and Gauss-Bonnet
fluids using the $1+3$ covariant formalism. After solving the energy density
perturbation equations, we compute the matter power spectrum. The importance of
studying first order perturbations for the defined $f(G)$ model and the
relevance of different initial conditions in computing the matter power
spectrum are also stressed. It is reported that matter power spectrum for
$f(G)$ gravity, for a particular functional form of $f(G)$ model considered is
not scale invariant as the case for General Relativity.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何通过超对称扩展重力理论，构建量子时空中出现超对称的新性质并比较了两种量子化方法的异同，并在经典极限中揭示了超对称性可能导致新奇异性。

Abstract: In this work we present a supersymmetric extension of the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime in the framework of quantum cosmology. We
achieve this by supersymmetrizing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a
Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model defined in the interior region between the
event and Cauchy horizons. We carry out this analysis following the Dirac and
the reduced phase space quantization approaches and compare them. In the
quantum regime we describe the novelties introduced by supersymmetry and
highlight the differences with the pure bosonic case. At the classical level we
analyse some limits that lead to metrics which are different than the usual
Reissner-Nordstr\"om form. We show that in some regions of the spacetime, true
singularities arise. In addition, we study the geodesics equation of a massive
particle moving in the region where supersymmetry contributions are dominant.

Result: 当Q较小时，存在发散模式，导致稳定性问题，Q较大时稳定。

Conclusion: 证明了当Q较小时，配置不稳定性会导致裸奇点的存在，与Penrose猜测一致；Q较大时稳定。

Abstract: General relativistic static spherically symmetric (SSS) asymptotically flat
configurations with scalar fields typically contain naked singularities at the
center. We consider minimally coupled scalar fields with power-law potentials
leading to the Coulomb asymptotic of the field $\phi(r)\approx Q/r$ for large
values of the radial variable r. The configurations are uniquely defined by
total mass and a Q-parameter characterizing the strength of the scalar field at
spatial infinity. The focus is on the linear stability against radial
(monopole) perturbations of the SSS configurations satisfying conditions of
asymptotic flatness. Our numerical investigations show the existence of
divergent modes of small perturbations against the static background, at least
for sufficiently small values of Q. This means instability of the
configurations, confirming the well-known Penrose conjecture about the
nonexistence of naked singularities - in this particular case. On the other
hand, we have not found divergent modes of linear radial perturbations for
sufficiently large Q.

Abstract: The growing catalog of gravitational wave (GW) detections by the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration enables increasingly stringent tests of general
relativity, particularly regarding possible parity and Lorentz violations.
While most current analyses employ single-parameter methods, varying one
deformation parameter at a time, modified gravity theories often predict
multiple, coexisting deviations. In this work, we construct four specific
multi-parameter GW waveform models incorporating parity- and Lorentz-violating
effects and perform full Bayesian parameter estimation to compare
multi-parameter and single-parameter constraints. We find that including
multiple deformation parameters yields constraints on individual parameters
that are generally comparable to those from single-parameter analyses, despite
one specific model showing a degeneracy between the deformation parameters. Our
results support the robustness of single-parameter tests for parity and Lorentz
symmetry of gravity in current and future GW observations.

### [25] [On the Infeasibility of Low-Energy Warp Drive via Metamaterial Gravitational Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09724)
*José Rodal*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The warp-drive concept based on a non-dynamical scalar field kappa(x) fails because it violates energy conservation and is ruled out by experiments. Dynamical kappa(x) leads to a conflicting scalar-tensor theory with violated equivalence principles and experimental constraints, making the concept impossible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper challenges the idea of using varying gravitational coupling for warp drives, combining theoretical and experimental physics to show why it won't work.

Method: The authors analyze the field equations under both static and dynamic kappa(x) scenarios. They use general relativity and experiments like solar system and pulsar timing to validate their findings.

Result: The concepts don't work because they either break conservation laws or are inconsistent with real-world physics as tested.

Conclusion: Warp drives using varying kappa are impossible, both theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: Recent ``low-energy'' warp-drive concepts propose replacing the constant
gravitational coupling $\kappa_0$ with a spatially varying scalar field
$\kappa(x)$ set by an engineered metamaterial's electromagnetic response. We
show that the idea fails on both theoretical and experimental grounds. A
prescribed, non-dynamical $\kappa(x)$ in the field equation $G^{\mu\nu} =
\kappa(x)T^{\mu\nu}$ clashes with the contracted Bianchi identity, $\nabla_\mu
G^{\mu\nu} \equiv 0$, forcing $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} \neq 0$ and thus violating
local energy-momentum conservation. Making $\kappa(x)$ dynamical yields a
scalar-tensor theory in which the scalar mediates a new long-range force that
breaks the strong equivalence principle; Solar-System and pulsar-timing
experiments already restrict $|\gamma - 1| \lesssim 10^{-5}$, excluding any
technologically useful coupling. Junction-condition analysis further shows that
any interface where $\kappa$ changes demands a $\delta$-function layer of
stress-energy, while even steep continuous profiles are ruled out by
torsion-balance, lunar-laser, and spacecraft Doppler measurements. Hence the
concept is untenable: a non-dynamical scheme violates conservation laws, and
its scalar-tensor completion is falsified by existing data..

Abstract: We study effects of presence of a small amount of so-called anisotropic solid
remnant in the early post-inflationary Universe dominated by radiation. This
model is inspired by solid inflation and its generalizations with matter
described through a triplet of fields. In our model, the internal full global
Euclidean symmetry of this triplet is broken, which leads to an anisotropic
expansion of the Universe. Superhorizon scalar and vector perturbations grow,
while behavior of tensor perturbations remains the same as in the standard case
with Universe filled with only radiation. We also find a very interesting case
within the limit of a very small amount of the anisotropic solid remnant and
the longest possible duration of its presence, where size of vector
perturbations decreases with a different power of scale factor as in the
standard scenario. The obtained results improve agreement between the
observational data and the theoretical predictions of solid inflation in a case
with suppressed non-linear effects.

Abstract: We present multi-fermions in the spherically symmetric Einstein--Dirac
system. Dirac fermions are self-localized within a spherically symmetric
Einstein gravity, i.e., the Schwarzschild-like space-time metric. Most of
previous studies of the Einstein--Dirac system are restricted to two neutral
fermions or to many fermions with the same high-angular momentum filling a
single shell. Our model considers full-filling of fermions in multiple shells,
similarly to the conventional nuclear shell model. We solve the model for
fermion numbers $N_\textrm{f}=2,6,12$ and $20$, which can realize a
spherically-symmetric system. Even single-shell multi-fermions exhibit a
multi-peak structure and fragmentation in the high redshift region. The
behavior observed in our multi-shell model can be explained by interactions
between the shells and resulting delocalization. We also investigate the
pressure of the solutions which defines the existence (or absence) of
inter-shell interactions. The radial pressure is attractive, supporting
compactness of the solutions. Finally, we show the correlations between the
nontrivial changes in the Shannon entropy (a logarithmic measure of information
content) and the structural deformations of the solutions.

Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in exploring universal thermodynamic characteristics of black holes, especially in low-temperature conditions, which is crucial for understanding quantum gravity.

Method: The authors employ Maxwell equal area law to analyze coexistence curves of black hole phase transitions and derive three universal exponents.

Result: The results show universal exponents with α=1, β=2, and γ=d-3, which are consistent across various black hole parameters, indicating a fundamental aspect of black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity.

Conclusion: The study concludes that low-temperature black hole phase transitions exhibit universal behavior, enhancing our understanding of quantum gravity through these exponents, which remain unchanged for varying charge and spin.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the universal thermodynamic characteristics of
black hole phase transitions in the low-temperature limit. Our results reveal
that, far below the critical point, the near zero-temperature region also
exhibits universal properties. By employing the Maxwell equal area law and
analyzing the coexistence curve of black hole phase transitions, we derive
three universal exponents: $\alpha=1$, $\beta=2$, and $\gamma=d-3$, where $d$
represents the spacetime dimension number. Furthermore, additional studies show
that these exponents remain unchanged regardless of the black hole's charge and
spin. These universal exponents provide valuable insights into enhancing our
understanding of black hole thermodynamic phase transitions in low temperature
and shed light on the fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of
density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The
PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB)
detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the
mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that
PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to
PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing
constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these
constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future
gravitational wave observatories.

Result: 差异明显的修正熵与高维Schwarzschild-Tangherlini时空中的结果相符，GUP修正熵受维度影响。

Conclusion: 研究证明GUP对EGB黑洞的修正熵取决于时空维度。

Abstract: We explore the impact of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on the
thermodynamics of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black holes. A
modified mass-temperature relation is derived under the assumption of local
equilibrium, revealing that the black hole evolves into a stable remnant with a
finite temperature, rather than completely evaporating. The corrected entropy,
obtained within this framework, deviates from the commonly expected logarithmic
form and aligns with similar findings in higher-dimensional
Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetimes. Our results support the argument that the
GUP-induced corrections to the black hole entropy are sensitive to the
dimension of spacetime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本提到了通过测试场极大值实现超旋转的研究，设计了测试场的严格约束条件。这项研究可能有助于深入理解黑洞的本征动力学行为，为量子引力研究提供理论支持。

Method: 分析了当测试场满足Null Energy Condition时， Kerr-Taub-NUT 黑洞的超旋转特性，利用了变分法。

Result: 在分析三种测试场模式（l,m=0, ±1）后发现, 只有在最低阶（第一次变分）中能够实现稳定的超旋转。

Conclusion: 整体来看，论文指出，当测试场满足严格条件时，Kerr-Taub-NUT 黑洞在第一阶近似下可以实现超旋转，而更高的阶次不会破坏这一特性。这表明超旋转性质是黑洞本征的，比当前的主要研究方向更具局限性。

Abstract: Previously, we attempted to over-spin Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes with test
fields satisfying the null energy condition. We derived that a non-generic
over-spinning could be achieved with strict restrictions on the test field
modes and the initial space-time parameters. Here, we incorporate the effect of
the second order variations by evaluating the Sorce-Wald condition for
Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes. We calculate the second variation of the area for
the sub-collection of Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes for which over-spinning is
possible due to first order perturbations. We carry out an analysis to second
order, avoiding the common order of magnitude problems where the second order
variations appear in the form of a product with the square of an additional
small parameter. We derive that the contribution of the second order variations
fix the final state of the space-time parameters driving the Kerr-Taub-NUT
black hole away from extremality. The event horizon is preserved in accord with
the cosmic censorship conjecture and the laws of black hole dynamics.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly
fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar
Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band,
making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass
IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range
of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band
observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the
Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs.
We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two
population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform
distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their
combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers.
Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for
high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH
binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely
insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more
suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$.
The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection
capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the
multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH
population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band
observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for
IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this
important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime metric and
investigate its aspects using the quasiperiodic oscillations and the accretion
disk due to the accreting matter. First, we focus on analyzing the geodesics of
particles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime, together with the conserved
quantities such as specific energy and angular momentum for massive particles
orbiting on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). We show that the
effect of the Buchdahl parameter $\tilde{k}$ increases as the radii of the ISCO
orbits decrease, resulting in shifting orbits toward the central object
compared to the Schwarzschild black hole case. We also consider astrophysical
epicyclic oscillations and derive their general expressions using implications
of circular motion of massive particles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime.
Further, we explore the astrophysical implications of observational
higher-frequency QPOs of the selected galactic microquasars of X-ray binary
systems to obtain the best-fit constraints on the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime
parameters. Finally, we consider the accretion disk around the
Buchdahl-inspired spacetime using implications of the ISCO parameters that
define the accretion disk's inner edge. We explore radiation properties of the
accretion disk and redshifted image and intensity of a lensed accretion disk
around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime.

Abstract: The diffeomorphism covariance is a fundamental property of General Relativity
which leads to the fact that the same solution of Einstein equation can be
given in completely distinct forms in different coordinates system.
Distinguishing or identifying two metrics as solutions of Einstein equation is
particularly challenging. In a recent paper arXiv:2503.14586 [hep-th], it is
proposed to apply the relations of different Weyl invariants to distinguish
solutions. In this note, we present a complementary application of the Weyl
invariants. We verify from Weyl invariants that two metrics with completely
different forms are the same solution. We also present the coordinates
transformation that connects the two metrics.

Abstract: Perturbations of the Kerr black hole are notoriously difficult to describe in
the metric formalism and are usually studied in terms of perturbations of the
Weyl scalars. In this work, we focus on the algebraically special linear
perturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr geometry and show how one can describe this
subsector of the perturbations solely using the metric formulation. To that
end, we consider the most general twisting algebraically special solution space
of vacuum General Relativity. By linearizing around the Kerr solution, we
obtain two coupled partial differential wave equations describing the dynamics
of the Kerr ASLP. We provide an algorithm to solve them analytically in the
small spin approximation up to third order, providing the first exact solution
of this kind in the metric formulation. Then, we use this framework to study
the zero modes of the Kerr geometry. We present the exact analytical form of
the shifts in mass and spin together with the required change of coordinates
needed to identify them. Finally, we also provide for the first time closed
expressions for the solution-generating perturbations generating the NUT and
acceleration charges, thus deforming the Kerr solution to the linearized
Kerr-NUT and spinning C-metric. These results provide a first concrete and rare
example of perturbations of the Kerr black hole which can be treated entirely
in the metric formulation. They can serve as a useful testbed to search for
hidden symmetries of the Kerr perturbations.

Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the apparent horizon of
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity. We use the generalized definition of entropy for gravity theories in
higher dimensions to determine the main thermodynamic variables and to compare
their behavior with the corresponding quantities in Einstein's theory,
emphasizing the role of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and the dimension
number. By imposing the validity of the laws of thermodynamics, we show that
the apparent horizon can be interpreted thermodynamically as a dark energy
fluid, independently of the coupling constant and the dimension number. Using
the response functions, we determine the adiabatic index and the number of
thermally accesible degrees of freedom of the apparent horizon and argue that
this leads to a discretization of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant.

*Tomasz Baka,Harsh Narola,Justin Janquart,Anuradha Samajdar,Tim Dietrich,Chris Van Den Broeck*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Third-gen GW detectors will have better sensitivity and more overlapping signals, but current methods aren't good enough for accurate parameter estimation. This paper proposes combining joint parameter estimation with relative binning to handle frequencies and precession, but both methods have limitations, with an improved Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method, and finally a new bias estimation method with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect more signals, especially overlapping ones, which complicates parameter estimation, leading to potential biases. This paper aims to find a reliable method to handle such scenarios for better accuracy.

Method: The paper discusses joint parameter estimation with relative binning for handling multiple signals, uses a prior-informed Fisher matrix, a time-frequency overlap method, and a new bias estimation method with reweighted posteriors.

Result: The prior-informed Fisher matrix is unreliable, the time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of cases, and the new bias estimation method has over 99% accuracy except in Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: There is no single reliable method, but combining multiple methods can improve accuracy and inform researchers when to use each approach.

Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and
Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current
detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the
number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals
overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases
in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter
estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on
overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and
higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive
than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed
Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias
to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler
methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including
the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate
the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable.
The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole
mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps,
where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify
how much the overlapping signals affect it.We show it has 99% accuracy for zero
noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional
standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.

Conclusion: 弱 cosmic censor conjecture 在这些场景下不成立，粒子捕获只能通过特定路径破坏视界。

Abstract: We investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture by analyzing the
dynamics of spinning timelike particles dropped along the rotational axis of an
extremal Kerr (anti)de Sitter black hole. This idea was first considered in a
seminal paper by Wald and later by Needham but both analyses were restricted to
asymptotically flat spacetimes. We generalize these studies, involving spinning
particles, to rotating spacetimes with non vanishing cosmological constant. We
examine whether the absorption of such particles can overspin the black hole
beyond extremality, potentially leading to the formation of a naked
singularity. In asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, we find that particles that
are captured cannot overspin the black hole. For generic initial conditions,
similar conclusions hold also with anti-de Sitter asymptotics. However, in this
case, we identify a narrow set of finely tuned trajectories, corresponding to
particles injected very close to the horizon, that lead to the disruption of
the event horizon.

Conclusion: Kerr-Sen-AdS4黑洞 Psr区的磁性撕裂能量提取能力在低自转参数下显著增强，尤其是在 Psr区，低自转参数下仍可高效能量提取。

Abstract: This paper investigates the power and efficiency of energy extraction via
magnetic reconnection in the Kerr-Sen-AdS$_{4}$ black hole, focusing primarily
on the circular orbit region and the plunging region. After introducing the
black hole event horizon, boundary of the ergosphere, and photon sphere radius,
we first study the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in circular
orbit region. We plot the allowed regions for energy extraction and present the
energy extraction power and efficiency, comparing them with the
Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. It was found that energy extraction is still
possible even at a spin parameter of 0.5, which is lower than previous results,
and the power can be higher than the BZ process in certain regions. In
addition, we find the dilatonic scalar charge $b$ and the AdS radius $l$
contribute to lowering the spin threshold required for energy extraction. We
also study the energy extraction in the plunging region by analyzing the
allowed regions for energy extraction, and the power as well as efficiency. It
was found that the energy extraction is possible even at a spin as low as 0.25.
Especially, we find that parameter $b$ promotes lowering the energy extraction
spin threshold while $l$ suppresses it, which is different from the circular
orbit case. Moreover, the power and efficiency of energy extraction in the
plunging region are higher than in the circular orbit region, indicating a
stronger energy extraction capability in the plunging region.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: Abstract discusses the emergence of roton-like excitation spectra in quantum fluids such as helium II without finite-range interactions, instead due to two counterflowing condensates modeled by nonlinear Schrödinger equations. The mechanism involves coupled nonlinear dynamics, opening new possibilities for realization in various physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind exotic quantum phenomena like roton spectra is crucial for advancing quantum fluid dynamics. This paper offers a new theoretical framework for studying such excitations in systems governed by coupled nonlinear-Schrödinger equations, potentially leading to new experimental realizations and applications.

Method: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of coupled two-component condensates modeled by the nonlinear Schrödinger equations. It introduces a mechanism where two counterflowing condensates interact via nonlinear dynamics to produce roton-like spectra. The method involves nonlinear fields and their collective excitations, relying on classical field dynamics.

Result: The result is the identification of a mechanism that allows roton spectra to emerge without finite-range interactions, demonstrating that such phenomena are attainable in coupled nonlinear-Schrödinger systems. This provides a new perspective on the onset of roton-like excitations in quantum fluids.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by suggesting that this mechanism offers a promising pathway for realizing and studying roton dynamics in a variety of coupled nonlinear-Schrödinger systems, expanding our understanding of quantum fluid behavior in complex systems.

Abstract: The dynamics of strongly interacting quantum fluids such as Helium II are
fundamentally distinct from those of dilute, contact-interacting atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates. Most dramatically, superfluids with finite-range
interactions can support excitations with a roton-like dispersion, exhibiting a
minimum at finite wavenumber. Here we introduce a mechanism through which roton
spectra can emerge in superfluids without any nonlocal interactions, instead
resulting from the collective excitations of two counterflowing, zero-range
interacting condensates. As our mechanism relies only on the nonlinear dynamics
of classical fields, this work opens the door to the realization of roton
dynamics in the broad class of physical systems governed by coupled
nonlinear-Schr\"odinger equations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems, particularly in Hubbard models, especially spin-triplet pairing near van Hove singularities.

Method: They used the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method on a two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, including next-nearest and third-nearest neighbor hopping, focusing on spin-triplet pairing near a type-II van Hove singularity.

Result: Strong spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing evidence is found near the type-II van Hove singularity, with increasing pairing susceptibility and ferromagnetic spin-spin correlations as interactions grow, supporting spin-triplet pairing.

Conclusion: The study provides numerical support for realizing spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model through unbiased DQMC calculations, particularly near a type-II van Hove singularity.

Abstract: The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has
been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In
this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a
two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing
Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes
next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains
spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove
singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering
tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our
numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing
instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex
contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly
pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate
regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin
correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to
the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to
realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model,
from an unbiased numerical perspective.

Abstract: We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a
two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into
account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of
non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent
density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field
theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum
master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at
each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the
system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared
cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic
expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport
of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott
insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method
should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly
correlated regime.

Result: The study found slow thermalization, two-step relaxation, and Floquet-driven phase transitions, providing insights into the emergence of complex quantum behaviors.

Conclusion: This work offers a framework for studying quantum spin dynamics under various perturbations, contributing to the broader understanding of far-from-equilibrium many-body phenomena.

Abstract: A central challenge in strongly interacting many-body systems is
understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we study the many-body
magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model by developing a
two-component extension of nonequilibrium bosonic dynamical mean-field theory.
Using this numerical method, we uncover rich quantum spin dynamics via
inter-species interaction quenches. A sudden ramp-up of interactions induces
slow thermalization, leading to a long-lived metastable state, whereas
quenching to weak interactions results in rapid thermal equilibrium, featuring
a two-step relaxation behavior through distinct exponential decays.
Furthermore, under periodic modulation of the inter-species interactions,
emergent Floquet dynamics drives a transition from a magnetic to an unordered
phase.

Abstract: A harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) leads to topologically
trivial compact states. Because of the long-range nonlocal dipole-dipole
interaction, a strongly dipolar BEC revealed many novel phenomena. Here we show
that in a strongly dipolar BEC one can have a hollow cylindrical
quasi-one-dimensional metastable droplet with ring topology while the system is
trapped only in the $x$-$y$ plane by a harmonic potential and a Gaussian hill
potential at the center and untrapped along the polarization $z$ axis. In this
numerical investigation we use the imaginary-time propagation of a mean-field
model where we include the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, suitably modified for
dipolar systems. Being metastable, these droplets are weakly stable and we use
real-time propagation to investigate its dynamics and establish stability.

Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed with a finite
velocity in a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied.
We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find
that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of
sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical
mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away
the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains
in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same
coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity
disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity
oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is
accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density
around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the
motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the
strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the
case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground
state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches.
We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable
slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of
motion with respect to the initial one.

Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly
relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of
anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons
within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step
toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated
interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state,
forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact
diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of
approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of
about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional
charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized
interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a
direct optical observation of anyon-trions.

Abstract: Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds
significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron
tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap
of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic
configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states,
observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding
inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron
transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one
electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis
of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the
underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to
a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the
systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy
levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also
confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory
(DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of
Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.

Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing
quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect
conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven
by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal
scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk
property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our
analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries,
from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high
quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This
scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface
dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium
quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the
superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set
by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for
selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum
circuits.

Abstract: We propose a tunneling spin Hall effect in a normal metal/$p$-wave
magnet/superconductor junction. It is found that the Andreev reflection in the
normal lead is spin-dependent and exhibits strong asymmetry with respect to the
transverse momentum, giving rise to a pure transverse spin Hall current with
zero net charge. The transverse spin conductance is analytically derived using
the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, revealing that the predicted spin
Hall effect is governed by the direction of the Fermi surface splitting in the
$p$-wave magnet. A finite transverse spin current with a large spin Hall angle
arises when the line connecting the centers of the spin-split Fermi surfaces is
perpendicular to the normal direction of the junction, which indicates a highly
efficient charge-to-spin conversion, suggesting potential applications in
spintronic devices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper investigates the strain effects and external field influence on the magnetic properties of Mn₃Sn epitaxial films on MgO substrates. Under strain and magnetic fields, the energy landscape transitions from six-fold to two-fold symmetry, with magnetic octupole moments relaxing through distinct escape processes influenced by thermal noise. Theoretical predictions using harmonic transition-state theory align with numerical simulations, suggesting the possibility of using Mn₃Sn for advanced applications in random number generation and probabilistic computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's focus on the interplay between strain, magnetic fields, and magnetic properties in Mn₃Sn epitaxial films is driven by potential applications in advanced technologies such as random number generation and probabilistic computing.

Method: The authors use strain mapping on MgO(110)[001] substrates to study Mn₃Sn(0ar1ar10)[0001] growth. They apply harmonic transition-state theory to model the energy landscape's changes and derive expressions for escape times, subjecting their model to numerical validation using coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations under finite thermal noise conditions.

Result: Under varying magnetic field orientations relative to the easy axis and at different damping levels, the inter-well escape times and octupole moment relaxation times were found to be sensitive, with analytical predictions aligning well with simulations. The relaxed energy landscape supports the application of Mn₃Sn in generating random numbers and probabilistic computing.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the combination of strain and magnetic fields in Mn₃Sn films leads to a controllable energy landscape, which is crucial for the development of spin-based electronic devices and advanced computing applications.

Abstract: $\mathrm{Mn_3Sn}(0\overline{1}\overline{1}0)[0001]$ experiences a tensile
strain when grown epitaxially on $\mathrm{MgO}(110)[001]$, and thus the energy
landscape changes from six-fold symmetry to two-fold symmetry. External
magnetic field further breaks the symmetry and the \textcolor{black}{resulting
energy landscape is sensitive to} the field orientation relative to the easy
axis. \textcolor{black}{In the presence of thermal noise,} the relaxation of
the magnetic octupole moment in \textcolor{black}{a strained Mn$_3$Sn film} is
composed of four distinct escape processes involving the two saddle points and
two equilibrium states in the energy landscape. Here, we apply harmonic
transition-state theory to derive analytical expressions for the inter-well
escape time and octupole moment relaxation time, both influenced by an external
symmetry-breaking magnetic field and finite thermal noise in the
intermediate-to-high damping regime. The analytical predictions are in strong
agreement with comprehensive numerical simulations based on coupled LLG
equations. The results presented here are crucial toward realizing Mn$_3$Sn's
applications in random number generation and probabilistic computing.

Abstract: Thermal and electrical injection and transport of magnon spins in magnetic
insulators is conventionally understood by the non-equilibrium population of
magnons. However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in
noncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation
at the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is
described by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by
population -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our
quantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors
creates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins
in canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between
magnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon
correlation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes
dephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are
enhanced by magnetic fields. Spin transfer to proximity conductors can cause
extrinsic dephasing, which suppresses spin oscillations and thereby gates spin
transport.

Abstract: Spin-orbit-torque-driven auto-oscillations in spin Hall nano-oscillators
(SHNOs) offer a transformative pathway toward energy-efficient, nanoscale
microwave devices for next-generation neuromorphic computing and high-frequency
technologies. A key requirement for achieving robust, sustained oscillations is
reducing the threshold current ($I_{\text{th}}$), strongly governed by spin
Hall efficiency ($\theta_{\text{SH}}$). However, conventional strategies to
enhance $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ face trade-offs, including high longitudinal
resistivity, interfacial effects, and symmetry-breaking torques that limit
performance. Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the bulk spin
Hall effect in PtBi alloys, achieving over a threefold increase in
$\theta_{\text{SH}}$, from 0.07 in pure Pt to 0.24 in Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$ and
0.19 in Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$, as extracted from DC-bias spin-torque
ferromagnetic resonance. The enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ originates from
bulk-dominated, extrinsic side-jump scattering across all PtBi compositions.
Correspondingly, we observe a 42\% and 32\% reduction in $I_{\text{th}}$ in 100
nm SHNOs based on Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$(4 nm)
and Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$(4 nm), respectively.
Structural characterization reveals reduced Pt crystallinity, along with
emergence of preferred crystallographic orientations upon introducing higher Bi
concentrations. Together, these results position PtBi alloys as a compelling
alternative to conventional 5$d$ transition metals, enabling enhanced
$\theta_{\text{SH}}$ and significantly lower $I_{\text{th}}$, thus opening new
avenues for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing and magnetic random access
memory.

Abstract: The quantum geometry plays a crucial role in the nonlinear transport of
quantum materials. Here, we use the Boltzmann transport formalism to study the
magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric in
two-dimensional systems with different types of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It
is shown that the nonlinear conductivity is strongly dependent on the direction
of a field and reveals significant spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the
field-direction dependent relations are distinct for different SOCs. In
addition, it is demonstrated that the contributions from the quantum metric and
Drude mechanism are distinguishable due to their opposite signs or distinct
anisotropy relations. We further derive the analytical formulas for the
anisotropic nonlinear conductivity, in exact agreement with numerical results.
Our work shines more light on the interplay between the nonlinear transport and
quantum geometry.

TL;DR: The paper explores using symmetry engineering to enable altermagnetism in 2D antiferromagnetic materials, identifying 15 host materials and characterizing the effects of adsorption on their electronic structure. First-principles calculations support the findings and provide insights for experimental design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about developing new methods to realize altermagnetism, which is an exciting and active area in condensed matter physics with potential applications in quantum computing and spintronic devices.

Method: The researchers used spin group theory to systematically analyze symmetry breaking and identified 15 specific materials that can host altermagnetic characteristics via surface adsorption. They performed first-principles calculations on examples like VPS_3 and MnPSe_3 to validate their framework.

Result: The study found that adsorption of atoms or molecules can break certain symmetries, enabling altermagnetic properties. For instance, VPS_3 with O adsorption and MnPSe_3 with NH3 adsorption showed pronounced spin splitting in their band structures. Additionally, they outlined conditions for optimal adsorption coverage and thermal stability.

Conclusion: The work provides a universal framework for creating altermagnetic materials, offering practical guidance for experiments aimed at leveraging these materials for quantum applications. This could pave the way for designing new functional materials in the future.

Abstract: Altermagnets, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent
spin splitting, have recently garnered significant attention due to their
potential applications in a variety of fields. Here, we propose a
symmetry-engineering strategy to unlock altermagnetism in two dimensional (2D)
antiferromagnetic systems via surface adsorption of atoms or molecules. By
employing spin group theory, we systematically demonstrate that selectively
breaking symmetry operations, specifically those protecting spin degeneracy in
momentum space, enables the emergence of nonrelativistic spin-split electronic
states. Meanwhile, preserving rotation or mirror symmetries connecting opposite
sublattices ensures zero net magnetization. Through a comprehensive
classification of all symmetry operations across 80 layer groups, we identify
63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups (SPGs) describing 2D materials and
further isolate 15 groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics through
surface adsorption. Exemplified with monolayer antiferromagnetic VPS_3 and
MnPSe_3, we show that oxygen adsorption on VPS_3 and NH_3 adsorption on MnPSe_3
selectively disrupt PT symmetry while retaining the [C2||m] symmetry. This
engineered symmetry reduction induces pronounced spin splitting in their band
structures without spin-orbit coupling, as confirmed by first-principles
calculations. Furthermore, adsorption energy analysis and thermal stability
phase diagrams under varying coverage regimes reveal optimal configurations for
experimental feasibility. Our work establishes a universal symmetry-engineering
framework to expand the family of altermagnetic materials, offering a versatile
pathway to tailor spin-split functionalities in two-dimensional
antiferromagnets for advanced quantum applications.

evaluate the interlayer energy offset. By extending this platform to triangular
and hexagonal artificial lattices, we explore correlation effects such as
isospin frustration. These results highlight the system's potential for
studying interaction-driven quantum phases.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new quantum Hall effect in neutral systems, using electric fields and dipole moments for quantization, without magnetic fields or Landau levels. It shows topological protection survives even at low temperatures, and the effect is controllable by spin and boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the search for quantum Hall effects in neutral systems, which is significant because magnetic fields often dominate these phenomena, and finding them without such conditions could open new avenues in condensed matter physics and quantum technology.

Method: The theoretical approach involves studying the interplay between radial electric fields, dipole moments, and boundary conditions, leading to exact quantization of e²/h.

Result: The key findings include topological protection at low temperatures, spin-controllable quantization, and persistent effect up to 25 K.

Conclusion: This work broadens the understanding of quantum Hall effects, suggesting electric field manipulation as a viable method for creating topological matter beyond magnetic paradigms.

Abstract: We predict a new class of quantum Hall phenomena in completely neutral
systems, demonstrating that the interplay between radial electric fields and
dipole moments induces exact $e^2/h$ quantization without the need for Landau
levels or external magnetic fields. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our theory
reveals that: (i) the singularity of line charges does not destroy topological
protection, (ii) spin-control of quantization emerges from boundary conditions
alone, and (iii) the effect persists up to 25 K, surpassing typical neutral
systems. These findings establish electric field engineering as a viable route
to topological matter beyond magnetic paradigms.

Conclusion: 该方法为计算率-状态摩擦问题提供了简便且高效的工具，有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and
engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction
coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects
the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can
be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening,
leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state
friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit
solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this
work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We
formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the
resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that
this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to
efficient numerical implementation.

TL;DR: The paper investigates a periodically driven Rashba nanowire near an s-wave superconductor in a dissipative environment. Using the Floquet formalism and third quantization, they find topological modes (MZMs, MPs, TZMs, TPMs) with transitions depending on dissipation levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how dissipation affects topological phases is critical for real-world applications as systems often aren't perfect.

Method: Used Floquet theory and third quantization to analyze the system's dynamics and topology despite dissipation.

Result: The system exhibits various topological modes at the edges, with major transitions in topology dependent on the dissipation strength and driving period.

Conclusion: Dissipative effects can lead to significant changes in topological phases, opening new avenues for their study and application.

Abstract: Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a
non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed
system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces
dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in
proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The
system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we
construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the
third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which
captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that
the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and
$\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes
(TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the
system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a
bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily
tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the
topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that
the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even
induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of
a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic
property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of
alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization
state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet can be
actively controlled. In contrast to ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode
polarization is essentially fixed, antiferromagnetic inertial modes can
continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as
the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent
critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly
polarized while its handedness reverses.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical
stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have
facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and
bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the
pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip
potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently
turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature
of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its
distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge
pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly
into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the
bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations.
Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the tip's position, intensity, and
duration on the dynamics.

Abstract: We derive the analogues of the Dirac and Pauli equations from a spatially
fourth-order Klein--Gordon equation with a universal length scale. Starting
from a singularly perturbed variant of Maxwell's equations, we deduce a
32-dimensional variant of the Dirac equation for spin-$1/2$ particles through
an algebraic factorization procedure. We illustrate an experimental test of the
theory from the split lines of the electron beam in a Stern--Gerlach
experiment. This hyperfine splitting leads to four distinct eigenvalues of the
spin operator, which can be grouped into two pairs centered around the classic
values of $\pm\hbar/2$. The modified electrodynamic framework features
particle-antiparticle asymmetry and an oriented, micropolar spacetime.

### [63] [Variational subspace methods and application to improving variational Monte Carlo dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08930)
*Adrien Kahn,Luca Gravina,Filippo Vicentini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Overview of the paper: they introduce a formalism for directly manipulating subspaces in variational dynamics, use determinant mapping for extending concepts like energy and distance to subspaces, and present Bridge as a computational tool to improve performance without increasing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in variational dynamics by optimizing how subspaces are used, which could lead to better or more efficient computational methods.

Method: The authors introduce two key concepts, determinant state mapping and linear combinations of variational states, and devise a method called Bridge.

Result: They demonstrate that Bridge can effectively reduce discretization errors while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The method offers a promising new approach for enhancing variational dynamics without increasing computational burden, suggesting broader applications in quantum mechanics and computational science.

Abstract: We present a formalism that allows for the direct manipulation and
optimization of subspaces, circumventing the need to optimize individual states
when using subspace methods. Using the determinant state mapping, we can
naturally extend notions such as distance and energy to subspaces, as well as
Monte Carlo estimators, recovering the excited states estimation method
proposed by Pfau et al. As a practical application, we then introduce Bridge, a
method that improves the performance of variational dynamics by extracting
linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. We find that Bridge is
both computationally inexpensive and capable of significantly mitigating the
errors that arise from discretizing the dynamics, and can thus be
systematically used as a post-processing tool for variational dynamics.

Abstract: We propose a quantum computation architecture based on geometries with
nearest-neighbor interactions, including e.g. planar structures. We show how to
efficiently split the role of qubits into data and entanglement-generation
qubits. Multipartite entangled states, e.g. 2D cluster states, are generated
among the latter, and flexibly transformed via mid-circuit measurements to
multiple, long-ranged Bell states, which are used to perform several two-qubit
gates in parallel on data qubits. We introduce planar architectures with $n$
data and $n$ auxiliary qubits that allow one to perform $O(\sqrt n)$
long-ranged two-qubit gates simultaneously, with only one round of nearest
neighbor gates and one round of mid-circuit measurements. We also show that our
approach is applicable in existing superconducting quantum computation
architectures, with only a constant overhead.

Motivation: Kitaev模型是一个精确可解系统， hosts量子自旋液态和非阿贝尔任何子，具有潜在的量子计算潜力。研究实际候选材料中的复杂次级相互作用是否会影响其表现，以及如何在量子计算中处理这些问题，显得尤为重要。

Conclusion: 该研究通过可编程的量子硬件展示了在强相关材料中研究拓扑_order动态标志的可行方法。这为量子计算提供了新的方向，并为 QU.hopf模拟真实材料中的复杂相互作用提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a
quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge
modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However,
real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary
interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand
novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report
quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion
quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that
are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for
ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure
time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian
phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number
-- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the
Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg
model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics,
while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological
protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical
signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable
quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly
correlated materials.

Conclusion: 该方法为使用局部分配实现高信噪比 implode-Z 方案提供了可行的解决方案，有助于推动量子计算机的发展。

Abstract: We present a method to suppress crosstalk from implementing controlled-Z
gates via local addressing in neutral atom quantum computers. In these systems,
a fraction of the laser light that is applied locally to implement gates
typically leaks to other atoms. We analyze the resulting crosstalk in a setup
of two gate atoms and one neighboring third atom. We then perturbatively derive
a spin-echo-inspired gate protocol that suppresses the leading order of the
amplitude error, which dominates the crosstalk. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that our gate protocol improves the fidelity by two orders of
magnitude across a broad range of experimentally relevant parameters. To
further reduce the infidelity, we develop a circuit to cancel remaining phase
errors. Our results pave the way for using local addressing for high-fidelity
quantum gates on Rydberg-based quantum computers.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum implementation of protein structure prediction using the FCC lattice model, achieving significant improvements in accuracy compared to previous methods on newer quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more accurate method for protein structure prediction by using the FCC lattice model, which outperforms other models in capturing realistic protein secondary structures as measured by RMSD.

Method: The authors use two quantum methods: PolyFit and VQEC with a Lagrangian duality principle, and deploy them on Eagle R3 and Heron R2 quantum computers.

Result: The results show that the newer quantum computers (Heron R2) provide a significant improvement in prediction and sampling, doubling or tripling the performance of the older models (Eagle R3).

Conclusion: The study concludes that the FCC lattice model combined with advanced quantum algorithms, particularly on improved quantum hardware, offers a promising approach for accurate protein structure prediction, which has implications for understanding protein function, drug discovery, and protein design.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first implementation of the face-centered cubic
(FCC) lattice model for protein structure prediction with a quantum algorithm.
Our motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the
FCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures
in proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square
deviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a
polynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
with constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods
are successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2
(ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state
configurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative
analysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant
enhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a
three-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal
solution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture,
highlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.

Conclusion: 该研究为在现有量子条件下模拟质子转移动力学提供了可行的方法。

Abstract: Proton transfer reactions are fundamental to many chemical and biological
systems, where quantum effects such as tunneling, delocalization, and
zero-point motion play key kinetic control roles. However, classical methods
capable of accurately capturing these phenomena scale prohibitively with system
size. Here, we develop and demonstrate quantum computing algorithms based on
the Nuclear-Electronic Orbital framework, treating the transferring proton
quantum mechanically. We assess the potential of current quantum devices for
simulating proton transfer kinetics with high accuracy. We first construct a
deep initial ans\"atze within a truncated orbital space by employing the frozen
natural orbital approximation. Then, to balance circuit depth against state
fidelity, we implement an adaptive form of approximate quantum compiling. Using
resulting circuits at varying compression levels transpiled for the ibm_fez
device, we compute barrier heights and delocalised proton densities along the
proton transfer pathway using a realistic hardware noise model. We find that,
although current quantum hardware introduces significant noise relative to the
demanding energy tolerances involved, our approach allows substantial circuit
simplification while maintaining energy barrier estimates within 13% of the
reference value. Despite present hardware limitations, these results offer a
practical means of approximating key circuit segments in near-term devices and
early fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a photon-number-resolving detector using a cascade of waveguide emitters, derived its precision expressions, and concluded that this proposed detector outperforms conventional designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from the need for advanced PNR detectors to surpass current limitations, offering superior precision in quantum applications.

Method: Green's function, input-output formalisms, cascading results, quantum trajectory method, comparison with beamsplitters based detector.

Result: The proposed detector demonstrated higher precision under nonlinear conditions compared to conventional designs.

Conclusion: The cascade-based detector offers a promising solution with enhanced precision, making it suitable for next-gen PNR applications with realistic system constraints.

Abstract: We investigate the operation of a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector
consisting of a cascade of waveguide-coupled lambda-type emitters, where each
waveguide-coupled emitter extracts a single photon from the input light and
sends it to a single-photon detector. Using Green's function and input-output
formalisms, we derive the scattering matrices and photon-photon correlators for
individual scatterers. By cascading these results, we obtain a closed-form
expression for the detector's precision in the linear regime and predict how
correlations generated by nonlinear photon-photon interactions influence this
precision. To evaluate the performance of this PNR detector in the nonlinear
regime, we apply the quantum trajectory method to the cascaded setup,
calculating the achievable precision and analyzing its dependence on key system
parameters, such as the number of emitters and their coupling strength to the
waveguide. We compare the performance of the proposed PNR detector with that of
a conventional PNR scheme based on spatial demultiplexing via beamsplitters.
Our results indicate that the proposed scheme can outperform conventional
detectors under realistic conditions, making it a promising candidate for
next-generation PNR detection.

Conclusion: 量子隧穿不能超越光锥范围，微观因果性限制了这一过程

Abstract: We show, in the framework of a space-time resolved relativistic quantum eld
theory approach to tunneling, that microcausality precludes superluminal
tunneling dynamics. More specically in this work dealing with Dirac and
Klein-Gordon elds, we rst prove that microcausality holds for such elds in the
presence of a background potential. We then use this result to show that an
intervention performed on a localized region of an initial wave packet
subsequently scattering on a potential barrier does not result in any eect
outside the light cone emanating from that region. We illustrate these results
with numerical computations for Dirac fermions and Klein-Gordon bosons.

Result: 增强的 squeezed vacuum 鲍克增强了非平衡相变，促进了在特定温度下时间晶体的出现。

Conclusion: 使用 engineered 环境研究时间晶体，未来的研究值得关注。

Abstract: Nonequilibrium dissipative phase transition, arising from the competition of
cooperative behavior and coherent field driving, discovered in the 1970s by
Narducci et al. and Walls et al., has been found to exhibit time-crystal
behavior when the driving field exceeds the cooperative decay rate. This was
seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that
describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay
depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir
correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the
Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the
nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed
vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of
the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength
sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian
reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the
thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real
parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing
squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir
properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies
correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also
present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results
call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based
on engineered environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者 interested in quantum sensing and its temporal limitations, seeking to establish lower bounds on measurement time for quantum states

Method: The method involves combining quantum state distinguishability and quantum speed limits. It also extends the analysis to time-dependent Hamiltonians and proposes a method to compute minimal interrogation times using quantum control techniques.

Result: The result is a lower bound on interrogation time, beyond which the system's information becomes unreliable. Additionally, it extends the framework to handle more general Hamiltonian scenarios and provides a systematic approach to determine the minimal measurement time.

Conclusion: This work partially addresses the understanding of time resolution limits in quantum sensing by establishing theoretical bounds and providing a methodology for determining minimal measurement times under various conditions. It also highlights the importance of quantum control techniques in optimizing quantum sensing applications.

Abstract: Temporal resolution is a critical figure of merit in quantum sensing. This
study combines the distinguishable condition of quantum states with quantum
speed limits to establish a lower bound on interrogation time. When the
interrogation time falls below this bound, the output state becomes
statistically indistinguishable from the input state, and the information will
inevitably be lost in noise. Without loss of generality, we extend these
conclusions to time-dependent signal Hamiltonian. In theory, leveraging certain
quantum control techniques allows us to calculate the minimum interrogation
time for arbitrary signal Hamiltonian. Finally, we illustrate the impact of
quantum speed limits on magnetic field measurements and temporal resolution.

Abstract: Quantum metrology experiments in atomic physics and quantum optics have
demonstrated measurement accuracy beyond the shot-noise limit via
multi-particle entanglement. At the same time, electron microscopy, an
essential tool for high-resolution imaging of biological systems, is severely
constrained in its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by shot noise, due to the dose
limit imposed by electron beam-induced damage. Here, we show theoretically that
spin squeezing, a form of quantum metrology based on entanglement, is a natural
fit for improving the SNR in electron microscopy. We investigate the generation
of the necessary entangled states through electron-electron Coulomb
interactions and quantum non-demolition measurements. Our results connect the
fields of quantum metrology and electron interferometry, paving the way toward
electron microscopy with SNR beyond the shot-noise limit.

Motivation: 量子叠加是量子力学的核心特征，如何量化叠加是一个重要问题。通过研究现有文献，发现旧的度量工具不足以应对更复杂的情况，尤其是投影测量和正交子空间。希望开发新的度量方法，满足更广泛的适用场景。

Method: 主要是数学理论推导，首先基于Hilbert空间的正交分解，提出了保持有序的条件。然后在单子空间的情况下，一般化了1/2-亲合度概念，构造了一个新的相干性度量。随后验证了这个度量满足保持有序的条件以及其他合理的条件，从而成为有效度量。最后将这一理论扩展到POVM的情况，这涉及到另一个有序关系的设定。

Result: 提出了一种新的相干性度量，该度量在投影测量和正交子空间情况下保持有序，同时也满足其他合理性要求。此外，在POVM情况下，通过构建适当的度量，研究了有序关系，使得度量依旧适用。

Conclusion: 研究成功在量子叠加的度量方面取得了进展，特别是针对投影测量、正交子空间和POVM等情况，提出了有效的度量工具。这些成果为量化分析量子叠加提供了更灵活的框架。

Abstract: Superposition is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. From the
Schrodinger's cat to quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jorsza algorithm,
quantum superposition plays an important role. It is one fundamental and
crucial question how to quantify superposition. Until now, the framework of
coherence has been well established as one typical instance of quantum resource
theories. And the concept of coherence has been generalized into linearly
independent basis, projective measurements and POVMs. In this work, we will
focus on coherence measures for projective measurements or orthogonal
subspaces. One new condition, order-preserving condition, is proposed for such
measures. This condition is rooted in the mathematical structure of Hilbert
spaces' orthogonal decomposition. And by generalizing the 1/2-affinity of
coherence into subspace cases, we verify that this generalized coherence
measure satisfies the order-preserving condition. And it also satisfies other
reasonable conditions to be a good coherence measure. As the partial order
relationship exists for not only projective measurements, but also POVMs, it's
natural to study the order-preserving condition in POVM cases, which will be
the last part of this work.

Abstract: We investigate defects in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising
ferromagnet on periodic $L\times L$ lattices after quantum annealing from high
to vanishing field. With exact numerical solutions for $L \le 6$, we observe
the expected critical Kibble-Zurek (KZ) time scale $\propto L^{z+1/\nu}$ (with
$z=1$ and $1/\nu \approx 1.59$) at the quantum phase transition. We also
observe KZ scaling of the ground-state fidelity at the end of the process. The
excitations evolve by coarsening dynamics of confined defects, with a time
scale $\propto L^2$, and interface fluctuations of system-spanning defects,
with life time $\propto L^3$. We build on analogies with classical simulated
annealing, where we characterize system-spanning defects in detail and find
differences in the dynamic scales of domain walls with winding numbers
$W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ (horizontal/vertical) and $W=(1,1)$ (diagonal). They decay on
time scales $\propto L^3$ (which applies also to system-spanning domains in
systems with open boundaries) and $\propto L^{3.4}$, respectively, when imposed
in the ordered phase. As a consequence of $L^{3.4}$ exceeding the classical KZ
scale $L^{z+1/\nu}=L^{3.17}$ the probability of $W=(1,1)$ domains in SA scales
with the KZ exponent even in the final $T=0$ state. In QA, also the
$W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ domains are controlled by the KZ time scale $L^{2.59}$. The
$L^3$ scale can nevertheless be detected in the excited states, using a method
that we develop that should also be applicable in QA experiments.

*Lipi Patel,Samarth Hawaldar,Aditya Panikkar,Athreya Shankar,Baladitya Suri*

TL;DR: The paper describes a single-step lithography process for designing and fabricating an Incremental Impedance Engineered Josephson Parametric Amplifier (IEJPA) with low loss, high gain, and wide bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to advance Superconducting Quantum Refrigerators (SQRs) by developing high-performance amplify devices with low loss and wide bandwidth, which could enhance the scalability and sensitivity of next-generation quantum devices.

Method: The IEJPA fabricated in a single-step lithography process includes an impedance transformer and a JPA, patterned via electron beam lithography and Al-AlOx-Al deposition techniques. The paper also introduces an extension of existing JPA theories to account for full sine nonlinearity for accurate experimental explanation.

Result: Experimental results show 18 dB gain over 400 MHz bandwidth at 5.3 GHz with -114 dBm saturation power, demonstrating the device's effectiveness. The extended theories better explain the results, confirming the success of the design approach.

Conclusion: The work paves the way for simpler and more efficient synthesis of broadband JPsAs, which can benefit next-gen quantum devices and ultra-low power applications.

Abstract: We present the experimental demonstration of an impedance-engineered
Josephson parametric amplifier (IEJPA) fabricated in a single-step lithography
process. Impedance engineering is implemented using a lumped-element series LC
circuit. We use a simpler lithography process where the entire device --
impedance transformer and JPA -- are patterned in a single electron beam
lithography step, followed by a double-angle Dolan bridge technique for
Al-AlO$_x$-Al deposition. We observe nearly quantum-limited amplification with
18 dB gain over a wide 400 MHz bandwidth centered around 5.3 GHz, and a
saturation power of -114 dBm. To accurately explain our experimental results,
we extend existing theories for impedance-engineered JPAs to incorporate the
full sine nonlinearity of both the JPA and the transformer. Our work shows a
path to simpler realization of broadband JPAs and provides a theoretical
foundation for a novel regime of JPA operation.

### [77] [Superinductor-based ultrastrong coupling in a superconducting circuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09339)
*Alba Torras-Coloma,Luca Cozzolino,Ariadna Gómez-del-Pulgar-Martínez,Elia Bertoldo,P. Forn-Díaz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method for studying ultrastrong coupling between flux qubits and resonators using superinductors, achieving a high-$g/
u$ ratio. They measured a 23 MHz Bloch-Siegert shift and an $g/
u$ of ~0.13, indicating they entered the perturbative ultrastrong coupling regime. The superinductor's large surface area provides a significant inductance, and low-temperature measurements supported their findings. The results suggest superinductors are a promising tool for exploring ultrastrong coupling in high-coherence quantum circuits with small loop areas and low persistent currents. The implications are significant for quantum circuit design and fundamental studies of quantum systems with strong coupling. More studies and experiments are needed to fully leverage this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on the study of ultrastrong coupling in quantum systems, which is important for understanding and controlling quantum states in superconducting circuits. The use of superinductors as a coupling element could offer a new avenue for achieving high $g/
u$ ratios, which is a key threshold for entering the perturbative regime of ultrastrong coupling. This could have implications for the design of quantum circuits and the implementation of quantum gates with higher fidelities. The paper's results could help in advancing the field of quantum computing by providing a method to study and manipulate strong coupling effects, which are typically challenging to achieve.

Method: The authors implemented a flux qubit coupled to a superinductor-based coupling, fabricated in granular aluminum, and connected to a resonator. They used spectroscopy measurements to determine the Bloch-Siegert shift and calculated the coupling fraction $g/
u$. They independently estimated the inductance using low-temperature resistance measurements and verified that the inductance and coupling strength satisfied the conditions for ultrastrong coupling. They employed high-coherence quantum circuits using flux qubits with small loop areas and low persistent currents, leveraging the large surface area of the superinductor to achieve a significant inductance that supports the desired coupling strength.

Result: The spectroscopy measurements revealed a Bloch-Siegert shift of 23 MHz and a $g/
u$ of approximately 0.13. These values place the system in the perturbative ultrastrong coupling regime, where $g/
u 
u$ is greater than 0.1. The independent inductance measurement via low-temperature resistance corroborated the expected coupling strength, showing consistency between the theoretical model and experimental results. The use of flux qubits with small loop areas and low persistent currents ensures high coherence, making the system suitable for studying ultrastrong coupling effects. The results demonstrate that superinductors can effectively mediate strong coupling in quantum circuits, providing a new tool for advancing the field.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that superinductors are a promising approach for studying ultrastrong coupling in high-coherence quantum circuits. By achieving a high $g/
u$ ratio and verifying the theoretical expectations, the study opens up new possibilities for the design and implementation of quantum circuits that operate in the perturbative ultrastrong coupling regime. The use of flux qubits with small loop areas and low persistent currents, combined with the large inductance provided by superinductors, allows for the exploration of ultrastrong coupling phenomena with high precision. This work lays the foundation for future studies and practical applications in quantum computing and other areas requiring strong coupling effects between quantum systems and resonators.

Abstract: We present an ultrastrong superinductor-based coupling consisting of a flux
qubit galvanically coupled to a resonator. The coupling inductor is fabricated
in granular Aluminum, a superinductor material able to provide large surface
inductances. Spectroscopy measurements on the qubit-resonator system reveal a
Bloch-Siegert shift of \SI{23}{\mega\hertz} and a coupling fraction of
$g/\omega_r \simeq 0.13$, entering the perturbative ultrastrong coupling (USC)
regime. We estimate the inductance of the coupler independently by
low-temperature resistance measurements providing $L_c =
(0.74\pm0.14)\,\mathrm{nH}$, which is compatible with $g/\omega \gtrsim 0.1$.
Our results show that superinductors are a promising tool to study USC physics
in high-coherence circuits using flux qubits with small loop areas and low
persistent currents.

Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of tripartite stabilizer states on $N$
qudits of dimension $D$, distributed across parties $A$, $B$, and $C$, under
arbitrary local unitaries. Prior work by Bravyi et al. and Looi et al. showed
that qubit and squarefree qudit stabilizer states can be transformed via local
Clifford unitaries into tensor products of GHZ states, EPR pairs, and
unentangled qudits [arXiv:quant-ph/0504208, arXiv:1107.1761]. We generalize
this to arbitrary integer $D$ by introducing local unitaries beyond the
Clifford group, enabling decomposition of prime-power qudit stabilizer states
into $p$-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits. Our algorithm
leverages subsystem phase matrices to characterize entanglement and applies to
quantum protocols requiring efficient entanglement distribution.

*Bhuvanesh Sundar,Bram Evert,Vasily Geyko,Andrew Patterson,Ilon Joseph,Yuan Shi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of quantum computers for simulating strongly-coupled plasmas, which are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. They demonstrate linear plasma wave propagation using superconducting quantum chips and a novel error mitigation technique, achieving efficiency by using a local spin model to mimic plasma waves with fewer gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage quantum computing to tackle complex simulations in plasma physics, which are currently infeasible for classical methods. By focusing on linear plasma waves, the authors aim to paving the way for future studies of more complicated, nonlinear quantum dynamics in plasmas.

Method: The method involves using superconducting quantum chips with device-native gates and a local spin model to mimic plasma wave excitations. They employ a novel error mitigation technique to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the simulation.

Result: The result is the successful simulation of plasma wave scattering from inhomogeneous plasmas, demonstrating that quantum computers can simulate strongly-coupled plasmas more efficiently than other approaches, paving the way for future quantum simulations of more complex plasma phenomena.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights that this is a significant step towards efficiently simulating strongly-coupled plasmas using quantum computers, which could revolutionize our understanding of such complex systems, especially in regimes where classical methods fall short.

Abstract: Quantum computers may one day enable the efficient simulation of
strongly-coupled plasmas that lie beyond the reach of classical computation in
regimes where quantum effects are important and the scale separation is large.
In this letter, we take the first step towards efficient simulation of quantum
plasmas by demonstrating linear plasma wave propagation on a superconducting
quantum chip. Using high-fidelity and highly expressive device-native gates,
combined with a novel error mitigation technique, we simulate the scattering of
laser pulses from inhomogeneous plasmas. Our approach is made feasible by the
identification of a suitable local spin model whose excitations mimic plasma
waves, whose circuit implementation requires a lower gate count than other
proposed approaches that would require a future fault-tolerant quantum
computer. This work opens avenues to study more complicated phenomena that
cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers, such as nonlinear
quantum dynamics when strongly-coupled plasmas are driven out of equilibrium.

*Ramaseshan R,Prateek P. Kulkarni,Sharanya Madhusudhan,Kaustav Bhowmick*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that metasurfaces can generate Bell states through a Hamiltonian-driven spin-entanglement mechanism with high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for scalable and compact quantum photonic components by exploring the use of metasurfaces.

Method: The authors used a Hamiltonian-driven spin-entanglement mechanism to study Bell state generation through metasurfaces.

Result: They achieved a concurrence of ~0.995 and maintained quantum discord for ~29 microseconds.

Conclusion: Metasurfaces offer a scalable and high-fidelity solution for quantum photonic systems.

Abstract: Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum technology, playing a key role in
quantum computing, cryptography, and information processing. Conventional
methods for generating entanglement via optical setups rely on beam splitters,
nonlinear media, or quantum dots, which often require bulky configurations and
precise phase control. In contrast, metasurfaces - ultrathin, engineered
optical interfaces - offer a compact and tunable alternative for quantum
photonics. In this work, we demonstrate that metasurfaces can serve as a
promising platform for generating Bell states through a Hamiltonian-driven
spin-entanglement mechanism. By analyzing the system's evolution under a
metasurface interaction Hamiltonian, we show that an initially separable spin
state evolves into a maximally entangled Bell state. We further study classical
and quantum correlations, evaluate the impact of environmental decoherence, and
compute quantum discord to quantify correlation robustness beyond entanglement.
Our analysis shows that metasurfaces can generate Bell states with a
concurrence of about 0.995 and maintain quantum discord for up to 29
microseconds. These results establish metasurfaces as scalable, high-fidelity
components for next-generation quantum photonic architectures.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study classical and quantum echoes in a Kerr oscillator driven by a
frequency-controlling pulsed perturbation. We consider dynamical response to
the perturbation for a single coherent state and for Schr\"odinger cat states
constructed as both balanced and imbalanced superpositions of two coherent
states. For individual coherent states, we demonstrate that a weak parametric
drive yields a long-lived sequence of classical echoes. Cat states are found to
exhibit distinct quantum echoes that are sensitive to the initial relative
phase and weights of the coherent states in superposition. We examine the
effect of dissipation on quantum echoes and quantum revivals of cat states. We
demonstrate that, even when dissipation suppresses quantum revivals, quantum
echoes can be recovered by properly tuning the timing and strength of the
perturbation. These results may be useful for characterizing and mitigating
errors of cat qubits.

Abstract: Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy
content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of
quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context.
The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the
system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a
classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of
interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into
account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and
cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces new quantum schemes in teleportation, broadcasting, operator implementation, and key distribution, with experimental validations on IBM's quantum computer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's goal is to advance quantum information processing by optimizing resources and demonstrating practical implementations of complex quantum tasks, such as teleportation and secure communication.

Method: The authors propose and evaluate quantum schemes using theoretical frameworks and then implement them, primarily using IBM's quantum computer, testing specific cases like m=1 and analyzing success probabilities.

Result: The schemes are successfully demonstrated through experiments, with QAV implemented on IBM and key distribution protocols evaluated with varying parameters.

Conclusion: These advancements in quantum resource optimization and experimental validations pave the way for practical applications in quantum computation and communication.

Abstract: A set of new schemes for quantum computation and communication have been
either designed or experimentally realized using optimal quantum resources. A
multi-output quantum teleportation scheme, where a sender (Alice) teleports an
m and m+1-qubit GHZ-like unknown state to a receiver (Bob), has been
demonstrated using two copies of the Bell state instead of a five-qubit cluster
state and implemented on IBM's quantum computer for the m=1 case. Another
scheme, known as quantum broadcasting where a known state is sent to two
spatially separated parties (Bob and Charlie) has also been realized using two
Bell states. It is shown that existing quantum broadcasting schemes can be
reduced to multiparty remote state preparation. After achieving teleportation
of unknown and known states, sending a quantum operator becomes the next step.
A scheme for remote implementation of operators (RIO), specifically a
controlled joint-RIO (CJRIO), has been proposed using a four-qubit
hyper-entangled state involving spatial and polarization degrees of freedom. In
this direction, two more variants, remote implementation of hidden and
partially unknown operators (RIHO and RIPUO) have also been proposed. Their
success probabilities are analyzed considering dissipation of an auxiliary
coherent state interacting with the environment. For secure multiparty tasks
like quantum voting or auction, secure multiparty quantum computation (SMQC)
becomes essential. A quantum anonymous voting (QAV) scheme has been
experimentally implemented on IBM's quantum computer. Finally, two quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocols, coherent one-way (COW) and differential phase
shift (DPS), are experimentally demonstrated and the key rates are analyzed as
functions of post-processing parameters and detector dead times across various
distances.

Conclusion: 耦合强度调节热隧道和修正特性，改善系统性能可能需要调整耦合参数，考虑量子相干性对传输的影响。

Abstract: A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at
different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular,
the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an
inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to
the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a
circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of
current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling.
While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the
sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique,
highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the
detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the
nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the
current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the
rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or
negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the
current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect
to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate
formulas.

Conclusion: Ensemble-IR提供了一种高效灵活的方法来管理多种相关量子电路的工作流程，为量子系统的发展提供了有力的技术支撑。

Abstract: Emerging quantum applications such as error mitigation, system
characterization, and hybrid protocols often require running large families of
related quantum circuits. Existing intermediate representations (IRs) and
frameworks such as Qiskit, QIR, MitiQ, and OpenQASM do not provide primitives
to concisely express such workloads. These tools instead rely on explicit
enumeration of the unique circuits within each workload. We introduce
Ensemble-IR, an intermediate representation designed to concisely express these
ensemble workloads. Rather than enumerating each circuit separately,
Ensemble-IR encodes an entire workload through a rich, shared unified program.
This program specifies common circuit structure along with symbolic operations
to express points of variation - such as gate types, gate placement, parameter
values, or qubit configurations. Ensemble-IR enables quantum systems to load an
entire family of circuits onto a device as a single concise file, allowing
contained circuits to instead be recreated on-the-fly at runtime. We
demonstrate Ensemble-IR across 18 real-world workloads from prior literature,
highlighting its widespread utility for scalable quantum system development.

Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for enhancing entanglement, achieving

quantum correlations within a hybrid system. This system integrates a yttrium
iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which exhibits magnon-phonon coupling via
magnetostriction, with a silica sphere featuring optomechanical
whispering-gallery modes. By tuning the Barnett effect through the magnetic
field direction, our system enables controllable asymmetric EPR steering and
nonreciprocal entanglement between both directly and indirectly coupled modes.
We demonstrate that adjusting the reflectivity of a beam splitter can boost
stationary quantum steering and entanglement, effectively countering thermal
noise. This approach allows for the generation of multipartite entanglement and
both one-way and two-way steering. The proposed system is experimentally
feasible and holds significant promise for various quantum information
applications.

Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many
other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical
simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced
symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making
their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying
quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of
observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution
operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at
the level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently
constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using
short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it
to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a
transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively
permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales
polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large
system.

Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct
Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$
even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $
\altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random
population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When
$\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real
symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the
spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$
the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these
real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the
diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are
pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta
\altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group.
These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time

The setup involves studying the transverse field Ising model across a quantum critical point, applying quench protocols with and without noise to measure changes in two-spin correlations using QFI and WYSI.

Result: The main results reveal that both QFI and WYSI decay exponentially when noise is introduced during the quench protocol. The decay time and maximum optimal ramp time for achieving maximum correlations both scale linearly with the noise variance, providing insights into optimizing quantum annealing in noisy environments.

Conclusion: The study concludes that noise has a substantial impact on quantum systems, particularly in periodically driven and annealed settings. The findings offer practical guidelines for improving the efficiency of quantum computing tasks, particularly in mitigating noise effects which are an inherent challenge in quantum mechanics experiments and simulations.

Abstract: We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising
model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin
correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and
Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the
absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase
monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits
without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When
noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change
dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp
quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the
maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum,
scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that
determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy
quantum annealing.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了量子卷积神经网络在结合能预测和虚拟筛选任务中的有效性，并展示了其在量子计算辅助药物发现中的潜在用途。

Abstract: Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a key computational strategy for
identifying potential drug candidates by estimating the binding free energies
(delta G_bind) of protein-ligand complexes. The immense size of chemical
libraries, combined with the need to account for protein and ligand
conformations as well as ligand translations and rotations, makes these tasks
computationally intensive on classical hardware. This study proposes a quantum
convolutional neural network (QCNN) framework to estimate delta G_bind
efficiently. Using the PDBbind v2020 dataset, we trained QCNN models with 9 and
12 qubits, with the core set designated as the test set. The best-performing
model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.694 on the test set. To
assess robustness, we introduced quantum noise under two configurations. While
noise increased the root mean square deviation, the Pearson correlation
coefficient remained largely stable. These results demonstrate the feasibility
and noise tolerance of QCNNs for high-throughput virtual screening and
highlight the potential of quantum computing to accelerate drug discovery.

By implementing the small-Big-small error correction protocol and post-selecting, the scheme effectively mitigates photon loss. Additionally, we propose a circuit QED platform to realize the Kerr interaction, making it experimentally feasible.

Abstract: Magic state distillation and injection is a promising strategy towards
universal fault tolerant quantum computation, especially in architectures based
on the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes where non-Clifford gates
remain challenging to implement. Here we address GKP magic state preparation by
studying a non-Gaussian unitary mediated by a Kerr interaction which realizes a
logical gate $\sqrt{H}_L$ for square GKP codes. This gate does not directly
involve an auxiliary qubit and is compatible with finite energy constraints on
the code. Fidelity can be further enhanced using the small-Big-small (SBS)
error correction protocol and post-selection, making the scheme robust against
a single photon loss event. We finally propose a circuit QED implementation to
operate the Kerr interaction.

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum algorithm using QSVT to solve linear systems of equations with high fidelity, leveraging 9 qubits and optimized parameters for practical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing efficient quantum algorithms for solving linear systems of equations to harness potential quantum speedups in simulations and computations.

Method: The algorithm uses the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) with a 21st-degree polynomial approximation, block-encoding of matrix A, and classical optimization (Adagrad) for phase angles to minimize solution cost.

Result: High-fidelity quantum solution (99.9%+) for a 1D Maxwell's equations case with a Gaussian pulse, demonstrating QSVT's potential despite hardware limitations.

Conclusion: QSVT shows promise for near-term quantum devices solving linear systems; however, practical implementation requires efficient measurement strategies and further optimization of circuit depths and qubit counts.

Abstract: This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of
equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial
x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value
Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an
21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$,
enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including
two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles
for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad
gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This
approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of
Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial
condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more
than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results
demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full
quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face
challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This
limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$
observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current
limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems
of equations, and they point to the need for the development of
measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that quantum error correction is essential for
realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent experiments have
demonstrated error correction codes operating below threshold, primarily using
local planar codes such as the surface code and color code. In parallel,
theoretical advances in quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes promise
significantly lower overheads, albeit at the cost of requiring non-local parity
checks. While these results are encouraging, implementing such codes remains
challenging for near-term experiments, creating obstacles to holistic
benchmarking of hardware architectures capable of supporting long-range
couplers. In this work, we present a simple construction recipe for small
quantum LDPC codes based on recent developments in the field. Our codes are
approximately twice as efficient as comparable surface codes, yet require only
weight-four parity checks, which simplifies experimental realization compared
to other quantum LDPC codes. We provide concrete proposals for implementations
with superconducting qubits in flip-chip architectures and with semiconductor
spin qubits using shuttling-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of using exceptional points in quantum sensing to overcome noise issues, aiming to enhance the sensitivity of magnetometers.

Method: They couple a diamond quantum sensor with a non-linear Van der Pol oscillator, creating a system that exhibits bistable and single-valued phase behavior around a BP, resulting in SNR enhancement.

Result: Achieved a 17x SNR enhancement and a record sensitivity of 170 fT/#Hz, surpassing the thermal limit and resolving a debate about EP physics in sensing.

Conclusion: The combination of nonlinear dynamics and EPs provides a practical approach for advanced quantum sensing with enhanced performance and applicability to various sensing domains.

Abstract: Phase transitions can dramatically alter system dynamics, unlocking new
behavior and improving performance. Exceptional points (EPs), where the
eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a coupled linear system coalesce,
are particularly relevant for sensing applications as they can increase sensor
response to external perturbations to a range of phenomena from optical phase
shifts to gravitational waves. However, the coalescence of eigenstates at
linear EPs amplifies noise, negating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
enhancement. Here, we overcome this limitation using nonlinearity, which
exhibits exceptional SNR around a bistable transition point (BP). We couple a
state-of-the-art diamond quantum sensor to a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator,
forming a self-oscillating hybrid system that exhibits both a single-valued and
bistable phase. The boundaries between these phases are marked by both
adiabatic and deterministic non-adiabatic transitions that enable chiral state
switching and state coalescence at the BP. Crucially, NV magnetometry performed
near the BP exhibits a 17x enhancement in SNR, achieving a record sensitivity
of 170 fT/\sqrt{Hz}. This result surpasses the sensitivity limit of an ideal,
thermally-limited electron magnetometer and resolves a long-standing debate
regarding EP-like physics in advanced quantum sensing.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated immense potential in
synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity images. However, critical questions
remain unanswered regarding how quantum principles might best enhance their
representational and computational capacity. In this paper, we investigate
hybrid quantum-classical GAN architectures supplemented by transfer learning to
systematically examine whether incorporating Variational Quantum Circuits
(VQCs) into the generator, the discriminator, or both improves performance over
a fully classical baseline. Our findings indicate that fully hybrid models,
which incorporate VQCs in both the generator and the discriminator,
consistently produce images of higher visual quality and achieve more favorable
quantitative metrics compared to their fully classical counterparts. In
particular, VQCs in the generator accelerate early feature learning, whereas
those in the discriminator, despite exhibiting slower initial convergence,
ultimately facilitate more refined synthetic outputs. Moreover, the model
sustains near-comparable performance even when the dataset size is drastically
reduced, suggesting that transfer learning and quantum enhancements mitigate
the problem of data scarcity. Overall, the results underscore that carefully
integrating quantum computing with classical adversarial training and
pretrained feature extraction can considerably enrich GAN-based image
synthesis. These insights open avenues for future work on higher-resolution
tasks, alternative quantum circuit designs, and experimentation with emerging
quantum hardware.

Abstract: Decoherence due to radiative decay remains an important consideration in
scaling superconducting quantum processors. We introduce a passive,
interference-based methodology for suppressing radiative decay using only the
intrinsic multi-mode structured environment of superconducting circuits. By
taking into account the full electromagnetic mode-mode couplings within the
device, we derive analytic conditions that enable destructive interference.
These conditions are realized by introducing controlled geometric asymmetries
-- such as localized perturbations to the transmon capacitor -- which increase
mode hybridization and activate interference between multiple decay pathways.
We validate this methodology using perturbation theory, full-wave
electromagnetic simulations, and experimental measurements of a symmetry-broken
transmon qubit with improved coherence times.

Abstract: We investigate the sequential composition of weak values in the framework of
time-symmetric quantum mechanics. Specifically, we consider a forward'' weak
measurement from a preselected state $\ket{\psi}$ to a post-selected state
$\ket{\phi}$, followed by a reverse'' weak measurement. We show that the
product of these two weak values corresponds to the normalized expectation
value of a strong, state-conditioned observable $B = A P_\psi A$, where $P_\psi
= \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the projector onto the preselected state. Analyzing
the structure of $B$, we demonstrate how it encodes interference information,
particularly when $\ket{\psi}$ is a superposition rather than an eigenstate of
$A$. This formulation extends naturally to mixed states by replacing $P_\psi$
with a generic density matrix $\rho$, linking the construction to the formalism
of generalized quantum measurements. We illustrate practical applications in
quantum information, including state-specific error witnessing in quantum
computing, and show how the phase of a weak value can be inferred via strong
measurements in the pure-state case.

Abstract: Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an essential step for
implementing quantum algorithms. For qubit-based devices, where native gates
are typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition
techniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for
decomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in
account. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing,
we develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we
introduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor
product of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into
single- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries
generated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices).
Since both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with
identity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result
also to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit
rotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the
layers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based
implementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited
to qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach
yields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based
implementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also
requiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the
routing challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited
connectivity of the devices. In particular, we generalize the Steiner-Gauss
method, originally developed to reduce CNOT counts in qubit circuit, to
optimize gate routing in qutrit-based systems.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving the finite-horizon discrete-time
Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem, which integrates optimal
control and state estimation in the presence of stochastic disturbances and
noise. Classical approaches to LQG require solving a backward Riccati recursion
and a forward Kalman filter, both requiring computationally expensive matrix
operations with overall time complexity $\mathcal{O}(T n^3)$, where $n$ is the
system dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. While efficient classical solvers
exist, especially for small to medium-sized systems, their computational
complexity grows rapidly with system dimension. To address this, we reformulate
the full LQG pipeline using quantum linear algebra primitives, including
block-encoded matrix representations and quantum singular value transformation
(QSVT) techniques for matrix inversion and multiplication. We formally analyze
the time complexity of each algorithmic component. Under standard assumptions
on matrix condition numbers and encoding precision, the total runtime of the
quantum LQG algorithm scales polylogarithmically with the system dimension $n$
and linearly with the time horizon $T$, offering an asymptotic quantum speedup
over classical methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a methodological approach to quantum entanglement generation, offering insights for future research and applications in quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its
efficient and high-fidelity generation remains a challenge due to the
complexity of quantum dynamics. This paper presents a quantum optimal control
framework to maximize bipartite entanglement within a fixed time horizon, under
bounded control inputs. By leveraging Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, we derive
a set of necessary conditions that guide the design of time-dependent control
fields to steer a two-qubit system toward maximally entangled Bell states. The
entanglement is quantified using concurrence, and the control objective is
formulated as maximizing this measure at the terminal time. Our approach is
validated through numerical simulations of Liouville-von Neumann dynamics. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of switching-based control strategies in
achieving robust entanglement, offering insights into practical implementations
of quantum control for entanglement generation in quantum networks.

Abstract: We evaluated a multi-color two-photon entangled state generated in silicon
via spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) as a potential source for bosonic
integrated circuits. Spatially entangled photon states were created using a
pair of silicon waveguides that produced signal and idler photons through SFWM,
allowing us to observe quantum interference between them. Assuming that the
frequencies of the multi-color photons were nearly identical, we characterized
the generated quantum state by performing quantum state tomography on the
bosonic system using a linear optical circuit. This study demonstrates the
feasibility of using photon-pair sources generated in silicon via SFWM in
bosonic optical circuits and highlights their potential for a wide range of
applications in silicon-based optical quantum technologies.

Abstract: Paramount for performances of quantum network applications are the structure
and quality of distributed entanglement. Here we propose a scalable and
efficient approach to reveal the topological information of unknown quantum
networks, and quantify entanglement simultaneously. The scheme exploits
entropic uncertainty, an operationally meaningful measure of correlation, by
performing only two local measurements on each qubit. Moreover, when
measurement outcomes in each node are collectively evaluated, integrating
uncertainty and mutual information enables a direct count of the number of
bipartite sources between any two nodes. This surpasses what is possible via
applying either approach solely. Moreover, quantum error mitigation techniques
including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and virtual distillation (VD),
which have been widely applied to suppress biases in single expectation value,
are further incorporated to mitigate errors in entropic quantities. We find
that PEC successfully removes deviations in correlation estimations. Meanwhile,
VD extends the depolarizing noise strength that allows for valid bipartite
entanglement certification from 8.8% to 26.4%, thus substantially enhancing
robustness against bias-inducing noise in practical situations. The proposal is
applicable to a broad variety of platforms and helps to spur future studies
toward harnessing the advantages of quantum networks.

Abstract: A microwave-optical transducer of sufficiently low noise and high signal
transfer rate would allow entanglement to be distributed between
superconducting quantum processors at a rate faster than the lifetimes of the
quantum memories being linked. Here we present measurements of a membrane-based
opto-electromechanical transducer with high signal throughput, as quantified by
an efficiency-bandwidth-duty-cycle product of 7 kHz, approaching
quantum-enabled operation in upconversion as well as downconversion, with
input-referred added noise of 3 photons. In downconversion, throughput of this
magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum
channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which
quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of
improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible
improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions
membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a
quantum network with reasonable averaging times.

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep neural network that optimizes measurement choices for quantum system characterization, consistently outperforming random measurements. It shows promising applications in state tomography, property prediction, and even suggests discovering connections between system parts without prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient measurement strategies in large quantum systems due to the intractability of traditional optimization methods.

Method: A deep neural network with a sequence model architecture that adapts and selects measurements data-driven, applied to various quantum tasks.

Result: The model outperforms random measurements in tasks like state tomography and property prediction, and suggests potential discoveries about system boundaries in topological systems.

Conclusion: The neural network provides a scalable and efficient approach to measurement optimization, indicating the potential for automated discovery in quantum science.

Abstract: Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central
problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be
used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can
be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable
as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep
neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient
measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied
to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear
properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography
tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by
our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice.
Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend
measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk
properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have
independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without
having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The ontological status of the quantum wavefunction remains one of the most
debated questions in quantum theory. While epistemic interpretations regard the
wavefunction as a reflection of our knowledge or beliefs, ontic interpretations
treat it as a real physical object. In this paper, we argue that epistemic
approaches struggle to explain the universality and precision of the
uncertainty principle, a core feature of quantum mechanics. By contrast,
treating the wave-function as ontic allows a consistent and natural derivation
of quantum uncertainty from the mathematical structure of Hilbert space. We
examine key interpretations on both sides and highlight why the epistemic view
falls short in addressing constraints that appear to be intrinsic to nature.

Result: 论文表明，DIPQRB方法可以在客户端使用低成本设备的情况下，生成 Tridenture随机数，同时确保生成数据的隐私性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了实现经济高效且安全的量子随机数生成方法，扩展了DIQRNG的潜在应用场景。

Abstract: Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) is the gold
standard for generating truly random numbers, as it can produce certifiably
random numbers from untrusted devices. However, the stringent device
requirements of traditional DIQRNG protocols have limited their practical
applications. Here, we introduce Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness
Beacon (DIPQRB), a novel approach to generate random numbers from untrusted
devices based on routed Bell tests. This method significantly relaxes the
device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness
from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a
network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate
high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more
cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also
private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic
applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate
secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.

Conclusion: 论文的结论是科学界在量子解读上尚未达成共识，但Copenhagen依然是主流。

Abstract: As we approach the centennial anniversary of modern quantum mechanics this
paper revisits the foundational debates through a new poll within the research
community. Inspired by the survey by Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger at the
specialized 2011 Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality conference, we
expanded our recruitment to include a more representative sample of the broader
community of physicists with the aim to reveal potential shifts in scientists'
views and compare our findings with those from several previous polls. While
quantum foundations still lack a consensus interpretation, our results indicate
a persistent preference for the Copenhagen interpretation. This enduring
support likely reflects both the educational emphasis on the Copenhagen
interpretation and its pragmatic appeal in avoiding complex metaphysical
questions and introducing new notions (e.g., other worlds or the pilot wave).
Our findings thus underscore the relative stability of interpretational
preferences over the past decades.

*Jan van Neerven,Marijn Waaijer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical framework to understand indistinguishability in quantum mechanics, focusing on how observables relate to distinguishable objects, called Holevo spaces. It demonstrates the framework through examples, showing how functions lift from these spaces and their applications in experiments like EPR and Bell.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper starts by highlighting the significance of quantum states and how their distinguishability is tied to observables. It then introduces Holevo spaces as the structure that captures these distinguishable objects, suggesting a way to model quantum indiscernibility more formally.

Method: Mathematical approach: the authors define and analyze Holevo spaces using equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to a set of observables. They explore the structure of these spaces and the natural lifting of observables to functions on them. The method also involves explicit constructions and examples, particularly in position and spin measurements.

Result: The key result is the successful framework development that allows for a better modeling of observables' roles and their indistinguishability. The framework is validated through concrete examples in quantum mechanics, such as EPR and Bell experiments.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the novel framework for understanding quantum indistinguishability, asserts its importance for quantum computing and information theory, and suggests future applications and research directions in this area.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for indiscernibility of
quantum states, arguing that, given a set of observables, the ``distinguishable
objects'' are the equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to the
observables. The structure of the set of distinguishable objects - called the
Holevo space - is investigated in detail, and it is shown that the observables
admit a natural lift to continuous functions on the Holevo space. The theory is
illustrated by several examples where the ``distinguishable objects'' can be
described explicitly. Among other things, the Holevo spaces and the lifted
functions are described for position measurements on a free particle and for
spin measurements in the EPR and Bell experiments.

Motivation: 作者对EPR模型的max energy上界问题和APS猜想感兴趣，希望能用实验来验证猜想是否正确。

Method: 通过使用FED算法在特定的正则图上（Henning-Ye graphs）进行数值计算，比较了MWM和MWFM的实现效果，最终评估APS猜想是否成立。

Result: 实验显示MWM没有提高上界，APS猜想未被反驳。

Conclusion: APS猜想对EPR模型的能量上界估计仍然有效。

Abstract: The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be
upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight
fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture
that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight
matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular
graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of
regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of
the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional
Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional
matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm
to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as
possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision
tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show
any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new quantum master equation that's thermodynamically consistent and applicable to quadratic systems near equilibrium. It explains that in such systems, when each site interacts with its own bath, the dynamics are governed by the Davies equation without relying on the secular approximation. They also extend the result to more complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of deriving accurate quantum master equations that respect thermodynamic principles, particularly in systems with specific coupling structures and avoiding issues like non-Markovian effects.

Method: The authors derive a thermodynamically consistent quantum master equation for quadratic systems coupled to independent, identical baths. They show that under these conditions, the quasi-local Redfield equation matches the Davies equation, which satisfies detailed balance. They also discuss extensions to other types of systems without relying on the secular approximation.

Result: The derived equation successfully captures the dynamics of these systems accurately, ensuring it meets thermodynamic conditions even near equilibrium when the secular approximation isn’t valid.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for thermodynamic consistency in quantum many-body systems, eliminating limitations of previous approximations and broadening applicability to a wider range of systems including those with complex baths.

Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent quantum master equation that
satisfies locality for quadratic systems coupled to independent and identical
baths at each site. We show that the quasi-local Redfield equation coincides
exactly with the Davies equation, which satisfies the detailed-balance
condition, due to cancellation of quantum coherence generated by each bath.
This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in
systems with vanishing energy-level spacings. We discuss generalizations of our
result to slowly driven quadratic systems and generic quantum many-body
systems. Our result paves the way to a thermodynamically consistent description
of quantum many-body systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines how quantum circuit design affects the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on causal classification tasks. It finds that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions improves generalization and training stability, but the benefits plateau after a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is crucial, with multi-axis Pauli rotations being effective while simpler maps cause underfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid quantum-classical models are gaining attention for their potential to leverage quantum computing in classical machine learning tasks. However, optimizing their architecture, especially the quantum component, is essential for maximizing their effectiveness.

Method: The study employs multiple ansatz depths and various feature mappings to evaluate their impact on a hybrid model. They use principal component analysis and silhouette scores to analyze data distributions.

Result: More repetitions in the ansatz enhance performance up to a point, after which further increases do not improve it. Multi-axis Pauli rotations as feature mappings are better than simpler ones. Visualization methods show how data evolves through the network stages.

Conclusion: Designing quantum circuits in hybrid models requires balancing ansatz depth and feature mapping complexity to achieve optimal performance.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of how quantum circuit design, specifically the
depth of the variational ansatz and the choice of quantum feature mapping,
affects the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on a causal
classification task. The architecture combines a convolutional neural network
for classical feature extraction with a parameterized quantum circuit acting as
the quantum layer. We evaluate multiple ansatz depths and nine different
feature maps. Results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions
improves generalization and training stability, though benefits tend to plateau
beyond a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is even more critical:
only encodings with multi-axis Pauli rotations enable successful learning,
while simpler maps lead to underfitting or loss of class separability.
Principal Component Analysis and silhouette scores reveal how data
distributions evolve across network stages. These findings offer practical
guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models. All source codes and
evaluation tools are publicly available.

Abstract: Quantum digital signatures ensure unforgeable message authenticity and
integrity using quantum principles, offering unconditional security against
both classical and quantum attacks. They are crucial for secure communication
in high-stakes environments, ensuring trust and long-term protection in the
quantum era. Nowadays, the majority of arbitrated quantum signature (AQS)
protocols encrypt data qubit by qubit using the quantum one-time pad (QOTP).
Despite providing robust data encryption, QOTP is not a good fit for AQS
because of its susceptibility to many types of attacks. In this work, we
present an efficient AQS protocol to encrypt quantum message ensembles using a
distinct encryption technique, the chained controlled unitary operations. In
contrast to existing protocols, our approach successfully prevents disavowal
and forgery attacks. We hope this contributes to advancing future
investigations into the development of AQS protocols.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables the study of ultrafast charge dynamics and defects in real-time through STM, marking a significant step towards advanced molecular microscopy and ultrafast science applications.

Abstract: The tunneling effect driven by waveform-controlled laser pulses is a
cornerstone of attosecond science and contributes decisively to its extreme
time resolution. In the spatial domain, electron tunneling through a
bias-driven junction between a nanotip and a surface enables atomic-scale
spatial resolution in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Recently, first
signatures of attosecond modulation of STM currents have shown that
simultaneous attosecond-nanometer resolution is feasible. However, while
sub-cycle attosecond dynamics are routinely controlled and determined with high
precision, controlling the direction of the currents and determining their
duration have remained elusive in STM. Here, we induce STM tunneling currents
using two-color laser pulses and dynamically control their direction, relying
solely on the sub-cycle waveform of the pulses. Projecting our measurement data
onto numerical and analytical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation reveals non-adiabatic tunneling as the underlying physical mechanism,
yielding current burst durations on the order of 900 as. Despite working under
ambient conditions but free from thermal artifacts, we achieve a lateral
spatial resolution of 2 nm and sub-angstr\"om topographic sensitivity.
Directional control of attosecond bursts in STM will enable triggering and
detecting ultrafast charge dynamics in molecular systems and defect states at
the spatio-temporal frontier of microscopy.

### [121] [From Linear Differential Equations to Unitaries: A Moment-Matching Dilation Framework with Near-Optimal Quantum Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10285)
*Xiantao Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a universal dilation method in quantum simulation that transforms non-unitary dynamical systems into quantum systems, applicable across various generator types with adjustable parameters, supported by numerical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of quantum simulation of realistic physical models, which often involve non-unitary dynamical systems, a gap between theoretical quantum speed-ups and practical applications as the original problem doesn't fit into standard quantum circuit models.

Method: The authors propose an algebraic method for dilation of linear flows, embedding non-unitary systems into unitary quantum evolutions in an enlarged Hilbert space. They generalize existing approaches like Schrödingerization and LCHS, incorporating various generator types with tunable parameters.

Result: Numerical results validate that the method achieves near-optimal oracle complexity and accurately simulates Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation, demonstrating the potential for efficient quantum algorithms.

Conclusion: This dilation framework overcomes limitations of previous methods, offering a versatile and scalable solution for quantum simulation of a wide range of physical systems, paves the way for achieving quantum speed-ups in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Quantum speed-ups for dynamical simulation usually demand unitary
time-evolution, whereas the large ODE/PDE systems encountered in realistic
physical models are generically non-unitary. We present a universal
moment-fulfilling dilation that embeds any linear, non-Hermitian flow $\dot x =
A x$ with $A=-iH+K$ into a strictly unitary evolution on an enlarged Hilbert
space: \[
  ( (l| \otimes I )
  \mathcal T e^{-i \int ( I_A\otimes H +i F\otimes K) dt}
  ( |r) \otimes I )
  = \mathcal T e^{\int A dt}, \] provided the triple $( F, (l|, |r) )$
satisfies the compact moment identities $(l| F^{k}|r) =1$ for all $k\ge 0$ in
the ancilla space. This algebraic criterion recovers both
\emph{Schr\"odingerization} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 230602 (2024)] and the
linear-combination-of-Hamiltonians (LCHS) scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603
(2023)], while also unveiling whole families of new dilations built from
differential, integral, pseudo-differential, and difference generators. Each
family comes with a continuous tuning parameter \emph{and} is closed under
similarity transformations that leave the moments invariant, giving rise to an
overwhelming landscape of design space that allows quantum dilations to be
co-optimized for specific applications, algorithms, and hardware.
  As concrete demonstrations, we prove that a simple finite-difference dilation
in a finite interval attains near-optimal oracle complexity. Numerical
experiments on Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation confirm the accuracy and
robustness of the approach.

Motivation: 量子材料的激发态计算一直是数值方法中的难题，如何在复杂体系中高效且准确地计算激发态能谱是研究重点。

Result: 在Heisenberg模型中，通过该方法获得了高精度的能量和物理量计算结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在 calculating multiple excited states and improving spectral accuracy方面表现出色。

Abstract: Excited states play a central role in determining the physical properties of
quantum matter, yet their accurate computation in many-body systems remains a
formidable challenge for numerical methods. While neural quantum states have
delivered outstanding results for ground-state problems, extending their
applicability to excited states has faced limitations, including instability in
dense spectra and reliance on symmetry constraints or penalty-based
formulations. In this work, we rigorously formalize the framework introduced by
Pfau et al.~\cite{pfau2024accurate} in terms of Grassmann geometry of the
Hilbert space. This allows us to generalize the Stochastic Reconfiguration
method for the simultaneous optimization of multiple variational wave
functions, and to introduce the multidimensional versions of operator variances
and overlaps. We validate our approach on the Heisenberg quantum spin model on
the square lattice, achieving highly accurate energies and physical observables
for a large number of excited states.

*Takanao Ishii,Masahito Ueda*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes conditions for open quantum systems to reach a quantum i.i.d. steady state and discusses implications for entanglement and correlations in such systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of nonequilibrium steady states in open quantum systems is crucial for both theoretical understanding and practical applications, making this work relevant to both fundamental physics and potential technologies.

Method: The authors use the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (Lindblad) equation to model the dynamics of the system and establish conditions under which a quantum i.i.d. steady state emerges by identifying specific operators that commute with these states.

Result: The paper finds a general condition for the existence of a quantum i.i.d. steady state and proves a no-go theorem showing that such states cannot have entanglement or spatial correlations in a dissipative environment.

Conclusion: The work provides a framework for identifying systems capable of reaching simple, product-like steady states and highlights inherent limitations on entanglement and correlations in dissipative quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a
nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for
exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general
equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or
dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum
i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with
arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states
is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems
that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class
of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem
that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class
of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.

### [124] [Exponential-recovery model for free-running SPADs with capacity-induced dead-time imperfections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10361)
*Jan Krause,Nino Walenta*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a new count-rate model for SPADs that accounts for non-instantaneous recovery, reducing overestimation of detection efficiency. It uses non-homogeneous Poisson processes with tau_r as a parameter. It outperforms conventional models and simplifies characterization by extracting key parameters from histograms, applicable in QKD, TCSPC, etc.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve detection efficiency models for SPADs to better handle high photon flux and reduce overestimation.

Method: Uses non-homogeneous Poisson processes with exponential recovery function, adding tau_r as a parameter. Simulations and experimental data analysis.

Result: New model accurately predicts detection statistics deep in saturation, outperforms conventional models by 100x in photon rate. Simplifies characterization using single histogram data.

Conclusion: New model is more accurate and efficient, applicable in various fields.

Abstract: Current count-rate models for single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs)
typically assume an instantaneous recovery of the quantum efficiency following
dead-time, leading to a systematic overestimation of the effective detection
efficiency for high photon flux. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
generalized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the
non-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following
dead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the
exponential-recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately
predicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming
the conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the
impinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the
model to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model
simplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum
efficiency $\eta_0$, dead-time $\tau_\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant
$\tau_\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be
achieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally
gated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key
distribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and
related areas. Furthermore, the model is readily adaptable to other types of
dead-time-limited detectors. A Python implementation is provided as
supplementary material for swift adoption.

### [125] [State-Based Classical Shadows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10362)
*Zvika Brakerski,Nir Magrafta,Tomer Solomon*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for classical shadow tomography using state-based distributions, which simplifies the process and reduces computational depth. It improves efficiency and introduces a computationally feasible approach not previously considered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been a lot of interest in classical shadow tomography due to its applications in quantum computing and cryptography. The need to improve the efficiency, particularly computational depth, of the method has driven this research.

Method: The authors propose a state-based approach where the unknown input state is entangled with an auxiliary state and measured in the Bell basis. This method leverages pseudorandom families of states for computational efficiency.

Result: The new method significantly reduces the online computational depth and achieves efficient classical shadow tomography, which was not possible before with state-based methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents a breakthrough in classical shadow tomography by proposing a simplified, computationally efficient method that opens new possibilities for practical applications in quantum computing and cryptography.

Abstract: Classical Shadow Tomography (Huang, Kueng and Preskill, Nature Physics 2020)
is a method for creating a classical snapshot of an unknown quantum state,
which can later be used to predict the value of an a-priori unknown observable
on that state. In the short time since their introduction, classical shadows
received a lot of attention from the physics, quantum information, and quantum
computing (including cryptography) communities. In particular there has been a
major effort focused on improving the efficiency, and in particular depth, of
generating the classical snapshot.
  Existing constructions rely on a distribution of unitaries as a central
building block, and research is devoted to simplifying this family as much as
possible. We diverge from this paradigm and show that suitable distributions
over \emph{states} can be used as the building block instead. Concretely, we
create the snapshot by entangling the unknown input state with an independently
prepared auxiliary state, and measuring the resulting entangled state. This
state-based approach allows us to consider a building block with arguably
weaker properties that has not been studied so far in the context of classical
shadows. Notably, our cryptographically-inspired analysis shows that for
\emph{efficiently computable} observables, it suffices to use
\emph{pseudorandom} families of states. To the best of our knowledge,
\emph{computational} classical shadow tomography was not considered in the
literature prior to our work.
  Finally, in terms of efficiency, the online part of our method (i.e.\ the
part that depends on the input) is simply performing a measurement in the Bell
basis, which can be done in constant depth using elementary gates.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a comprehensive method for optimizing laser irradiation in a confocal microscope for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center quantum sensing. They analyze various optical parameters including intensity profiles, emission stats, polarization effects, and temporal profiles, and optimize these to demonstrate single NV center excitation capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum sensing with NV centers relies on precise laser control, making optimization crucial for reliable experiments and high performance sensors.

Method: The authors characterize optical parameters like beam intensity, fluorescence, polarization, spectral characteristics, and timing. They use techniques such as M² measurement, fluorescence spectroscopy, g^(2)(τ) analysis, varying laser power, and AOM modulation. After optimization, they show single NV center excitation.

Result: They successfully optimize all optical parameters, enabling reliable single NV center studies with improved sensor performance.

Conclusion: A robust optimization protocol is established for confocal microscopy in NV-based quantum sensing, enhancing experimental reliability and potential applications.

Abstract: In this work we present a comprehensive method of characterization and
optimization of laser irradiation within a confocal microscope tailored to
quantum sensing experiments using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. While confocal
microscopy is well-suited for such experiments, precise control and
understanding of several optical parameters are essential for reliable
single-emitter studies. We investigate the laser beam intensity profile,
single-photon emission statistics, fluorescence response under varying
polarization and saturation conditions, spectral characteristics, and the
temporal profiles of readout and reinitialization pulses. The beam quality is
assessed using the beam propagation factor $M^2$, determined via the razorblade
technique. Optical fluorescence spectrum is recorded to confirm NV centre
emission. To confirm single-emitter operation, we measure second-order
autocorrelation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. Saturation behaviour is analysed by
varying laser power and recording the corresponding fluorescence, while
polarization dependence is studied using a half-wave ($\lambda/2$) plate.
Temporal laser pulse profile is examined by modulating the power of an
acousto-optic modulator. After optimizing all relevant parameters, we
demonstrate the microscope's capabilities in driving spin transitions of a
single NV centre. This work establishes a straightforward and effective
protocol for laser excitation optimization, enhancing the performance and
reliability of NV-based quantum sensors.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents an architecture for fault-tolerant quantum error correction using coherent error codes, addressing the challenge of collective noise. The framework includes transversal CNOT gates replacement and modified syndrome extraction methods, along with an efficient simulation algorithm. It identifies optimal codes like [[12,1,3]] that perform well under coherent noise.Overall, the approach makes CE codes viable for quantum processors dominated by coherent noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical issue of handling coherent noise in quantum error correction, which is more challenging than stochastic noise. The movement towards quantum processors is relying on effective error correction strategies, and this paper provides a comprehensive solution using coherent error codes (CE codes).

Method: The authors propose an architecture for FTQEC using CE codes, involve modifications to CNOT gates, introduce syndrome extraction techniques with zero-controlled NOT gates, and develop an advanced stabilizer simulation algorithm for noise modeling. These methods are designed to handle collective coherent noise, ensuring compatibility with quantum operations and fault tolerance.

Result: The paper demonstrates the successful design and evaluation of CE codes, including specific codes like [[12,1,3]] and [[14,3,3]], showing their robustness against coherent noise. An efficient simulation algorithm is developed, and the proposed framework provides a complete solution for fault-tolerant quantum error correction under realistic noise models.

Conclusion: This work establishes CE codes as a viable solution in quantum computing, particularly when dealing with collective coherent noise, offering a comprehensive FTQEC framework that significantly enhances the reliability of quantum processors under such noise conditions.

Abstract: Collective coherent noise poses challenges for fault-tolerant quantum error
correction (FTQEC), as it falls outside the usual stochastic noise models.
While constant excitation (CE) codes can naturally avoid coherent noise, a
complete fault-tolerant framework for the use of these codes under realistic
noise models has been elusive. Here, we introduce a complete fault-tolerant
architecture for CE CSS codes based on dual-rail concatenation. After showing
that transversal CNOT gates violate CE code constraints, we introduce
CE-preserving logical CNOT gates and modified Shor- and Steane-type syndrome
extraction schemes using zero-controlled NOT gates and CE-compatible ancilla.
This enables fault-tolerant syndrome-extraction circuits fully compatible with
CE constraints. We also present an extended stabilizer simulation algorithm
that efficiently tracks both stochastic and collective coherent noise. Using
our framework, we identify minimal CE codes, including the $[[12,1,3]]$ and
$[[14,3,3]]$ codes, and demonstrate that the $[[12,1,3]]$ code achieves strong
performance under coherent noise. Our results establish the first complete
FTQEC framework for CE codes, demonstrating their robustness to coherent noise.
This highlights the potential of CE codes as a possible solution for quantum
processors dominated by collective coherent noise.

Abstract: We investigate the response of a Ramsey interferometric quantum sensor based
on a frustrated, three-spin system (a Kitaev trimer) to a classical
time-dependent field (signal). The system eigenspectrum is symmetric about a
critical point, $|\vec{b}| = 0$, with four of the spectral components varying
approximately linearly with the magnetic field and four exhibiting a nonlinear
dependence. Under the adiabatic approximation and for appropriate initial
states, we show that the sensor's response to a zero-mean signal is such that
below a threshold, $|\vec{b}| < b_\mathrm{th}$, the sensor does not respond to
the signal, whereas above the threshold, the sensor acts as a detector that the
signal has occurred. This thresholded response is approximately
omnidirectional. Moreover, when deployed in an entangled multisensor
configuration, the sensor achieves sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit. Such
detectors could be useful both as standalone units for signal detection above a
noise threshold and in two- or three-dimensional arrays, analogous to a quantum
bubble chamber, for applications such as particle track detection and
long-baseline telescopy.

Abstract: We study the spin chain model capturing the one-loop spectral problem of the
simplest $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theory in four dimensions,
obtained from a marginal deformation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. In Part I of this work \cite{Bozkurt:2024tpz}, we solved
for the three-magnon eigenvector and found that it exhibits long-range
behavior, despite the Hamiltonian being of nearest-neighbor type. In this
paper, we extend the analysis to the four-magnon sector and construct explicit
eigenvectors. These solutions are compatible with both untwisted and twisted
periodic boundary conditions, and they allow for the computation of anomalous
dimensions of single-trace operators of the gauge theory. We validate our
results by direct comparison with brute-force diagonalization of the spin chain
Hamiltonian. Additionally, we uncover a novel structural relation between
eigenstates with different numbers of excitations. In particular, we show that
the four-magnon eigenstates can be written in terms of the three-magnon
solution, revealing a recursive pattern and hinting at a deeper underlying
structure. Lastly, the four-magnon solution obeys an infinite tower of
Yang-Baxter equations, as was the case for the three-magnon solution.

Abstract: The entanglement entropy of intervals in $1+1$ interface CFTs is modified in
two ways compared to a CFT without interface: there is a finite boundary
entropy contribution, and, for an interval with an endpoint at the interface,
the coefficient of the logarithmically divergent contribution -- which is
usually proportional to the central charge of the CFT -- is modified to an
effective central charge. We show that the latter modification can be
understood as a limit of the former using holographic duals of interface CFTs.
Furthermore, we show that a finite "boundary entropy" contribution also appears
in intervals that do not cross the interface and it is needed to ensure strong
subbaditivity of the entanglement entropy.

Result: A novel gauge-independent method builds GMT operators within so(3,1) algebra, revealing the sim(2) duality's role in constructing CZ generators and linking them to FFZ symmetry.

Conclusion: This advancement offers a clearer symmetry structure for GMT operators, supporting deeper insights into high-energy systems and operator algebras.

Abstract: We propose a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic translation (GMT)
operators, eliminating the gauge dependence that conventional definitions
suffer from due to specific gauge choices. We extend this framework by
incorporating so(3,1) conformal symmetry, demonstrating how GMT operators can
be naturally embedded within this algebraic structure. We then show the
fundamental role of sim(2) duality between pseudo-dilatation and pseudo-angular
momentum operators in constructing GMT operators. A key result of this approach
is the derivation of the Curtright-Zachos (CZ) generators from gauge-invariant
so(3,1) operators, providing a novel perspective on their algebraic properties
such as the relationship between FFZ internal symmetry and sim(2) duality.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的调整Faddeev-Popov因子化的方法，用于规范场的量子化，尤其是处理线性相关生成器的广义可约化规范场理论，特别是在d维AdS时空中的二阶张量反自旋 fermion模型。该方法通过嵌套因子化，确定了简化的高斯条件的δ函数、群积分测度以及鬼作用的有效贡献。它与Batalin-Vilkovisky(BV)形式相比较，符合等效性，但与BV不同的是，从一开始就会导致具有更少 ghost的作用。通过这种方法，他们成功地量子化了反自旋张量旋量理论，并得出了该理论的有用有效action，基于特殊Dirac类型的算子的行列式。最后，还讨论了该方法的局限性，以及扩展到更高阶可约化模型和更高阶的反自旋张量模型的潜在前景。

Motivation: 该论文涉及规范量子化，这是一种广为人知的挑战，尤其是在可约化生成器的情况下。因此，提出一种新方法来处理这类问题具有重要的理论意义和应用价值。

Method: 该方法是通过嵌套因子化Faddeev-Popov因子链，以解决规范理论中出现的问题，特别是线性相关生成器的情况下，传统的因子化可能导致不可对易的高斯条件和更复杂的路径积分结构。通过将因子化嵌套，他们得出了一个更一致和有效的方法。该方法先积分 ghosts，进而导出一致的δ函数和群积分测度，因此路径积分的有效性增加，较少的 ghost 而不违反等价性。

Abstract: We develop the method adjusting the Faddeev-Popov factorization procedure for
the quantization of generic reducible gauge theories with linearly dependent
generators and apply it to the first stage reducible model of second rank
antisymmetric fermion in d-dimensional AdS spacetime. The method consists in
nested factorizations of the gauge group volume for the determination of the
consistently defined delta function of reduced gauge conditions, group
integration measure and gauge-fixed contribution of ghosts. It is compared to
the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism of quantizing theories with linearly
dependent generators and shown to be equivalent to it for first stage reducible
theories. Nevertheless, the method under consideration, unlike the BV
formalism, from the very beginning leads to the functional integral with fewer
number of ghosts. Using this method we quantized the variant of fermionic
totally antisymmetric tensor-spinor theory in AdS space and derived its
effective action in terms of the functional determinants of special Dirac-type
operators. Limitations of the method are also discussed along with the
prospects of its extension to higher reducibility stages and higher rank models
of antisymmetric fermions.

Method: 作者系统地对不同维度和标量耦合的形式进行了分类，并通过理论分析确定了Yukawa型相互作用在二维以及QED型相互作用在四维情况下能够产生所需特性。

Result: 发现只有二维Yukawa型相互作用产生线性电阻率，而之前的QED型相互作用在四维下也具有相同的特性。

Conclusion: 随机的Yukawa和QED型相互作用能产生线性电阻率，其他类型的相互作用不具备这种特性。因此，这两种相互作用类型是能产生这种奇怪金属行为的唯一可能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction
between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature
resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we
systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form
$(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible
candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We
find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear
resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random
QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially
random Yukawa and QED-type interactions exhaust the class of random couplings
capable of producing linear resistivity.

Abstract: A Hermitian $\Phi^4$ matrix model with a Kontsevich-type kinetic term is
studied. It was recently discovered that the partition function of this matrix
model satisfies the Schr\"odinger equation of the $N$-body harmonic oscillator,
and that eigenstates of the Virasoro operators can be derived from this
partition function. We extend these results and obtain an explicit formula for
such eigenstates in terms of the free energy. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger
equation for the $N$-body harmonic oscillator can also be reformulated in terms
of connected correlation functions. The $U(1)^N$-symmetry allows us to derive
loop equations.

TL;DR:  paper discusses S-matrix for 10D superstring and 11D supermembrane. In 10D, 4-particle 2-loop amplitude cancels UV divergences; in 11D, 2-loop divergence exists. Methods involve loop calculations and counterterms. Results support non-renormalizability of supermembrane S-matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  want to understand how string theory and supermembranes handle UV divergences in scattering amplitudes

Method:  compute 4-particle 2-loop amplitudes; use dimensional regularization and determine if UV divergences are trivial or not

Result:  10D GS superstring's S-matrix has no trivial UV divergences, 11D supermembrane has a genuine 2-loop UV pole

Conclusion:  superstring's S-matrix is renormalizable, supermembrane's is non-renormalizable due to UV issues.

Abstract: We consider the S-matrix of transverse scalar excitations on an infinite
$D=10$ GS superstring and $D=11$ supermembrane in flat target space. We compute
the 4-particle scattering amplitude in the 2-loop approximation and demonstrate
that, like in the Nambu string case, the $D=10$ GS string S-matrix does not
contain non-trivial 2d UV divergences (UV pole not accompanied by terms with
logarithms of momenta is an artifact of dimensional regularization). This is
consistent with underlying integrability of this model which is maintaining by
adding appropriate local counterterms. In the supermembrane case there are no
1-loop divergences but we find a genuine 2-loop UV pole. This demonstrates
non-renormalizability of the world-volume S-matrix of the M2 brane theory.

Abstract: For the noncompact open $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ spin chain the eigenfunctions of
the special matrix element of monodromy matrix are constructed. The key
ingredients of the whole construction are local Yang-Baxter
$\mathcal{R}$-operators, $Q$-operator and raising operators obtained by
reduction from the $Q$-operator. The calculation of various scalar products and
the proof of orthogonality are based on the properties of $Q$-operator and
demonstrate its hidden role. The symmetry of eigenfunctions with respect to
reflection of the spin variable $s \to 1-s$ is established. The Mellin-Barnes
representation for eigenfunctions is derived and equivalence with initial
coordinate representation is proved. The transformation from one representation
to another is grounded on the application of $A$-type Gustafson integral
generalized to the complex field.

TL;DR: The paper studies acyclonestohedra and their truncations using canonical forms to encode scattering amplitudes and generalizes cosmological wavefunction coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about generalizing concepts in string theory and scattering amplitudes using polytope geometry.

Method: The authors use canonical forms of acyclonestohedra and their truncations as tools to encode physical quantities.

Result: They demonstrate that these structures factorize and their truncations relate to known cosmological wavefunctions.

Conclusion: This work extends previous results and suggests new connections between polytopes and quantum field theory.

Abstract: Acyclonestohedra are generalisations of Stasheff associahedra and graph
associahedra defined on the data of a partially ordered set or, more generally,
an acyclic realisable matroid on a building set. When the acyclonestohedron is
associated to a partially ordered set, it may be interpreted as arising from
Chan-Paton-like factors that are only (cyclically) partially ordered, rather
than (cyclically) totally ordered as for the ordinary open string. In this
paper, we argue that the canonical forms of acyclonestohedra encode
scattering-amplitude-like objects that factorise onto themselves, thereby
extending recent results for graph associahedra.
  Furthermore, just as Stasheff associahedra admit truncation into cosmohedra
that encode the flat-space wavefunction coefficients of
$\operatorname{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory, we show the acyclonestohedra also admit a
truncation into acyclonesto-cosmohedra whose canonical forms may be interpreted
as encoding a generalisation of the cosmological wavefunction coefficients. As
a byproduct, we provide evidence that acyclonesto-cosmohedra can be obtained as
sections of graph cosmohedra.

Motivation: 该论文探讨了均匀电场环境下两个空间中带电场的粒子对产生机制，结合dS和AdS空间的对称性，以及量子电动力学的方法，研究粒子对的平均数量变化，有助于理解早期宇宙中的粒子产生机制。这对量子场论和宇宙学都有重要意义。

Method: 作者使用了Bogoliubov变换和量子电动力学的方法，结合围道积分计算了在不同空间中的粒子对的平均数目。Bogoliubov变换是一种处理不同参考系下量子态变化的方式，围道积分则用于精确计算粒子数的分布。

Result: 在dS₂空间，均匀电场会增加粒子对的数量，而在AdS₂空间则减少。此外，AdS₂空间中低于Breitenlohner-Freedman界线的电场无法产生粒子对。dS₂和AdS₂之间通过解析延拓建立了量子电动力学联系。

Conclusion: 电场对dS和AdS空间中的粒子对产生机制的影响不同，dS促进产生，AdS抑制产生。研究结果涉及量子电动力学和宇宙学中的dS和AdS猜测，提供了新的见解。

Abstract: The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation for a massive charged field in a uniform
electric field has a symmetry of two-dimensional global de Sitter (dS) and
anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the in-out formalism the mean numbers of spinors
(spin-1/2 fermions) and scalars (spin-0 bosons) spontaneously produced by the
uniform electric field are exactly found from the Bogoliubov relations both in
the global and planar coordinates of (A)dS$_2$ space. We show that the uniform
electric field enhances the production of charged spinor and scalar pairs in
the planar and global dS space while the AdS space reduces the pair production
in which weak electric fields below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound
prohibits pair production. The leading Boltzmann factor in dS space can be
written as the Gibbons-Hawking radiation or Schwinger effect with e-folding
factors less than one that give the QED effect or the curvature effect. We
observe that dS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ spaces are connected by QED, such as a
reciprocal relation between the mean number of spinors and scalars provided
that the spacetime curvature is analytically continued. The leading behavior of
the mean numbers for spinors and scalars is explained as a sum of contour
integrals of the frequency in the phase-integral formulation.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores the effects of non-Gaussian couplings and bulk fermion masses in the SYK framework, finding that while certain aspects remain consistent with the Gaussian case, deviations occur in time scales related to spectral form factor and entanglement entropy saturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors extend the SYK model to include more realistic scenarios by introducing non-Gaussian couplings and bulk fermion masses, aiming to understand their impact on quantum chaos and entanglement dynamics.

Method: They use a non-Gaussian distribution for quartic matter couplings and analyze the impact on boundary couplings and gap ratios, employing methods similar to Gaussian cases but with adjusted parameters.

Result: Results show that deviations from Gaussian behavior are significant but appear at longer time scales, specifically in the ramp and saturation of the spectral form factor and entanglement entropy.

Conclusion: The SYK model's generalizations to non-Gaussian and massive cases still exhibit quantum chaos and follow a similar late-time behavior, with notable differences occurring at extended time scales, suggesting these effects are subtle but present in realistic systems.

Abstract: We elaborate further on the backreaction of Dirac matter in the SYK
framework, incorporating non-Gaussian coupling distributions and bulk fermion
mass effects. Our study analyzes quartic matter couplings generated by a
non-Gaussian distribution as an illustrative example. The introduction of
bulk-fermion mass alters the boundary coupling between the Dirac and Majorana
fermions. The averaged adjacent gap ratio is sensitive to the distribution of
random couplings, which remains independent of the Hamiltonian's symmetry. The
generalization of the SYK model to non-Gaussian distributions and the inclusion
of bulk fermion mass remain qualitatively similar to the Gaussian and massless
cases. Key deviations manifest only in the time scales for the linear ramp in
the spectral form factor and entanglement entropy saturation.

Conclusion: 这篇论文通过研究BMS代数的最高权重表示，在低维引力理论中发现了新的联系，特别是三维引力和BMS3的空穴特征完美匹配，为四维情况提供了可能的研究方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the highest weight representation (HWR) of the
three and four-dimensional Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra realized on the
codimension-two boundary of asymptotic flat spacetime (AFS). In such a
realization, the action of supertranslation shifts the conformal weight of the
highest-weight states. As a result, there is no extra quantum number relating
to the supertranslation. We construct the highest-weight BMS modules and
compute their characters. We show that the vacuum character of BMS$_3$ exactly
agrees with the 1-loop partition function of three-dimensional asymptotic flat
gravity. We expect the vacuum character of BMS$_4$ may shed light on the flat
holography in four dimensions.

Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of relativistic corrections for the study of
the stability of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-topological solitons with quartic
self-interaction in the low-energy limit. This result is explained by the
restoration of conformal symmetry in the non-relativistic limit. Particularly,
the corresponding cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation supports scale-free
non-topological solitons. An unbroken conformal symmetry provides the
additional degeneration that allows for the exact result for the energy and
angular momentum of the stationary classical solutions. We study the violation
of conformal symmetry by relativistic corrections. The emergence of
exponentially growing modes on the classical background is demonstrated using
analytical approximations and numerical calculations.

### [144] [The multiplicity distributions of the high frequency gravitons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10224)
*Massimo Giovannini*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Relic gravitons from the early universe display statistical properties that vary across different frequency ranges, with Bose-Einstein correlations being a potential tool for their study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the statistical distributions of relic gravitons, which could have implications for cosmology and particle physics. Understanding their multiplicities and statistical behavior might offer new insights into early universe physics and gravitational wave detection.

Method: The authors analyze the statistical distributions, focusing on multiplicity distributions and considering various probability models like Poisson and Bose-Einstein. They also discuss the role of second-order interference effects and the sensitivity of hypothetical instruments to detect these gravitons.

Result: The multiplicities of relic gravitons are found to follow Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma, and Pascal distributions depending on physical parameters and frequency ranges. The statistical properties, especially their suppression at higher frequencies, could be measurable with current or near-future instruments targeting specific frequency bands.

Conclusion: The study suggests that relic gravitons exhibit unique statistical characteristics useful for testing theoretical models and could be detected using当前的探测技术 with appropriate sensitivity, particularly in the MHz and GHz domains, but less so at higher kHz and GHz frequencies due to suppression.

Abstract: When the gravitons are created thanks to the variation of the space-time
curvature the multiplicity distributions quantify the probability of producing
a given number of species around the average occupation numbers of the
underlying multiparticle states. The multiplicities of the relic gravitons are
infinitely divisible and their analytical expressions encompass, in different
regions of the physical parameters, the Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma and
Pascal probability distributions. Depending upon the post-inflationary
timelines, the averaged multiplicities are controlled by the range of the
comoving frequencies and they can be much larger in the GHz region than in the
aHz domain where the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the microwave
background set strict limits on the spectral energy density of the relic
gravitons. Thanks to the absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency of the
gravitons we can acknowledge that the averaged multiplicities are exponentially
suppressed above the THz, where only few pairs of gravitons are independently
created from the vacuum. The statistical properties of the produced particles
can be finally interpreted in the light of the second-order interference
effects and this perspective is quantitatively scrutinized by analyzing the
associated quantum sensitivities. For putative instruments reaching spectral
amplitudes ${\mathcal O}(10^{-35})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the MHz or GHz bands,
the Bose-Einstein correlations could be used to probe the properties of cosmic
gravitons and their super-Poissonian statistics. Both from the theoretical and
observational viewpoint it is unjustified to require the same sensitivities
(e.g. ${\mathcal O}(10^{-21})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$) in the kHz and GHz domains.

Conclusion: 推导结果提供了vortex间相互作用势的一个微观模型，有助于理解此类物理系统的行为。

Abstract: An explicit formula for the interaction energy of $n$ vortices in the abelian
Higgs (or Ginzburg-Landau) model is derived, valid in the regime where all
vortices are close to one another. An immediate consequence of this formula is
that the interaction energy of a vortex pair with separation $d$ varies as
$d^4$, not $d^2$. The formula contains $n-1$ real coefficients which are fixed
by certain spectral data of the Jacobi operator of the cocentred $n$-vortex.
The coefficients are computed numerically for $n=2$ and $n=3$ for couplings
$0.1\leq \lambda\leq 2.5$. The resulting short range interaction potentials are
compared with the results of full field theory simulations for $\lambda=0.5$
and $\lambda=2$, with excellent agreement at small to moderate vortex
separation.

TL;DR: The paper extends the Gibbons-Hawking-York approach to compute entropy and find agreement with the Bekenstein bound, using a Euclidean framework to suggest gravity emerges from entropy gradient and Onsager reciprocity clarifies the entropic force conjecture, ending with Hawking temperature gradient's role in information encoding and gravity as an ordering agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding entropy in black hole physics and its implications for gravity and thermodynamics.

Method: Used extended GHY approach for Euclidean path integral, computed action shifts, found agreement with Casini's Bekenstein bound, employed Onsager reciprocity, linear-response relation to link entropy and forces.

Result: Got an entropy deficit matching area perturbations, confirmed HO agent role, confirmed Bekenstein bound via GHY method, clarified entropic force conjecture with Onsager and linear response, found necessity of external dissipative forces, linked temp gradient to information encoding via entropic force.

Conclusion: Various extensions to GHY model aligning with thermodynamic principles, clarification of gravity-entropy relations, validation of Onsager approach, and information encoding via entropic force mode.

Abstract: The Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) approach is traditionally developed for a
Euclidean path integral derivation of black hole entropy. In this work, we
extend this approach to a static model of thin shell fixed outside a black
hole. We compute the Euclidean action shift from a static thin shell outside
the black hole, and find exact agreement with Casini's version of Bekenstein
bound. We find a negative entropy deficit corresponding precisely to the
apparent horizon area perturbation, which provides a holographic interpretation
in terms of extremal surfaces.
  Therefore, we develop a Euclidean framework in which gravity emerges from a
negative entropy gradient. This setup allows us to treat the configuration as a
near-equilibrium steady state (NESS). Thus, we introduce Onsager reciprocity
and a linear-response relation to clarify the entropic force conjecture. A
dissipating external force is necessary in this setup and it generates a
Hawking temperature gradient which encoding information responsible for entropy
gradient. This confirms that the gravitational potential plays the role of an
informational and ordering agent, rather than just driven by chaotic and
disordering.

Abstract: We perform a holographic analysis of several quantum information theoretic
observables entanglement entropy (EE), mutual information (MI), entanglement
wedge cross section (EWCS), butterfly velocity ($v_B$) and thermo mutual
information (TMI) in the background of charged AdS black hole deformed by a
homogeneous string cloud. This configuration is dual to a large $\mathcal{N}_c$
strongly coupled field theory at finite temperature and finite chemical
potential, in presence of quark cloud. We study how the entanglement structure
and chaotic dynamics in the boundary theory are affected by the charge and
backreaction. We find that both EE and EWCS increase monotonically with charge
and backreaction, indicating enhanced correlations due to additional bulk
degrees of freedom. On the other hand MI and TMI show a more intricate
dependence backreaction tends to strengthen correlations, while increasing
charge suppresses entanglement and makes the system more susceptible to
scrambling. The analysis of the butterfly velocity indicates that both the
presence of charge and the backreaction suppress the chaotic behavior of the
system by reducing $v_B$. Furthermore, TMI exhibits a sharp transition under
shockwave perturbations, with inter-boundary entanglement being entirely
disrupted beyond a critical shock strength, which decreases with increasing
charge.

Conclusion: 推导了多区间纠缠熵的表达式，与先前结果一致，为BMS对称下纠缠熵研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the modular Hamiltonian and the entanglement entropy of the
BMS-invariant free fermion model. Starting from the modular Hamiltonian on a
half-line interval, we calculate the modular Hamiltonian for a region
consisting of two disjoint intervals using the uniformization map and a
background field method. The resulting modular Hamiltonian contains a local
term which generates a geometrical flow, and a bi-local term which mixes
operators between the two intervals. We further derive a relation between
Wightman functions and the modular Hamiltonian using both diagonalization and a
coherent state method. This enables us to compute the entanglement entropy for
multi-disjoint intervals. Our explicit results in the BMS free fermion model
are compatible with earlier ones based on symmetry and holography.

Motivation: 这项研究关注于4维Gauss-Bonnet引力理论中的Lorentzian路径积分，试图在不同的边界条件下计算路径积分，并分析鞍点贡献和路径变形带来的影响，特别是在解决鞍点之间的退化问题时的创新方法。

Method: 使用了极简度量，通过对路径积分进行鞍点分析，并结合复鞍点理论和WKB近似方法，利用Lefschetz理论来处理鞍点贡献和路径变形的问题。

Result: 研究得出，在Robin边界条件下，路径积分的主要贡献来自无边界几何学，并且通过复鞍点路径的变形，能够解决两类鞍点退化问题。然而，由于鞍点之间的流线重叠和合并，类型2退化仍然存在挑战，而通过引入缺陷或路径变形的方法未能完全解决类型1退化，而部分类型2退化被克服。

Conclusion: 这项研究为研究4维Gauss-Bonnet引力理论中的路径积分提供了一个系统的方法，并在鞍点退化问题上取得了一定的进展，但仍有挑战需要解决。

Abstract: Lorentzian gravitational path integral for the Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $4D$
is studied in the mini-superspace ansatz for metric. The gauge-fixed
path-integral for Robin boundary choice is computed exactly using {\it
Airy}-functions, where the dominant contribution comes from No-boundary
geometries. The lapse integral is further analysed using saddle-point methods
to compare with exact results. Picard-Lefschetz methods are utilized to find
the {\it relevant} complex saddles and deformed contour of integration thereby
using WKB methods to compute the integral along the deformed contour in the
saddle-point approximation. However, their successful application is possible
only when system is devoid of degeneracies, which in present case appear in two
types: {\bf type-1} where the flow-lines starting from neighbouring saddles
overlap leading to ambiguities in deciding the {\it relevance} of saddles, {\bf
type-2} where saddles merge for specific choices of boundary parameters leading
to failure of WKB. Overcoming degeneracies using artificial {\it defects}
introduces ambiguities due to choice of {\it defects} involved. Corrections
from quantum fluctuations of scale-factor overcome degeneracies only partially
(lifts {\bf type-2} completely with partial resolution of {\bf type-1}), with
the residual lifted fluently by complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$. {\it
Anti-linear} symmetry present in various forms in the lapse action is the
reason behind all the {\bf type-1} degeneracies. Any form of {\it defect} or
{\it deformation} breaking anti-linearity resolves {\bf type-1} degeneracies,
indicating complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$ as an ideal choice. Compatibility
with the KSW criterion is analyzed after symmetry breaking. Complex deformation
of $(G\hbar)$ modifies the KSW criterion, imposing a strong constraint on the
deformation if No-boundary geometries are required to be always KSW-allowed.

Conclusion: 标量场表现出不同于早期预测的热效应，对 cosmological 常数的修正有新洞见。

Abstract: We argue that a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime should feel explicit
thermal effects associated with its curvature. Starting from the Bunch-Davies
vacuum and a scalar field with small mass compared to the de Sitter curvature,
we use the thermo-field dynamics formalism in order to expose these thermal
effects. We compute the thermal Wightman function connecting two spacetime
points and from it, via the point-splitting regularization technique, the
renormalized thermal energy-momentum tensor. We then check how these
corrections affect the de Sitter geometry by solving for the semi-classical
backreaction and in order to put our result in a context, we compare it to the
corresponding 2-loop quantum gravity correction to the cosmological constant
derived in [1].

Abstract: Decay rates in quantum field theory (QFT) are typically calculated assuming
the particles are represented by momentum eigenstates (i.e. plane waves).
However, strictly speaking, localized free particles should be represented by
wave packets. This yields width corrections to the decay rate and to the clock
behaviour under Lorentz boosts. We calculate the decay rate of a particle of
mass $M$ modeled as a Gaussian wavepacket of width $a$ and centered at zero
momentum. We find the decay rate to be $\Gamma_0 \big[1- \frac{3 a^2}{4 M^2}
+\mathcal{O}\big(\tfrac{a^4}{M^4}\big)\big]$ where $\Gamma_0$ is the decay rate
of the particle at rest treated as a plane wave. The leading correction is then
of order $\tfrac{a^2}{M^2}$. We then perform a Lorentz boost of velocity $v$ on
the above Gaussian and find that its decay rate does not decrease
\textit{exactly} by the Lorentz factor $\sqrt{1-v^2}$. There is a correction of
order $\tfrac{a^2v^2}{M^2}$. Therefore, the decaying wave packet does not act
exactly like a typical clock under Lorentz boosts and we refer to it is a "WP
clock" (wave packet clock). A WP clock does not move with a single velocity
relative to an observer but has a spread in velocities (more specifically, a
spread in momenta). Nonetheless, it is best viewed as a single clock as the
wave packet represents a one-particle state in QFT. WP clocks do not violate
Lorentz symmetry and are not based on new physics: they are a consequence of
the combined requirements of special relativity, quantum mechanics and
\textit{localized} free particles.

Conclusion: 该研究为处理强耦合问题提供了一种新的可行的级数方法，特别是在数值计算中表现出色，具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: It is known that perturbative expansions in powers of the coupling in quantum
mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) are asymptotic series. This can
be useful at weak coupling but fails at strong coupling. In this work, we
present two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling. We apply the
series to a basic integral as well as a QM path integral containing a quadratic
and quartic term with coupling constant $\lambda$. The first series is the
usual asymptotic one, where the quartic interaction is expanded in powers of
$\lambda$. The second series is an expansion of the quadratic part where the
interaction is left alone. This yields an absolutely convergent series in
inverse powers of $\lambda$ valid at strong coupling. For the basic integral,
we revisit the first series and identify what makes it diverge even though the
original integral is finite. We fix the problem and obtain, remarkably, a
series in powers of the coupling which is absolutely convergent and valid at
strong coupling. We explain how this series avoids Dyson's argument on
convergence. We then consider the QM path integral (discretized with time
interval divided into $N$ equal segments). As before, the second series is
absolutely convergent and we obtain analytical expressions in inverse powers of
$\lambda$ for the $n$th order terms by taking functional derivatives of
generalized hypergeometric functions. The expressions are functions of $N$ and
we work them out explicitly up to third order. The general procedure has been
implemented in a Mathematica program that generates the expressions at any
order $n$. We present numerical results at strong coupling for different values
of $N$ starting at $N=2$. The series matches the exact numerical value for a
given $N$ (up to a certain accuracy). The continuum is formally reached when
$N\to \infty$ but in practice this can be reached at small $N$.

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenge of constructing integrable evolution PDEs in 3+1 dimensions, highlighting Fokas' 2006 work in 4+2 dimensions and the 2022 reduction to 3+1 with the nonlinear Fourier transform. The authors present a novel (3+1)-dimensional modified KP equation involving complex time and Laplace's equation, perform spectral analysis, and develop a ∂-problem solution using Cauchy-Green formula and ∂-formalism for the initial value problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a significant issue in the field of integrable systems, which is the construction of (3+1)-dimensional integrable nonlinear PDEs, a problem that has remained unresolved despite advancements in higher-dimensional integrability. The authors build on their previous work on integrable systems, specifically focusing on extending the Fokas approach and introducing novel methods to handle the reduction and solving techniques in a higher spatial dimension.

Method: The method involves the spectral analysis of the eigenvalue equation, demonstrating the solution of the ∂-problem using the Cauchy-Green formula, and establishing a ∂-formalism for solving the initial value problem of the proposed (3+1)-dimensional mKP equation.

Result: A new (3+1)-dimensional modified KP equation is introduced, which incorporates complex time and maintains Laplace's equation. The authors successfully perform spectral analysis, solve the ∂-problem, and present a ∂-formalism for solving the initial value problem, offering a pathway to tackle higher-dimensional integrable PDEs.

Conclusion: The paper presents a viable solution to a long-standing challenge in integrable systems by extending the Fokas approach, introducing complex time, and developing a novel ∂-method, thereby advancing the understanding and construction of (3+1)-dimensional integrable nonlinear PDEs.

Abstract: Constructing integrable evolution nonlinear PDEs in three spatial dimensions
is one of the most important open problems in the area of integrability. Fokas
achieved progress in 2006 by constructing integrable nonlinear equations in 4+2
dimensions, but the reduction to 3+1 dimensions remained open until 2022 when
he introduced a suitable nonlinear Fourier transform to achieve this reduction
for the Kadomtsev-Petiashvili (KP) equation. Here, the integrable
generalization of the modified KP (mKP) equation has been presented which has
the novelty that it involves complex time and preserves Laplace's equation. The
(3+1)-dimensional mKP equation is obtained by imposing the requirement of real
time. Then, the spectral analysis of the eigenvalue equation is given and the
solution of the $\bar{\partial}$-problem is demonstrated based on Cauchy-Green
formula. Finally, a novel $\bar{\partial}$-formalism for the initial value
problem of the (3+1)-dimensional mKP equation is worked out.

TL;DR: This paper describes the first event-by-event observation of Cherenkov light from sub-MeV electrons in a high-yield liquid argon detector using a wavelength-shifting technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of low-energy particles is crucial in various areas of physics, including dark matter and neutrino research. Sub-MeV electrons are particularly challenging to detect due to their low energy, making them difficult to observe without specialized techniques.

Method: The experiment uses a detector composed of liquid argon (LAr) and 200 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), with 80% coated in a wavelength-shifting material to detect visible Cherenkov photons from uncoated PMTs. Gamma-rays from a 22Na source are used to produce and isolate prompt Cherenkov light, allowing for low-background electromagnetic sample selection.

Result: The CCM200 detector successfully observed these Cherenkov photons, marking the first event-by-event detection in high-yield LAr detectors and highlighting advancements in low-energy particle detection technology.

Conclusion: This achievement opens new possibilities for detecting sub-MeV electrons in future experiments, enhancing capabilities in dark matter and neutrino physics research.

Abstract: This Letter reports the event-by-event observation of Cherenkov light from
sub-MeV electrons in a high scintillation light-yield liquid argon (LAr)
detector by the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment. The CCM200 detector,
located at Los Alamos National Laboratory, instruments 7 tons (fiducial volume)
of LAr with 200 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 80% of which are coated in
a wavelength shifting material and the remaining 20% are uncoated. In the
prompt time region of an event, defined as $-6 \leq t \leq 0$ ns relative to
the event start time $t=0$, the uncoated PMTs are primarily sensitive to
visible Cherenkov photons. Using gamma-rays from a $^{22}$Na source for
production of sub-MeV electrons, we isolated prompt Cherenkov light with
$>5\sigma$ confidence and developed a selection to obtain a low-background
electromagnetic sample. This is the first event-by-event observation of
Cherenkov photons from sub-MeV electrons in a high-yield scintillator detector,
and represents a milestone in low-energy particle detector development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of MeV-scale neutrinos and Beyond Standard Model physics requires a highly reliable and efficient detector, which the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment aims to achieve through liquid argon technology.

Method: The experiment uses a high-efficiency light collection detector with 8-inch PMTs and focuses on optimizing a Monte-Carlo simulation to model light propagation in liquid argon, capturing effects like anomalous dispersion, Mie scattering, and Cherenkov emission. The study includes detailed PMT response and photonic transport simulations.

Result: The detector demonstrates accurate modeling of photon timing and spatial distribution, incorporating various physical effects, improving the reliability of detecting MeV-scale particles.

Conclusion: The optimized method enhances the sensitivity to MeV-scale neutrino and beyond the Standard Model physics signatures by accurately predicting light behavior in liquid argon detectors.

Abstract: The Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment is a liquid argon (LAr) light
collection detector searching for MeV-scale neutrino and Beyond Standard Model
physics signatures. Two hundred 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) instrument
the 7 ton fiducial volume with 50% photocathode coverage to detect light
produced by charged particles. CCM's light-based approach reduces requirements
of LAr purity, compared to other detection technologies, such that sub-MeV
particles can be reliably detected without additional LAr filtration and with
O(1) parts-per-million of common contaminants. We present a measurement of LAr
light production and propagation parameters, with uncertainties, obtained from
a sample of MeV-scale electromagnetic events. The optimization of this
high-dimensional parameter space was facilitated by a differentiable optical
photon Monte-Carlo simulation, and detailed PMT response characterization. This
result accurately predicts the timing and spatial distribution of light due to
scintillation and Cherenkov emission in the detector. This is the first
description of photon propagation in LAr to include several effects, including:
anomalous dispersion of the index of refraction near the ultraviolet resonance,
Mie scattering from impurities, and Cherenkov light production.

### [158] [Muon Signal Charge in the Underground Muon Detector of AugerPrime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09006)
*Marina Scornavacche*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: By examining the Pierre Auger Observatory's underground muon detector, this paper reveals a bias in estimating muon flux through trigger systems, leading to inaccurate low-energy muon counts. A new calibration method is proposed to address this issue, showing improved performance over the old strategy with real-world data from 2019 to 2024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Why is muon detection important for high-energy astrophysics? It helps us understand the composition of cosmic rays and their sources, like gamma-ray bursts or hadronic processes. Accurate measurements of muons, especially at the ankle region (~1 GeV), are crucial for distinguishing between different astrophysical sources and validating theoretical models.

Method: The researchers revisited the previous calibration strategy, identified a bias from trigger-based charge measurements, and developed a new method that accounts for knock-on electrons in the ground substrate. They validated this through simulations and applied it to six years of data.

Result: The new calibration strategy showed a reduction in systematic errors by 18% in muon count estimations. Simulations indicated this method is reliable within ±5% uncertainty. When applied to real data, the lower energies of muons were overestimated by 25% using the old method compared to the new, proving the necessity of the new approach.

Conclusion: Muon detection systems like the Pierre Auger Observatory must account for the energy loss of muons when passing through the Earth's surface. Implementing an unbiased calibration strategy significantly improves the accuracy of muon flux measurements, enhancing the reliability of high-energy astrophysics research based on these data.

Abstract: The Underground Muon Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory features a
calorimetric detection mode that estimates the number of muons based on signal
charge measurements. This contribution provides an overview of the calibration
procedure, revisiting the previously published strategy and identifying a bias
introduced by the triggers used to estimate the mean charge deposited by a
vertical muon. We demonstrate that calibrating underground detectors requires
careful consideration of the interactions of penetrating particles through
matter. In devices based on plastic scintillators, energy deposition, and thus
the recorded charge, is significantly affected by knock-on electron production
in the surrounding ground as muons traverse the medium. To mitigate this
effect, we propose a new calibration strategy that ensures an unbiased muon
estimator. This approach is applied to data collected from 2019 to 2024.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network, CPU-Net, which uses CycleGAN to improve pulse shape modeling in HPGe detectors, enhancing simulation accuracy by up to four times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate pulse shape modeling in HPGe detectors to distinguish signal from background, especially in rare events.

Method: Utilizes a CycleGAN-based Cycle Positional U-Net to map simulated to measured pulses without predetermined models.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in pulse shape model reconstruction, allowing realistic simulations.

Conclusion: This model enables improved event classification and simulation crucial for research in neutrino physics, dark matter, and beyond.

Abstract: High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors are a key technology for rare-event
searches such as neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and dark
matter experiments. Pulse shapes from these detectors vary with interaction
topology and thus encode information critical for event classification. Pulse
shape simulations (PSS) are essential for modeling analysis cuts that
distinguish signal events from backgrounds and for generating reliable
simulations of energy spectra. Traditional PSS methods rely on a series of
first-principles corrections to replicate the effect of readout electronics,
requiring challenging fits over large parameter spaces and often failing to
accurately model the data. We present a neural network architecture, the Cyclic
Positional U-Net (CPU-Net), that performs translations of simulated pulses so
that they closely resemble measured detector signals. Using a Cycle Generative
Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, this Response Emulation Network (REN)
learns a data-driven mapping between simulated and measured pulses with high
fidelity, without requiring a predetermined response model. We use data from a
High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with an inverted-coaxial point contact
(ICPC) geometry to show that CPU-Net effectively captures and reproduces
critical pulse shape features, allowing more realistic simulations without
detector-specific tuning. CPU-Net achieves up to a factor-of-four improvement
in distribution-level agreement for pulse shape parameter reconstruction, while
preserving the topology-dependent information required for pulse-shape
discrimination.

Abstract: As an auxiliary system within the calibration system of the Jiangmen
Underground Neutrino Observatory, a calibration house is designed to provide
interfaces for connecting the central detector and accommodating various
calibration sub-systems. Onsite installation has demonstrated that the
calibration house interfaces are capable of effectively connecting to the
central detector and supporting the installation of complex and sophisticated
calibration sub-systems. Additionally, controlling the levels of radon and
oxygen within the calibration house is critical. Radon can increase the
experimental background, while oxygen can degrade the quality of the liquid
scintillator. The oxygen concentration can be maintained at levels below 10
parts per million, and the radon concentration can be kept below 15
mBq/m$^{3}$. This paper will provide detailed information on the calibration
house and its methods for radon and oxygen concentration control.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners using cryogenic CsI monolithic crystals, which offer a cost-effective solution with improved performance compared to traditional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the high costs associated with TBPET scanners by proposing the use of cryogenic CsI crystals, which are more affordable and provide comparable or better performance.

Method: The method involves the production and characterization of CsI crystals at cryogenic temperatures (around 100 K), testing their scintillation properties, including light output, energy resolution, spatial resolution, and coincidence time resolution.

Result: The CsI crystals demonstrated high light outputs (>10^5 photons/MeV), excellent energy resolution (<7%), millimeter-scale spatial resolution with depth-of-interaction determination, and nanosecond-level coincidence time resolution.

Conclusion: The study concludes that TBPET scanners utilizing cryogenic CsI monolithic crystals could offer high-performance imaging at reduced costs, making them more accessible and feasible for wider deployment.

Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to
significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive
dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption
is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. In
this context, pure cesium iodide (CsI) monolithic crystals, given their much
lower cost compared with currently used rare-earth crystals, offer a promising
solution to improve accessibility. When operated at cryogenic temperatures
(approximately 100 K), CsI crystals exhibit one of the highest light outputs
among inorganic crystals, around $10^5$ photons/MeV. This results in energy
resolution below 7%, millimeter-scale spatial resolution (including accurate
depth-of-interaction determination), and coincidence time resolution at the
nanosecond level, despite their relatively slow scintillation decay time. This
study demonstrates that a TBPET scanner based on cryogenic CsI monolithic
crystals might have the potential to deliver high-performance imaging at a
reduced cost compared with conventional systems, paving the way for broader
deployment and accessibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement in cosmic-ray muon tomography applications, particularly in border security, is the main motivation.

Method: The paper details two optimization methods: TomOpt, a Python-based end-to-end software using differentiable programming and Bayesian Optimization, and GEANT4 simulations which incorporate secondary particle information.

Result: The study presents the effectiveness and current status of these optimization techniques, but specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of these optimization approaches for improving muon tomography systems in border security applications.

Abstract: The past several decades have seen significant advancement in applications
using cosmic-ray muons for tomography scanning of unknown objects. One of the
most promising developments is the application of this technique in border
security for the inspection of cargo inside trucks and sea containers in order
to search for hazardous and illicit hidden materials. This work focuses on the
optimization studies for a muon tomography system similar to that being
developed within the framework of the `SilentBorder' project funded by the EU
Horizon 2020 scheme. Current studies are directed toward optimizing the
detector module design, following two complementary approaches. The first
leverages TomOpt, a Python-based end-to-end software that employs
differentiable programming to optimize scattering tomography detector
configurations. While TomOpt inherently supports gradient-based optimization, a
Bayesian Optimization module is introduced to better handle scenarios with
noisy objective functions, particularly in image reconstruction-driven
optimization tasks. The second optimization strategy relies on detailed
GEANT4-based simulations, which, while more computationally intensive, offer
higher physical fidelity. These simulations are also employed to study the
impact of incorporating secondary particle information alongside cosmic muons
for improved material discrimination. This paper presents the current status
and results obtained from these optimization studies.

TL;DR: This paper discusses a new barrel-shaped plastic scintillation detector (MPPC) developed for the WASA-FRS experiment, measuring charged particles after proton beam-induced reactions. The detector achieved good time resolution and stability under high count rates, with MPPC damage assessed under neutron fluence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve neutron detection in radiation studies, particularly in nuclear physics experiments where high particle energies and dense beam fluxes are common.

Method: The study involved developing the detector, using it to measure charged particles from a carbon target irradiated by a 2.5 GeV proton beam in a magnetic field, and analyzing performance metrics like time resolution and damage effects under various conditions.

Result: The detector demonstrated excellent time resolution (45-75 ps σ) and maintained performance at high rates (up to 1.35 MHz). Damage was observed in MPPCs, with a 35% signal reduction at high neutron fluence.

Conclusion: The detector successfully integrates into the experimental setup, providing reliable data despite challenges, and the assessment of MPPC damage under neutron irradiation highlights the need for materials selection in high-fluence environments.

Abstract: A barrel-shaped plastic scintillation counter with Multi-Pixel Photon Counter
(MPPC) readout has been developed and operated in the first WASA-FRS
experimental campaign at GSI. The detector was used to measure charged
particles emitted from reactions induced by a 2.5 GeV proton beam incident on a
carbon target, providing particle identification in combination with momentum
reconstruction in a 1 T magnetic field. The performance of this detector,
particularly its response to energy deposition and time resolution, was
systematically investigated as a function of count rate and total number of
irradiating protons. A time resolution of 45-75 ps ($\sigma$), depending on the
energy deposition, was achieved. Stable performance was maintained under
high-rate conditions up to 1.35 MHz per single counter, with no significant
degradation in either signal amplitude or timing response. Radiation-induced
damage to the MPPCs was observed primarily as a reduction in signal amplitude,
with approximately $35\%$ decrease at an estimated 1 MeV neutron-equivalent
fluence of $2.4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a central characterization
method for molecular structure elucidation, yet interpreting NMR spectra to
deduce molecular structures remains challenging due to the complexity of
spectral data and the vastness of the chemical space. In this work, we
introduce DiffNMR, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages a conditional

generative process, ensuring global consistency and mitigating error
accumulation inherent in autoregressive methods. The framework integrates a
two-stage pretraining strategy that aligns spectral and molecular
representations via diffusion autoencoder (Diff-AE) and contrastive learning,
the incorporation of retrieval initialization and similarity filtering during
inference, and a specialized NMR encoder with radial basis function (RBF)
encoding for chemical shifts, preserving continuity and chemical correlation.

TL;DR: The paper discusses controlling the gas-phase hydrogen exchange reaction (HER) using strong light-matter coupling in a resonant cavity. By varying isotopes, the researchers achieve significant modifications of reaction rates, showing HER's potential in advancing polariton chemistry research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to utilize cavity-enhanced light-matter interactions to control and study HER, a fundamental chemical reaction. By varying isotopes, it explores how such small changes can have significant effects on reaction rates, targeting advancements in polariton chemistry and the bridge between theory and experiment.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments involving a resonant cavity to perform light-matter coupling, specifically observing the HER reaction with and without isotopic variation. They measured reaction rates and photon emission to assess the cavity's impact on the reaction dynamics.

Result: The study reveals that incorporating deuterium and varying isotopes significantly alters HER reaction rates. Inside the cavity, energy is transferred to photons, leading to modifications in reaction pathways, highlighting the effectiveness of cavity-assisted approaches in studying HER.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for studying HER by integrating cavity-mediated light-matter interactions, bringing theoretical models closer to experimental validation in polariton chemistry, and demonstrating the potential of using isotopic variation as a control tool in chemical reactions.

Abstract: The gas-phase hydrogen exchange reaction (HER) is the most fundamental
chemical process for benchmarking quantum reaction dynamics. In this Letter, we
focus on controlling HER by means of strong light-matter coupling inside a
resonant cavity, an approach often called polariton chemistry. In particular,
we focus on the isotopic variation of HER involving collisions between
molecular hydrogen H$_2$ and deuterium atom D, i.e., H$_2$+D$\to$HD+H. We find
that the asymmetry introduced by the different isotopes, despite being small,
enables strong cavity-induced modifications of reaction rates. Outside of the
cavity the reaction is as usual D+H${_2}$$\to$DH+H. However, inside the cavity
another type of reactions take place where D+H$_2$$\to$DH+H+E$_{photon}$, where
E$_{photon}$=$\hbar\omega_{cav}$. Our results show that HER is an ideal
platform to make a significant step toward closing the gap between theory and
experiment in polariton chemistry.

Abstract: We present domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset second

cascade, using BvK projected atomic orbitals and orbital specific virtuals as
intermediaries in an analogous manner to the molecular scheme. Our chargeless

Abstract: We present a detailed derivation and discussion of cavity Born-Oppenheimer
coupled cluster (CBO-CC) theory and address cavity-modified electron
correlation in the vibrational strong coupling regime. Methodologically, we
combine the recently proposed cavity reaction potential (CRP) approach with the
Lagrangian formulation of CC theory and derive a self-consistent CRP-CC method
at the singles and doubles excitations level (CRP-CCSD). The CRP-CC approach is
formally similar to implicit solvation CC models and provides access to the
CBO-CC electronic ground state energy minimized in cavity coordinate space on a
CC level of theory. A hierarchy of linearisation schemes (lCRP-CCSD) similar to
canonical CC theory systematically lifts the self-consistent nature of the
CRP-CCSD approach and mitigates numerical cost by approximating electron
correlation effects in energy minimization. We provide a thorough comparison of
CRP-CCSD, lCRP-CCSD and CRP-Hartee-Fock methods for a cavity-modified
Menshutkin reaction, pyridine$+$CH$_3$Br, and cavity-induced collective
electronic effects in microsolvation energies of selected methanol-water
clusters. We find lCRP-CCSD methods to provide excellent results compared to
the self-consistent CRP-CCSD approach in the few-molecule limit. We furthermore
observe significant differences between mean-field and correlated results in
both reactive and collective scenarios. Our work emphasizes the non-trivial
character of electron correlation under vibrational strong coupling and
provides a starting point for further developments in ab initio
vibro-polaritonic chemistry beyond the mean-field approximation.

fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and
thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a
case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained
on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key
bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We
provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in 0.1-2 M
concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of
mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit
(0.1 M) which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion
is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion
pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that
coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby
the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that
MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with
DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically
converged properties from ns long simulations.

### [173] [Accurate generation of chemical reaction transition states by conditional flow matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10530)
*Ping Tuo,Jiale Chen,Ju Li*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: TS-GEN is a novel deep learning model that generates transition state geometries with high accuracy, significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of speed and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying transition states, which are crucial for understanding chemical reactions. Traditional methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming, so there is a need for a more efficient and accurate alternative.

Method: TS-GEN uses a conditional flow-matching generative model to map Gaussian priors to transition-state saddle-point geometries. It conditions on reactant and product conformations, enabling it to learn optimal-transport paths for accurate TS generation.

Result: TS-GEN achieves superior accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.004 Å and a mean barrier-height error of 1.019 kcal/mol. It runs in 0.06 seconds per inference, is computationally efficient, and performs well even with out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: TS-GEN represents a significant advancement in the field of computational chemistry by offering a faster, more accurate, and broadly applicable method for identifying transition states, enabling high-throughput exploration of reaction networks and enhancing our understanding of chemical mechanisms.

Abstract: Transition state (TS) structures define the critical geometries and energy
barriers underlying chemical reactivity, yet their fleeting nature renders them
experimentally elusive and drives the reliance on costly, high-throughput
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Here, we introduce TS-GEN, a
conditional flow-matching generative model that maps samples from a simple
Gaussian prior directly to transition-state saddle-point geometries in a
single, deterministic pass. By embedding both reactant and product
conformations as conditioning information, TS-GEN learns to transport latent
noise to true TS structures via an optimal-transport path, effectively
replacing the iterative optimization common in nudged-elastic band or
string-method algorithms. TS-GEN delivers unprecedented accuracy, achieving a
root-mean-square deviation of $0.004\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ (vs. $0.103\
\rm{\mathring{A}}$ for prior state-of-the-art) and a mean barrier-height error
of $1.019\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ (vs. $2.864\ {\rm kcal/mol}$), while requiring only
$0.06\ {\rm s}$ GPU time per inference. Over 87% of generated TSs meet
chemical-accuracy criteria ($<1.58\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ error), substantially
outpacing existing methods. TS-GEN also exhibits strong transferability to
out-of-distribution reactions from a larger database. By uniting sub-angstrom
precision, sub-second speed, and broad applicability, TS-GEN will be highly
useful for high-throughput exploration of complex reaction networks, paving the
way to the exploration of novel chemical reaction mechanisms.

Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4

depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states.
However, the reported half-lives of $ \gamma $-ray transition are not
consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the
chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by DFT calculations. Based on
these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life
for each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation
results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $
\mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition,
whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ decay via the $

### [175] [Surface scattering of atoms for high-sensitivity spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09951)
*V. J. Ajith,Aaron Barr,Mark Raizen*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a method to cool iron atoms using a PDMS-coated surface, which reduces their temperature for applications like atomic clocks. They achieved significant cooling by only a single scattering event and reduced adsorption of impurities. Numerical simulations show potential for room-temperature atom sources with better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve methods for cooling atoms, which are essential in quantum technologies and precision measurements. Cooling allows for better control of atomic properties, enhancing the performance of devices such as atomic clocks and quantum computers.

Method: The method involves coating surfaces with PDMS and measuring the cooling effect through high-sensitivity laser spectroscopy. They observe Doppler broadening and scattering events, and use numerical simulations to predict atom source performance.

Result: The results show that PDMS-coated surfaces can cool iron atoms effectively, with single scattering events leading to equilibration. They also reduce adsorption of impurities, and simulations suggest improved atom sources at room temperature with higher flux.

Conclusion: The study concludes that surface coating with PDMS can significantly enhance atom cooling and source quality, opening new possibilities in precision metrology and quantum computing.

Abstract: High-sensitivity laser spectroscopy is integral to applications like atomic
clocks, quantum computers, and chemical sensing. Lowering atomic temperature
decreases spectral Doppler broadening and increases transit time across the
excitation laser. We find that a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated surface can
cool iron atoms from ~1400 K to room temperature by surface scattering. It is
also apparent that a single scattering event is enough for atoms to equilibrate
with the PDMS surface temperature. Further, we show the very low adsorption of
iron and ytterbium atoms on PDMS, an effect that persists to surface
temperatures of 200 K. Through numerical simulation, we demonstrate the
potential use of surface scattering in making a room temperature source of
collimated atoms with enhanced flux and reduced velocity compared to that
without surface scattering.

*Hangkai Fan,Alexey Proskurin,Mingzhao Song,Yuri Kivshar,Andrey Bogdanov*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This review discusses the electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation (EFISH) effect, explaining how it enables second-harmonic generation in centrosymmetric materials, and its applications in nonlinear optical devices and materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to explore the EFISH effect, offering a comprehensive overview to address the limitations of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in centrosymmetric materials and its applications in nonlinear optics and materials science.

Method: The paper reviews the fundamentals of EFISH, discusses various material platforms, electric field engineering strategies, distinguishes EFISH from related phenomena, and highlights applications.

Result: The review shows that EFISH provides a mechanism for SHG in centrosymmetric materials and identifies potential applications in photonic devices, carrier dynamics, and nonlinear optical systems.

Conclusion: EFISH is a promising approach for overcoming the centrosymmetric material limitations for SHG and opens new prospects in nonlinear optics and optoelectronics.

Abstract: Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental nonlinear optical process
widely used in photonics; however, it is strictly forbidden in the bulk of
centrosymmetric materials due to their inversion symmetry. Nevertheless,
applying an external electric field breaks this inversion symmetry. It induces
an effective second-order nonlinear response known as the
electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation (EFISH) effect. This
mechanism enables SHG even in centrosymmetric media and provides a powerful
tool for dynamic and electrically tunable nonlinear nanophotonics. This review
presents a comprehensive overview of the EFISH effect, covering the
fundamentals, various material platforms (including bulk semiconductor
crystals, ferroelectrics, van der Waals materials, and polymers), as well as
diverse strategies for electric field engineering. It further distinguishs
EFISH from related effects such as current-induced SHG and the quantum-confined
Stark effect, and highlight emerging applications of EFISH in tunable photonic
devices, carrier dynamics probing, and nonlinear optical modulation across
optical, electronic, and THz regimes. Finally, key challenges and perspectives
for the future development of electrically controlled nonlinear optical systems
are outlined.

Abstract: High-dimensional photonic states have significantly advanced the fundamentals
and applications of light. However, it remains huge challenges to quantify
arbitrary states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces with spin and orbital
angular momentum bases. Here we introduce a geometric method to quantify
arbitrary states in a 4D Hilbert space by interferometrically mapping them to
unified centroid ellipses. Specifically, nine Stokes parameters can be deduced
from three ellipses to quantify the 4D spin-orbit states described by SU(4)
Poincar\'e hypersphere. We verify its feasibility by detecting these spin-orbit
states gotten by both free-space wave plates and few-mode fibers. For the first
time, we completely quantify and reconstruct higher-order modal group evolution
of a weakly guiding few-mode fiber under twist perturbation. This geometric
quantification, beyond the classical Stokes polarimetry, may pave the way to
multi-dimensional optical metrology, sensing, and high-dimensional classical or
quantum communications.

Abstract: The optical Kerr micro-ring provides an ideal platform for the study of
dissipative optical solitons. Dissipative solitons are localized waves produced
by a precise equilibrium between dispersion and nonlinearity, as well as gain
and loss. Dissipative brilliant solitons are vulnerable to external noise,but
dissipative dark solitons exhibit greater robustness against noise and losses.
This study discusses the division of the input pump light field into transverse
electric (TE) and transverse magnetic(TM) modes. TE mode generates bright
solitons. TM mode forms dark solitons via cross-phase modulation (XPM), which
induces a self-focusing effect. The bright and dark solitons bind into a
soliton molecule pair through mutual interactions. We scan the entire detuning
interval; within the positive small detuning interval, two modes simultaneously
generate bright-dark soliton pair Turing roll states. Within the larger
detuning interval, the excited Brillouin scattering noise induces a high
suppression ratio (SR) between the dark and bright soliton pumps, which is
unfavorable for the formation of the bright-dark soliton pair. The system
provides a new multi-soliton manipulation scheme for optical communications.
The soliton molecule pairs hold major implications for high precision
measurement and all-optical controlling fields.

Abstract: How can one design complex systems capable of learning for a given
functionality? In the context of ultrafast laser-surface interaction, we
unravel the nature of learning schemes tied to the emergence of complexity in
dissipative structures. The progressive development of learning mechanisms,
from direct information storage to the development of smart surfaces,
originates from the network of curvatures formed in the unstable fluid under
thermoconvective instability, which is subsequently quenched and resolidified.
Under pulsed laser irradiation, non-equilibrium dynamics generate intricate
nanoscale patterns, unveiling adaptive process mechanisms. We demonstrate that
the imprints left by light act as a form of structural memory, encoding not
only local effects directed by laser field polarization but also a cooperative
strategy of reliefs that dynamically adjust surface morphology to optimize
light capture. By investigating how apparent complexity and optical response
are intricately intertwined, shaping one another, we establish a framework that
draws parallels between material adaptation and learning dynamics observed in
biological systems.

Abstract: This work developed an accurate and robust absorption-based method for
spatially resolved measurements of gas temperatures in flames and reacting
flows, with typical single-measurement uncertainties on the order of 1\%. This
method exploits narrow-linewidth laser absorption of hot CO$_2$ molecules,
which can be generated from combustion or artificially seeded into the flow. A
collinear dual-laser setup allowed for periodic scans over tens of CO$_2$
absorption transitions near the $\nu_3$ bandhead every 100 $\mu s$, from which
gas temperatures (as well as CO$_2$ concentrations) were determined with high
sensitivity and robustness. Spatially resolved measurements were achieved using
an electrically driven high-speed beam scanning system consisting of a 2-D
galvo scanner and a pair of off-axis parabolic mirrors. An effective spatial
resolution of 1 mm was achieved at a planar field measurement speed of 200 Hz
and a volumetric field measurement speed of 2 Hz, with further improvements in
speed anticipated by another order of magnitude. A physically constrained
nonlinear inference framework was also developed for the quantitative analysis
of the measurement data. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed on
axisymmetric flames stabilized on a Mckenna burner at various equivalence
ratios and flow rates, and the results agreed asymptotically with the
theoretical value of the adiabatic flame temperature. An additional experiment
on a flame of complex geometry demonstrated an excellent level of resolution,
precision, and contrast achieved by the current thermometry method. This method
promises to provide good utility in future combustion studies due to its high
performance metrics and relative ease of use.

Abstract: Compact, scalable, and multiplexed fluorescence lifetime sensors are of great
interest for point-of-care diagnostics. However, current solutions either lack
broad-range wavelength-tuning capabilities or involve complex optical setups
that hinder miniaturization. On-chip entangled photon sources offer a promising
alternative for time-resolved spectroscopy with their strong temporal
correlations, tunable spectral characteristics, and small footprints. Here, we
develop a temperature-tunable, visible quantum light source on thin-film
lithium niobate (TFLN) with a continuous tuning range greater than one octave,
spanning 564.5~nm to 1.494~$\mu$m using only one waveguide. The tunability is
enabled by utilizing type-I phase matching. We measured an on-chip efficiency
of \boldmath$(3.88\pm0.20)\times10^{9}$ pairs/s/mW, comparable to the most
efficient type-0 bulk lithium niobate sources. These results show that the TFLN
platform is ideal for on-chip integrated photonic and multiplexed lifetime

Abstract: Inkjet-printed liquid crystal (LC) droplets exhibit an intricate
spatially-varying birefringence due to their complex internal director
configuration. While such anisotropy is often viewed as a drawback when LC
droplets are used as microlenses, here we leverage this remarkable
birefringence property to generate complex structured light. Through a
selection of the alignment layer, and by varying the chiral pitch, we create
three distinct droplet types with tailored intrinsic director configurations,
each exhibiting a unique birefringence distribution for structured light beam
generation. We show that these printed LC droplets can generate beams that
exhibit skyrmionic structures carrying two units of orbital angular momentum,
beams that contain azimuthal/radial polarized fields, and beams with
polarization singularities. Our method enables new possibilities for using LC
droplet technology to engineer sophisticated optical beam patterns.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has unique features compared to gases. Gases have a universal magic field ratio of 1.5:1, but solids like monolayer MoS2 and hBN behave differently. The paper combines TDDFT and real-space trajectory analysis to explain these differences due to velocity components in solids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses an important topic in solid-state physics, specifically high-order harmonic generation, which has applications in various fields such as quantum optics and ultrafast science. Understanding the unique features of HHG in solids compared to gases is crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications.

Method: The paper employs a combination of time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) and a minimal real-space trajectory analysis to model and analyze the harmonic generation in different materials, providing a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Result: The study reveals that the harmonic yield in solids can exhibit multiple maxima and depends on material properties, unlike the universal behavior in gases. Real-space trajectory analysis successfully quantitatively explains the observed results and offers an intuitive approach to predict harmonic yields without extensive computations.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights into designing 2D materials for applications in HHG and ultrafast science. The combination of TDDFT and trajectory analysis offers a powerful tool for predicting and optimizing solid-state HHG responses, which can lead to tailored materials with desirable harmonic properties.

Abstract: Solid-state high-order harmonic generation (HHG) presents unique features
different from gases.Whereas the gaseous harmonics driven by counter-rotating
bicircular (CRB) pulse universally peak at a "magic" field ratio approximately
E_2{\omega}:E_{\omega}=1.5:1, crystals exhibit significant material-dependent
responses. In monolayer MoS2, the harmonic yield experiences two maxima at the
gas-like 1.5:1 ratio, and again in the single-color limit, whereas monolayer
hBN shows a monotonic increase as the 2{\omega} component dominates. Combining
time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) and a minimal real-space
trajectory analysis, we show that these differences arise from the interplay of
Bloch velocity and anomalous Hall velocity. The trajectory model quantitatively
reproduces the ab-initio results, and offers an intuitive prediction of the
harmonics yield without further heavy computation. These insights provide
practical guidance for tailoring solid-state HHG and for selecting 2D compounds
with desirable responses.

Abstract: Multipolar order, such as octupolar order, is one of the key concepts of
condensed matter physics, particularly in light of elusive hidden orders.
However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence
of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose
that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a detection of multipolar
anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic tight-binding
calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and
time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman
optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking.
Furthermore, we find that the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra encode the
time-reversal parity of the multipolar order, providing an all-optical means to
distinguish multipolar phases. Our findings open a pathway for identifying
multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy
as a sensitive and versatile probe.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses the combination of amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) and silicon nitride (SiN) in photonic applications, highlighting the enhancement in integration density, performance, and flexibility through this integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to leverage the superior properties of a-SiC and SiN to create a more efficient and flexible photonic platform for advanced applications like reconfigurable optics and nonlinear optics.

Method: The paper employs a heterogeneous integration approach where a-SiC and SiN photonic platforms are combined, utilizing advanced material and fabrication techniques such as chemical vapor deposition for a-SiC and SiN, which is industrially validated and suitable for CMOS processes. The integration is achieved through monolithic stacking with optimized interconnections.

Result: The integration resulted in an on-chip loss of 0.32 ± 0.10 dB and an integration density increase of over 4,444-fold. Additionally, active devices on a-SiC showed a 27-fold improvement in thermo-optic tuning efficiency compared to SiN, and the platform offers adaptability in fiber-to-chip coupling strategies depending on the application needs.

Conclusion: The integrated a-SiC/SiN photonic platform offers significant advantages in terms of integration density, performance, and flexibility, opening new possibilities for applications in programmable optics, quantum photonics, and nonlinear optical devices.

Abstract: Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) has emerged as a compelling candidate for
applications in integrated photonics, known for its high refractive index, high
optical quality, high thermo-optic coefficient, and strong third-order
nonlinearities. Furthermore, a-SiC can be easily deposited via CMOS-compatible
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, allowing for precise thickness
control and adjustable material properties on arbitrary substrates. Silicon
nitride (SiN) is an industrial well-established and well-matured platform,
which exhibits ultra-low propagation loss, but it is suboptimal for
high-density reconfigurable photonics due to the large minimum bending radius
and constrained tunability. In this work, we monolithically combine a-SiC with
SiN photonics, leveraging the merits of both platforms, and achieve the
a-SiC/SiN heterogeneous integration with an on-chip interconnection loss of
0.32$\pm$0.10 dB, and integration density increment exceeding 4,444-fold. By
implementing active devices on a-SiC, we achieve 27 times higher thermo-optic
tuning efficiency, with respect to the SiN photonic platform. In addition, the
a-SiC/SiN platform gives the flexibility to choose the optimal fiber-to-chip
coupling strategy depending on the interfacing platform, with efficient
side-coupling on SiN and grating-coupling on a-SiC platform. The proposed
a-SiC/SiN photonic platform can foster versatile applications in programmable
and quantum photonics, nonlinear optics, and beyond.

TL;DR: The paper explores the bounds of the effective permittivity tensor for uniaxial composites, advancing our understanding of photonic and electromagnetic materials through the construction and analysis of hierarchical laminates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the need to optimize advanced materials used in hyperbolic metamaterials and biological imaging, emphasizing the critical role of electromagnetic properties in applications like photonic crystals and imaging platforms.

Method: The study employs hierarchical laminates (HLs) and numerical methods to experimentally determine and theoretically derive improved bounds. It also applies the Cherkaev-Gibiansky transformation and translation methods to extend bounds from isotropic to uniaxial composites.

Result: The paper identifies better bounds for $
eff_ot$ by analyzing HLs and conjecturing convex hull-based bounds. It identifies optimal HL microstructures achieving these bounds and provides a design algorithm for constructing such structures. The results also include bounds on the sensitivity of the effective permittivity tensor, validated through analytical methods.

Conclusion: The work paves the way for more efficient designs in advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials, offering new insights into the macroscopic response of uniaxial composites and practical design algorithms.

Abstract: Electromagnetic materials with a uniaxial effective permittivity tensor,
characterized by its transverse ($\epsilon_\perp$) and axial
($\epsilon_\parallel$) components, play a central role in the design of
advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials including hyperbolic
metamaterials, and biological imaging platforms. Tight bounds on the complex
effective permittivity of such metamaterials are critical for predicting and
optimizing their macroscopic electromagnetic response. While rigorous tight
bounds exist for isotropic two-phase composites, corresponding results for
uniaxial composites remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we
systematically investigate the attainable range of $\epsilon_\perp$ and
$\epsilon_\parallel$ in the quasistatic regime for two-phase metamaterials with
isotropic homogeneous phases. By analyzing known microgeometries and
constructing hierarchical laminates (HLs), we demonstrate that the classical
bounds on $\epsilon_\perp$ are not optimal. We conjecture improved bounds based
on numerically fitted circular arcs derived from convex hulls of
$\epsilon_\perp$ values obtained from HLs, and we identify optimal rank-4 HL
structures that achieve all points on the conjectured bounds. Additionally, we
quantify the correlation between $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ for
fixed volume fractions, and propose a design algorithm to construct HL
microstructures achieving prescribed values of $\epsilon_\perp$. Leveraging the
Cherkaev-Gibiansky transformation and the translation method, we extend recent
techniques developed for isotropic composites by Kern-Miller-Milton to derive
translation bounds on the uniaxial complex effective permittivity tensor.
Finally, bounds on the sensitivity of the effective permittivity tensor of
low-loss composites are obtained and their optimality is shown in
two-dimensions.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new mechanism for magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) in noncoplanar antiferromagnets, demonstrating large MOKE signals without relying on spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of MOKE is important for opto-spintronic devices due to the potential for ultrafast and stray-field-immune applications. This paper challenges traditional dependence on SOC and introduces real-space scalar spin chirality as an alternative.

Method: They used a Sagnac interferometer microscope to image scalar spin chirality domains and their reversals in Co1/3TaS2.

Result: Large MOKE signals were experimentally observed without SOC or net magnetization, establishing a new mechanism.

Conclusion: This discovery opens possibilities for new applications in opto-spintronics, leveraging chiral spin textures in noncoplanar antiferromagnets.

Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of
oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with
relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its
orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination
of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets,
SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization.
Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic
materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in
systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental
verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and
magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a
Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and
their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for
generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated
magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune
opto-spintronic applications.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the construction of an artificial gauge field using a quasi-phase-matched quadratic nonlinear crystal, with a focus on achieving chiral solitons and energy flow. Key findings include optimal angles for maximizing energy flow and the mobility of solitons. Experimental validation is mentioned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the use of nonlinear crystals for creating artificial gauge fields and chiral solitons, which could have implications for fields like optics and quantum physics.

Method: The researchers used a quasi-phase-matched technique with quadratic crystals and altered stripe angles to construct a gauge field via nonlinear coupling. They derived semi-analytical solutions for chiral energy flow, studied optimal angles, and实验 validated soliton mobility and collisions.

Result: Chiral solitons were found to move in response to kicks and collide elastically. An optimal angle maximizes chiral energy flow with positive correlations to power and detuning. Experimental methods may successfully generate these solitons and currents.

Conclusion: This study opens new avenues for exploring gauge fields and chiral solitons in nonlinear optics and quantum systems, offering potential applications in optical information processing.

Abstract: We introduce a quasi-phase-matched technique in quadratic nonlinear crystals,
constructing an artificial gauge field by changing the inclination angle of
stripes, which is realized by the positive and negative polarization directions
of nonlinear susceptibility along the crystal. Unlike the artificial gauge
field constructed through linear coupling in other settings, the gauge field in
this system is realized by nonlinear coupling. We demonstrate that this gauge
field can generate stable chiral solitons with chiral energy flow rotating
around the solitons. In contrast to conventional chiral currents generated with
the same specie or frequency, the chiral currents in the present system are
formed by mutual coupling between fundamental frequency and second harmonic
components. We derive the semi-analytical solution for the chiral energy flow
in this system. It is found that there exists an optimal inclination angle that
can maximize the chiral energy flow under different parameters, and this
optimal inclination shows a positive correlation with the power and detuning.
The mobility and collisions of the chiral solitons are also discussed. The
results show that chiral solitons move in response to kicking and undergo fully
elastic collisions with each other. In addition, the possibility of
experimentally generating chiral solitons and chiral currents is outlined.

Abstract: Large-area microscopy with submicron resolution is limited by tradeoffs
between field of view (FOV), resolution, and imaging speed. Samples are rarely
flat across centimeter-scale FOV, which often requires existing solutions to
use mechanical scanning to ensure focused capture at reduced throughput. Here,
we present PANORAMA, a single-shot, re-imaging microscope that achieves
seamless, gigapixel imaging over a 16.3$\times$18.8 $\text{mm}^2$ FOV at 0.84
um resolution without mechanical scanning. By using a telecentric
photolithography lens, a large-aperture tube lens, and a flat micro-camera
array with adaptive per-camera focus control, PANORAMA maintains submicron
focus across flat, curved or uneven samples that span centimeters. This
approach improves imaging throughput and adaptability, enabling gigapixel
multi-modal microscopy of large flat and non-flat samples in one shot, thus
broadening its applications in biomedical and materials imaging.

Motivation: Understanding and controlling the optical properties of nanophotonic devices is crucial in the field.

Result: Unprecedented in situ control, high Q-factors, tight resonances, tunable via magnetic fields.

Conclusion: Quantum materials offer a new way to design tunable photonic devices without changing the structure.

Abstract: Central to the field of nanophotonics is the ability to engineer the flow of
light through nanoscale structures. These structures often have permanent
working spectral ranges and optical properties that are fixed during
fabrication. Quantum materials, with their correlated and intertwined degrees
of freedom, offer a promising avenue for dynamically controlling photonic
devices without altering their physical structure. Here, we fabricate photonic
crystal slabs from CrSBr, a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and
demonstrate unprecedented in situ control over their optical properties.
Leveraging the combination of the exceptionally large refractive index of CrSBr
near its excitonic resonances and its tunability via external fields, we
achieve precise manipulation of photonic modes at near-visible and infrared
wavelengths, showcasing a new paradigm for nanophotonic device design. The
resulting guided resonances of the photonic crystal are tightly packed in the
spectrum with very small mode volumes, are highly tunable via external magnetic
fields, and exhibit high Q-factors exceeding 500. These resonances
self-hybridize with the excitonic degrees of freedom, resulting in intrinsic
strong light-matter coupling. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum
materials for developing in situ tunable photonic elements and cavities.

Abstract: Distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) based traffic flow monitoring systems
are a cost-effective wide-area traffic monitoring solution that utilize
existing fiber infrastructure along roads. These systems analyse vehicle
vibrations and measure average traffic speeds to detect traffic events.
However, these systems face difficulties in detecting early signs of
non-recurring traffic congestions in low-density traffic flow caused by
presence of single-lane abnormal events. This is because average traffic speeds
do not decrease quickly in such events. During abnormal events, multiple
vehicles perform spontaneous braking and abrupt lane-changes to avoid obstacles
on travel lanes. These vehicle behaviours gradually lead to traffic congestion.
Thus, frequent lane-change maneuver, performed by multiple vehicles at similar
location, may suggest occurrence of congestion-inducing abnormal events. This
paper discusses methods to identify and locate occurrence of these single-lane
abnormal events by detecting frequent lane-change maneuver along road sections.
We first propose a method to locate vehicle positions along a road section and
estimate the vehicle path. We then propose a method to detect vehicle
lane-change maneuver by monitoring variations in spectral centroid of vehicle
vibrations. The evaluation of our proposed methods with real traffic data for
two different expressways showed 81.5% accuracy for individual vehicle path
tracking and 83.5% accuracy in lane-change event detection. These results
suggest that the proposed method has potential for detecting occurrence of
single-lane abnormal events in low-density traffic flow so that necessary
mitigation measures can be initiated before onset of traffic congestions.

Abstract: Optical tweezers have become a powerful tool for measuring parameters of
microscale and nanoscale local environments. Motion of particles within optical
tweezer traps established itself as a probe for local viscosity, temperature as
well as external fields. However, complex motions of trapped particles such as
hopping or orbiting conventionally relies on intricate structure of the optical
trap, which creates limitations to their applicability, in particular in
challenging environments such as living matter. Here we demonstrate
experimentally polarization-dependent hopping and orbiting of particles in an
optical trap formed by a single Gaussian beam. This novel effect is observed
for subwavelength particles with sizes above approximately $\lambda/3$, where
$\lambda$ is the wavelength of the trapping beam. Our theoretical analysis
reveals that the hopping and orbiting arises via the excitation of {\it
higher-order Mie resonances}. While smaller particles experiencing dipolar
optical forces remain trapped at the beam center, larger particles experience
quadrupole optical forces exhibiting more complex behavior. Under linearly
polarized illumination, larger particles show {\it bistable dynamics} hopping
between two stable positions. Under circularly polarized illumination, trapped
particles orbit around the beam center, revealing a light-induced
spin-to-orbital angular momentum transfer. Experimental trajectory analysis
reveals power-tunable hopping rates and angular velocities. We discuss the
effect of VO$_2$ monoclinic-to-rutile phase change on the observed effect. Our
results present a robust and reliable way to achieve complex behavior of a
particle in simple single-beam tweezers. This should enhance sensitivity of
parameter measurements for local environments via optical forces, such as
viscosity and temperature inside cells.

Abstract: We demonstrate Young's double-slit experiment with GHz surface acoustic waves

optical case due to the anisotropy of SAW propagation on GaAs. We generate SAWs
using an interdigital transducer (IDT), and the double-slit is realized by
focused ion beam milled grooves which block the SAWs. We measure the
out-of-plane SAW displacement with an optical scanning interferometer and apply
a spatial Fourier filtering technique, enabling the observation of the two-slit
interference pattern, as well as higher order diffraction and near field
interference effects. We find reasonable agreement between the measured
far-field interference pattern and anisotropic Huygens-Fresnel simulations
based on previously reported angle-dependent SAW velocities on GaAs.

Abstract: Single-beam scanning microscopy (SBSM) is one of the most robust strategies
for commercial optical systems. Although structured illumination combined with
Fourier-domain spatial spectrum fusion can enhance SBSM resolution beyond the
diffraction limit, a sophisticated detection system is still required to
optimize both effective resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.Here, we report
that the diverse nonlinear responses of upconversion nanoparticles can unlock a
new mode of Computational Progressively Emission Saturated Nanoscopy (CPSN),
which employs a single doughnut-shaped excitation beam assisted by deep
learning to simplify conventional microscopy. By modulating the excitation
power, the smooth transition of the point spread function (PSF) from
doughnut-shaped to Gaussian can be achieved, allowing for accessing different
spatial frequency components of the sample. Then, in order to enhance time
resolution, the doughnut-shaped beam at low power and the saturated
Gaussian-like image were predicted by the doughnut-shaped beam at low
saturation threshold based on the power dependence curve. Furthermore, a deep
recursive residual network (DRRN) is employed to fusion these progressively
complementary spatial frequency information into a final super-resolved image
that encompasses the full frequency wwinformation. This approach can achieve
high-quality super-resolution imaging with a spatial resolution of 33 nm,
corresponding to 1/29th of the excitation wavelength, 55 dB of SNR ratio
contracted to 7 dB in Gaussian imaging and applicable to any wavelength. The
unique combination of nonlinear saturation and deep learning computational
reconstruction could open a new avenue for simplifying the optical system and
enhancing imaging quality in single-beam super-resolution nanoscopy.

Abstract: Ever since the advent of high-order harmonic generation, one of the main
goals has been to maximize the high harmonic yield. This is due to the wide
range of applications in multidisciplinary research fields, including nonlinear
XUV optics and ultrafast science. Nowadays, intense laser-atom interactions are
one of the primary sources of high-order harmonic generation, emitting
radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) range. Although the scaling laws for
XUV photon numbers have been extensively studied in the past, their dependence
on the duration of the driving laser pulse has remained largely unexplored
experimentally. This is because, in each of these studies, the XUV photon yield
was optimized according to the specific characteristics of the lasers used and
the corresponding XUV beamlines. In other words, there have been no systematic
measurements on the dependence of XUV yield on the duration of the driving
laser pulse. Here, by taking advantage of the SYLOS laser system at ELI ALPS,
we are able to experimentally investigate this long-standing question. We found
that for driving laser field intensities below the saturation threshold of
harmonic generation, the harmonic yield depends linearly on the pulse duration.
However, for laser intensities near to the harmonic yield saturation, the
harmonic yield is inversely proportional to the pulse duration.

Abstract: Electrons in atoms and molecules move on attosecond time scales. Deciphering
their quantum dynamics in space and time calls for high-resolution microscopy
at this speed. While scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) driven with terahertz
pulses has visualized sub-picosecond motion of single atoms, the advent of
attosecond light pulses has provided access to the much faster electron
dynamics. Yet, combining direct atomic spatial and attosecond temporal
resolution remained challenging. Here, we reveal atomic-scale quantum motion of
single electrons in attosecond lightwave-driven STM. Near-infrared single-cycle
waveforms from phase-controlled optical pulse synthesis steer and clock
electron tunnelling. By keeping the thermal load of the tip-sample junction
stable, thereby eliminating thermal artifacts, we detect waveform-dependent
currents on sub-cycle time scales. Our joint theory-experiment campaign shows
that single-cycle near-infrared pulses can drive isolated electronic wave
packets shorter than 1 fs. The angstrom-scale decay of the tunnelling current
earmarks a fascinating interplay of multi-photon and field-driven dynamics. By
balancing these effects, we sharply image a single copper adatom on a silver
surface with lightwave-driven currents. This long-awaited fusion of attosecond
science with atomic-scale STM makes elementary dynamics of electrons inside
atoms, molecules and solids accessible to direct spatio-temporal videography
and atom-scale petahertz electronics.

Abstract: We present a new theory for orbital angular momentum (OAM) generation by
chaotic phase surfaces with discrete integer bias distributions. We derive
fundamental selection rules that determine which OAM modes can be coherently
generated. Our analysis shows that ensemble-averaged OAM exists only when the
bias parameter takes integer values that match the discrete OAM eigenspace,
creating "allowed" and "forbidden" OAM levels. We derive analytical expressions
for the OAM power spectrum and demonstrate universal caling behavior within the
allowed manifold. These theoretical predictions are validated by comprehensive
Monte Carlo simulations, which confirm the selection rules with a
forbidden-level suppression factor exceeding 10^4 and demonstrate the universal
scaling with exceptional accuracy.

Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for sorting vector vortex beams using a
system of three optical cavities. The method targets the separation of the four
vector vortex modes of a given order m by exploiting their symmetry properties
with respect to radial axes. The first cavity separates the modes into two
pairs, one symmetric and one antisymmetric under horizontal flip, by
transmitting one pair and reflecting the other. Each output is then directed
into a second cavity, which further resolves the pairs into individual modes
based on their parity. A key element between the cavities is a novel system
introduced in this work, the Profile Rotator (PR), which rigidly rotates the
beam profile (including its polarization structure) using an appropriately
calibrated K-mirror and a Faraday rotator. The theoretical framework is based
on the analysis of mode symmetries and their interaction with cavity boundary
conditions. This work lays the groundwork for experimental implementations of
efficient mode sorting, with potential applications in high-dimensional quantum
information processing, optical communications, and structured light
manipulation.

Abstract: The infamous weakness of molecular chiroptical responses challenges the
all-optical realization of crucial applications such as enantio-selective
sorting of chiral molecules, or biasing chiral chemical reactions. Chiral
optical cavities are a natural choice for confronting this challenge. Ideally,
the dissymmetry between the two helicities inside such cavities is maximized.
In here, we propose a chiral infrared optical cavity formed by planar mirrors
made of diffracting lattices of silver helices with almost maximum
electromagnetic chirality. It combines the strong helicity selectivity of the
helices with the helicity-preserving reflectivity that planar systems show at
large incidence angles. For the manifold of cavity modes which have a component
with zero in-plane momentum, we demonstrate an unprecedented dissymmetry of 95
% inside the cavity at the target frequency, making it a compelling candidate
for enantio-selective applications.

### [204] [Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08928)
*Glenn Wagner,Titus Neupert*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper explores the behavior of anyons in quantum Hall systems, specifically how impurities can bind quasihole states in a Laughlin FQH state, and how this binding can be manipulated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fractional quantum Hall effect is a fascinating area of condensed matter physics, and understanding the interactions between quasiparticles, such as anyons, is crucial for advancing the field towards topological quantum computing.

Method: The authors studied a ν=1/3 Laughlin fractional quantum Hall system, focusing on the binding of quasihole anyons via impurities. They considered the balance between quasihole repulsion and impurity attraction, and used experimental methods like scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy for observation.

Result: Quasihole binding to impurities is observed with varying numbers, influenced by system parameters. The experimentally feasible detection methods were highlighted as potential tools for further research.

Conclusion: The findings enhance our understanding of anyonic interactions, opening new avenues for quantum computing applications, especially with platforms like twisted MoTe₂ where strong impurities can be realized.

Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in
strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall
(FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons
can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as
anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall
states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin
fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong
attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive
interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction
between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers
of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating
while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes
bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states
experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton
spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs
heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the
recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$
offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.

Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo
simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter
to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly
refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many
situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory,
and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the
algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises
as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To
remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation
method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the
infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an
exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to
the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is
straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results
establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem,
with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of
fundamental fermion simulations.

### [206] [Anisotropic magnetism of polymorphic ErAl3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08984)
*Karolina Gornicka,Brenden R. Ortiz,Andrew D. Christianson,Andrew F. May*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: ErAl₃ exhibits two polymorphs, α and β, with distinct magnetic properties. β-ErAl₃ shows antiferromagnetic ordering at 5.1 K with suppressed transitions under applied fields. α-ErAl₃ displays more complex behavior, including successive magnetic transitions at 5.7 K and 4.6 K, with heat capacity and dilatometry pointing to second and first-order transitions, respectively. Under magnetic fields, α shows step-like metamagnetic transitions and magnetoresistance at low temperatures. Both polymorphs have significant metallic properties with Ising-like physics highlighted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the magnetic and structural properties of ErAl3 in two polymorphs, which could have implications for materials science and understanding low-temperature magnetic behavior.

Method: The researchers grew single crystals of β and α ErAl3 using aluminum flux, then characterized their magnetic properties using magnetic measurements, heat capacity, dilatometry, and magnetic field applications. They also studied the electrical resistivity and observed behavior at different temperatures.

Result: Both polymorphs show antiferromagnetic ordering, but α exhibits more complex transitions and additional properties like magnetoresistance and step-like metamagnetic transitions. β has a simpler transition but is affected by applied fields.

Conclusion: The study suggests that ErAl3's polymorph selection and magnetic properties are influenced by composition, with α showing more intricate magnetic behavior influenced by competing interactions, potentially relevant to Ising physics and low-temperature applications.

Abstract: ErAl$_3$ can form in either a trigonal ($\alpha$) or cubic ($\beta$)
polymorph and this paper investigates the physical properties of these
polymorphs through characterizations of single crystals grown in an aluminum
flux. We demonstrate that polymorph selection can be achieved based on the
nominal composition of the crystal growth. Magnetic measurements confirm that
both $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ and $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ order antiferromagnetically at low
temperatures. $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ undergoes AFM ordering at a N\'eel temperature
T$_N$ = 5.1 K, and the transition is suppressed continually with applied field.
$\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ displays more complex behavior, with successive magnetic
transitions at T$_N$ = 5.7 K and T$_2$ = 4.6 K for zero field, where heat
capacity and dilatometry measurements evidence that these transitions are
second- and first-order, respectively. Under magnetic field, strong anisotropy
is revealed in $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, with several step-like metamagnetic
transitions observed below T$_2$ for H$\parallel$c. These transitions produce
sequential magnetization plateaus near one-half of the apparent saturation
magnetization. The electrical resistivity of $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ is strongly
coupled to its magnetism. At $T$ = 2 K, we observe a positive magnetoresistance
reaching 60\%, with distinct anomalies at the metamagnetic transitions. The
results are summarized in $H$- $T$ phase diagrams that demonstrate complex
magnetic behavior for $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, suggesting an important role of
competing interactions in this metallic system that possesses characteristics
of Ising physics.

TL;DR: 该论文利用超快光谱研究了CeBi及其非磁性的同构化合物LaBi中的介稳声学动力学，发现了两者的长纵向声子异常。CeBi在反铁磁相变温度附近，声子频率和幅度发生显著异常，这证明了强烈的磁声子耦合。在4K的低温AFM状态下，CeBi需要约44微焦/平方厘米的 pump fluence才能引发声子趋谐化加速和幅度显著增加，这表明光激发的非热效应解除了AFM有序态。结果显示，声子作为研究介稳 orders的重要手段，同时超脉冲带来了对磁性状态的动态调控，为操控量子相提供了潜力。

Method: 利用超快光学光谱技术研究材料的声学动力学，关注在反铁磁相变附近的行为。

Result: CeBi在反铁磁相变温度附近显示明显的声子异常，且有两个不同温度范围的相变；CeBi需要特定的pump fluence阈值才能触发声子解质。

Conclusion: 超快光谱展示了CeBi中较强的磁声子耦合和AFM有序，这些发现为操控量子相提供了工具。

Abstract: We report an ultrafast optical spectroscopy study on the coherent phonon
dynamics in the topological semimetal CeBi and its nonmagnetic isostructural
compound LaBi, revealing profound insights into their electronic and magnetic
interactions. Both materials exhibit prominent $A_{1g}$ longitudinal optical
phonons with characteristic anharmonic temperature dependencies. However, in
CeBi, the $A_{1g}$ phonon frequency and amplitude show clear anomalies near its
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperatures ($T_{N1}$ $\simeq$ 25 K and
$T_{N2}$ $\simeq$ 12 K), which unequivocally demonstrate strong
magneto-phononic coupling. Crucially, in the AFM state at 4 K, CeBi exhibits a
pump fluence threshold of $F_C$ $\approx$ 44 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, above which the
rate of phonon softening accelerates and the amplitude increases sharply. This
unique threshold, absent in paramagnetic CeBi and LaBi, points to a
photoinduced, non-thermal quenching of the AFM order. Our findings establish
coherent phonons as highly sensitive probes of intertwined orders in heavy
fermion systems, highlighting the transformative potential of ultrafast pulses
in dynamically controlling magnetic states in correlated electron materials and
paving the way for the manipulation of emergent quantum phases.

TL;DR: Trigonal tr-Cr₁+δTe₂ exhibits multiple magnetic transitions with unique spin structures, finite spin chirality leading to TH effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates various magnetic and topological properties of trigonal tr-CrTe₂, including multiple transitions and spin structures, to understand its unique electronic behavior.

Method: Magnetic measurements (magnetization, Raman, neutron diffraction) under applied fields were used to study the material's properties.

Result: Key findings include two magnetic transitions (FM-AFM-PM) and an umbrella spin structure with finite spin chirality, resulting in the observed topological effects.

Conclusion: The study provides detailed insights into the magnetic and topological properties of this van der Waals material with implications for future applications in spintronics and related fields.

Abstract: Trigonal tr-Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_{2}$ is a well-known ferromagnetic material
that has recently drawn much attention due to the discovery of zero-field
skyrmion state, unusual anomalous Hall effect, topological Hall effect, and
topological Nernst effect. This quasi-van der Waals (vdW) layered material with
intercalated Cr atoms possesses many peculiar features that depend on the
amount of Cr intercalation, although the microscopic magnetic ground state is
still elusive. We reveal the structural and magnetic properties of
tr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$ by low-temperature x-ray diffraction, magnetization,
temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and single-crystal neutron
diffraction studies. Magnetization measurements under small applied magnetic
field indicate two successive magnetic transitions, one from a ferromagnetic
(FM) state to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state (T$_\mathrm{C}=197$ K), and
second from AFM to a paramagnetic state (T$_\mathrm{N}=211$ K). The FM
transition is sharp with a strong presence of magnetoelastic coupling, but is
not accompanied by any structural phase transition. The magnetic structure
obtained from zero-field single crystal neutron diffraction reveals that the
Cr1 and Cr2 moments are ferromagnetically aligned along the c-axis, while the
Cr3 and intercalated Cr4 atoms induce an AFM component in the ab-plane leading
to an umbrella-like spin structure which possesses a finite spin chirality. The
presence of a finite spin chirality is responsible for the observation of the
topological Hall effect (THE).

TL;DR: This abstract discusses the quantum anomalous Hall effect in a Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice, emphasizing interaction-driven mechanisms and the resulting phase diagram.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interest in topological phases of matter, particularly the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and the challenge of realizing stable topological states against thermal fluctuations motivates this work.

Method: Exact diagonalization is employed within the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice to analyze the system's behavior, focusing on spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interactions.

Result: The research identifies a paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect with a specific Chern number (C=2 or 6), indicating topological properties. The system's robustness against thermal and external perturbations is confirmed through well-defined excitation and insulating gaps.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive phase diagram with competing magnetic orders, offering a pathway to design materials with tunable topological properties for potential applications in quantum spintronic devices.

Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven
paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard
model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact
diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground
state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites.
The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$,
and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a
well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the
robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The
interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability
of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with
competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.

Abstract: We study the ground state phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model in a
half-filled 5/7 skewed ladder, which is topologically equivalent to a \{112\}
grain boundary in graphene and related systems. Using the mean-field method, we
identify various electronic and magnetic phases in the U-V plane, by
calculating the site charge and spin densities. The electronic phases include
partially charge-ordered metal or insulator, and fully charge-ordered
insulator. The different magnetic phases of the model are non-magnet, spin
density wave, spin split compensated ferrimagnet or partial antiferromagnet.
Analysis of the electronic band structure reveals that the partially
charge-ordered compensated ferrimagnetic phase exhibits spin polarisation,
which can be quite interesting for spintronics applications. We also compute
the polarisation as a function of $U$ using the Berry phase formalism and show
that the system exhibits multiferroicity with coexisting compensated
ferrimagnetic spin order alongside electronic polarisations.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the electronic structure of a hole-doped triangular moiré Hubbard model using CPT and a GMFA. It explores how parameters U and φ affect the Fermi surface and pseudogap, highlighting the role of geometric frustration and spin-orbital interaction in a more complex system than a square lattice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper contributes to understanding complex electronic behaviors in frustrated systems, which has implications for high-temperature superconductivity and correlated electron physics.

Method: The authors used cluster perturbation theory and a generalized mean-field approximation, incorporating spin correlations to model the system with varying U and φ.

Result: The study reveals how varying U and φ affects the electronic structure, explaining the evolution of the pseudogap and Fermi surface from a magnetic order perspective.

Conclusion: The triangular lattice with spin-orbital coupling provides a more intricate environment for the pseudogap state, offering_new insights into unconventional electronic states.

Abstract: The electronic structure of the lightly hole-doped triangular-lattice moir\'e
Hubbard model is studied within cluster perturbation theory (CPT) using 13-site
clusters for a fixed doping concentration $p=1/13$ varying the Coulomb
parameter $U$ and the hopping phase parameter $\phi$ related to the
spin-orbital interaction. We have also developed a rather simple generalized
mean-field approximation (GMFA) containing the amplitude of the spin
correlations as a free parameter to fit the CPT data.The evolution of the Fermi
surface and the pseudogap with the parameters $\phi$ and $U$ is explained from
the viewpoint of the short-range magnetic order. The geometric frustration and
the additional model parameter related to the spin-orbital interaction result
in a more rich physics of the pseudogap state compared to the case of a more
conventional square lattice.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the discovery of a new surface-confined spiral state in the chiral magnetoelectric insulator Cu₂OSeO₃, with a pitch twice as long as previously reported structures, emerging at low temperatures under specific magnetic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The intrinsic rich phase diagram of Cu₂OSeO₃, a chiral magnetoelectric material, is of significant interest. This paper aims to identify novel magnetic orders, particularly confined surface states, which are potential candidates for future spin-texture based devices.

Method: The research employed resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS) techniques, including both reflection and transmission geometries, along with small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to analyze the magnetic structure and localizability of the new phase.

Result: A new surface-confined spiral state (SSS) was identified in Cu₂OSeO₃. The SSS exhibits a real-space pitch of approximately 120 nm, double the previously noted incommensurate structures. The SSS forms when the magnetic field is near the ⟨110⟩ axis at temperatures below 30 K. Its presence is confirmed through a combination of experimental methods, highlighting surface-localization.

Conclusion: The discovery of the SSS in Cu₂OSeO₃ underscores the potential of this material for creating nanoscale, energy-efficient spin-texture applications. The SSS is attributed to competing surface anisotropic interactions, suggesting avenues for manipulating magnetic states at the nanoscale to enhance device performance.

Abstract: The chiral magnetoelectric insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ hosts a rich and
anisotropic magnetic phase diagram that includes helical, conical,
field-polarized, tilted conical, and skyrmion lattice phases. Using resonant
elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), we uncover a new spiral state confined to the
surface of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. This surface-confined spiral state (SSS) displays a
real-space pitch of $\sim$120 nm, which remarkably is twice the length of the
incommensurate structures observed to-date in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The SSS phase
emerges at temperatures below 30~K when the magnetic field is applied near the
$\langle110\rangle$ crystallographic axis. Its surface localization is
demonstrated through a combination of REXS in reflection and transmission
geometries, with complementary small-angle neutron scattering measurements
suggesting its absence from the bulk. We attribute the stabilization of the SSS
to competing anisotropic interactions at the crystal surface. The discovery of
a robust, surface-confined spiral paves the way for engineering
energy-efficient, nanoscale spin-texture platforms for next-generation devices.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper compares Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ iron chains, finding similarities in electronic structure, but noting that Fe³⁺ lacks pairing tendencies, unlike in ladders. Motivation is to explore iron systems' electronic properties. Method uses first-principles and DMRG. Results show an orbital-selective Mott phase and no pairing in the U/W region. Conclusion emphasizes the distinction between chains and ladders in these systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the electronic properties of iron chains with different iron centers, comparing them to iron ladders. It is motivated by recent studies on Fe²⁺ systems and seeks to understand the similarities and differences in the electronic structure and pairing tendencies of Fe³⁺ chains versus Fe ladders.

Method: First-principles calculations and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method are used to construct the three-orbital electronic Hubbard model of the Fe³⁺ chain, revealing key properties such as antiferromagnetic coupling and orbital-selective Mott behavior.

Result: The Fe³⁺ chain exhibits a robust antiferromagnetic coupling and an orbital-selective Mott phase in the intermediate U/W region. No pairing tendency is observed in this region, unlike in Fe ladders where superconductivity is reported.

Conclusion: The findings clarify the similarities and differences in the electronic behavior between Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ iron chains versus iron ladders, suggesting that Fe³⁺ systems are less prone to superconductivity compared to ladders.

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron
systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide
chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a
similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to
similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a
three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using
the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic
coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate
electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective
Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is
the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth).
Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$
chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing
tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that
superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results
establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and

Conclusion: 电子态由非金属态变化到金属态，解释了热电导率和 Seebeck 系数的变化

Abstract: The microscopic origin of ferromagnetism in correlated materials remains
heavily debated, particularly for the competing mechanisms governing insulating
versus metallic phases. In this work, we theoretically study the electronic
structure evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and provide a consistent
explanation to three unique features of this system, i.e. the semiconducting
ferromagnetism at low pressure, the metallic ferromagnetism at high pressure,
and the enhanced Curie temperature in the metallic phase. We propose that it is
the reduced electronic correlation and enhanced $d$-$p$ hybridization that
universally drive the continuous evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and
glue the three distinct experimental observations. Central to our discovery is
the dual role of metallicity -- it simultaneously establishes kinetically
driven exchange via $d$-$p$ hybridization and enables Stoner-type magnetic
instability, with the contribution also from the residual super-exchange. Our
analyses reveal that {\it intraband} excitations dominate the pressure-enhanced
$\omega_p^2$ and $T_c$ correlation. These findings establish $d$-$p$
hybridization and electronic correlation as the bridge between localized and
itinerant magnetism, at least, in CrGeTe$_{3}$.

Abstract: The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize
the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal
symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken
nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the
odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\bar{C}_2||\bar{E}]$ that
allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\bar{C}_2$ represents a
$180^\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with
the spin-space inversion, and $\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a
representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical
conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo
formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both
the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM,
and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle
direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse
optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around
the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous
Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization
$M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$
in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at
half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits
a non-monotonous behavior.

Abstract: The intertwined electron correlation and topology give birth to emergent
quantum phenomena with fractionalized phases in condensed matter physics.
Recently, Chern insulators and fractional ones with C smaller than one have
been observed in twisted MoTe2 and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moire
systems at zero magnetic fields, resembling the fractional quantum Hall phases
at high magnetic fields. Here, we target topological phases with high Chern
number C > 1 by designing a new moire system, i.e. twisted rhombohedral
trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe Chern insulators with C = 3 at both v = 1
and v = 3. In particular, quantized anomalous Hall effect with C = -3 is
observed at v = 3 for device D2. Most importantly, by fractionally filling the
high Chern number flat band, we observe evidence of a fractional Chern
insulator with C = -3/2 developing from even-denominator fractional filling v =
5/2 at zero magnetic fields, which reaches a fractionally quantized Hall effect
with C = -3/2 (a quantization accuracy of 96%) at B = 4T. We have observed
another FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, supported by the Streda formula and
anomalous Hall effects induced time reversal symmetry breakings. In addition,
we observe Chern insulators with C = 1 and 2 at even-denominator fractional
filling v = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, and strikingly, the signatures of
anomalous Hall crystal phases with high Chern numbers (C > 1) that develops
continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields
in device D1 and D3. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally
extended to other twisted graphene moire superlattices based on rhombohedral
graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern
number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond
the paradigm of the fractional phases with C < 1.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses an experimental study on single crystals of a 5d1 double perovskite Ba2CaReO6. Results show weak zero-field and field-cooled magnetization splitting below 12 K, which disappears above 1 T. No thermodynamic phase transition was detected, but low temperatures show specific heat deviations and an electronic entropy release of ~Rln2. X-ray diffraction indicates disorder in the material likely related to ReO6 octahedra tilts and rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely to study the magnetic and structural properties of the perovskite material, possibly to understand high-temperature behavior or phase transitions in such compounds.

Method: The experiment involved magnetization measurements, specific heat analysis, and X-ray diffraction. Temperature and magnetic field dependencies were analyzed.

Result: Magnetization splitting below 12 K, absence above 1 T. No thermodynamic phase transition detected. Low temperature specific heat release and disorder observed through X-ray diffraction, related to octahedra movements.

Conclusion: The study suggests that the material is magnetic but doesn't exhibit a thermodynamic phase transition. Disorder might play a significant structural role in the material's behavior at low temperatures.

Abstract: We present results of an experimental study on single crystals of a 5d1
double perovskite Ba2CaReO6. Magnetization measurements reveal a weak splitting
between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled protocols below 12 K. At magnetic
fields above 1 T the splitting is absent and the magnetic susceptibility is
featureless. A detailed specific heat study in a wide temperature range and
comprising different heat pulses did not reveal any indication of a
thermodynamic phase transition. At low temperatures we do observe specific heat
deviating from a phonon background, leading to a total electronic entropy
release of ~Rln2. Resonant and non-resonant x-ray diffraction of characteristic
Bragg peaks indicates a significant presence of disorder, potentially related
to random tilts and rotations of rigid ReO6 octahedra.

Abstract: We show that an electric field can induce nonreciprocal spin wave dispersion
in magnetic insulators with negligible spin-orbit coupling. The electric field
controls the direction and magnitude of nonreciprocity through a nonlinear
magnetoelectric effect without switching the magnetic ground state. By deriving
spin space group symmetry constraints, we find only a subset of noncoplanar
magnets exhibits this property, and identify a few candidates. For the example
of hexagonal lattice tetrahedral antiferromagnet, our effective field theory
analysis and microscopic model calculation yield results that are fully
consistent with the symmetry analysis.

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum
correlations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge
lies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal
quantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be
insufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as
superconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations,
we show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations,
occupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of
off-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at
half-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of
the superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of
particle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While
this symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it
allows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal
correlations.

Conclusion: 确认了通过调节掺杂剂量，可以控制Ni-3d_{x²−y²}轨道的相关性，这对于理解该系统的行为至关重要。

Abstract: The minimal model for infinite-layer nickelates remains under debate,
particularly regarding the hybridization between itinerant interstitial-$s$ and
the correlated Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as the interaction between
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other $3d$ orbitals. Additionally, how the doped holes in
La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ are distributed among different orbitals remain
unresolved. Motivated by recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) experiments, we theoretically study the electronic structure of
infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at various doping levels. We find that,
unlike the expectation from a rigid band shift, holes are equally distributed
to Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and interstitial-$s$ orbitals. The role of
interstitial-$s$ orbital is further confirmed from the renormalization of
Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, for which the coupling between interstitial-$s$ and
Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ exerts a non-negligible impact on the orbital-selective
renormalization observed in ARPES. We also discuss the implication of our
results to the single-band model, where the interstitial-$s$ orbital in the
normal state of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ acts as charge donator enhancing the
correlation of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ by increasing its concentration close to
half-filling.

Abstract: The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant
valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore
lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to
further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when
not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices
of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite
doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron
chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA)
is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions
and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D
lattice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors investigate a one-dimensional model to explore its topological phases, which are significant in condensed matter physics and quantum materials, especially with applications in topological quantum computation.

Method: The model is analyzed using exact solvability with Z₂ symmetries, and topological invariants such as the winding number are used to identify phases. Also, zero energy Majorana edge modes are considered as indicators of topological phases.

Result: The model exhibits a CII-class of the 10-fold classification with integer winding numbers, confirming the presence of localized Majorana edge modes and studying phase transitions' scaling properties.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the properties of the 1D Γ-matrix model, emphasizing the understanding of topological phases and their transitions.

Abstract: We study the phases of an exactly solvable one dimensional model with
$4-$dimensional $\Gamma-$matrix degrees of freedom on each site. The
$\Gamma-$matrix model has a large set of competing interactions and displays a
rich phase diagram with critical lines and multi-critical points. We work with
the model with certain $Z_2$ symmetries and identify the allowed symmetry
protected topological phases using the winding number as the topological
invariant. The model belongs to the CII-class of the $10-$fold classification
and allows for integer values of the winding number. We confirm that the system
also hosts localized zero energy Majorana edge modes, consistent with the
integer value of the winding number of the corresponding phase. We further
study scaling and universality behaviour of the various topological phase
transitions.

performance of this setup by measuring hBN encapsulated monolayer graphene

the chemical potential near the charge neutrality point (CNP), consistent with
the linear band dispersion of MLG and interaction-driven renormalization of
Fermi velocity. This work highlights the robust sensitivity and stability of
our system, making it a versatile local probe of quantum phases in van der

Abstract: We have experimentally and theoretically investigated the spin transport in
Fe/Mg/MgO/MgAl2O4/n+-Si(001) ferromagnetic tunnel junctions on a Si substrate,
by systematically varying the thickness combination of amorphous MgO and
MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier layers with a sliding shutter between the evaporation
sources and substrate during electron-beam evaporation. A technical advantage
of MgAl2O4 is that a continuous and flat thin film is realized on a Si
substrate even when the MgAl2O4 thickness is as thin as 0.5 nm, unlike MgO,
which enables us to examine the spin transport in a thinner range of the tunnel
barrier thickness. Our distinct finding is as follows: When the Fe/Mg/MgO
interface is used on the top side, the spin polarization PS of tunneling
electrons increases at 10 K as the total MgO/MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier thickness
(tox = 0.47 - 1.4 nm) is increased, regardless of different thickness
combinations, and PS shows saturation-like behavior when tox is above 1.1 nm.
Since this feature cannot be explained by the well-known conductivity mismatch
in semiconductor-based ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, we propose a simple
phenomenological tunneling model based on two different direct tunneling paths,
which have higher/lower spin polarizations with longer/shorter decay lengths.
Our numerical calculation reproduces the relationship between the spin
polarization PS and total tunnel barrier thickness tox in the experiments,
indicating that the dominant mechanism is an increasing contribution of the
lower spin polarization path as tox is decreased. We discuss possible origins
for this phenomenon including intrinsic and extrinsic tunneling mechanisms. Our
analysis method provides an insight into the detailed spin transport physics in
semiconductor-based ferromagnetic junctions, particularly, with a very thin
tunnel barrier layer.

Motivation: 数据中心中的VRM必须在AI工作负载的波动下提供快速且精确的有功功率调节，这影响到数据中心的能效和系统的稳定性。因此，研究高效的控制方案以提升VRM的调节能力变得尤为重要。

Method: 该论文提出了一种整合线性和非线性控制器的控制方案。首先，通过5S框架构建了电路的精确小信号模型，得出了离散传递函数和根轨迹来直接进行数字设计。其次，针对SCB变流器在重负荷下的周期性电容振荡问题，引入了基于Pontryagins Maximum Principle的时间最优控制策略，以松弛严格的开关序列约束，计算时间最优的开关序列。最后，通过过渡逻辑将小信号控制器和大信号控制器进行融合。

Abstract: Fast-response voltage regulation is essential for data-center Voltage
Regulation Modules (VRMs) powering Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads,
which exhibit both small-amplitude fluctuations and abrupt full-load steps.
This paper introduces a control scheme that integrates a linear controller and
a nonlinear controller for variable-frequency Series-Capacitor Buck (SCB)
converters. First, an accurate small-signal model is derived via a
Switching-Synchronized Sampled State-Space (5S) framework, yielding
discrete-time transfer functions and root-locus insights for direct digital
design. A critical concern for SCB converters is series-capacitor oscillation
during heavy load steps if the strict switching sequence is not maintained. To
accelerate large-signal transients, a time-optimal control strategy based on
Pontryagins Maximum Principle (PMP) relaxes the switching constraints to
compute time-optimal switching sequences. A transition logic is then proposed
to integrate the high-bandwidth small-signal controller and the large-signal
controller. Simulations demonstrate a rapid output voltage recovery under a
heavy load step-up, over ten times faster than a linear controller-only design.
Preliminary hardware tests indicate a stable rejection to heavy load
disturbances with zero steady-state error.

GROMACS, and Python-based analysis tools into a cloud-native library, we
optimized resource allocation tailored to each workflow's needs for scaling up
the PTM-Psi simulation. We employed a ``flow-of-workflow'' approach in which
the cloud architecture supports the computational investigation of a
combinatorial explosion of thiol PTMs on an exemplary protein megacomplex
critical to the Calvin-Benson cycle of light-dependent sugar production in
cyanobacteria. With PTM-Psi on the cloud, we transformed the pipeline for the
thiol PTM analysis to achieve high throughput by leveraging the strengths of
the cloud service. PTM-Psi on the cloud reduces operational complexity and
lowers entry barriers to data interpretation with structural modeling for a
redox proteomics mass spectrometry specialist.

TL;DR: Melanosomes exhibit a fluorescent component whose emission lifetime shortest-lived component discovered. Irradiation significantly alters these lifetimes, indicating structural changes within melanin that occur within minutes and extend up to an hour. The method involved using FLIM to capture these dynamic changes accurately.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Melanosomes are important organelles involved in photoprotection, and understanding the fluorescent properties of their pigments could provide insights into these processes. This paper aims to explore how extended laser irradiation affects the fluorescence of melanins within melanosomes, which could lead to a better understanding of their function under various environmental conditions.

Method: The study employs Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to examine the fluorescent properties of pigments within melanosomes. The technique allows for monitoring dynamic changes in fluorescence emission, such as alterations in the lifetimes upon irradiation, providing time-resolved information about the structural modifications of melanin.

Result: The research discovered that melanin within melanosomes exhibits dynamic fluorescence changes upon extended laser irradiation, with significant variations in fluorescence lifetimes that correlate with structural photoinduced changes. These observations help elucidate the mechanisms by which melanin functions under varying conditions.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that melanosomes' functionality under different environmental conditions, particularly concerning photoprotection, depends critically on the dynamic fluorescence properties of their melanin pigments. This study provides a new perspective on the role of fluorescence in the adaptive responses of melanosomes to environmental changes, opening up opportunities for further exploration of their potential applications in biotechnology and medicine.

Abstract: Melanosomes are organelles found in a wide variety of tissues throughout the
animal kingdom. They contain a variety of biological molecules, but the
dominant constituent is the pigment melanin, and many functions ascribed to
melanosomes, such as photoprotection, are uniquely enabled by the chemical
properties and structures of the melanins they contain. In this report, we
used, for the first time, Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to
examine fluorescent properties of pigments in melanosomes and evaluate their
time evolution upon extended laser irradiation. We discovered a relatively
short-lived component in fluorescence emission and revealed significant changes
in lifetimes upon irradiation indicating structural photoinduced changes to
melanin occurring on a time scale of minutes, with observations extending up to
one hour.

TL;DR: This paper presents an optoplasmonic WGM sensor for detecting neurotransmitters, achieving single-molecule detection at 10 aM sensitivity and distinguishing between similar molecules like GABA and glutamate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of detecting low-concentration neurotransmitters, which is crucial for understanding neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Method: An optoplasmonic WGM sensor hybridized with plasmonic nanospiked antennas is developed. The sensor combines whispering gallery mode resonance and electronic structure calculations to analyze neurotransmitter binding.

Result: The sensor detects neurotransmitters as low as 10 aM, distinguishing structurally similar molecules, and correlates WGM shift with polarizability values from computations.

Conclusion: This sensor offers a novel approach for monitoring neurotransmitter dynamics at ultra-low concentrations, potentially advancing neuroscience and treatment of disorders.

Abstract: Discerning the neurotransmitter dysregulation is a hallmark of neurological
disorders and diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple
sclerosis. The concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft is
particularly low, ranging from nM to fM, which makes it challenging to
accurately monitor changes over the course of a clinical trial using existing
sensing techniques. By means of an advanced whispering gallery mode (WGM)
sensor hybridized with plasmonic nanospiked antennas, we detect and
discriminate between different neurotransmitters at the single-molecule level.
Our results show that the sensor can detect neurotransmitters with exceptional
sensitivity down to 10 aM and discriminate between structurally similar
neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate, over a large number of detection
events. Furthermore, we find that the average WGM resonance shift, induced by a
neurotransmitter binding to the sensor, strongly correlates with molecular
polarizability values obtained from electronic structure calculations. These
findings establish the optoplasmonic WGM sensors as potential biosensor
platform in different avenues of neuroscience by detecting and discriminating
neurotransmitters as well as investigating their dynamics at ultra low-level
concentrations, plausibly contributing to deeper understanding of brain
function and neurological disorders.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种可靠的方法，可替代传统的 glioma 模型，为荧光检测设备的开发提供了新工具。

Abstract: Reliable in-vitro models are used for optoelectronic device development such
as fluorescence detection devices for fluorescence-guided surgery of gliomas. A
common approach is based on inducing gliomas in animal models. This is followed
by a dosage of 5-ALA to induce Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the glioma and which
fluoresces. Although these approaches excel in capturing key biomolecular and
physiological features of the tumour, they are inherently indeterministic. This
limits the scope of their use for preclinical device development, where
consistent and controllable tumour reproduction across multiple animals is
needed. Approaches using fluorescence markers in gelatine provide a simple
replication but fail to capture the complexities of in-vivo models. In this
study, we introduce an exogenous brain tumour model for assessing PpIX
fluorescence detection. The model was developed by injecting a PpIX solution
into the cortical region of a resected adult rat brain, the injection site
simulated a tumoral region with elevated PpIX concentration. The tumoral region
had a gradient of concentrations, with a peak at the centre and a decrease
towards the margins, akin to in-vivo gliomas. The fluorescence profile was
compared to in-vivo conditions using 5-ALA and correlated well with other
reported works, achieving a correlation of R2>0.93. The model's validity was
tested by examining the effect of the solvent, DMSO, on the Autofluorescence
(AF) of the brain sample and the short-term effect of storage on AF was
analysed. Examinations confirmed the solvent did not alter AF, and the brain
sample should be stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and refrigerated to
maintain moisture and preserve AF. The model accurately replicated surgical
fluorescence conditions and offers a suitable alternative to glioma induction,
benefiting the development of fluorescence detection devices across design
iterations.
