This is due to soft modes in the underlying Fermi liquid that lead to long-ranged correlations. These correlations in turn yield a nonanalytic dependence of the free energy on the magnetization even at a mean-field level that results in a fluctuation-induced first-order transition. Kirkpatrick and Belitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 124}, 147201 (2020)] have pointed out that one notable exception are non-centrosymmetric metals with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In such materials the spin-orbit interaction gives the relevant soft modes a mass, which inhibits the mechanism leading to a first-order transition. Miserev, Loss, and Klinovaja [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 106}, 134417 (2022)] have claimed that this conclusion does not hold if electron-electron interactions in the particle-particle channel, or 2$\\kF$ scattering processes, are considered. They concluded that this interaction channel leads to soft modes that are not rendered massive by the spin-orbit interaction and again lead to a first-order quantum phase transition. In this Comment we show that this conclusion is not correct in three-dimensional magnets if the screening of the interaction is properly taken into account."}

While the Shastry-Sutherland lattice permits additional symmetry-allowed fermion bilinears compared to the square lattice, the quantum field theories are identical up to additional irrelevant terms. Consequently, the Higgs potential structure and the leading low-energy theory coincide with the square-lattice case at the quantum critical point. The SO(5) critical point is expected to realize conformal deconfined criticality: we analyze it in a large flavor expansion, calculate its critical exponents, and identify the Yukawa coupling between the fermions and Higgs fields as the relevant perturbation that destabilizes it, consistent with pseudocritical behavior observed in recent Monte Carlo studies. We show that the emergent SO(5) order parameter acquires a large anomalous dimension at the critical point, leading to strongly enhanced Néel and VBS susceptibilities-a hallmark of fermionic deconfined quantum criticality consistent with numerical studies. Our results place recent numerical evidence for a gapless $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within a controlled field-theoretic framework and demonstrate that fermionic deconfined criticality on the square lattice-including critical exponents and stability-extends to frustrated lattices with reduced symmetry."}

We present a comprehensive finite-element study of re-entrant cavity haloscope designs operating in the 100 to 500 MHz range, comparing their performance using effective scan time as a figure of merit. Among the configurations studied, we identify a double attack geometry that achieves a roughly threefold improvement in effective scan time compared to a conventional single-rod re-entrant cavity. We further investigate practical implementation strategies, including a hybrid design employing one fixed rod and one tunable rod, which preserves a scan time gain while reducing mechanical complexity. These results demonstrate a pathway to enhanced low-mass axion haloscope sensitivity."}

These theories produce a constraint equation that follows from the modified Einstein's equations and the contracted Bianchi identity which has no simple solution and raises questions about the consistency of backgrounds structures in extensions to general relativity. In contrast, spontaneous symmetry breaking where fields acquire a vacuum expectation value are shown to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, there are some approaches that consistently implement explicit diffeomorphism breaking by: i) introducing geometrical restrictions which may dynamically restore diffeomorphism invariance, ii) using the Stückelberg formalism where auxiliary scalar fields can carry degrees of freedom associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, and more recently by iii) exploiting the isometries of a given gravitational configuration in the presence of a background; which ultimately requires the background fields to be Lie-dragged along the Killing vectors. In this work, we further develop and apply the latter approach focusing on a concrete example involving the Gödel metric and the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension. We show that the resulting dynamics is fully consistent with the constraint equation and produce new Noether's identities. Furthermore we investigate causality violations by analyzing the critical radius, which is found to depend explicitly on the background fields. This dependence allows for the emergence of both causal and non-causal regions in spacetime."}

In this work, we revisit the identification between the Wilson-Fisher fixed point at integer dimensions and the Ising CFT. We argue that a literal equality between the two theories is incompatible with the emergence of Virasoro symmetry in two dimensions. Instead, we propose that the Ising model emerges only as a subsector of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We support this scenario through a detailed study of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ model and by examining operators transforming in irreducible representations of the orthogonal group whose multiplicities become negative for integer values of the spacetime dimension.

Placing these qubits at surfaces maximizes coupling to nearby spins and fields, enabling nanoscale sensing and facilitating integration with photonic and superconducting devices. However, reducing the dimensions or size of established qubit systems without sacrificing the qubit performance or degrading the coherence lifetime remains challenging. Here, we introduce a surface molecular qubit formed by pentacene molecules scaffolded on a two-dimensional (2D) material, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The qubit exhibits stable fluorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from cryogenic to ambient conditions. With fully deuterated pentacene, the Hahn-echo coherence reaches 22 $μ$s and further extends to 214 $μ$s under dynamical decoupling, outperforming state-of-the-art shallow NV centers in diamond, despite being positioned directly on the surface. We map the local spin environment, resolving couplings to nearby nuclear and electron spins that can serve as auxiliary quantum resources. This platform combines true surface integration, long qubit coherence, and scalable fabrication, opening routes to quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and hybrid quantum devices. It also paves the way for a broader family of 2D material-supported molecular qubits."}

By systematically including correlations beyond the mean-field level, we map the equilibrium phase diagram and identify regimes of coexistence between vortex lattices and multiply charge central vortices. Quench dynamics reveals that macrovortices are robust under changes in rotation or interaction strength, sustaining clean monopole oscillations with well-separated, vorticity-dependent breathing frequencies. In contrast, trap quenches trigger a universal decay process mediated by vortex-phonon coupling, in which rotational energy is progressively transferred to compressible modes until the macrovortex splits into singly quantized vortices. Our results demonstrate that macrovortex lifetimes and decay pathways can be tuned by trap confinement, providing experimentally accessible signatures of vortex-phonon interactions and collective energy transfer in correlated quantum fluids."}

While ODT is well established for imaging thin, weakly scattering samples, it encounters significant challenges when applied to heterogeneous, strongly scattering thick samples such as tissues and organoids. In this work, a novel common-path interferometric approach to ODT is presented, specifically designed for the RI reconstruction of heterogeneous and highly scattering samples at high temporal stability. The proposed technique, termed lateral shearing (LS)-ODT, incorporates partial lateral shearing off-axis interferometry to suppress the effects of multiple scattering, similar to the mechanism in differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, which is widely used for imaging thick specimens. Additionally, the LS-ODT system uses dynamic speckle illumination to enhance both spatial phase and RI sensitivity compared to laser-based ODT systems. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments on a cell phantom. Its robustness and accuracy are further validated across a wide range of samples, including mouse kidney tissue sections and brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in both thin and thick sections. Furthermore, correlative fluorescence and RI tomography of the organoids highlights the potential of LS-ODT to enhance and support a broad spectrum of biomedical studies, particularly in the field of histology."}

Among various bioceramics, Ca-Mg silicates are unique from the viewpoints of osteoinductive and mechanical properties, as well as their outstanding osteoconductive and angiogenic behaviors owing to the release of Si, Ca and Mg. Despite these distinct advantages, different compositions of these bioceramics still require mechanical and biological enhancements for further applications. For this purpose, doping with some ions like F-, Sr2+, Cu2+, Eu2+, Ba+, Ce3+ and some alkali cations has been proved to be a valued approach. This review attempts to bring together areas for the performance improvement of the further researched Ca-Mg silicates (i.e., diopside, akermanite, bredigite and monticellite) and the alteration of these compositions via ion-doping. It is concluded that a correct choice of dopants incorporated at the optimal concentration makes these silicates ideal bone substitutes competing or even superior to calcium phosphates (apatites) and bioglasses which are known as the most prominent bioceramics."}

In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models.

The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport.

We then apply the algorithm to the $\\sf N=6$ cone, analyzing the 6 \"mystery\" extreme rays of the subadditivity cone from arXiv:2412.15364 that satisfy all known holographic entropy inequalities yet lacked graph realizations. We found realizations for 3 of them, proving they are genuine extreme rays of the holographic entropy cone, while providing evidence that the remaining 3 are not realizable, implying unknown holographic inequalities exist for $\\sf N=6$."}

While dimer-monomer bound states are manifested as a single particle attached to dimer bound pair, it is still unclear about quantum walks and Bloch oscillations of dimer-monomer bound states. Here, we revisit three-particle bound states in the Bose-Hubbard model and find that interaction-induced impurities adjacent to bound pair and boundaries cause two kinds of bound states: one is dimer-monomer bound state and the other is bound edge states. In quantum walks, the spread velocity of dimer-monomer bound state is determined by the maximal group velocity of their energy band, which is much smaller than that in the single-particle case. In Bloch oscillations, the period of dimer-monomer bound states is one third of that in the single-particle case. Our works provide new insights to the collective dynamics of three-particle bound states."}

Starting from state-averaged complete active space self consistent field references, this approach produces highly accurate excitation energies for states dominated by a single doubly excited determinant, as well as states in glyoxal and similar molecules where two different doubly excited determinants have large weights. Typical excitation energy errors in both types of states are on the order of 0.15 eV, with the largest observed error being 0.3 eV. These errors stand in stark contrast to equation of motion methods, where typical errors are 4 to 6 eV at the singles and doubles level and 0.4 to 0.8 eV at the full triples level.

The number of pigments in the mutant CPC is identical to that in the wild-type APC, and their spatial arrangements are similar. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the mutant CPC closely resemble those of the wild-type CPC rather than the wild-type APC, indicating that pigment spatial arrangement is not a primary factor in determining the excited-state energy structure. The 2D-ES measurements show that the wild-type CPC retains broad positive signals at 1 ps, signifying incomplete relaxation and persistence of excited vibronic states, unlike APC, which vibrationally relaxes to the bottom of the potential energy surface within the same timeframe. The mutant CPC behaves similarly to the wild-type CPC in the 2D-ES, reinforcing that the pigment number or arrangement is not a dominant factor. Instead, the local pigment-protein interaction governs the electronic structure and relaxation dynamics. Structural analysis reveals that the bent structure of PCB in CPC's α-chain versus the planar structure of PCB in APC. The bent PCB in CPC reduces the degree of π-conjugation, and exhibits excited-state properties distinct from those of the planar structure of PCB in APC.

To overcome this limitation, we introduced a thermocouple assisted active geometry modulation technique. This method mechanically lifts the spreading melt into a liquid bridge via surface tension, optimizing the transmission path length while simultaneously enabling in situ temperature monitoring. The device features a triple fiber coupled laser head with high power density, a precision closed loop Proportional Integral Derivative temperature control system, and an atmosphere controlled vacuum chamber coupled with a mass spectrometer. This integration allows for simultaneous evolved gas analysis, enabling the correlation of structural phase transitions with chemical volatilization or reaction dynamics.

We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition. Remarkably, despite the intrinsically non-equilibrium nature of the steady state, critical charge fluctuations admit an effective-temperature description, $T_{\\text{eff}}(T,V)$, that collapses the steady-state behavior onto its equilibrium form. In sharp contrast, current fluctuations exhibit genuinely non-equilibrium features: the fluctuation-dissipation ratio becomes negative in the ordered phase, corresponding to a negative effective temperature for the current degrees of freedom. These results establish current noise as a sensitive probe of critical fluctuations at non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions and open new directions for exploring voltage-driven critical phenomena in quantum transport systems."}

To cope with such collision and data rates, ALICE uses a new GEM TPC with continuous readout and a GPU-based online computing farm for data compression. Operating the first GEM TPC of this size with large space charge distortions due to the high collision rate has many implications for the track reconstruction algorithm, both anticipated and unanticipated. With real Pb-Pb data available, the TPC tracking algorithm needed to be refined, particularly with respect to improved cluster attachment at the inner TPC region. In order to use the online computing farm efficiently for offline processing when there is no beam in the LHC, ALICE is currently running TPC tracking on GPUs also in offline processing. For the future, ALICE aims to run more computing steps on the GPU, and to use other GPU-enabled resources besides its online computing farm. These aspects, along with better possibilities for performance optimizations led to several improvements of the GPU framework and GPU tracking code, particularly using Run Time Compilation (RTC). The talk will give an overview of the improvements for the ALICE tracking code, mostly based on experience from reconstructing real Pb-Pb data with high TPC occupancy. In addition, an overview of the online and offline processing status on GPUs will be given, and an overview of how RTC improves the ALICE tracking code and GPU support."}

A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \\pm 1.5 °$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet \"surfs\", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications."}

Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-αr^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$.

The imagitivity and Frobenius norm exhibit rapid growth and high late-time plateaus in the ergodic regime, are suppressed in the localized regime, and show intermediate behavior in the fractal phase. The real part of the second Tsallis entropy displays a spectral form factor-like dip-ramp-plateau throughout the chaotic window and a suppressed ramp in the localized regime. We further introduce a kernel negativity, defined as the negative spectral weight of the Hermitian part of the kernel. This negativity equals the trace-norm distance to the set of positive semidefinite operators and the maximal witnessable negative quasiprobability, and its time-averaged value decreases across the ergodic-fractal-localized crossover in close correspondence with the fractal dimension."}

By anchoring spin-active molecules onto hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we eliminate the depth of the quantum sensor while also exhibiting robust spin properties from 4~K to room temperature (RT). The Hahn-echo spin coherence time exceeds \\(T_2 = 3.4~\\upmu\\text{s}\\) at 4~K, outperforming values in bulk organic crystals and overturning the prevailing expectation that spin inevitably deteriorates upon approaching the surface.

For small $α$, the resulting long-range $1d$ XY model exhibits continuous symmetry breaking, in marked contrast to its nearest neighbor counterpart. In this paper, we examine this model near the phase transition at $α_c$ from the lens of the spin stiffness, or superfluid density. We develop a stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation and a generalized winding number estimator to measure the superfluid density in the presence of power-law interactions, which we test against exact diagonalization for small lattice sizes. Our results show how conventional superfluidity in the $1d$ XY model is enhanced in the long-range interacting regime. This is observed as a diverging superfluid density as $α\\rightarrow 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, which we show is consistent with linear spin-wave theory.

Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz."}

Stereoscopic sensing allows plankton to disambiguate flow signals by integrating two spatially separated flow measurements, while a roll about the swimming axis enhances exploration of the three-dimensional space. We show that steer'n roll is efficient, achieving a 100% success rate, versatile across signal type, and robust to flow sensing noise, orientational diffusion, and turbulence.

While the optical readout provides rich topological information, it produces large, sparse megapixel images that challenge real-time triggering, data reduction, and background discrimination.\n  We summarize two complementary machine-learning approaches developed within CYGNO. First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted. On real prototype data, the selected configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with ~25 ms per-frame inference time on a consumer GPU.\n  Second, we report a weakly supervised application of the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) framework to data acquired with an Americium--Beryllium neutron source. Using only mixed AmBe and standard datasets (no event-level labels), a convolutional classifier learns to identify nuclear-recoil-like topologies. The achieved performance approaches the theoretical limit imposed by the mixture composition and isolates a high-score population with compact, approximately circular morphologies consistent with nuclear recoils."}

In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\\dotφ^2=β(φ)V(φ)$, where $β(φ)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches. The slow-roll era is found to be compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data."}

This feedback loop extends existing graph-like ZX extraction and supports modular integration of different extraction algorithms, routing strategies, and target hardware, making it a versatile building block during compilation. To perform numerical evaluations, a reference instance of the scheme is implemented with SWAP-based routing for neutral atom hardware and evaluated using various benchmark collections on small-to mid-scale circuits.

We derive asymptotic expansions of $φ^{(3)}$ in two regimes: the 111-expansion, where all three pairwise distances are large, and the 21-expansion, where one particle is far from the other two. In the 111-expansion, the leading term grows as $\\ln^3(B/a)$ at large hyperradius $B=\\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$. At order $B^{-2}\\ln^{-3}(B/a)$, we identify a three-body parameter $D$ with dimension of length squared, which we term the three-body scattering area. This quantity should be contrasted with the three-body scattering area previously studied for infinite or vanishing two-body scattering length. If the two-body interaction is attractive and supports bound states, $D$ acquires a negative imaginary part, and we derive its relation to the probability amplitudes for the production of two-body bound states in three-body collisions. Under weak modifications of the interaction potentials, we derive the corresponding shift of $D$ in terms of $φ^{(3)}$ and the changes of the two-body and three-body potentials.

Reported values of exchange time are broadly dispersed, about two orders of magnitude. We analyze the measurement technique called Filtered Exchange Imaging (FEXI) using numerical solution of Bloch--Torrey equation in digitalized neurons downloaded from NeuroMorpho.org. The FEXI outcome, the recovery of diffusion coefficient in cells with impermeable membrane is multiexponential, tightly related to the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. Fitting the commonly used exponential recovery function results in a strong dependence of the apparent exchange time on the involved mixing time interval. For short mixing times, exchange time is of the order of 10 ms. It gets an order of magnitude larger for mixing times of a few hundreds of milliseconds. To obtain an estimate of membrane permeability, we reinterpret previously published data on preexchange lifetime in neuronal cell culture. It results in the permeability 0.005 micrometer/ms. The corresponding exchange time is about 140 ms. We conclude that essentially shorter exchange times are due to fast geometric exchange inside the ramified cells."}

The aim of this work is the local controlled delivery of a cardiovascular drug, heparin, loaded onto nitinol treated by electrochemical anodizing and chitosan coating. In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models. Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability assay also showed the non-cytotoxicity of the samples, so that the best performance was found for the chitosan-coated samples.

In this topical review, we discuss recent developments of coupled-wire description in nanoscale systems, where it emerges not only as a theoretical tool but also as a highly tunable physical platform. In these nanoscale realizations, coupled-wire networks are formed by one-dimensional channels embedded in two-dimensional materials, most prominently in moiré and twisted structures. Such networks host a broad range of unconventional states of matter, including superconductivity, charge density waves, spin density waves, Mott insulating phases, Anderson insulating phases, quantum spin Hall states, quantum anomalous Hall states, and their fractionalized counterparts. The ability to electrically control interaction strength, confinement, and coupling between wires makes these systems qualitatively different from earlier realizations and allows continuous tuning between competing phases. Notably, recent work has demonstrated that the coupled-wire framework in moiré networks completes the trio of quantum Hall phenomena, encompassing quantum Hall, quantum spin Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall states, together with their fractional analogues. This development highlights coupled-wire networks in nanoscale materials as a versatile and experimentally relevant setting for exploring the interplay of topology, strong correlations, and low-dimensional physics."}

The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\\left(\\frac{ρ(r)}{ρ_{\\star}}\\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $ρ(r)=\\frac{ρ_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{α^2}\\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\\frac{K_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{α^2}\\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \\pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation."}

Diamond is an especially attractive material for quantum devices because it can host atomic-scale defects that emit single photons and store quantum information with exceptional stability. However, fabricating the optical structures needed to control light in diamond typically relies on slow, bespoke processes that are difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce a manufacturing approach that brings diamond quantum photonics closer to industrial production. Instead of sequentially defining each device by lithography written directly on diamond, we fabricate high-precision silicon masks using commercial semiconductor foundries and transfer them onto diamond via microtransfer printing. These masks define large arrays of nanoscale optical structures, shifting the most demanding pattern-definition steps away from the diamond substrate, improving uniformity, yield, and throughput. Using this method, we demonstrate hundreds of diamond \"quantum microchiplets\" with improved optical performance and controlled interaction with quantum emitters. The chiplet format allows defective devices to be replaced and enables integration with existing photonic and electronic circuits. Our results show that high-quality diamond quantum devices can be produced using scalable, foundry-compatible techniques. This approach provides a practical pathway toward large-scale quantum photonic systems and hybrid quantum-classical technologies built on established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure."}

Ferromagnetism emerges at low fillings from the flat band and persists to stronger interactions and higher fillings via a double-exchange mechanism, where spins align to avoid Hund-rule penalties at the expense of Dirac-fermion kinetic energy. We further argue that the paramagnetic regime is a correlated \"Hund metal.\" $p$-orbital Fermi gases thus provide an ideal experimental setting to investigate competing exchange mechanisms in multi-orbital systems with coexisting localized and itinerant spins."}

However, the experimental validation of robust inter-cell interactions in Moire photonic structures and the modulation of flatbands for specific photonic applications remain challenging. Here, we propose a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity and demonstrate nanolasers enabled by strong flatband coupling. In contrast to a twist-angle Moire cavity, a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity provides a stable flatband frequency and a substantial enhancement in Q factor compared to an isolated single-cell cavity, as the unit-cell size decreases. The photonic band-structure measurement of the small-unit-cell Moire cavity by photoluminescence reveals pronounced flatbands. Cell-resolved spectroscopy further confirms the presence of flatbands by identifying resonant peaks that consistently emerge across unit cells in a Moire cavity with a lattice mismatch of 102 nm, but not in a larger-unit-cell Moire cavity with a mismatch of 60 nm. Furthermore, mode selection is achieved by reducing the center-hole size, thus isolating the hexapole mode from the degenerate dipole modes while maintaining strong inter-cell coupling. Consequently, we demonstrate a low-threshold hexapole flatband laser in a single mode. Therefore, the systematic modification of the relative lattice parameters of the two constituent lattices offers a promising strategy for developing Moire nanolasers and flatband nanophotonic devices."}

While experimental and theoretical methods have advanced our understanding of mechanochemical processes, predicting where energy concentrates within a molecule remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce SITH (Splitting Intramolecular Tension due to stretcHing), a novel method that decomposes the total electronic energy change of a stretched molecule into contributions from individual degrees of freedom -- such as bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals -- using numerical integration of the work-energy theorem. Unlike previous approaches that rely on harmonic approximations, SITH provides high accuracy and robustness to study the distribution of energies of stretched molecules up to a first bond cleavage. Although SITH uses 3N-6 degrees of freedom for the energy decomposition, we show that it can work even for ring structures like prolines. We apply SITH to a dataset of tripeptides and demonstrate that glycine and proline exhibit significantly different energy distributions in their Ca-C backbone bonds under tension: glycine stores more energy, making it more prone to rupture, while proline has the opposite behaviour. These findings reveal intrinsic differences in mechanochemical susceptibility across amino acids, offering more accurate predictions of bond rupture in proteins, and similarly in other (bio)polymers. SITH thus provides a powerful, interpretable tool for understanding energy distribution at the quantum level, with possible implications in mechanochemistry and force field validation."}

Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_χ$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates."}

Multi-angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), which assigns independent parameters to each Hamiltonian operator term, achieves superior approximation performance even with fewer layers than standard QAOA. Unfortunately, this increased expressibility can raise the classical computational cost due to a greater number of parameters. The recently proposed Layerwise MA-QAOA (LMA-QAOA) reduces this overhead by training one layer at a time, but it may suffer from obtaining the precise solution due to the previously fixed parameters. This work addresses two questions for efficient MA-QAOA training: (i) What is the optimal granularity for parameter updates per epoch, and (ii) How can we get precise final cost function results while only partially updating the parameters per epoch? Despite the benefit of reducing the parameters that update per epoch can reduce the classical computation overhead, too fine or coarse a granularity of Hamiltonian update can degrade the MA-QAOA training efficiency. We find that optimizing one complete layer per epoch is an efficient granularity. Moreover, selectively retraining each layer by tracking gradient variations can achieve a final cost function equivalent to the standard MA-QAOA while lowering the parameter update overhead. Based on these insights, we propose Orbit-QAOA, which cyclically revisits layers and selectively freezes stabilized parameters. Across diverse graph benchmarks, Orbit-QAOA reduces training steps by up to 81.8%, reduces approximation ratio error by up to 72x compared to the unified stop condition-applied enhanced LMA-QAOA, and achieves equivalent approximation performance compared to the standard MA-QAOA."}

However, understanding their microscopic exchange Hamiltonian and spin correlations has been hampered by varying sample quality, and poor signal-to-noise in the existing neutron data due to a small Ce$^{3+}$ magnetic dipole moment. In this work, we overcome these challenges and report single-crystal diffuse neutron scattering from hydrothermally grown Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ -- the highest quality crystals obtained to date for the Ce$_2$X$_2$O$_7$ family. In contrast to the broad diffuse scattering observed in Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, we find highly structured diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ featuring strong intensities along the Brillouin zone boundaries.

They exhibit rich magnetic phase diagrams, featuring tricritical and critical end points, due to the competing magnetic interactions and the Ising anisotropy. While conventional thermodynamic probes can identify these critical points in bulk Ising metamagnets, achieving this in the two-dimensional (2D) limit, where enhanced fluctuation effects can substantially modify critical phenomena, remains to be realized. Here, we combine specific heat capacity (C_V) and magnetic circular dichroism measurements to identify these critical points, extract a tricritical exponent, and map out the complete magnetic phase diagram of 2D Ising metamagnetic CrI3. This is achieved in a nanomechanical device of 6-layer CrI3, in which a direct measurement of the temperature derivative of its mechanical resonance frequency gives C_V. The tricritical point is identified by the onset of an abrupt spin-flip transition on one side and, on the other side, by a vanishing specific heat λ-anomaly for a continuous AF phase transition. In contrast, only the spin-flip transition remains near the critical end point. Our results establish nanomechanical calorimetry as a general route to classify metamagnetic phase transitions and to study multicritical phenomena in 2D magnets."}

While the positive $Λ$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $Λ$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case."}

The color--magnetic fields associated with the gluon knot also induce a local chiral condensate, contributing to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the baryon mass. Extending this conjecture to heavy-flavor mesons, we argue that stable flux tubes and gluon knots may also play a role in their internal structure, whereas light-flavor mesons are dominated by alternative confinement mechanisms. Our approach provides a unified, topologically motivated picture linking confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the internal dynamics of baryons and certain mesons, suggesting that gluon knots constitute fundamental infrared degrees of freedom of Yang--Mills theory."}

Using a frequency-shift dynamic matrix and an interaction-resolved dynamic energy-density formalism, we show that the frequency asymmetry cannot generally be ascribed to dipolar effects alone. Instead, once counterpropagating modes differ in their geometric structure along the thickness, interlayer exchange dominates the frequency shift. Applied to representative multilayer systems, we find that the interlayer exchange contribution exceeds dipolar and intralayer exchange effects by up to two to three orders of magnitude over a broad wave-vector range. Our results establish interlayer exchange as the primary mechanism controlling nonreciprocal dispersion in multilayer magnonic systems and provide a quantitative framework for engineering large frequency shifts in nonreciprocal magnonic devices."}

Here, we demonstrate free-space optical modulators based on imprinted BTO metasurfaces with targeted designs for optical and electric field confinement within the active material. With resonances exhibiting high quality factors of up to 200, we demonstrate improved transmission modulation at sub-volt driving amplitudes and frequencies up to 5 MHz. Additional enhancement is achieved via ferroelectric domain alignment, resulting in up to 25 % higher modulation strength compared to the unbiased case and up to 75 % compared to previous demonstrations.

In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models.

SEPT achieves 3.5 dB noise suppression beyond the standard quantum limit, enabling a 2.5-fold increase in imaging throughput or 31% reduction in pump power, while providing an unmatched versatility through the intrinsic compatibility between continuous-wave squeezing and photothermal modulation. We showcase SEPT applications by providing high-precision characterization of nanoparticles and revealing subcellular structures, such as cytochrome c, that remain undetectable under shot-noise-limited imaging.

In the simplest one-dimensional ($1d$) traps, these interactions decay as a power-law with distance $1/r^α$, with a tunable exponent $α$. For small $α$, the resulting long-range $1d$ XY model exhibits continuous symmetry breaking, in marked contrast to its nearest neighbor counterpart. In this paper, we examine this model near the phase transition at $α_c$ from the lens of the spin stiffness, or superfluid density. We develop a stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation and a generalized winding number estimator to measure the superfluid density in the presence of power-law interactions, which we test against exact diagonalization for small lattice sizes. Our results show how conventional superfluidity in the $1d$ XY model is enhanced in the long-range interacting regime. This is observed as a diverging superfluid density as $α\\rightarrow 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, which we show is consistent with linear spin-wave theory. Finally, we define a normalized superfluid density estimator that clearly distinguishes the short, medium, and long-range interacting regimes, providing a novel QMC probe of the critical value $α_c$."}

Recent studies have shown that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can lift these restrictions and enable highly nonlinear spin and charge currents. Here we propose a distinct mechanism for high-harmonic spin pumping that does not rely on spin-orbit interactions. We show that nonlinearities in the adiabatic energy spectrum--rather than SOC itself--constitute the essential ingredient for high-harmonic generation in pumped spin currents. Such nonlinearities can arise in purely magnetic systems when a secondary magnetic order parameter is introduced perpendicular to the cone axis of a precessing magnetic moment. As a result, spin pumping and its higher harmonics emerge even in the complete absence of SOC. Our findings establish a new route to ultrafast spin pumping based solely on magnetic structure and dynamics."}

When gravitational perturbations are quantized as gravitons, the conversion of an initial single photon state gives rise to a superposition of photon and graviton states. We show that the temporal correlations obtained from successive projective measurements on the photon-graviton system violate the LGI. Observation of such a violation would provide a novel avenue for probing the quantum nature of gravity."}

Our approach uses ensembles of noisy QSP circuits combined with measurement-level averaging to suppress random phase errors in Z rotations. Building on this framework, we develop robust QSP algorithms for implementing polynomial functions of Hermitian matrices and for estimating observables, with applications to Hamiltonian simulation, quantum linear systems, and ground-state preparation. We analyze the trade-off between approximation error and hardware noise, which is essential for practical implementation under the stringent depth and coherence constraints of current quantum hardware.

By deriving the paraxial wave equation directly in the time domain from the Helmholtz equation under an adiabatic approximation, the model remains analytically tractable while extending paraxial optics beyond time-invariant backgrounds commonly treated by frequency-domain expansions. The resulting equation preserves a Schrödinger-like structure in the presence of explicit temporal modulation and admits closed-form solutions for ultrashort Gaussian pulses. The framework supports a Green's-function description and an operator-based Hamiltonian formalism, from which an ABCD matrix representation for temporal propagation in time-varying media is obtained. The results demonstrate that temporal modulation provides an active means to control ultrashort pulse dynamics, enabling tailored evolution of pulse characteristics such as temporal width and chirp, with potential applications in ultrafast pulse shaping and a direct connection to temporal wave-packet dynamics."}

The number of pigments in the mutant CPC is identical to that in the wild-type APC, and their spatial arrangements are similar. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the mutant CPC closely resemble those of the wild-type CPC rather than the wild-type APC, indicating that pigment spatial arrangement is not a primary factor in determining the excited-state energy structure. The 2D-ES measurements show that the wild-type CPC retains broad positive signals at 1 ps, signifying incomplete relaxation and persistence of excited vibronic states, unlike APC, which vibrationally relaxes to the bottom of the potential energy surface within the same timeframe. The mutant CPC behaves similarly to the wild-type CPC in the 2D-ES, reinforcing that the pigment number or arrangement is not a dominant factor. Instead, the local pigment-protein interaction governs the electronic structure and relaxation dynamics. Structural analysis reveals that the bent structure of PCB in CPC's α-chain versus the planar structure of PCB in APC. The bent PCB in CPC reduces the degree of π-conjugation, and exhibits excited-state properties distinct from those of the planar structure of PCB in APC. This finding highlights a critical role of the electronic structure governed by the local interaction in ultrafast energy relaxation."}

Ferromagnetism emerges at low fillings from the flat band and persists to stronger interactions and higher fillings via a double-exchange mechanism, where spins align to avoid Hund-rule penalties at the expense of Dirac-fermion kinetic energy. We further argue that the paramagnetic regime is a correlated \"Hund metal.\" $p$-orbital Fermi gases thus provide an ideal experimental setting to investigate competing exchange mechanisms in multi-orbital systems with coexisting localized and itinerant spins."}

A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR)."}

We identify two distinct classes of fixed-point solutions, one of which is ultraviolet attractive and characterized by a vanishing quartic coupling together with finite, interacting gravitational couplings. For a finite region of infrared initial conditions, the RG trajectories remain regular at all scales and approach this fixed point.

SEPT achieves 3.5 dB noise suppression beyond the standard quantum limit, enabling a 2.5-fold increase in imaging throughput or 31% reduction in pump power, while providing an unmatched versatility through the intrinsic compatibility between continuous-wave squeezing and photothermal modulation. We showcase SEPT applications by providing high-precision characterization of nanoparticles and revealing subcellular structures, such as cytochrome c, that remain undetectable under shot-noise-limited imaging.

These theories produce a constraint equation that follows from the modified Einstein's equations and the contracted Bianchi identity which has no simple solution and raises questions about the consistency of backgrounds structures in extensions to general relativity. In contrast, spontaneous symmetry breaking where fields acquire a vacuum expectation value are shown to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, there are some approaches that consistently implement explicit diffeomorphism breaking by: i) introducing geometrical restrictions which may dynamically restore diffeomorphism invariance, ii) using the Stückelberg formalism where auxiliary scalar fields can carry degrees of freedom associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, and more recently by iii) exploiting the isometries of a given gravitational configuration in the presence of a background; which ultimately requires the background fields to be Lie-dragged along the Killing vectors. In this work, we further develop and apply the latter approach focusing on a concrete example involving the Gödel metric and the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension. We show that the resulting dynamics is fully consistent with the constraint equation and produce new Noether's identities. Furthermore we investigate causality violations by analyzing the critical radius, which is found to depend explicitly on the background fields.

In this work, we propose photoacoustic tensile imaging (PATI), a new PA imaging modality enabling quantitative assessment of tensile stress in biological samples. PATI exploits the nonlinear PA response induced by dual-pulse laser excitation to establish a mapping between the applied tension and the increment of the nonlinear PA signal. By varying the temporal delay between the heating and detecting laser pulses, the relationship between tensile force and nonlinear PA characteristics is quantitatively analyzed.

We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition. Remarkably, despite the intrinsically non-equilibrium nature of the steady state, critical charge fluctuations admit an effective-temperature description, $T_{\\text{eff}}(T,V)$, that collapses the steady-state behavior onto its equilibrium form. In sharp contrast, current fluctuations exhibit genuinely non-equilibrium features: the fluctuation-dissipation ratio becomes negative in the ordered phase, corresponding to a negative effective temperature for the current degrees of freedom.

In model~I, a Bondi-type mass model described by the asymptotic mass $μ_c$, horizon mass $μ_H$, and profile slope $λ$, it is found that the absorption cross section increases with steeper $λ$, larger $μ_c$ (especially at higher frequencies), or smaller $μ_H$. The differential scattering cross section in this model shows the strongest dependence on the horizon mass $μ_H$. When $μ_H$ exceeds a critical value for a fixed incoming wave frequency $ω$, no partial wave transmits into the black hole, flattening the differential scattering cross section as a function of angle before it increases again with further increase of $μ_H$. Model~II, which considers a truncated accretion region outside some radius $r_0$, contains a potential well in its effective scattering potential. Its absorption cross section decreases in the low-frequency region as the accretion radius $r_0$ decreases, and more importantly, it shows resonance peaks at the quasibound wave frequencies due to resonances induced by the potential well. The differential scattering cross sections show dips around intermediate scattering angles when the parameters (mainly $μ_H$ and $ω$) are such that the resonantly scattered and non-resonant waves interfere destructively around these angles. In both models, absorption exhibits a zero-absorption band as $ω$ approaches $μ_c$ from above, and in both absorption and scattering, the effects of the parameters are found to diminish in the high-frequency limit."}

A crucial aspect of our analysis is the recognition that the apparent horizon volume is not comoving; this requires a consistent accounting of particle exchange across the moving boundary.

For instance, the work we need to invest in order to implement $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of a quantum channel is quantified by the thermodynamic capacity of the channel when we require the implementation's accuracy to be guaranteed in diamond norm over the $n$-system input. Recent work showed that work extraction can be implemented universally, meaning the same implementation works for a large class of input states, while achieving a variable work cost that is optimal for each individual i.i.d. input state. Here, we revisit some techniques leading to derivation of the thermodynamic capacity, and leverage them to construct a thermodynamic implementation of $n$ i.i.d. copies of any time-covariant quantum channel, up to some process decoherence that is necessary because the implementation reveals the amount of consumed work. The protocol uses so-called thermal operations and achieves the optimal per-input work cost for any i.i.d. input state; it relies on the conditional erasure protocol in our earlier work, adjusted to yield variable work. We discuss the effect of the work-cost decoherence. While it can significantly corrupt the correlations between the output state and any reference system, we show that for any time-covariant i.i.d. input state, the state on the output system faithfully reproduces that of the desired process to be implemented. As an immediate consequence of our results, we recover recent results for optimal work extraction from i.i.d. states up to the error scaling and implementation specifics, and propose an optimal preparation protocol for time-covariant i.i.d. states."}

We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $γ_{\\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 25.91$~K.

As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\\dotφ^2=β(φ)V(φ)$, where $β(φ)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches.

To the best of our knowledge, this formalism had not been previously derived for 5D black holes, including neutral ones. Finally, we show the emergence of Love symmetry in the near-zone regime, and derive the generators of the associated $sl(2,\\mathbb{R})$ algebra. It is shown that all conditions for Love-number vanishing can be explained by this algebra in terms of the highest-weight property."}

The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\\left(\\frac{ρ(r)}{ρ_{\\star}}\\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $ρ(r)=\\frac{ρ_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{α^2}\\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\\frac{K_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{α^2}\\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \\pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation."}

We identify dephasing as the primary mechanism enforcing this symmetry, which can be suppressed by intercomponent phase correlations. Consequently, a sufficient condition for realizing a continuous time crystal is a nonlinear quantum self-sustaining system exhibiting quantum synchronization among its constituents. As a concrete example, we demonstrate spontaneous oscillations in a synchronized array of van der Pol oscillators, corroborated by both semiclassical dynamics and the quantum Liouville spectrum. These results reduce the identification of time crystals in many-body systems to the evaluation of only two-body correlations and provide a framework for classifying uncorrelated time crystals as trivial."}

While the positive $Λ$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $Λ$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case."}

While large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers remain a long-term objective, near- and medium-term systems will support early fault-tolerant computation with small numbers of logical qubits and tight constraints on error rates, connectivity, latency, and classical control.

A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR)."}

In this picture, the GW acts as a coherent background that induces inelastic energy exchanges with the electromagnetic field - analogous to the Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts in Raman spectroscopy. We propose a detection scheme sensitive to this microscopic mechanism based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We show that the scattering-induced phase shifts render frequency-entangled photon pairs distinguishable, spoiling their destructive quantum interference. GW signal is thus encoded in the modulation of photon coincidence rates rather than classical field intensity, offering a complementary quantum probe of the gravitational universe that recovers the standard classical response in the macroscopic limit."}

We found a secondary splitting of Autler-Townes splitting in the probing field transmission spectra, which could be understood by the effective Hamiltonian derived with multi-mode Floquet theory. The Frequency mixing scheme developed here enables continuous tunablity of the resonant frequency between upper levels, which facilitates the broad band sensing of AC field. Furthermore, by introducing an additional periodic driving, we realize an effective model that two distinct quantum interference effects coexist: interference among Floquet channels and loop interference arising from closed coherent pathways. Both interference effects could be read out from the transmission spectra independently. The changing of the distance between double splitting peaks represents the interference of Floquet channels, while their asymmetric linewidth broadening is linked with the total effective phase of the loop. This not only provides complementary readout for extracting the phase of AC field, but also establishes a new paradigm for coherent control in multi-level quantum systems."}

Working first in the ghostly two-dimensional Hamiltonian formulation, we construct differential intertwiners that generate a spectrum-generating algebra acting on the generalised eigenspaces of the Hamiltonian. This algebra organises the generalised eigenvectors into finite Jordan chains and closes into a hidden $su(2)$ Lie algebra that exists only at resonance.\n  We then show that quantising a classically equivalent Hamiltonian yields a radically different quantum theory, with a fully diagonalisable spectrum and genuine degeneracies.

We estimate the prevalence of different forms of error such as coherent error and control qubit leakage, then apply error suppression strategies based on the most significant sources of error, making use of pulse-shaping and additional compensating gates. These techniques require no additional hardware overhead and little additional calibration, making them suitable for routine adoption. An average reduction of 3.7x in error rate for two qubit operations is shown across a chain of 16 qubits, with the median error rate improving from 4.6$\\%$ to 1.2$\\%$ as measured by interleaved randomized benchmarking.

For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $τ(N)=Θ(\\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics. We optimize the search time as a function of the hopping amplitude, detection rate, and resetting rate, and identify the conditions under which time complexity could outperform Grover's scaling. The overall search time does not violate Grover's optimality bound when including the time budget of the physical implementation of the measurement. For databases of finite sizes monitoring can warrant rapid convergence and provides a promising avenue for fault-tolerant quantum searches."}

We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $γ_{\\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 25.91$~K. This hybrid framework provides a quantitative connection between accessible spectroscopic observables and the dominant noise mechanisms limiting coherent optical control in mechanically decoupled quantum emitters, exemplified in hBN and generalizable to similar emitters in other materials."}

In this paper, we introduce a post-selected quantum metrology scenario where the initial state, the dynamics associated with the phase shift, and the post-selection are all inspired by the Hardy paradox. Specifically, we identify an anomalous weak value that is characteristic of both the Hardy paradox and the potential enhancement of sensitivity by the post-selection.

Starting from the quantisation of the electromagnetic field and the bosonic formalism of Fock space, the notes develop a unified framework for describing and analysing quantum states of light. Key families of states -- thermal, coherent, and squeezed -- are introduced as paradigmatic examples illustrating the transition from classical to nonclassical behaviour. The concepts of convexity, classicality, and quasiprobability representations are presented as complementary tools for characterising quantumness and defining operational notions such as P-nonclassicality. The discussion extends naturally to Gaussian states, composite systems, and continuous-variable entanglement, highlighting how nonclassicality serves as a resource for generating and quantifying quantum correlations. Theoretical developments are complemented by computational and experimental perspectives, including simulations of optical states using the Python library Strawberry Fields and data analysis from simulated data.

We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, circumventing transport in mediating states. The distributions thus created can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting, and the pathways contributing to photon emission events can be classified by tuning filtering parameters. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources and multidimensional photon counting allow promising applications to spectroscopy and sensing."}

Working first in the ghostly two-dimensional Hamiltonian formulation, we construct differential intertwiners that generate a spectrum-generating algebra acting on the generalised eigenspaces of the Hamiltonian. This algebra organises the generalised eigenvectors into finite Jordan chains and closes into a hidden $su(2)$ Lie algebra that exists only at resonance.\n  We then show that quantising a classically equivalent Hamiltonian yields a radically different quantum theory, with a fully diagonalisable spectrum and genuine degeneracies.

In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC.

More broadly, this work provides a theoretical framework to assess the applicability of mixed-precision arithmetic in machine-learning approaches that rely on MCMC sampling.

For the free particle, quantum fluctuations induce measurable phase shifts in azimuthal precession of approximately 8-12%, with uncertainty growth rates proportional to initial moment correlations. When a non-central Makarov potential is introduced, quantum corrections dramatically amplify its asymmetry. For strong coupling ($γ$ = -1.9), the quantum-corrected force drives trajectories preferentially toward the southern hemisphere on timescales 40% shorter than classical predictions, with trajectory densities exhibiting up to 3-fold enhancement in the preferred region. Throughout evolution, the solutions rigorously satisfy Heisenberg uncertainty relations, validating the truncation scheme.

This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids. We demonstrate the method on weakly dipole-coupled lattices, recovering ground-state energies, covariance matrices, and spectral gaps accurately.

Quench dynamics reveals that macrovortices are robust under changes in rotation or interaction strength, sustaining clean monopole oscillations with well-separated, vorticity-dependent breathing frequencies. In contrast, trap quenches trigger a universal decay process mediated by vortex-phonon coupling, in which rotational energy is progressively transferred to compressible modes until the macrovortex splits into singly quantized vortices.

Shankaranarayanan"], "title": "Gravitational wave detection via photon-graviton scattering and quantum interference", "comment": "23 pages, 6 figures, comments welcome", "summary": "We present a fully quantum field-theoretic framework for gravitational wave (GW) detection in which the interaction is described as photon-graviton scattering. In this picture, the GW acts as a coherent background that induces inelastic energy exchanges with the electromagnetic field - analogous to the Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts in Raman spectroscopy. We propose a detection scheme sensitive to this microscopic mechanism based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We show that the scattering-induced phase shifts render frequency-entangled photon pairs distinguishable, spoiling their destructive quantum interference. GW signal is thus encoded in the modulation of photon coincidence rates rather than classical field intensity, offering a complementary quantum probe of the gravitational universe that recovers the standard classical response in the macroscopic limit."}

While recent demonstrations of quantum nonlinear microscopy show sub-shot-limited sensitivity, they are intrinsically limited by availability of high peak-power squeezed light sources. Here, we introduce squeezing-enhanced photothermal (SEPT) microscopy, a quantum imaging technique that leverages twin-beam quantum correlations to detect absorption induced signals with unprecedented sensitivity. SEPT achieves 3.5 dB noise suppression beyond the standard quantum limit, enabling a 2.5-fold increase in imaging throughput or 31% reduction in pump power, while providing an unmatched versatility through the intrinsic compatibility between continuous-wave squeezing and photothermal modulation. We showcase SEPT applications by providing high-precision characterization of nanoparticles and revealing subcellular structures, such as cytochrome c, that remain undetectable under shot-noise-limited imaging. By combining label-free contrast, quantum-enhanced sensitivity, and compatibility with existing microscopy platforms, SEPT establishes a new paradigm for molecular absorption imaging with far-reaching implications in cellular biology, nanoscience, and materials characterization."}
