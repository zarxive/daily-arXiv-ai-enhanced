The source delivers\na continuous flux up to 4.9(5)x10^9 atoms/s, with a transverse temperature of\n94(5) microK, a longitudinal temperature as low as 231(65) microK, and a\ntunable mean velocity between 5 and 20 m/s. Custom in-vacuum mirrors integrate\nthe reflective geometry for the off-axis OM beams with a 0.8 mm output\naperture, ensuring stable alignment while suppressing stray light and\nfluorescence leakage. Ultra-low light shift and decoherence are verified via\ncontinuous Raman-Ramsey interferometry, yielding a light shift of -0.51(4)Hz\nand a typical fringe contrast of 90.85(30)% at a Raman separation of 100 mm\n(interrogation time of 8.70 ms).

If\none wishes to explain such correlations by classical means, a natural\npossibility is to allow communication between the parties. In particular, LHV\nmodels augmented with two bits of classical communication can explain the\ncorrelations of any two-qubit state. Would this still hold if communication is\nrestricted to measurement outcomes? While in certain scenarios with a finite\nnumber of inputs the answer is yes, we prove that if a model must reproduce all\nprojective measurements, then for any qubit-qudit state the answer is no. In\nfact, a qubit-qudit under projective measurements admits an LHV model with\noutcome communication if and only if it already admits an LHV model without\ncommunication. On the other hand, we also show that when restricted sets of\nmeasurements are considered (for instance, when the qubit measurements are in\nthe upper hemisphere of the Bloch ball), outcome communication does offer an\nadvantage. This exemplifies that trivial properties in standard LHV scenarios,\nsuch as deterministic measurements and outcome-relabelling, play a crucial role\nin the outcome communication scenario."}

We identify two distinct types of noise-induced\nDTCs on Kagome and Lieb lattices, both arising from quantum noise in ancilla\nqubits. Type-I DTCs originate from robust boundary-mode period-doubling\noscillations, stabilized by symmetry charge pumping, that are redistributed\ninto the bulk due to ancilla noise. Type-II DTCs, in contrast, emerge in\nsystems without charge-pumped qubits, where quantum noise unexpectedly\nstabilizes period-doubling oscillations that would otherwise rapidly decay. On\nthe noisier Eagle device (ibm_kyiv), we observe both type-I and type-II DTCs on\n53-qubit Kagome lattices with and without charge-pumped qubits, respectively.\nIn contrast, on the lower-noise Heron device (ibm_marrakesh), period-doubling\noscillations are confined to boundary-localized oscillations on 82-qubit Kagome\nand 40-qubit Lieb lattices, as redistribution into the bulk is suppressed.\nThese experimental findings are supported by noisy matrix-product-state\nsimulations, in which ancilla noise is modeled as random sign flips in the\ntwo-qubit gate rotation angles.

Small, low-noise quantum processors connected through\nrelatively noisy quantum links are capable of fault-tolerant operation as long\nas the noise can be confined to the interface. Finding protocols that implement\nthe quantum links between modules as efficiently as possible is essential\nbecause inter-module entanglement is challenging to produce at a similar rate\nand fidelity as local entanglement. We introduce a protocol for lattice surgery\non surface codes in which all non-local operations are Bell measurements. The\nprotocol simultaneously confines the link noise and requires only half as many\nmodule-crossing gates as previously proposed protocols. To mitigate\ndistance-reducing hook errors, we introduce a strategy of alternating the gate\nsequence between rounds of syndrome measurement, which prevents multiple hooks\nfrom simultaneously aligning with a logical operator in the code. We evaluate\nour protocol's performance when two logical qubits on separate modules are\nprepared in a logical Bell state. Circuit-level simulations under depolarizing\nnoise show that the logical error suppression for a given entanglement rate\nbetween modules is consistently stronger compared to the best-performing\nalternative protocols for a wide range of link noise, with a typical 40%\nentanglement resource saving for a constant logical error rate.

It has\nsignificant applications in modern physics, including band structure\nengineering, phase transition dynamics, quantum metrology, and more. Dilute-gas\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs), in which self-trapping can arise from\ninteratomic interactions, are a prime testbed for probing nonlinear dynamics.\nIn this Letter, we report the observation of self-trapping in a spin-orbit\ncoupled BEC subjected to a stationary optical lattice. We employ Raman-induced\nspin-orbit coupling, complemented by a matching optical lattice that\nfacilitates coupling between momentum eigenstates of the spin-orbit coupled\nsystem. By ramping the Raman detuning, we probe atomic current flow between\nthese eigenstates and identify a clear distinction between a delocalized mixed\nstate and a self-trapped regime. Following a quench of the Raman detuning, the\ntime-averaged atomic current exhibits non-analytic behavior across the\ntransition between these two regimes in certain parameter ranges, signaling a\ndynamical phase transition in the system."}

We present\nbidirectional nonlinear optical tomography (BNOT), a direction-aware metrology\nthat uses forward and backward pumping of complementary nonlinear probes, with\nprocess-appropriate detection, to break the ``degeneracy'' of $\\eta_1\\eta_2$\nand estimate individual interface efficiencies with tight confidence intervals.\nThe method links off-chip measurements to on-chip quantities through a compact\nobservation model that explicitly incorporates pump fluctuations and detector\nnoise, and it frames efficiency extraction as a joint constrained optimization.\nMonte Carlo studies show unbiased convergence of the estimated efficiencies to\nground truth with low error across realistic operating regimes. Using these\nefficiency estimates to reconstruct on-chip nonlinear figures of merit yields\ndistributions centered on the true values with reduced variance, whereas\nconventional ``degenerate'' calibration is biased and can substantially\nmisestimate on-chip performance.

Dimensional dependence is\nobserved: in $d>5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases\nmonotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in\n$d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive\nthermodynamic properties. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the W\nstate exhibits higher robustness in preserving coherence, whereas the GHZ state\nshows greater resistance to measurement uncertainty increase induced by Hawking\nradiation. Notably, the two scenarios yield qualitatively distinct behaviors:\nquantum coherence is consistently lower in Scenario 1 (quantum memory near\nhorizon) than in Scenario 2 (measured particle near horizon), irrespective of\nthe quantum state.

This study presents a systematic approach to characterize\nand mitigate the effects of such disorder. We utilize finite element modeling\nof a Si/SiGe double quantum dot to generate a large statistical ensemble of\ndevices, simulating the impact of trapped interface charges.
