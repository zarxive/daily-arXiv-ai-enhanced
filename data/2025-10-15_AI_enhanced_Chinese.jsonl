We develop a compact Hilbert space description for one-dimensional\nelastic chains, expressing intra-cell motion as a normalized superposition of\northogonal eigenstates and tracking complex amplitudes as trajectories on a\nBloch sphere. For diatomic lattices, this framework makes inversion symmetry\nprotection explicit: the relative phase between in-phase and out-of-phase modes\nis piecewise locked, and the Zak phase is quantized with band-dependent jumps\nat symmetry points. Extending the analysis to triatomic lattices shows that\nrestoring inversion retains quantization, whereas breaking it dequantizes the\ngeometric phase while leaving the spectral origin invariant. Viewing\nnorm-preserving transformations of the modal coefficient pair as Bloch sphere\nrotations, we demonstrate classical analogues of single-qubit logic gates. A\npi-phase rotation about a transverse axis swaps the modal poles, and a\nlongitudinal-axis phase flip maps balanced superpositions to their conjugates.\nThese gate-like operations are realized by controlled evolution across\nwavenumber space and can be driven or reprogrammed through spatiotemporal\nstiffness modulation. Introducing space-time modulation hybridizes carrier and\nsideband harmonics, producing continuous phase winding and open-path geometric\nphases accumulated along the Floquet trajectory. Across static and modulated\nregimes, the framework unifies algebraic and geometric viewpoints, remains\nrobust to gauge and basis choices, and operates directly on amplitude-phase\ndata.

They are caused by the\ninteraction between the longitudinal dynamics, governed by the tesseral\nharmonics of the geopotential, and the orbital precession forced by Earth's\noblateness and lunisolar perturbations. The transitions are extremely sensitive\nto small perturbations, making the long-term evolution unpredictable. Recently,\na Monte Carlo analysis of trajectories starting in the immediate vicinity of\nthe 165 degrees E unstable equilibrium point, revealed that the evolution to\nchaos is not gradual. It occurs via sudden episodes of disorder at specific\npoints of the precession cycle, when the orbital inclination is minimal. Due to\nthe high cost of the statistical analysis, the results were limited to a single\ninitial longitude. This paper applies modified versions of the diameter\nLagrangian descriptor to reduce the computational burden. This enables mapping\nthe dynamical behavior over the complete range of longitudes where transitions\nbetween modes of motion are possible, considering both unstable equilibrium\npoints (165 degrees E and 15 degrees W). It is found that the episodes of chaos\nremain linked to the orbital inclination cycle, but their timing depends on the\ninitial spacecraft longitude. As the initial position moves farther away from\nthe unstable point, the transitions take place at higher values of the orbital\ninclination.

A hallmark of our construction is that the effective\nradius of an electric point charge can be reduced arbitrarily by tuning a\ncoupling parameter, thereby achieving scales far below the Born--Infeld bound\nand consistent with the experimentally undetected size of the electron. The\nmodels preserve finite self energy for point charges while energetically\nexcluding monopoles and dyons, a robustness that appears intrinsic to this\nclass of nonlinear theories. Two complementary behaviors are uncovered: In the\nnon-polynomial perturbations, the Maxwell limit is not recovered as the\ncoupling vanishes, whereas in polynomial models the self energy diverges\ncorrectly, meaning that the Maxwellian ultraviolet structure is reinstated. A\nfurther subtlety emerges in the distinction between the prescribed source\ncharge, imposed through the displacement field, and the measurable free charge\narising from the induced electric field. In particular, the free charge and the\nself energy contained within any ball around the point charge tend to zero in\nthe strong-nonlinearity or zero effective-radius limit, rendering a pointlike\nstructure locally undetectable, both electrically and energetically.

Strikingly, we show that materials with a positive index at real\nfrequencies can act as negative-index materials under complex frequency\nexcitation. Using our approach, we numerically demonstrate the optical\nantimatter functionality, as well as double focusing by an ideal perfect lens\nand superscattering.

Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires\nconsideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial\ndistribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing\nnon-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution,\nand degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise\nobservation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ\nneutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of\nview 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and\ndistribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature\naccelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission\nattenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the\ntwo stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating\nnon-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss\nand liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying.\nFurther analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron\ntransmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of\nhydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying\ndoes not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively\ndecoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal\nthat high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while\nlow EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss.

A key application\nof NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among\nmetals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and\nelectrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies.\nHowever, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their\nquantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered\ndiamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with\ndifferent energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum\nproperties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films.

In this paper we explicitly derive the low energy\ntheory of phenomenologically viable supersymmetric theories in five dimensions,\nand highlight several aspects of these models that are not obvious from working\nsolely in the 4d effective theory. Important deviations arise for anomaly\nmediation, which is purported to be a predictive mechanism to mediate\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) breaking that is naturally most relevant in extra\ndimensional theories. Despite this, most analyses of anomaly mediation have\nbeen performed in the 4d effective theory. We fill this gap in the literature\nby constructing stabilized supersymmetric theories in 5d and studying\nsupersymmetry breaking and anomaly mediation. Studying Sequestered Conformal\nAnomaly-Mediated (SCAM) in full generality reveals important deviations from\nthe 4d EFT expectations, particularly for the role of boundary superpotentials,\nthe radion and the predicted universality of anomaly mediation. We discuss the\nrequirements for viable extra dimensional models of SUSY-breaking, and\ndemonstrate when and how the anomaly-mediated masses in 5d reduce to the\nna{\\i}ve 4d supersymmetric result. In many cases supersymmetry is necessarily\nbroken at the 5d level, leading to anomaly-mediated and other supersymmetry\nbreaking masses that are not derivable in a simple supersymmetric 4d EFT, but\nneed to be included as matching corrections.

In the small deformation limit, the coupled\nelectroporation, electrohydrodynamics and membrane mechanics are solved. The\nexcess membrane area generated by electroporation manifests as amplitudes of\nthe second, fourth, and sixth Legendre modes, P2(cos{\\theta}), P4(cos{\\theta}),\nand P6(cos{\\theta}), respectively, which serves as the shape function. The\nproposed model reveals that accentuated deformation in GUVs under strong pulsed\nDC fields arises from the additional surface area introduced by membrane\nporation.

Subsequently, theoretical studies showed that other alkali\nions solvate in a similar manner but no experimental results were reported so\nfar. Here, we extend the previous measurement on Na$^+$ to Li$^+$ and K$^+$\nions. A pump pulse selectively ionizes an alkali atom, initially residing at\nthe droplet surface, and the ensuing solvation dynamics of the formed alkali\ncation, Ak$^+$, is followed by ionizing a Xe atom, located in the droplet\ninterior, and recording the yields of Ak$^+$He$_n$ ions expelled from the\ndroplet as a function of the pump-probe pulse delay. We find that Li$^+$,\nNa$^+$ and K$^+$ ions solvate with a binding rate of 1.8 $\\pm$ 0.1, 1.8 $\\pm$\n0.1 and 1.7 $\\pm$ 0.1 He per ps, respectively. Furthermore, by comparing the\nnumber distribution of the Ak$^+$He$_n$ ion yields to the evaporation energies\nof these ion--He complexes, obtained by Path Integral Monte Carlo calculations,\nwe identify signatures of the first solvation shells of Li$^+$, Na$^+$ and\nK$^+$.

By employing\ncounter-propagating probe and coupling beams, we create a plane of atoms in a\ndark state that is sensitive to incident mmWave and demonstrate the method with\nmmWaves resonant with the transition between two neighboring Rydberg states at\n91.4 giga hertz. Objects in the mmWave beam path affect the spatial profile of\nthe mmWave field, which, in turn, leads to spatial variation of optical\nfluorescence at 780 nm. This results in a transduction of the mmWave spatial\nprofile to an optical image that can be acquired by a CCD camera.

We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the\nbounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for\nequally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts.\nOur analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced\nmodes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or\nenhance constraints on GR deviations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\uff08GR\uff09\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u56de\u54cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u573a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5GR\u5728\u56de\u54cd\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u5426\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u573a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fee\u6b63\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u6269\u5c55GR\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u989d\u5916\u573a\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u989d\u5916\u573a\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u56de\u54cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u5b83\u4eec\u624d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9650\u5236GR\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3GR\u548c\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u3002"}}

As an application we study the non-unitary dynamics of a\nlossy or driven-dissipative BCS superconductors, evolving in presence of\ntwo-body losses and two-body pumps. We show that the non-Hermitian limit acts\nas a singular limit of the hybrid dissipative dynamics, leading to a sharp\nmodification of the universal approach to the driven-dissipative steady-states.\nBy considering the dissipative dynamics with pair losses, we show that, as the\nnon-Hermitian limit is approached, the density dynamics sharply evolves from a\nuniversal power-law to exponential decay that converges towards a quasi-steady\nplateau characterized by the freezing of the particle depletion due to pair\nlosses.

Metasurface-based platforms offer unique advantages\nbecause of their compact design, energy efficiency, and the ability to\nprecisely manipulate light at the subwavelength scale, in a contact-less\nfashion. However, achieving both high transmission modulation and low optical\nloss in the telecom band remains a challenge. This study develops monolithic\nand hybrid metasurfaces based on the phase change material antimony trisulfide\n(Sb$_2$S$_3$) to address this limitation. First, we demonstrate the capability\nof Sb$_2$S$_3$ to offer up to ~91 percent modulation, even with a magnetic\ndipole - a low-Q resonance. It lifts the requirement for complex precisely\nfabricated metasurfaces, a long-standing limitation in the community for all\noptical switching. Furthermore, with the most straightforward hybridisation\napproach, i.e. depositing a thin film of silicon, we improved the simulated\nmodulation depth to 99 percent. Experimentally, over 80 percent modulation was\nachieved for both hybrid and monolithic structures, with nearly 2-fold less\npower required for switching in the hybrid design whilst maintaining high\nmodulation depth. This performance results from the significant refractive\nindex tunability of Sb$_2$S$_3$ and its intrinsically low optical loss (k <\n10^{-4}) in the telecom band, further enhanced by silicon integration.

The prevailing understanding is\nthat the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long\nmean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size,\nthereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat\neffectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann\ntransport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture\nmode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon\npopulations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near\nNHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of\nlong-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons\nheat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient\nnear the NH and thereby enhancing TR. By resolving the spectral contributions\nto the phonon transport resistance and temperature gradients, we identify the\ncritical role of the modal specific heat in nonlocal phonon transport.

While transversal gates offer an efficient method for\nimplementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially\nlowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available\nthreshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and\nlimited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the\nnegative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the\nstatistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical\ncircuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a\ntransversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of\ntwo independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip\nerrors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech\nmodel is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show\nthat the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$,\na $26\\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of\nsyndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body\nIsing model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error\nthreshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the\nspread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$.

In studies of magnetic transport, for\nexample in magnetic diffusion, the conservation of energy and momentum is then\nneglected. In this paper, we investigate the details and the consistency of\nthis so-called $\\textit{probe limit}$ in different parametric regimes of MHD\nplasmas. In the first part of the paper, our discussion explores the\nhydrodynamic (higher-form) theory of MHD. In the second part, we then\nexplicitly test the probe limit by using a microscopic holographic (AdS/CFT)\nmodel of a strongly coupled plasma. In the process, we develop the holographic\nSchwinger-Keldysh EFT prescription for describing the bulk 2-form fields and\ntheir dual 1-form symmetries. Moreover, we find evidence of a phase transition\nat low temperatures and show that magnetic Hall transport can emerge as a\nconsequence of background charge density that breaks the charge conjugation\nsymmetry of the state.

This\nstudy investigates the impact of long-term delays on the scientific\ncapabilities of next-generation detector networks. We use the Fisher\ninformation formalism to simulate the performance of a set of detector networks\nfor large, fiducial populations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars,\nand primordial black-hole binaries. Bootstrapping the simulated populations, we\nmap the expected observation times required to reach a number of observations\nfulfilling scientific targets for key sensitivity and localization metrics\nacross various network configurations. We also investigate the sensitivity to\nstochastic backgrounds. We find that purely sensitivity-driven metrics such as\nthe signal-to-noise ratio are not strongly affected by delays between\nfacilities. This is contrasted by the localization metrics, which are very\nsensitive to the number of detectors in the network and, by extension, to\ndelayed observation campaigns for a detector. Effectively, delays in one\ndetector behave like network-wide interruptions for the localization metrics\nfor networks consisting of two next-generation facilities. We examine the\nimpact of a supporting, current-generation detector such as LIGO India\noperating concurrently with next-generation facilities and find such an\naddition will greatly mitigate the negative effects of delays for localization\nmetrics, with important consequences on multi-messenger science and stochastic\nsearches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u5dee\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u53d7\u65f6\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u65f6\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e8c\u53f0\u65b0\u4e16\u4ee3\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u52a0\u5165\u73b0\u4e16\u4ee3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982LIGO India\uff09\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\u5dee\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5982\u672a\u6765\u751f\u6210\u7684 facilities \u9700\u8981\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u534f\u8c03\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u5dee\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u65bd\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528 Fisher \u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3001\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\uff09\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u62bd\u6837\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6b8b\u7f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230\u5173\u952e\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6307\u6807\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u751f\u4ee3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982 LIGO India\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u4e16\u4ee3\u8bbe\u65bd\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5dee\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\u76f8\u5f53\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e8c\u53f0\u65b0\u4e16\u4ee3\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u52a0\u5165\u73b0\u751f\u4ee3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9274\u4e8e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u9700\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u53f0\u65b0\u4e16\u4ee3\u8bbe\u65bd\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u589e\u52a0\u73b0\u751f\u4ee3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u9879\u76ee\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Here we\npresent the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal\ndifferential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal\nmeasurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and\nthe large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a\nswitch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the\ninduced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo\nsinglet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve\ngate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance,\nidentifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations\nof quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and\nseries-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and\ncan be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the\nfeasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust\nnonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating\ntemperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap,\nthereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the\nsuitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial\nKitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially\nlarger topological gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper demonstrates the use of lead-hybrid nanowires for topological superconductivity, highlighting their superior performance compared to aluminum-based counterparts.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this work is the quest for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing using Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The design of hybrid superconductor-semiconductor (SC-SM) nanowires is a promising platform for realizing these exotic states of matter, particularly considering recent advancements in artificial Kitaev chains. The use of lead (Pb) as the superconducting component is chosen due to its bulk superconducting gap and critical temperature, which offer unique advantages in proximity effects and the generation of large gate-tunable superconducting gaps.", "method": "The researchers developed three-terminal Pb-hybrid nanowire devices and employed nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy to investigate the electronic properties. This experimental setup allowed them to probe the proximity-induced superconducting gaps and the Andreev bound states (ABSs) within the system. They also utilized a gate-tuning technique to manipulate the system's parameters and observe how these changes affect the physical properties. The theoretical part of the study focused on understanding the behavior of ABSs and their interaction with quantum dots (QDs).", "result": "The key findings include the observation of a dual-gap structure: the parent Pb gap and a large, tunable induced superconducting gap. The researchers successfully identified Andreev bound states within the induced gap and observed their singlet-doublet transitions. By applying gate voltages, they achieved control over the resonating sign of the nonlocal conductance, identifying distinct quantum-dot resonance regimes (single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Additionally, they demonstrated that the coupling between ABSs and QDs could be adjusted from weak to strong coupling limits. Importantly, the nonlocal signatures were observed to persist up to temperatures as high as ~1K, significantly higher than the operating temperatures of Al-based devices. This result opens up the possibility of implementing high-temperature topological quantum devices and artificial Kitaev chains using Pb-based hybrids.", "conclusion": "This study establishes lead-hybrid nanowires as a robust platform for exploring topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. The large gate-tunable superconducting gap in Pb devices, combined with their high operating temperature, makes them a promising candidate for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing, especially considering the potential for implementing warm-temperature artificial Kitaev chains."}}

The model exhibits the three main domination epochs\nin the Universe, as well as a non-trivial impact on the late-time de Sitter\nattractor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u6307\u6570$f(Q)$\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6458\u8981\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408B\"ohmer\u7b49\u4eba2023\u5e74\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4fee\u6539\u8fc7\u7684 Friedmann\u65b9\u7a0b\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7531\u4e8e$f(Q)$\u662f\u6307\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u8d8a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u7a0b\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u968f\u540e\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u70b9\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027dark\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0edark\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u8868\u5f81\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u665a\u2161\u578bde Sitter\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u76f4\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u5f81\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6307\u6570$f(Q)$\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86B\"ohmer\u7b49\u4eba2023\u5e74\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4fee\u6539\u8fc7\u7684Friedmann\u65b9\u7a0b\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6307\u6570$f(Q)$\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u8868\u5f81\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u5982\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001 dark\u80fd\u91cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u6e21\u65f6\u671f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728 late-time \u7684 de Sitter \u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u540e\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u6570$f(Q)$\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u5f81\u65f6\u671f\u548c\u5176\u540e\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u5185\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3 de Sitter \u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u91ca\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u4e0b\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3002"}}
