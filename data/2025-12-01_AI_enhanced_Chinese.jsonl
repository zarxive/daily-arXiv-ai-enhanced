It was predicted some thirty years ago that a single photon traversing a beam splitter could violate a Bell inequality.

We violate a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other, making it self-referential. We observe CHSH parameters of $2.71\\pm 0.09$ and $2.23\\pm 0.07$, depending on the joint measurements implemented.

This approach enables rapid device-wide generation of high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates, which are combined with standard calibrated gates to produce an expanded gate set. We show how these gates are directly usable as part of a quantum compiler, synthesizing generic two-qubit circuit blocks into minimal-duration sequences of the characterized gates interleaved with compensating single-qubit rotations. Benchmarking against circuits compiled using the default $CX$ gate alone on 127-qubit IBM hardware shows up to 7X improvement in success probability for Quantum Fourier Transform circuits up to 26 qubits, and up to 9X lower mean-square error in Trotter simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model.

As this platform allows for a precisely tunable anisotropy parameter, the model exhibits a rich landscape of phase transitions and critical phenomena, induced by the interplay of rotating-wave, counter-rotating-wave, and Ising interactions. We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number. We also demonstrate the vanishing of parity symmetry in finite-size simulations and show that the Rydberg blockade leads to a significant suppression of cavity occupation. Notably, stronger quantum fluctuations induced by the counter-rotating wave terms slightly favor the superradiant solid (SRS) phase over the Solid-1/2 state. Finally, we confirm that the SR phase transition and the transition from the Solid-1/2 to the SRS are second-order. In contrast, the transitions from the Solid-1/2 or SRS to the SR phase are both first-order for any value of the normalized anisotropy parameter.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

On-surface and molecular junction experiments have shown that tautomerism in single MFPs can be controlled by the magnitude of the current passing through them. Such conductance-based results confirm the potential for tautomeric switching but are not easily translated into device applications, where faster electric-field-gated switching is generally preferred. Previous work has focused on highly symmetric MFPs with four identical pyrrole rings, in which tautomers correspond to different H-N configurations of two protons. Here, we consider a synthesized metal-free benziporphyrin in which one pyrrole ring is replaced by a phenol moiety. This modification lowers the symmetry and increases the tautomer-dependence of the electronic state. The structural anisotropy of benziporphyrins also enhances their selective response to applied E-fields. Here, we use density functional theory and quantum electron-transport calculations to assess: (i) the statistical distribution of three distinct benziporphyrin tautomers under different applied E-fields, and (ii) the transport characteristics of each tautomer. We find that moderate E-fields can influence the tautomerism and that each tautomer exhibits distinct transport signatures, confirming that single metal-free benziporphyrins have potential to act as three-state molecular switches. By fusing two benziporphyrins, we show that the larger manifold of tautomeric states retains distinct transport signatures, opening the way to multistate molecular registers. Finally, we show that fused benziporphyrins can also act as molecular wires with enhanced conductance relative to a single unit.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the impact of tautomerism on the behavior of metal-free benziporphyrins, both as three-state molecular switches and as molecular wires with enhanced conductance when fused.

For example, a photoemission at a given nucleobase means that we both charge it and place an electron right next to a neighboring part of the genetic code. Inverse photoemission means that we trap a free electron (at some empty state or resonance), and instead emit a low-energy photon. This may reduce the damage if it happens at an already charged base, but it can cause extra damage if it arises somewhere else. Predicting the nature of sudden optically-driven excitations, termed quasi-particles (QPs), help us detail interactions and possibly control the damage that might follow. Also, these QPs contain information on the larger DNA assembly because they reflect the fingerprints of nucleobase polarity, the hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick pairs, and the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the Watson-Crick-pair stacking that makes up the genome. In this study, we utilize the recently developed (optimally tuned) range-separated hybrid vdW density functional, AHBR-mRSH* [JPCM 37, 211501 (2025)] to analyze the electron-attached and ionized QP states of these DNA components, with a particular focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances). We also evaluate critical properties such as dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Finally, we classify the Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature. This classification provides the foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The double-threshold voltage-current characteristics closely resemble those observed in the collective depinning of the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors. By adapting the model used for vortices to the case of an electron solid, good agreement with the experimental results is achieved, which supports a quantum electron solid forming in the low electron density state. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the double-threshold behavior occurs at voltages an order of magnitude lower and at significantly higher electron densities than the zero-field case. This indicates the stabilization of the quantum electron solid, aligning with theoretical predictions. Interestingly, the double-threshold voltage-current curves, indicative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime. This lack of observation does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u603b\u7ed3\uff1a\u8bba\u6587\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u548c\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u95e8\u9650\u7535\u538b-\u7535\u6d41\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u95e8\u9650\u7535\u538b\uff0c\u7535\u6d41\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u95e8\u9650\u4e4b\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4f4d\u9519\u6392\u65a5\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u95e8\u9650\u76f8\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u56fa\u4f53\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u65bd\u52a0\u5782\u76f4\u78c1\u573a\u65f6\uff0c\u4e8c\u6b21\u95e8\u9650\u7535\u538b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u4e8c\u6b21\u95e8\u9650\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u4e0b\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5728\u6574\u6d41\u586b\u5145\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f62\u6210\u72ec\u7acb\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u56fa\u4f53-state\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u73b0\u8c61\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u56fa\u4f53\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u53c2\u8003\u4e86\u7c7b\u57df\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e8c\u6b21\u95e8\u9650\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u56fa\u4f53\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e14\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u4e8c\u6b21\u95e8\u9650\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u4e0b\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u586b\u5145\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u56fa\u4f53\u3002\u5173\u4e8e\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\u56fa\u4f53\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u9700\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u95e8\u9650\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u586b\u5145\u6001\u6216\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

The QD clusters exhibit diverse dynamical behaviors, including contraction, oscillations, and expansion, depending on the cluster's initial radius. A phase shift between adjacent QDs imparts net angular momentum to the cluster, inducing its permanent rotation. Through the energy-minimization analysis, we predict equilibrium values of the necklace radius that support persistent rotation with negligible radial pulsations. In this regime, the clusters evolve as robust entities, maintaining the azimuthal symmetry in the course of the evolution, even in the presence of considerable perturbations.

Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators require vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity, preventing simultaneous fast and high-sensitivity operation. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation -- leaving gas-mediated convection as the dominant tunable pathway -- and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $34~\u03bc\\mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. While the demonstrated sensitivity is instrument-limited, our analysis shows that the device architecture itself supports a >25-fold performance enhancement toward its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3.1\\times10^{8}$ Jones).

To this end, we perform experiments to obtain morphological traits of xylem vessels under drought-stressed conditions, and develop a mathematical framework to model the underlying flow through the xylem, considering several features relevant to the plant system. Performing experiments using state of the art instruments, we measure the morphology of xylem vessels, physicochemical and mechanical properties of xylem walls under drought stressed conditions. Our experimental results unveil that drought reduces both xylem diameter and pit aperture size, implicating hydraulic adaptations of plants to drought stress. We find that the reduced cellulose content in drought stressed xylem vessels lowers the zeta potential and decreases elasticity of the vascular region. Additionally, drought stress alters metabolite activity, increases reactive oxygen species, reduces chlorophyll content, and limits the uptake of essential metallic nutrients. Besides, we perform three-dimensional numerical simulations to evaluate local flow field, mechanical stress, hydraulic conductivity, and radial transport efficiency of xylem vessels under drought stressed conditions. Simulated results reveal that under drought conditions, resistance to axial flow through xylem vessels increases significantly, which in turn, promotes radial transport of nutrients, allowing plants to survive even in drought stress. We show that the radial flow efficiency of xylem vessels becomes notably higher under drought stress than in well-watered control plants.

This difficulty arises from unavoidable atomic-scale disorder at the interface, caused by alloy randomness, which suppresses valley splitting and, more critically, induces large variations. Here, we demonstrate that CMOS-compatible uniaxial strain can substantially enhance valley splitting, rendering it immune to interface disorder. Atomistic pseudopotential calculations show that uniaxial strain linearly restores the valley splitting suppressed by interfacial disorder, with a large enhancement rate, while keeping disorder-induced variations within a narrow distribution. We reveal that uniaxial strain introduces a new coupling channel between bulk valleys in adjacent Brillouin zones through a small momentum transfer, which markedly reduces the susceptibility of valley splitting to interfacial disorder. These findings establish a viable route to improve gate uniformity in silicon-based spin qubits, paving the way for scalable quantum processors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7845/\u7845\u78b3\u5316\u7845\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u5206\u9694\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u786e\u4fdd\u9ad8\u9891\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u96be\u9898\u3002\u754c\u9762\u5fae\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u6027\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u9694\uff0c\u4e14\u4e25\u91cd\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5206\u9694\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cCMOS\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5355\u8f74\u5e94\u53d8\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u9694\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5bf9\u754c\u9762\u7f3a\u9677\u514d\u75ab\u3002\u539f\u5b50\u52bf\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u8f74\u5e94\u53d8\u7ebf\u6027\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u53d7\u5230\u754c\u9762\u65e0\u5e8f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5206\u9694\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5206\u9694\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u5f97\u65e0\u5e8f\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5206\u9694\u53d8\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ed\u7a84\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u8f74\u5e94\u8fb9\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Bulk valleys \u4e4b\u95f4\u65b0\u7684\u8026\u5408\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u52a8\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5927\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5206\u9694\u5bf9\u754c\u9762\u65e0\u5e8f\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u7845\u57fa\u81ea\u65cb\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u95e8\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7535\u5b50devices\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u74f6\u9888\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7845\u57fa\u81ea\u65cb\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0d\u8a00\u800c\u55bb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7a81\u7834\u6b64\u96be\u9898\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u5de5\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CMOS\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5355\u8f74\u5e94\u53d8\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u5b50\u52bf\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "lc\u5355\u8f74\u5e94\u53d8\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7845/\u7845\u78b3\u5316\u7845\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u5206\u9694\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5bf9\u754c\u9762\u5fae\u7f3a\u9677\u514d\u75ab\uff0c\u4e14\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u9694\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u652f\u6301\u5e94\u53d8\u901f\u7387\u5bf9\u5206\u9694\u7684\u6062\u590d\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u8f74\u5e94\u53d8\u662f\u6539\u5584\u7845\u57fa\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u95e8\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6750\u6599\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Starting from a canonical Lagrangian for radial metric functions and the curvature scalar $R$, we derive the associated Hamiltonian and show that the Legendre map is regular whenever both the first derivative of $f(R)$ with respect to $R$ and the second derivative with respect to $R$ is non-zero. Within Noether's approach (variational and Lie-derivative forms), we obtain general, canonical, and internal symmetry classes and identify explicit generators; for the quadratic model $f(R)=R^{2}$ these include radial translations and scaling symmetries. We then formulate Mei symmetry conditions as invariance of the Euler--Lagrange equations under the first prolongation, which yields an overdetermined partial differential equation (PDE) system for the generator components. Solving this system for $f(R)=R^{2}$, we find eight independent Mei generators and construct the corresponding conserved currents, some without a direct Noether analog. The analysis demonstrates that Mei symmetries extend the standard Noether framework for higher-order Lagrangians and provide additional conserved quantities relevant to black-hole dynamics in modified gravity.

We first extend the conjecture to set-ups where moduli are present and we demand that a particle, produced during the decay of an extremal black hole via the Schwinger effect, is repelled close to the horizon of the black hole. We interpret this condition as the universal criterion imposed by the WGC for any background. Interestingly, the constraint imposed by the WGC on the particle spectrum, before the stabilization of the moduli, is independent of the background, resulting in the same bound both in Minkowski and in AdS space. For the case of AdS space, after the stabilization of the moduli, the WGC in AdS space is reproduced due to the formation of a non-singular horizon of the extremal black hole. In that case, the particle spectrum must satisfy the stronger of the two WGC conditions obtained before and after moduli stabilization.

ASTAROTH is a project aimed at developing the next generation of such detectors by reading out their scintillation light with SiPM matrices operated at cryogenic temperatures. This paper describes the innovative design of the ASTAROTH cryostat, consisting of a double-walled copper-steel cryogenic chamber that cools the detectors by means of a liquid argon bath. The detectors are thermalized in a helium atmosphere at a temperature tunable from 87 to 150 K. The design has been validated in terms of heat transfer efficiency and mechanical stress, developing of a nonlinear multiphysics model. The mechanical properties of OFHC copper were experimentally evaluated on dedicated tensile samples. The simulation results show that the structural integrity is guaranteed. At the highest operating temperature, the region with the steepest temperature gradient exhibits stresses that slightly exceed the yield strength of copper (localized strain-hardened condition). Following construction, the cryostat was commissioned and has been in regular operation for over 30 cooling cycles, with no signs of degradation. The temperature can be tuned across the full target range and remains stable within 0.1 K.

The apparatus comprises four stages, each designed in-house. An oven heated to $\\sim 500^\\circ$C generates an atomic beam that is collimated by a capillary stack. The beam is sent into a passive, permanent-magnet-based Zeeman slower that reduces the atomic velocity to $30$ m/s. The slow atoms are captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and cooled to $1.0(3)$ mK with a trapping time of $16(2)$ ms. Ground-state atoms in the cold gas are excited to high Rydberg states via resonant excitation through the intermediate $4s4p\\, ^1P_1$ and $4s4d\\, ^1D_2$ states. The MOT is operated at the center of an electrode stack, which serves to apply continuous and pulsed electric fields and field-ionize the Rydberg atoms for detection.

Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic.

Tscherbul"], "title": "A rigorous adiabatic approach to ultracold atom-molecule collisions in a magnetic field", "comment": null, "summary": "We extend the rigorous adiabatic coupled-channel formalism to ultracold nonreactive atom-molecule collisions in the presence of an external magnetic field. The wavefunction of the collision complex is expanded in adiabatic basis states obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for the adiabatic Hamiltonian (the total Hamiltonian of the collision complex minus the radial kinetic energy) on a grid of atom-molecule distances $R$. The resulting coupled-channel equations are solved using the diabatic-by-sector method. We show that the adiabatic approach provides accurate cross sections for cold and ultracold Mg ($^1$S) + NH ($^3\u03a3^-$) collisions in a magnetic field with ~2 times fewer channels than the standard diabatic basis. We further develop an efficient $R$-dependent basis truncation protocol (RBT), in which the elements of the log-derivative matrix are sampled and discarded as it is propagated from small to large $R$. While RBT can be applied in both the adiabatic and diabatic bases, we show that the adiabatic basis can be reduced to just the open channels at long range, leading to an overall computational gain of ~15-30 for the propagation part of the calculation. The gain is particularly significant in situations where substantial errors in the calculated cross sections ($<$50\\%) can be tolerated or long-range interactions are involved, making the adiabatic basis formulation a promising approach to strongly anisotropic collisions and chemical reactions in the presence of an external magnetic field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684adiabatic\u5171\u8f6d\u901a\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u51b7\u975e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5916\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7b97\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u590d\u5408\u4f53\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86adiabatic\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7528adiabatic\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5171\u8f6d\u901a\u9053\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u9053\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7RBT\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u51b7\u548c\u8d85\u4f4e\u6e29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u78c1\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u8d85\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5916\u78c1\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5e0c\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5373\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u8fd9\u4e9b\u78b0\u649e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acbadiabatic\u57fa\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528adiabatic\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6c42\u89e3\u4e58\u6cd5\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86RBT\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u622a\u65ad\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cadiabatic\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e8615-30\u500d\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u51b7\u548c\u8d85\u4f4e\u6e29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u5c0f\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8d85\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5916\u78c1\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cdadiabatic\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

An important concept in this context is the Generalized Wigner-Smith (GWS) matrix, which has previously been primarily studied for optimizing radiation forces and torques on single objects embedded inside complex scattering environments. Here, we develop a unified scattering framework that rigorously establishes this connection for arbitrary inhomogeneous, lossless electromagnetic and acoustic media, as well as for controlling multiple objects individually. Variational identities relate parametric changes of the medium to perturbations of the scattering fields, from which the GWS matrix emerges as a natural generator of radiation forces and torques. For a single object, its extremal eigenstates yield maximal force or torque along a chosen direction; for multiple objects, the same framework defines Pareto-optimal compromises among competing objectives and reveals uncertainty relations for their simultaneous optimization. This establishes a comprehensive foundation towards collective and selective manipulation of objects in complex media.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Utilizing distributed cores, each hosting logical data qubits and logical ancillas connected via classical and quantum communication channels, offers a promising alternative. However, building such a system for logical qubits requires additional optimizations, such as minimizing the amount of state transfer between cores for inter-core two-qubit gates and optimizing the routing of magic states distilled in a magic state factory. In this work, we investigate such a system and its statistics in terms of classical and quantum resources. First, we restrict our quantum gate set to a universal gate set consisting of CNOT, H, T, S, and Pauli gates. We then developed a framework that can take any quantum circuit, transpile it to our gate set using Qiskit, and then partition the qubits using the KaHIP graph partitioner to balanced partitions. Afterwards, we built an algorithm to map these graphs onto the 2D mesh of quantum cores by converting the problem into a Quadratic Assignment Problem with Fixed Assignment (QAPFA) to minimize the routing of leftover two-qubit gates between cores and the total travel of magic states from the magic state factory. Following this stage, the gates are scheduled using an algorithm that takes care of the timing of the gate set. As a final stage, our framework reports detailed statistics such as the number of classical communications, the number of EPR pairs and magic states consumed, and timing overheads for pre- and post- processing for inter-core state transfers. These results help to quantify both classical and quantum resources that are used in distributed logical quantum computing architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5355\u6838\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5355\u6838\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u9762\u4e34\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528Qiskit\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u8026\u5408\u7f16\u8bd1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528KaHIP\u5212\u5206\u7269\u7406\u4f4d\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aQuadratic Assignment Problem\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u3001EPR\u5bf9\u548c\u9b54\u529b\u6001\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u5e8f\u5ef6\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In particular, even a small amount of distortion of the lattice potential can localise otherwise-delocalised quantum states in low-dimensional electron systems, dramatically influencing their thermodynamic properties and charge-transport behaviour. Study of such electron localisation induced by an aperiodic lattice potential remains exceptionally challenging in solid-state systems, since extrinsic disorders can trivially trap electrons in potential minima near disorders, obscuring the underlying quantum-mechanical origin of localisation phenomena. Van der Waals heterostructures can provide an alternative route for explorations of the phenomena via the emergence of superlattice potentials generated by rotating and stacking individual layers. Here, we report strong signatures of electron localisation in helical trilayer graphene, where the interplay of two moir\u00e9 patterns gives rise to a moir\u00e9-of-moir\u00e9 superlattice with distinct regions of moir\u00e9-periodic and moir\u00e9-aperiodic potentials. Remarkably, our measurements reveal the presence of double moir\u00e9-induced bands and high-order Brown-Zak oscillations, which are direct reflections of the periodic region with two constituent moir\u00e9 patterns, and a superimposed anomalous hysteretic signal attributable to the aperiodic region. The data strongly suggest that electron wave functions are partially localised driven by the loss of a periodic lattice potential.

Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, non-invertible symmetry structures in $D>2$ correspond to the choice of a subtheory of a unique parent one, where the symmetry is a compact group. We present a theorem that generalizes this result to higher form symmetries. We first re-formulate the DHR theorem in terms of Haag duality violations (HDV) for regions with non-trivial homotopy group $\u03c0_0$ in the finite index case. In this light, the theorem states that the category associated with such HDV is the dual of a group, and it can be extended to spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios. Then, after eliminating $\u03c0_0$ sectors via DHR reconstruction, we show that the HDV corresponding to regions with non-trivial $\u03c0_i$, $0<i<D-2$, are associated with abelian groups. Physically, the result shows that generalized order/disorder parameters in $D>2$ are labeled by such groups, in agreement with the case of confinement order parameters in Yang-Mills theories (Wilson and 't Hooft loops). For the special case of $D=4n$ and loops of dimension $k=2 n-1$, the group is further required to have a Hermitian character table. This does not rule out the possibility of an extra $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ factor that is not achievable by Lagrangian gauge models. In the way we find a new proof of the group-like origin of internal symmetries, and analyze the sectors for more general regions, e.g., direct sums, knots, and links. In particular, we find that generalized knot order parameters are classified by the unknot order parameters, and the commutator of knot non-local operators is determined by the linking number.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Theoretical studies suggest that their non-classical correlations enable time-resolved spectroscopy with monochromatic pumping and can selectively isolate specific Liouville pathways in nonlinear optical signals. In an earlier study, we proposed a fluorescence detection scheme that could, in principle, be implemented using existing single-photon detectors [Y. Fujihashi et al., arXiv:2502.02073 (2025)]. In that design, the time origin was defined by detecting the arrival of the pulsed laser used to pump the nonlinear crystal for spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a requirement that made the overall experiment cumbersome. This study theoretically examines an alternative protocol that defines the reference time based on the arrival of idler photons. We demonstrate that this idler-referenced scheme functions effectively when the entangled photons exhibit either negative or negligible frequency correlations. Eliminating the pump-timing channel simplifies the optical layout and lowers the experimental barrier to realizing time-resolved two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with entangled photons. Although the photons may exhibit frequency correlations in isolation, their frequency-time degrees of freedom can behave as effectively uncorrelated when considered over the full measurement timescale.

We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent.

At intermediate temperatures, the spin-spin structure factor develops features that reflect the absence of reflection symmetry in the lattice. The zero-temperature convergence of NLCE enables reliable estimates of the ground-state energy and points to a short-range correlated paramagnetic ground state composed of resonating hexagonal motifs.

Inspired by the prosperous development of photonic computing techniques, recent research has turned attention to performing quantum machine learning on photonic platforms. Although photons possess a high-dimensional quantum feature space suitable for computation, a general understanding of how to harness it for learning tasks remains blank. Here, we establish both theoretically and experimentally a scalable advantage in quantum machine learning with multi-photon states. Firstly, we prove that the learning capacity of linear optical circuits scales polynomially with the photon number, enabling generalization from smaller training datasets and yielding lower test loss values. Moreover, we experimentally corroborate these findings through unitary learning and metric learning tasks, by performing online training on a fully programmable photonic integrated platform.

Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic molecules regularly arranged on the surface of a thin ferromagnetic layer enable resonant coupling of propagating spin waves with the dynamics of the molecules' magnetic moments, opening a gap in the transmission spectrum up to 150 MHz. The gap, its width, and frequency can be controlled by an external magnetic field or the arrangement of molecules on the ferromagnetic surface. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic arrangement of the magnetic moments of molecules or clusters of molecules allows for control of the gap's position and width.

We simulate the late-time evolution of 15 binary black hole mergers with mass ratio $q = 1000$, dimensionless spins $\u03c7= [-0.9, -0.6, 0.0, 0.6, 0.9]$ and eccentricity at the last stable orbit $e_{\\rm LSO} = [0.8, 0.9, 0.95]$. We track the tail amplitudes and exponents up to a retarded time coordinate $t = 9000M$ after merger for the six spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes $(2,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,3)$, and $(4,4)$ employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. We note that the tails are increasingly pronounced for binaries with high eccentricity $e_{\\rm LSO}$ and large negative spin $\u03c7$. We find that the overall late-time exponents closely approach their predicted asymptotic values ($p=-\\ell-4$ for Weyl curvature scalar $\u03c8_{4,\\ell m}$ where $\\ell$ is the spin-weighted spherical harmonic index), while estimates restricted to the latest portion of the data exactly recover them. We further verify numerically that modes with the same spherical index $\\ell$ share identical tail exponents, while variations in $m$ do not affect the tail behavior.

Extended dead time in the electronics causes saturation and quenching of the counting rate, an effect we counter by inverting the pile-up plot once the double pulse resolution is determined.

It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator.

However, achieving tunable nonlinearity at terahertz (THz) frequencies faces significant challenges due to the lack of materials that combine high nonlinear responses with strong sensitivity to external stimuli in this spectral regime. Here, we show giant modulation of THz nonlinearity by optically tailoring the valley degree of freedom in semiconductor-based metasurfaces. Mediated by the resonant behaviors of metasurfaces, photoexcited electrons transition into different valleys in the conduction band in response to the driving THz field, with the transition rate controlled by light intensity. Since THz nonlinearities vary significantly with electron dynamics in different valleys, various nonlinear effects-such as nonlinear transmission and generation-can be efficiently enhanced and modulated within a single metasurface using weak optical pumping. With optical energy as low as a few picojoules, we achieve on-off switching of THz third harmonic generation with a modulation depth exceeding 20000%, along with effective tunability of its nonperturbative behaviors.

The absorber consists of two concentric space-coiling resonators with distinct resonance frequencies, with the inner resonator characterized by a low-quality factor (Q) and the outer resonator by a high Q factor. The coupling between the two resonators enables efficient broadband absorption within a deep-subwavelength range exceeding 15 times the structural thickness. Numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and experimental measurements demonstrate that highly efficient (greater than 80 percent) low-frequency broadband absorption is achieved in the range of 198-315 Hz, as well as a 58 percent fractional bandwidth spanning 183-334 Hz.

A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks.

For more general spacetimes, Bousso and Penington (BP) have recently proposed a generalization of entanglement wedges sharing many of the same properties as usual entanglement wedges. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that each generalized entanglement wedge can be associated with an algebra in the (generally unknown) fundamental description (in a semiclassical limit). We postulate features of the map from entanglement wedges to algebras that provide a natural algebraic interpretation for some of the basic mathematical properties of the set of entanglement wedges. Quantitatively, we suggest a possible generalization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula that associates the gravitational entropy of a generalized entanglement wedge with an entropic quantity for the associated algebra.

An additional mirror reflector, together with the mirror surface of the sample, forms a double mirror located between the pole pieces of a powerful laboratory electromagnet. The presence of an additional mirror leads to mixing of the amplitude ($\u0394R/R$) and phase ($\u0394\u03c6$) RMCD-components in the amplitudes of the signals at the first and second harmonics of the phase modulation. It is shown that the RMCD spectroscopy technique using a simplified scheme and an additional mirror requires the synchronous measurement of three electrical signals proportional to the amplitudes of the corresponding terms in the expression for the total intensity of monochromatic radiation detected by the photodetector: a constant signal $V_{dc}$ and high-frequency amplitudes $V_f$ and $V_{2f}$ at phase modulation frequencies $f$ and $2f$.

Here we combine classical and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations to resolve the interfacial organisation of aqueous LiCl from dilute to water-in-salt (WiS) (1--$20~\\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$) concentrations at graphitic electrodes, and compare with electrochemical differential-capacitance measurements from which the potential of zero charge (PZC) is obtained. We uncover a concentration-driven restructuring of the EDL: below $6~\\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$, solvated Li$^+$ dominates the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), but at higher concentrations co-adsorption of Cl$^-$ through solvent-separated ion pairs enforces a near 1:1 Li:Cl ratio at the interface. This transition expands the effective EDL thickness, redistributes the interfacial potential drop, and drives a decrease in the PZC, matching the trend inferred from differential-capacitance measurements on electrolyte-graphite interfaces. Capacitance calculations reveal that while both EDL and quantum contributions vary strongly with concentration, their opposing trends make the total capacitance appear nearly constant for pristine few-layer graphite; for electrodes with smaller quantum capacitance, however, the concentration dependence of the EDL capacitance would be directly reflected in the total capacitance. Solvent-separated ion pairing is identified as the key driver of anomalous EDL behaviour in LiCl WiS electrolytes, establishing design considerations for tuning interfacial capacitance and stability in next-generation aqueous energy-storage systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u8d85\u6d53\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\uff0cLiCl\u5728\u56fe\u7acb\u7279\u7535\u6781\u4e0a\u7684\u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u6027\u80fd\u7531\u4e8e\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u539a\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0bLiCl\u5728\u6c34-\u76d0\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4ecbfacial organization\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u7535\u8377\u7535\u5bb9\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u578b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5bb9\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7535\u6781\u4e0a\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5bb9\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u603b\u7535\u5bb9\u51e0\u4e4e\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5bb9\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u7535\u6781\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u6d53\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u5728\u7535\u5bb9\u4e0a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6eb6\u5242\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u914d\u5bf9\u4f5c\u7528\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8d85\u6d53\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eNext-gen\u6c34\u4e2d\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u754c\u9762\u7535\u5bb9\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8d85\u6d53\u6c34\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u7535\u8377\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c34\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0bLiCl\u5728\u6c34-\u76d0\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u4e0e\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7535\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u7535\u5bb9\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "1. \u8d85\u6d53\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u7684 ceil-\u6eb6\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6eb6\u5242\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u914d\u5bf9\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u30022. \u968f\u6d53\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u578b\u9020\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u539a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7535\u4f4d\u964d\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u52bf\u80fd\u548c\u96f6\u7535\u4f4d\u7535\u5bb9\u30023. \u7535\u5bb9\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u5bf9\u603b\u7535\u5bb9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7535\u6781\u4e0a\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5bb9\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u7535\u6781\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u6d53\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6eb6\u5242\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u914d\u5bf9\u4f5c\u7528\u662fLiCl\u6c34-\u76d0\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7535\u53cc\u5c42\u5728\u8d85\u6d53\u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c34\u50a8\u80fd\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7535\u5bb9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

In this work, we demonstrate a compact and polarization-invariant photonic metasurface, fabricated from hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) and based on radial bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are formed by radially distributed pairs of structurally asymmetric resonators. The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $\u03bcm^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint. By integrating the hBN photonic structure with a WS$_2$ monolayer, we observe enhanced photoluminescence when its resonance is spectrally aligned with the exciton resonance, accompanied by signatures of discrete momentum-space patterns that identify the orbital-angular-momentum-carrying ring eigenmodes. These features persist over a wide range of excitation powers and show minimal linewidth broadening, indicating robust and spatially modulated exciton-photon coupling.

Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\\times$ 2 charge density wave.

We derive multiple inequalities involving entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and show that monotonicity holds for both measured and unmeasured parties in $J_W$ and for the unmeasured party in $D_W$. Unlike their original counterparts, we find that $J_W$ is monogamous for both parties and obeys one-way strong superadditivity, whereas $D_W$ is polygamous for the unmeasured party in pure tripartite states.

In this work, we explore how nonlinear optical phenomena can be exploited for quantum information applications, demonstrating the versatility that arises from resonant coupling among excited states. By tracking changes in the ellipticities of signal photons on femtosecond timescales in four-wave-mixing experiments, we first establish a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Using single-photon detection, we then implement the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol by mapping these polarization states onto binary sequences. While the polarizations of weak coherent pulses are typically manipulated with optical elements in traditional quantum key distribution approaches, the intrinsic electronic structure and spin relaxation processes within the 2D-OIHP system determine the characteristics of the signal photons in our method. As a demonstration, an ASCII message consisting of 56 bits is transmitted through the polarization states of photons emitted by 2D-OIHP quantum wells. These results show that the information transmission efficiency depends strongly on contributions from biexciton states, highlighting the potential of spin-dependent nonlinear optical processes for quantum communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study shows that nonlinear optical processes in 2D-OIHP quantum wells can be used for quantum communication, specifically for encoding and distributing quantum keys using polarization states.", "motivation": "The paper's motivation is to explore how nonlinear optical phenomena in perovskite structures can be applied for next-generation quantum communication, potentially improving information security and data transmission efficiency.", "method": "The methodology involves using four-wave-mixing experiments to observe changes in signal photons' ellipticities, which are then used to encode quantum information.

When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals.

In this letter, we propose the superstrip algebra as a unified framework to catalog the categorical symmetry data in a massive fermionic model. The algebra and its representations explicitly encode the vacuum structure, soliton degeneracies, and their quantum numbers. As a demonstration, we apply this framework to the $\\mathcal N=2$ minimal models with their least relevant deformation. We show that this specific deformation alone preserves a non-invertible superfusion category, a fermionic variant of $\\text{SU}(2)_k$ known to underlie the $ADE$ classification of critical theories. Its superstrip algebra then accounts for the origin of the resulting $ADE$-type soliton spectrum and their fractional fermion number. Although our primary examples are supersymmetric and integrable, our framework itself relies on neither property, providing a new powerful tool for studying a broad class of strongly-coupled fermionic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a761+1\u7ef4gapped\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7531\u5185\u751f\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8d85\u6761\u7eb9\u4ee3\u6570\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u7c7b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8be5\u4ee3\u6570\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u7a7a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b64\u5b50\u9000\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7528$\text{N}=2$\u6781\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u6700\u5c0f\u76f8\u5173\u5f62\u53d8\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f62\u53d8\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u8d85\u878d\u5408\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8d85\u6761\u7eb9\u4ee3\u6570\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6240\u5f97\u5230\u7684$ADE$\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5b64\u5b50\u8c31\u53ca\u5176\u534a\u6574\u6570\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5965\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c Soliton \u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d85\u6761\u7eb9\u4ee3\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u79f0\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9$\text{N}=2$\u6781\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5176\u6700\u5c0f\u76f8\u5173\u5f62\u53d8\u7684\u8be6\u5c3d\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u6761\u7eb9\u4ee3\u6570\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7531\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684$ADE$\u578b\u5b64\u5b50\u8c31\u548c\u534a\u6574\u6570\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8d85\u6761\u7eb9\u4ee3\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7531\u5185\u751f\u975e\u53ef\u9006\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Yet, its practical applications are limited by the weak light-matter interaction in the mid-IR range and low brightness of mid-IR light sources. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy addresses the sensitivity limitations by leveraging resonant photonic structures, in particular, plasmonic and frequency-selective dielectric metasurfaces. However, current implementations of SEIRA approach mainly rely on complex instruments and scanning components such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and tunable external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC QCLs). Here, we present a compact and high-throughput imaging-based SEIRA platform that combines broadband gradient metasurfaces with a radiofrequency-modulated QCL that generates remarkably broad instantaneous emission spectrum (250 cm$^{-1}$) covering absorption bands of multiple distinct molecular vibrational modes. By matching the resonance spectrum of the compact (1 mm$^2$) broadband gradient metasurface with the laser emission projected on its surface through a dispersive element, we ensure that every QCL spectral component is uniquely addressed for an efficient targeted enhancement of the electromagnetic field. This enables us to use a low-cost and room-temperature mid-IR camera, acquiring in a single frame the enhanced absorption signatures of analytes deposited on the metasurface as a barcode image, thus reducing the acquisition time by up to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the FTIR and EC QCL based measurements. Eliminating the need for tunable light sources, bulky spectrometers, and expensive low-temperature detectors, our approach enables high-throughput, miniaturized, and highly specific molecular diagnostics for diverse chemical and biological applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u548c\u5c04\u9891\u8c03\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\uff08QCL\uff09\u7684\u8868\u9762\u589e\u5f3a\u7ea2\u5916\u5438\u6536\uff08SEIRA\uff09\u6210\u50cf\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u5728\u5730\u7403\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u7a7f\u900f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u6750\u6599\u5982\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0cSEIRA\u6280\u672f\u9010\u6e10\u6210\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u4e4b\u9053\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281\u6beb\u7c73\u5e73\u65b9\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u5c04\u9891\u8c03\u5236QCL\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u6563\u5143\u7d20\u4f7fQCL\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u4e0e\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u8868\u9762\u4ea7\u751f address \u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5e38\u6e29\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u76f8\u673a\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u96c6\u5206\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u96c6\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b49\u591a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5149\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u578bSEIRA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Very recently, the quasicrystal (QC) was proposed as a possible platform to realize AM. However, the existence of AM in QCs still lacks vigorous evidence. In this work, we adopt the sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithm to investigate the magnetic phases in the half-filled Hubbard models in various 2D bipartite QCs, and always obtain N\u00e9el ordered states. While the N\u00e9el states in bipartite crystals are usually antiferromagnetism (AFM), we find it common that those in bipartite QCs can also be AM or ferromagnetism (FM). Based on symmetry analysis, combined with our comprehensive PQMC results, we propose a general criterion for determining the magnetism classes of the N\u00e9el states in a bipartite QC: According to whether the two sublattices are related by the inversion, the other point-group operation, or no operation about the unique symmetry center in the QC, the corresponding N\u00e9el state is AFM, AM or FM, respectively. For example, our results yield AM for the two $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QCs and FM for the $D_5$-symmetric Penrose QC at half-filling. Our results provide a solid foundation for experimental investigations and potential applications of different classes of magnetism in QCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528PQMC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53cc\u5b50\u683c\u70b9\u8d34\u9762\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u6240\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5747\u5448\u73b0N\u00e9el\u6709\u5e8f\u6001\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53cc\u5b50\u683c\u8d34\u9762\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684N\u00e9el\u6001\uff0c\u82e5\u4e24\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5012\u5f71\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6001\u4e3a\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\uff08AFM\uff09\uff1b\u56e0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u5b83\u70b9\u7fa4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5219\u4e3a\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\uff08AM\uff09\uff1b\u82e5\u65e0\u4efb\u4f55\u70b9\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5219\u4e3a\u94c1\u78c1\uff08FM\uff09\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684QC\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u6613\u652f\u6301AM\uff1b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e3a\u4eba\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e Penrose QC\u652f\u519c\u78c1\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76aper\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aQC\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7279\u6027 Conditional Distribution", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u7b26\u5f81Quantum Monte Carlo(PQMC)\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53cc\u5b50\u683c\u70b9\u8d34\u9762\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684 Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u5f97N\u00e9el \u5f0f\u6240\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53cc\u5b50\u683c\u8d34\u9762\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684 N\u00e9el \u6001\uff0c\u82e5\u4e24\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5012\u5f71\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6001\u4e3a\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\uff08AFM\uff09\uff1b\u56e0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u5b83\u70b9\u7fa4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5219\u4e3a\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\uff08AM\uff09\uff1b\u82e5\u65e0\u4efb\u4f55\u70b9\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5219\u4e3a\u94c1\u78c1\uff08FM\uff09\u6001\uff1b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684QC\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u6613\u652f\u6301AM\uff1b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e3a\u4eba\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e Penrose QC\u652f\u519c\u78c1\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9QC\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PQMC\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5224\u65adQC\u4e2d\u7684N\u00e9el\u6001\u78c1\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u666e\u904d\u51c6\u5219\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u95f4\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5012\u5f71\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u5176\u5b83\u70b9\u7fa4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6216\u65e0\u4efb\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e3aAFM\u3001AM\u3001FM\u3002\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027QC\u6613\u4e8e\u652f\u6301AM\uff0c\u800c Penrose QC\u5219\u66f4\u6613\u652f\u6301FM\u3002\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aQC\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This type of dissipative coupling is a critical component for constructing Ising machines designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. By dynamically tuning the phase of a nonlinear mechanical pump, we demonstrate the realization of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dissipative interactions.

Conventionally, the flat-band wavefunctions that support FCIs are expected to mimic the lowest Landau level, a condition that can be quantified by the quantum-geometric indicators. In realistic systems, however, FCIs often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders, especially when the hosting flat bands not ideal. In this work, we propose stabilizing FCIs by exploiting the intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene, which naturally suppresses competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phase while FCIs are less effected. Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoir\u00e9 scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the interfacial phenomena governing performance in these systems remain poorly unified. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanoscale film formed by electrolyte decomposition, is well studied in batteries but its counterpart in supercapacitors has received limited systematic investigation despite growing experimental evidence. This review argues that SEI formation is a universal electrochemical process that occurs whenever electrode potentials drive electron transfer into electrolyte orbitals beyond their stability limits, independent of whether charge storage is Faradaic or non-Faradaic. Differences between battery SEIs and supercapacitor interphases arise mainly from operating conditions, not fundamental chemistry. Engineered interphases created through electrolyte additives, protective coatings, or surface functionalization suppress leakage currents, improve capacitance retention, and enable stable high-voltage operation.

The MCE data exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, in which the sample temperature increases during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. In Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the MCE further displays a striking plateau as a function of time, followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field, across pulses with differing peak-field strengths. Our magnetization measurements reveal an inferred temperature of the magnetic subsystem that differs significantly from the directly measured sample temperature and exhibits opposite hysteresis: the temperature is higher on the up-sweep than the down-sweep, unlike the direct measurements. These observations indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom on the timescale of the pulse ($\\sim 10^{-1}$s). We interpret the results using a phenomenological model involving two thermally coupled subsystems - the magnetic ions and phonons, and a thermal reservoir, which accounts well for the behavior of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.

A striking plateau in the MCE data followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field was observed in Nd\u2082Zr\u2082O\u2087, while in Pr\u2082Zr\u2082O\u2087, the plateau phenomenon was not observed. The magnetization measurements reveal a significant difference between the temperature of the magnetic subsystem and the directly measured sample temperature, with the magnetic subsystem temperature exhibiting opposite hysteresis compared to the direct measurements. This suggests that there is a significant divergence of magnetic subsystems and the lattice subsystems on short timescales (~10\u207b\u00b9 s).", "conclusion": "Our findings indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between the magnetic and lattice subsystems on the scale of the pulse. This breakdown is evident in both the magnetization and MCE data, and affects the interpretation of the results. We propose that the time-dependent coupling between the magnetic and lattice subsystems can help explain the observed behaviors. In particular, the experimentally observed plateaus in magnetic data in Nd\u2082Zr\u2082O\u2087 may be explained by a temperature-dependent thermal coupling coefficient that modulates the rate of magnetic field variation. Moreover, the slow heat transfer between magnetic and lattice subsystems in Nd\u2082Zr\u2082O\u2087 suggests a novel mechanism for dynamically controlling the heat flow within these materials."}}

This construction leads to novel boson-boson dualities, including an explicit correspondence between an $SO(N)$ theory with two real scalars and a $U(1)$ theory with one complex scalar, and their generalizations to arbitrary numbers of Majorana flavours. We analyze boundary conditions preserving chirality and demonstrate their role in matching gravitational anomalies and chiral central charges.

QFL can improve computational efficiency and scalability by taking advantage of quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement. However, existing QFL frameworks largely focus on homogeneity among quantum \\textcolor{black}{clients, and they do not account} for real-world variances in quantum data distributions, encoding techniques, hardware noise levels, and computational capacity. These differences can create instability during training, slow convergence, and reduce overall model performance. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth examination of heterogeneity in QFL, classifying it into two categories: data or system heterogeneity.

The M2 brane has an effective tension T$_2= \\frac{2}{ \u03c0} N$ so that the large tension expansion corresponds to the $1/N$ expansion. The value of the defect conformal anomaly coefficient in $SU(N)$ (2,0) theory was previously argued to be b$=12N- 9 - 3N^{-1}$. Semiclassically quantizing M2 brane it was found in arXiv:2004.04562 that the first two terms in b are indeed reproduced by the classical and 1-loop corrections to the M2 free energy. Here we address the question if the 2-loop term in the M2 brane free energy reproduces the $N^{-1}$ term in b. Despite the general non-renormalizability of the standard BST supermembrane brane action we find that, remarkably, the 2-loop correction to the free energy of the AdS$_3$ M2 brane in AdS$_7\\times S^4$ is UV finite (modulo power divergences that can be removed by an analytic regularization). Moreover, the 2-loop correction vanishes in the dimensional and $\u03b6$-function regularizations. This result appears to be in disagreement with the non-vanishing of the coefficient of the $N^{-1}$ term in the expected expression for the anomaly coefficient b. We discuss possible resolutions of this puzzle, including the one that the M2 brane probe computation may be capturing the surface defect anomaly in the $U(N)$ rather than the $SU(N)$ boundary 6d CFT.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Beyond planar films, theoretical studies predict that curvature can influence skyrmion stability by introducing effective chiral interactions. Here, we investigate skyrmion formation on self-assembled polystyrene particles coated with Pt/Co/Ta multilayers by magnetron sputtering. Vibrating sample magnetometry reveals clear differences in the magnetic reversal behavior of the curvilinear film compared to that of the planar counterpart. Using non-invasive imaging methods such as scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and high-sensitivity in-vacuum magnetic force microscopy (MFM) with low moment magnetic tipcs, we observe a maze domain pattern for the planar films while the curvilinear film reveals three-dimensional spiraling stripe states. By employing a conventional MFM operating under ambient conditions requiring a tip with a higher magnetic moment, we demonstrate that these stripe states can rupture into metastable skyrmions located at the top of the spherical particles by applying consecutive scans. Our results demonstrate that curvilinear films offer an accessible platform for stabilizing single skyrmions using local magnetic field stimuli, opening pathways to study the interplay between interfacial and curvature-induced DMIs and enabling controlled skyrmion writing on three-dimensional magnetic architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f2f\u66f2\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u7269\u5fae\u7c92\u8868\u9762 Treat \u5706\u5f62\u8584\u5c42\u5236\u5907\u51fa\u6765\u7684\u78c1 Skyrmion \u6bd4\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u78c1\u7535\u6cd5\u548c X \u513f\u7ebf\u900f\u5c04\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e09\u91cd\u87ba\u65cb\u6761\u7eb9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u626b\u63cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5fae\u5929\u7136\u662f Skyrmion \u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u78c1 Skyrmion \u5728\u5fc6\u5b58\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u6210\u4e3a\u9700\u3002\u5f2f\u66f2\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5177\u6709\u6548\u6e29\u66f2\u7684\u4ea4\u76f8\u4e92\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u78c1 Skyrmion\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u78c1\u7535\u6c89\u79ef\u5236\u5907\u4e86 Pt/Co/Ta \u8584\u5c42\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5305\u5728\u805a\u781c\u7c92\u5b50\u4e0a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u632f\u52a8\u6837\u54c1\u78c1\u6d41\u53d8\u4eea\u548c\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u626b\u63cf X \u513f\u7ebf\u900f\u5c04\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5e26\u6709\u8d85\u611f\u78c1\u5c16\u9488\u3002", "result": "\u5f2f\u66f2\u591a\u5c42\u819c\u5f97\u4e09\u7ef4\u87ba\u65cb\u6761\u7eb9\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u626b\u63cf\u6210\u529f\u5236\u9020\u4e86\u5fae\u5929\u5b50 Skyrmion \u653e\u5728\u7403\u5f62\u7c92\u5b50\u9876\u90e8\u3002\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5fae\u5929\u5b50\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u65e0\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u8fdb\u5165\u5f2f\u66f2\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u4e09\u7ef4\u78c1\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u9762\u7684\u78c1 Skyrmion \u8868\u73b0\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u66f2\u9762\u548c\u4e92\u4ea4\u4e4b\u95f4\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f2f\u66f2\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5bf9\u78c1 Skyrmion \u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u78c1\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u63a7\u5236 Skyrmion \u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e92\u4ea4\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c Skyrmion \u4e66\u5199\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal \"saturation charge\" $Q_{\\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the \"attracted\" charge exceeds the upper bound for the \"repelled\" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\\mathrm{w}}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u514b\u5c14\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u5747\u5300\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5145\u7535\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8db3\u591f\u5f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u5e93\u4ed1\u529b\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5f97\u7535\u8377\u504f\u5fc3\u5730\u805a\u96c6\u5728\u78c1\u573a\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4e00\u4fa7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u8377\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u50a8\u5b58\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u4f7f\u5f97\u7535\u8377\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6c83\u5c14\u5fb7\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9971\u548c\u7535\u8377\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5145\u7535\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u78c1\u573a\u8f83\u5f3a\u65f6\u7535\u8377\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u79ef\u7d2f\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u503c\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u78c1\u5316\u514b\u5c14\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7535\u573a\u548c\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6b63\u8d1f\u7535\u8377\u7684\u5438\u6536\u7387\u548c\u5438\u5f15/\u6392\u65a5\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8db3\u591f\u5f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u7535\u8377\u4f1a\u5411\u78c1\u573a\u65b9\u5411\u4e00\u4fa7\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u8377\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u4ea7\u751f\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c83\u5c14\u5fb7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9971\u548c\u7535\u8377\u503c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5f31\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Instead of invoking a stochastic wavefunction collapse, the measurement process is modeled as a bidirectional informational update between a forward-evolving state and a backward-propagating effect, governed by a completely positive generator and its adjoint. Within this operator-based formalism, pre- and post-selected statistics are treated on an equal footing, yielding a unified description of both. The proposed scheme rigorously preserves complete positivity, normalization, and the no-signalling principle, and it is shown to satisfy Spohn's inequality for the associated quantum Markov semigroup, thereby ensuring non-negative entropy production within this setting. The framework admits a direct experimental interpretation across a range of scenarios, including weak measurements, EPR-Bell tests, homodyne detection, and photon counting. Furthermore, in the classical limit, the bidirectional update is demonstrated to reduce to the well-established Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother used in classical estimation theory. These results support the view that the apparent temporal asymmetry of quantum measurement arises not from fundamental dynamical irreversibility, but from informational conditioning, specifically, the one-sided way in which measurement outcomes are incorporated into our description.

Zhidenko, 2511.03066]. The regularizing parameter $a$ is the characteristic scale of the halo. We compute the quasinormal spectrum for both axial \"up\" and \"down\" perturbations using the WKB method and verify the results through time-domain integration. The two sectors are no longer isospectral, and the deviations grow with the halo scale parameter. The grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections are extracted via standard scattering boundary conditions and the WKB approach, and their behaviour is fully consistent with the structure of the effective potentials. Altogether, our analysis demonstrates that a dark-matter halo imprint induces modifications in the gravitational response, while the employed approximation schemes remain sufficiently accurate for quantitative predictions.

Finally, we argue that the flat-space limit is more compatible with the description of effective field theory, as the total energy dependence of de Sitter S-matrix becomes trivial, allowing the Mandelstam variable to be identified as the unique energy scale, just as in flat space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e73\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4S\u77e9\u9635\u5728de Sitter\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u4e0ede Sitter\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684S\u77e9\u9635\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e73\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4S\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u6548\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u7279\u5b9a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6811\u7ea7\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u548cMassive\u6807\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5e73\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0ede Sitter\u7a7a\u95f4S\u77e9\u9635\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u5728\u6811\u7ea7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u4e0ede Sitter\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684S\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4ea4\u6362Massive\u6807\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u5c40\u57df\u5bfc\u6570\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e73\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0ede Sitter\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2dS\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u573a\u8bba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we have developed a noise removal system by using the deep prior-based method and integrated it into the micro focused SX-ARPES (\u03bcSX-ARPES) system at BL25SU in SPring-8. Our implemented system effectively eliminates the grid and spike noise typically present in ARPES data acquired using the voltage Fixed-mode, within about 30 seconds. We demonstrate, through the \u03bcSX-ARPES measurements on a single crystal of CeRu2Si2, that data with sufficient statistical accuracy can be obtained in approximately 40 seconds. In addition, we present the potential of high signal-to-noise ratio ARPES measurement, achieving an energy resolution of 51.6 meV at an excitation energy of 708 eV in \u03bcSX-ARPES measurements on polycrystalline gold.

Graphene nanoribbons, with tunable edge terminations and compatibility with planar device architectures, offer a promising alternative to semiconductor nanowires. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study of finite graphene strips with armchair, zigzag, and nearly square geometries, proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder. Using exact diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes tight-binding Hamiltonian, we analyze Majorana polarization, low-energy spectra, and real-space wavefunctions to identify the non-trivial topological phases supporting MZMs and distinguish them from from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or the quasi-Majoranas. We systematically chart the robustness of these modes across geometries and disorder regimes, finding that armchair strips with short zigzag edges provide the most stable platform. Our results unify polarization diagnostics with spatial wavefunction analysis and disorder effects, yielding concrete design guidelines for graphene-based topological superconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u78b3\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684Majorana\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f(MZMs)\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528 exact diagonalization \u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u6761\u5e26\u4f53\u5728 s-\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77ed\u7684\u68af\u5f62\u8fb9\u7f18\u78b3\u94fe\u662f\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u57fa\u5e95\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa*)(triplet Majorana bound states (T-MBS) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": " Majorana\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u6700\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6750\u6599\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002 \u5728\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u52a0\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86Bofell-de GennesHamiltonian\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7ed8\u5236\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684 Majorana\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u80fd\u9699\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": " \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u6761\u5e26\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u77ed\u7684\u68af\u5f62\u5cf0\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u652f\u6301 Majorana\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u4e86 armchair\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684\u80fd\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f7d\u8377\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u7684 Majorana\u57fa\u8f7d\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u68af\u5f62\u8fb9\u811a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347Majorana\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

We analyze the role of non-conserved energy-momentum tensor equations and investigate their influence on particle production within an irreversible thermodynamic framework. By introducing a novel Lagrangian, we derive modified field equations and establish their relationship with matter production, both with and without entropy generation. Our analysis focuses on ideal fluid models and extends to spatially flat LFRW cosmologies, providing key equations that govern energy density, pressure, and curvature dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a bouncing cosmological model, in which the universe undergoes cycles of contraction and expansion, avoiding the singularity associated with the Big Bang. Our results indicate that this bouncing scenario is feasible within the Rastall-like gravity framework, supported by particle production processes and stability conditions. The violation of energy conditions near the bounce point further confirms the consistency of this alternative cosmological model. The present work is focused on the theoretical foundations and internal consistency of the model; possible observational implications will be addressed in future investigations. We conclude that the proposed theory offers a coherent phenomenological approach to matter production and provides new insights into non-standard cosmological evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684Rastall\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u578b\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea7\u751f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u71b5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86\u5e73\u5c40LFRW\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u538b\u529b\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u5728Combining\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a bounce\u5b87\u5b99\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86Big Bang\u5947\u70b9\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728Rastall-like\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u53d7\u7c92\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u63a2\u8ba8\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf implications\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\u548c\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u70ed\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684Rastall\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f bounce\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Rastall\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u548cLFRW\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u538b\u529b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u71b5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 bounce\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684Rastall\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e0a\u662f\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728 bounce\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86Big Bang\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684Rastall\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u5728 bounce\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u60c5\u666f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

To model such effects, we consider a nonlocal scalar theory obtained by adding a $\u03c6\\Box^{-1}\u03c6$ term to the local action. Using the functional renormalisation group, we analyse its infrared fixed-point structure. Within the LPA, we show that nonlocality modifies phase-transition patterns and can induce symmetry breaking. Extending the LPA beyond polynomial truncations, we examine the convexity property of the effective potential as $k\\rightarrow 0$ and find that the flow becomes singular for $\u03bb^{2}>0$ before reaching the deep infrared. In the LPA$'$ framework, we find that the infrared-stable fixed point is the nonlocal Gaussian fixed point. We then generalise the model to $\u03c6\\Box^{\u03c3/2}\u03c6$ and analyse how the infrared properties depend on $\u03c3$. With appropriate scaling choices, we show that the infrared behaviour remains unchanged up to $\u03c3=d/2$ and follows Sak's prediction up to $\u03c3=2$.

The white shark optimizer has excellent global search capabilities. However, its calculation is cumbersome, programming complex and inefficient. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the white shark optimizer, it is improved by using the Tent map, introducing the dynamic nonlinear time factor, setting the automatic termination condition and adding the three-step search method. The improved white shark optimizer is applied to the integer-pixel displacement search. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sub-pixel displacement calculation, an improved surface fitting method is proposed by combining bicubic interpolation, improved white shark optimizer and surface fitting method. Through grayscale interpolation, the distance between the fitting points is reduced, and the accuracy of search of the surface fitting method is further improved. The performance of the improved white shark optimizer and the improved surface fitting method is tested by simulated speckle pattern. Test results revealed that the computational efficiency of the improved white shark optimizer is comparable to that of the particle swarm optimization, and the search success rate is as high as 100%. The calculation accuracy of the improved surface fitting method is comparable to that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm, but the computational efficiency is much higher than that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm.

Graph states are used in many applications, such as measurement-based quantum computation, as multipartite entangled resources. It is thus crucial to understand when two such states have the same entanglement, i.e. when they can be transformed into each other using only local operations. In this case, we say that the graph states are LU-equivalent (local unitary). If the local operations are restricted to the so-called Clifford group, we say that the graph states are LC-equivalent (local Clifford). Interestingly, a simple graph rule called local complementation fully captures LC-equivalence, in the sense that two graph states are LC-equivalent if and only if the underlying graphs are related by a sequence of local complementations. While it was once conjectured that two LU-equivalent graph states are always LC-equivalent, counterexamples do exist and local complementation fails to fully capture the entanglement of graph states. We introduce in this thesis a generalization of local complementation that does fully capture LU-equivalence. Using this characterization, we prove the existence of an infinite strict hierarchy of local equivalences between LC- and LU-equivalence. This also leads to the design of a quasi-polynomial algorithm for deciding whether two graph states are LU-equivalent, and to a proof that two LU-equivalent graph states are LC-equivalent if they are defined on at most 19 qubits. Furthermore, we study graph states that are universal in the sense that any smaller graph state, defined on any small enough set of qubits, can be induced using only local operations. We provide bounds and an optimal, probabilistic construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases.

Conventional static Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$, DFT+$U$+$V$) incorrectly predict a deep-valence Fe $3d$ peak (around $-7\\,\\text{eV}$) in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, in contradiction with hard-X-ray photoemission. We resolve this failure by using a recent generalization of DFT+$U$ to include a frequency-dependent screening -- DFT+$U(\u03c9)$ -- or using a dynamical Hubbard functional (dynH). The screened Coulomb interaction $U(\u03c9)$, computed with spin-polarized RPA and projected onto maximally localized Fe $3d$ Wannier orbitals, is expressed as a sum-over-poles, yielding a self-energy that augments the Kohn--Sham Hamiltonian.

Prepared for the proceedings of the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24), Glasgow, 14-18 July 2025", "summary": "Current state-of-the-art approaches to black hole (BH) dynamics, encompassing several effective approximation schemes, offer a remarkable control of the quantitative aspects of strong gravity. They also provide key insights into some qualitative aspects of the problem. In spite of this, there remain blind spots that hinder the understanding of the mechanisms underlying some observed phenomena, in particular concerning simplicity and universality in BH spacetimes. Adopting an 'asymptotic reasoning' approach, by filtering non-essential degrees of freedom, can potentially unveil universality patterns by identifying key underlying structural stability mechanisms. We first illustrate such an asymptotic approach by focusing on a BH quasinormal (QNM) Weyl's law, that accounts for the universal asymptotics of the QNM \"counting function\". This permits to identify light-trapping and the (local) redshift effect as the underlying mechanisms, also offering a bridge to the universal patterns found in BH QNM spectral instability. As a by-product, Weyl's law universality formally opens an observational access to spacetime (effective) dimensionality. More heuristically, we sketch a program recently put forward to apply such 'asymptotic reasoning' to address the observed simplicity and universality patterns in binary BH merger dynamics. This program is built as a hierarchy of asymptotic models, potentially making contact with integrability theory in gravity, namely through the background sector in a \"wave-mean flow\" approach to BH binary dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u6df1\u7684\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fd1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u975e\u672c\u8d28\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9ed1\u6d1e\u91cf\u5b50\u8272\u53d8\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u8c31\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5149\u6355\u83b7\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ea2\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8272\u53d8\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Routing entanglement in quantum networks poses several fundamental as well as technical challenges, including the high dynamicity of quantum network links and the probabilistic nature of quantum operations. Consequently, designing hand-crafted heuristics is difficult and often leads to suboptimal performance, especially if global network topology information is unavailable.\n  In this paper, we propose RELiQ, a reinforcement learning-based approach to entanglement routing that only relies on local information and iterative message exchange. Utilizing a graph neural network, RELiQ learns graph representations and avoids overfitting to specific network topologies - a prevalent issue for learning-based approaches. Our approach, trained on random graphs, consistently outperforms existing local information heuristics and learning-based approaches when applied to random and real-world topologies. When compared to global information heuristics, our method achieves similar or superior performance because of its rapid response to topology changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces RELiQ, a reinforcement learning-based entanglement routing approach in quantum networks powered by graph neural networks, which outperforms existing methods despite relying only on local information.", "motivation": "Optimizing entanglement routing in quantum networks presents challenges due to dynamic and probabilistic elements, making traditional heuristic-based solutions less effective.

It focuses on local information exchange and iterative message passing, enabling it to learn from environment interactions without requiring global topology knowledge.", "result": "The study demonstrates that RELiQ surpasses existing local information-based heuristics and learning-based methods in performance, particularly when evaluated against various topologies including real-world ones. It also matches or exceeds the performance of global information-based approaches, thanks to its ability to respond swiftly to changes in network topology.", "conclusion": "RELiQ presents a promising alternative for entanglement routing in quantum networks, offering a scalable, efficient, and responsive solution that addresses the limitations of conventional routing strategies. It suggests that machine learning techniques, especially those that minimize reliance on global information, could be valuable in advancing quantum network technologies."}}

It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory.

Two optical bistability regions are observed, including a distinctive direct mode-locking to non-lasing transition during pump down-sweep, absent in previous EDFL studies. Stable soliton-like pulses and stepwise pulse-number hysteresis further indicate first-order phase-transition-like dynamics. These results show that low-saturation intensity SAs offer a compact route to bistability-assisted pulse formation in fiber lasers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u7684COF\u5438\u6536\u4f53\u5728EDFL\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u652f\u6301\u975e\u53d1\u6001\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u4ee5\u53ca\u9501\u6a21\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u6362\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u6cf5\u4e0b\u51cf\u5e45\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u9501\u6a21\u5230\u975e\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6b64\u524dEDFL\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u3002\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b64\u5b50\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u9636\u68af\u72b6\u8109\u640f\u6570\u91cf'hysteresis'\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u9636\u76f8\u53d8-like\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u9971\u548c\u5ea6SAs\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u8f85\u52a9\u8109\u51b2\u5f62\u6210\u5728\u5149\u7ea4\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u7ea4\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u5728 various \u5207\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u3002\u5149\u5b50\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eCOF\u7684\u53ef\u4e92\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u9971\u548c\u5438\u6536\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728erbium-doped\u5149\u7ea4\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u6cf5\u6d66\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5149\u9501\u6a21\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u975e\u53d1\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5207\u6362\u3002\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5728\u6cf5\u6d66\u51cf\u5e45\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u9501\u6a21\u5230\u975e\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6b64\u524dEDFL\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u3002\u7a33\u5b9asoliton-like\u8109\u51b2\u548cstepwise\u8109\u640f\u6570\u91cf'hysteresis'\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u76f8\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u8109\u51b2\u5f62\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u9971\u548c\u5ea6COF\u9971\u548c\u5438\u4f53\u7684\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u5728\u5149\u7ea4\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u5728\u5149\u7ea4\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f4e\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u9971\u548c\u5438\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

A strong axial confinement is first introduced by growing closely spaced wurtzite (WZ) tunnel barriers in NWs to enclose a zinc blende (ZB) QD. The NW cross-section is then reduced by isotropic etching to obtain very small QDs, with a maximum observed charging energy > 30 meV. Using low-temperature electrical characterization and finite-element method simulations, we study how charging energies and the onset of electron filling scale with QD diameter. For extremely small diameters, we identify a regime where stray capacitances become non-negligible, limiting further increase in charging energy by diameter reduction alone. This approach to increasing confinement is particularly relevant for understanding the strong spin-orbit interaction observed in crystal-phase QDs, possibly linked to polarization charges at the WZ/ZB interfaces. Small diameter QDs allow considerably weaker interfering electric fields when studied, but the QDs cannot be realized with epitaxial growth alone due to a loss of crystal phase control.", "AI":

However, realistic experimental setups render the associated Bogoliubov integrals analytically intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the Inertial Replacement Method (IRM), a hybrid analytic-numerical framework for computing Bogoliubov coefficients for general moving-mirror trajectories. The IRM replaces the asymptotically inertial portions of a trajectory with analytic inertial extensions, so that numerical evaluation is required only for the finite accelerating segment. We derive perturbative error bounds for both perfectly and imperfectly reflecting mirrors, providing controlled accuracy estimates and guiding the choice of segmentation thresholds. The method is validated against analytically solvable trajectories and then applied to a fully numerical, PIC-based Chen-Mourou plasma-mirror trajectory relevant to the planned AnaBHEL experiment. A key physical insight emerging from this analysis is that the radiation spectrum is determined almost entirely by the finite accelerating region, with negligible sensitivity to the far-past and far-future inertial motion. These results establish the IRM as a reliable and broadly applicable computational tool for modeling particle creation in realistic analog-gravity systems such as AnaBHEL.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The full non-linear dynamics of these fluctuations can be encoded in a one-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity, which we construct explicitly. We provide its complete Lagrangian, up to second order in fermions, together with the corresponding supersymmetry transformations. We further discuss real forms of the theory for non-compact gauge groups and their embeddings into ten-dimensional supergravities with Lorentzian signature.

The framework generalizes straightforwardly to an arbitrary number of incident plane-wave components, enabling intuitive control of the transmitted angular spectrum through interference engineered at the aperture. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the closed-form model and characterize the influence of slit geometry, wavelength, partial coherence, and Gaussian beam width.

The knot structures have recently been observed in condensed matters, as examplified by a magnetic hopfion, sparking interest in controlling their topology. Here, we show that spin-orbit torque (SOT) enables dynamic manipulation of the Hopf number of magnetic hopfions.

To bridge this crucial gap, this work presents the first systematic analysis of strong-field, wave-optical GW lensing by a Kerr black hole (BH), extending recent results for non-rotating lenses obtained in Chan et al. to the astrophysically more relevant case of spinning lens. Using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism, we compute the strong-field scattering factor (SFSF) and show that the the spin produces characteristic modifications to the lensed waveform, and high-frequency incident radiation is not strongly absorbed by the BH lens, contrary to earlier claims in Chan et al. We further derive an explicit expression for the observed waveform for the general source-lens-observer configuration, showcasing the distortions produced by the scattering and quantifying their departure from the Schwarzschild case. Specializing to on-axis scattering, a mismatch analysis for a \\texttt{GW150914}-like source lensed by a Kerr BH of mass $M=10^2M_\\odot$ situated $100GM/c^2$ away from the source reveals percentage-level deviations from the direct (unscattered) wave at scattering angles near $30^\\circ$, across a range of lens spin values. The mismatch exhibits a sharp decrease at larger scattering angles. For a fixed scattering angle, however, the mismatch shows only a weak dependence on the BH spin in the case of on-axis scattering, which may improve for more general off-axis considerations. The framework developed here offers a unified treatment of strong-field GW scattering in Kerr spacetime and provides tools for interpreting future high-precision observations of compact-object lenses in the wave-optics regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, collective effects in different contexts -- absorption, emission, and transfer -- have often been defined disparately, especially across different communities, leading to results that are not immediately transferable between different contexts. Here, we describe all three types of collective effects using a common Dicke framework that resolves the apparent discrepancies between different approaches.

In contrast to two-dimensional skyrmions, which are typically limited to small topological invariants, i.e., skyrmion numbers, hopfions can, in principle, be stabilized with arbitrary Hopf numbers. However, the nonequilibrium dynamics, especially interconversion between different Hopf numbers, remain poorly understood. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of hopfions with various Hopf numbers by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque (SOT). For $H=1$, we show that SOT induces both translational and precessional motion, with dynamics sensitive to the initial orientation. For $H=2$, we find that intermediate SOT strengths can forcibly split the hopfion into two $H = 1$ hopfions. This behavior is explained by an effective tension picture, derived from the dynamics observed in the $H=1$ case. By comparing the splitting dynamics across different $H$, we identify a hierarchical structure governing SOT-driven behavior and use it to predict the dynamics of hopfions with general $H$. Furthermore, we show that by appropriately scheduling the time dependence of the SOT, it is possible to repeatedly induce both splitting and recombination of hopfions.

The developed theoretical approach allows accounting for arbitrary nanoparticle size-distribution and the microscopic line broadening mechanisms for the optical phonons. The two tools for solving the inverse problem of the nanodiamond properties reconstruction using a known Raman spectrum are provided. The first one utilizes a dense neural network trained on a vast array of synthetic Raman spectra. The second approach is based on the stochastic Metropolis algorithm, which updates the ensemble parameters by small quantities, tending to the state with minimal error. Both methods are available thanks to the computationally instant elasticity theory-like model for optical phonon modes in diamond nanocrystals that accurately reproduces the results of the atomistic approaches. Using experimental Raman spectra for nanodiamonds prepared by various techniques, we tested our tools and observed a faithful agreement with the data as well as between the two methods.

The global structure of some regular black holes, e.g. Hayward black hole, features an event horizon and a Cauchy horizon, raising fundamental questions about the latter's stability. In this work, we investigate collapse of a scalar field in Hayward spacetime. Under weak scalar perturbations, the inner horizon maintains a stable finite radius. In the circumstance of a strong scalar field, the inner horizon shrinks to zero volume, accompanied by the formation of a spacelike singularity. The Hayward geometry is effectively converted into a Schwarzschild-like geometry. Furthermore, the strength of the scalar field governs the contraction dynamics of the inner horizon. As the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field approaches the critical threshold ${p_*}$, the radius of the inner horizon ${r_{-}}$ exhibits a universal scaling behavior: ${r_{-}}\\propto{|p - {p_*}|^\u03b3}$, with a critical exponent $\u03b3\\approx 0.5$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Scalar fields in regular black holes cause inner horizons to shrink or vanish, forming singularities depending on perturbation strength and initial conditions.", "motivation": "Understanding how scalar fields affect black hole singularities is key to exploring spacetime's structure and the nature of singularities.", "method": "Mathematical analysis of scalar field perturbations in Hayward spacetime, examining weak and strong field behaviors.", "result": "Inner horizons either collapse to zero size or vanish, creating singularities at thresholds of field strength and profile parameters.", "conclusion": "This suggests a transition in black hole singularities governed by scalar field properties, proposing new insights into spacetime singularities and their scaling behaviors."}}

To address this limitation, we propose a quantum resource degradation theory based on the decomposition of observational entropy. We demonstrate that the total inconsistency measure, $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathcal{C}}$, can be decomposed into two independent components: inter-block coherence, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{rel}}$, and intra-block noise, $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{rel}}$. This decomposition reveals a significant degradation mechanism: under specific free operations, quantum coherence degrades into classical noise. Consequently, even when the total resource quantity is conserved, its quality decreases. This is quantified by the resource purity metric, $\u03b7$. Our theory provides greater detail than conventional approaches that rely solely on monotonicity. It also establishes a new framework for understanding quantum resource dynamics. We validate the theory through numerical experiments on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), demonstrating its utility in diagnosing and explaining the barren plateau phenomenon (BPP).

In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power.\n  Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time \"tails\", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.\n  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5916\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\uff0c\u6cbf\u5f84\u5411\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6ce2\u89e3\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1ePrice\u5b9a\u5f8b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f4e\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u89e3\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u6162\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e42\u6b21\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5916\u90e8\u6ce2\u89e3\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u975e\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u89e3\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5c3e\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c3e\u90e8\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u539f\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfb\u5e38\u8870\u51cf\u7279\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6ce2\u7b97\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u975e\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u89e3\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u6bd4Price\u5b9a\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6162\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e42\u6b21\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u51cf\u901f\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u53cd\u6bd4\u4f8b\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Price\u5b9a\u5f8b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce2\u65b9\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u548c\u9759\u6001\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Central to our construction is the identification of a harmonic higher-form symmetry which uniquely determines the field-strength and resolves the tension between Bianchi identities and dynamical equations of motion. Gauging this symmetry reproduces the flux-based description due to Sen and shows that the quantum consistency checks established for Sen's formalism are automatically subsumed by our action. Unlike Sen's flux-based formalism, our framework admits a simple minimal coupling to matter, the Witten effect, and extends readily to non-Abelian gauge fields.

However, qubits typically have multilevel structures making them prone to unwanted transitions from fast gates. This leakage out of the computational subspace is especially detrimental to algorithms as it has been observed to cause long-lived errors, such as in quantum error correction. This forces a choice between either achieving fast gates or having low leakage. Previous works focus on suppressing leakage by mitigating the first to second excited state transition, overlooking multi-photon transitions, and achieving faster gates with further reductions in leakage has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate single qubit gates with a total leakage error consistently below $2.0\\times10^{-5}$, and obtain fidelities above $99.98\\%$ for pulse durations down to 6.8 ns for both $X$ and $X/2$ gates. This is achieved by removing direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels using a double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which we name the R2D method. Moreover, we find that at such short gate durations and strong driving strengths the main error source is from these higher order transitions. This is all shown in the widely-used superconducting transmon qubit, which has a weakly anharmonic level structure and suffers from higher order transitions significantly. We also introduce an approach for amplifying leakage error that can precisely quantify leakage rates below $10^{-6}$. The presented approach can be readily applied to other qubit types as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u9664\u8d85\u5bfc\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8dc3\u8fc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5355\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u5c04\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u6027\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5feb\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u6f0f\u5c04\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u9012\u5f52\u5b9e\u73b0DRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08R\u00b2D\u00b2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u591a\u80fd\u7ea7\u8dc3\u8fc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6f0f\u5c04\u7387\uff08\u5c0f\u4e8e2e-5\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08\u8d85\u8fc799.98%\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5c0f\u4e8e6.8ns\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u4e0bX\u548cX/2\u95e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8699.98%\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u6f0f\u5c04\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e2e-5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86R\u00b2D\u00b2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u5bfc\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u6f0f\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

But the progress is accompanied with increasing demands in computational resources and power supply. Reservoir neuromorphic computing uses a non-linear physical system to replace a part of a large neural network. The advantages can include reduced power consumption and faster learning. We show that the interference in an organic crystal waveguide resonator leads to efficient separation of optical patterns, allowing a significant reduction of the size of the neural network and an acceleration of the learning process.

In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll.", "AI": {"tldr": " paper discusses entanglement features of cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflation.

The created pairs extract energy from the electric field, resulting in nontrivial backreaction. In this paper, we study 1+1D massive QED subject to strong external electric fields in a self-consistent and fully quantum manner. We use the bosonized version of the theory, which attains a cosine interaction term in the presence of nonzero fermion mass $m$. However, the assumption of strong electric field justifies a perturbative treatment of the cosine interaction, i.e., an expansion in $m$. We calculate the vacuum expectation value of the electric field to first order in $m$ and show that -- surprisingly -- it satisfies a classical nonlinear partial differential equation (related to the sine-Gordon equation). We show that the electric field exhibits dissipation-free oscillations (analogous to ordinary plasma oscillations) and calculate the plasma frequency analytically. We also compare to the semiclassical approximation commonly used to study backreaction, showing that it fails to capture the $O(m)$ shift in the plasma frequency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u534a\u6574\u6570QED\u5728\u5f3a\u5916\u52a0\u7535\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e00\u9636\u5fae\u6270\u4e0b\u7535\u573a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6ee1\u8db3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u65e0\u8017\u6563\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7c7b\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5916\u52a0\u7535\u573a\u8db3\u591f\u5f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u4e30\u5bcc\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4e3a\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u534a\u6574\u6570QED\u7684\u6b63\u5219 boson\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u8bba\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9879\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u5916\u7535\u573a\u8db3\u591f\u5f3a\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u8d28\u91cfm\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u7ea7\u5fae\u6270\u5c55\u5f00\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u7535\u573a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u5fae\u6270\u89e3\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e00\u9636\u5fae\u6270\u4e0b\uff0c\u7535\u573a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0esinh-Gordon\u65b9\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u8be5\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7535\u573a\u7684\u632f\u52a8\u662f\u65e0\u8017\u6563\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8272\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e0e\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u8d28\u91cf\u9879\u5bf9\u8272\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6b63\u5219boson\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u7ea7\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u8272\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u9636\u5fae\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u751f\u4ea7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that a two-dimensional array of three-level atoms operating under electromagnetically induced transparency can function as a tunable dual-band atomic mirror, where two independently controllable reflection bands emerge from the collective optical responses mediated by dipole-dipole interactions. These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure. This scheme provides a fully tunable dual-band atomic mirror operating across broad frequency and angular ranges, offering a practical and experimentally accessible pathway toward reconfigurable photonic elements in atomic-array platforms at low energy levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8272\u7f51\u7edc\u539f\u5b50\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u80fd\u7ea7\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u78c1\u8bf1\u5bfc\u900f\u660e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u53cc\u9891\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u6805\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u53d6\u5411\u3001\u5165\u5c04\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6676\u683c\u5e38\u6570\u7b49\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u6805\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u884d\u5c04\u7ea7\u6570\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u5143\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u5149\u6805\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u80fd\u7ea7\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u8bf1\u5bfc\u900f\u660e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u9891\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u6805\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u539f\u5b50\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u5143\u5668\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u8272\u7f51\u7edc\u539f\u5b50\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u675f\u539f\u5b50\u6e90\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u7ef4\u7684\u4e09\u80fd\u7ea7\u539f\u5b50\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u78c1\u8bf1\u5bfc\u900f\u660e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u53cc\u9891\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u6805\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u675f\u524d\u9762\u7684\u76f4\u5c04\u6ce2\u573a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u53d6\u5411\u3001\u5165\u5c04\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6676\u683c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u8c03\u63a7\u4e86\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u6805\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1. \u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u53cc\u9891\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u6805\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bbd\u8c31\u6bb5\u548c\u5bbd\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u5149\u6805\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u53d6\u5411\u3001\u5165\u5c04\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6676\u683c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u5149\u6805\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\uff1b3. \u989d\u5916\u7684\u884d\u5c04\u7ea7\u6570\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8303\u56f4\uff1b4. \u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u5143\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u80fd\u7ea7\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u53cc\u8272\u7f51\u7edc\u539f\u5b50\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u53d6\u5411\u3001\u5165\u5c04\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6676\u683c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u53cc\u9891\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u6805\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c55\u53ef\u91cd\u6392\u5149\u5b50\u5143\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u5143\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

There is a stronger version, known as supercatalysis, in which the borrowed catalyst is returned in an enhanced form, i.e. more entangled. However, this phenomenon has remained little explored. In this work we introduce the supercatalytic entanglement gain as a figure of merit taking values in [0,1] that quantifies the performance of the protocol (with 0 corresponding to the standard case of catalysis and 1 representing the maximal possible gain) and we study in which cases it can be greater than zero and which strategies can maximize it. While it turns out that every catalytic transformation can be implemented in a supercatalytic fashion with entanglement gain equal to 1 if the state that is borrowed is chosen appropriately, other choices can make the gain strictly less than 1 and even 0. In fact, we prove that a large class of catalytic transformations are not fully supercatalyzable, i.e. there is at least one choice of catalyst for which the entanglement gain vanishes. On the other hand, the construction that shows that supercatalysis is always possible with maximal gain uses artificially highly entangled catalysts. For this reason, we also study minimal supercatalysis, where the entanglement content of the borrowed state is constrained in a precise and natural way. While we consider a scenario where we prove it is impossible to have entanglement gain equal to 1 in this case, we show that there exist minimal supercatalytic transformations with gain as close to 1 as desired. We also explore several examples and observe that, although choosing a catalyst with the least possible entanglement is often an optimal strategy for minimal supercatalysis, this is not necessarily always the case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8d85\u7ea7\u50ac\u5316\u5316\u7387\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7b49caled\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u8d85\u7ea7\u50ac\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u7ea7\u50ac\u5316\u5316\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u914d\u65b9\u626b\u63cf\u4f4d\u5316\u7b49\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u7ea7\u50ac\u5316\u5316\u7387\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u50ac\u5316\u5316\u7387\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u914d\u65b9\u626b\u63cf\u4f4d\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u7ea7\u50ac\u5316\u5316\u7387\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u914d\u65b9\u626b\u63cf\u4f4d\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

The theory contains a metric curvature tensor, together with a curvature tensor constructed from an independent affine connection. We will show that the model could be written as a bi-scalar-tensor gravity with a non-minimal coupling between matter sector and a scalar field. The theory will then be confronted with observational data from Cosmic Chronometers, BAO dataset from DESI and the Pantheon$^+$ dataset. We will show that the theory could be a good alternative to the $\u039b$CDM model with the difference that the conservation of the baryonic matter sector holds only at the background level. The statefinder analysis will also be applied to the theory and it is observed that the DE behavior of the theory exhibits a quintessence to phantom transition occurs at redshifts around $z\\approx0.86$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7c7b\u6df7\u5408\u5ea6\u91cf-\u5e15\u62c9\u8482\u5c3c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a $\u039b$CDM \u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53cc\u591a\u9879\u6807\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u3002\u72b6\u6001\u68c0\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e9a quintessence \u5230 phantom \u8f6c\u53d8\u51fa\u73b0\u5728 $z \rapprox 0.86$ \u9644\u8fd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u5ea6\u91cf-\u5e15\u62c9\u8482\u5c3c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u7269\u8d28-\u51e0\u4f55\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e Cosmological \u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982 Cosmological Chronometers\u3001BAO\u3001Pantheon$^+$ \u7b49\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a $\u039b$CDM \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5177\u6709 Promise\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u6697\u80fd\u6e90\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u543b\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e9a quintessence \u5230 phantom \u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Pleba\u0144ski--Demia\u0144ski family. Here we demonstrate that the whole class admits a hidden symmetry encoded in the non-degenerate conformal Killing--Yano 2-form. Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Pleba\u0144ski--Demia\u0144ski class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full \"tower of symmetries\". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics. Moreover, as we shall show, the novel spacetimes provide an interesting test-ground for studying the recently defined Penrose charges whose existence is intrinsically related to hidden rather than explicit symmetries.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although the underlying differential equation of motion is quite different from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the instantaneous frequency spectrum of the proposed circuit is not linear, the probability of the LZT in circuits (circuit LZT for short), based on our new definition for norm-unconserved systems, still follows the laws of the LZT in quantum systems, co-determined by the linear sweeping rate $\u03b1'$ and the frequency gap $\u0394$, i.e., approaching the analytical value $\\exp(-\u03c0\u0394^2/2\u03b1')$, regardless of whether the coupling is reciprocal or nonreciprocal. The deep relationship between the circuit LZT and its quantum counterpart can be established through a linearization and block-diagonalization process.

Such high-performance time dissemination can support a variety of applications, including position, navigation and timing (PNT), financial transactions, metrology, as well as entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD). Demonstrations of WR over significantly longer distances remain few and far between, particularly in scenarios where intermediate amplification is unavailable, such as stretches of long-haul underwater fibre. In this work, we report the longest unrepeated deployment of WR to date, achieving time synchronisation over a 300 km (51.34 dB) single-span optical fibre link, even in highly asymmetrical configurations, with 99.86% uptime, whilst maintaining picosecond-level precision and sub-nanosecond accuracy. This was achieved through careful selection and optimisation of the components deployed at the link's end points.

If we consider a quantum interferometer featuring Heisenberg-limited sensitivity, then a typical result is that introducing coupling with the environment degrades the sensitivity to the shot-noise limit. Here we argue that this result crucially depends on whether the interferometer-environment coupling term is subject (or not) to the so-called Kac rescaling that restores extensivity, i.e., whether the coupling Hamiltonian is extensive or not. We present results of the Lindblad equation in the presence and absence of Kac rescaling of the coupling constant. Our results show that for a linear coupling and a harmonic model of the environment, often used in modeling of a quantum interferometer coupled with an environment, the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity may be restored after the Kac rescaling. This result points out the need and the importance to characterize the (model of the) environment of the interferometer at hand.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7Kac\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590dHeisenberg\u6781\u9650\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6062\u590dHeisenberg\u6781\u9650\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acbLindblad\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6709\u548c\u65e0Kac\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u5ea6\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u548c\u7b80\u8c10\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Kac\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590dHeisenberg\u6781\u9650\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u548c\u7b80\u8c10\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u660e\u786eKac\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u5ea6\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

This procedure preserves the flux configuration while converting semi-detangled geometries into ABF lattices with nontrivial hopping structure. The resulting flat bands admit compact localized states (CLSs) whose support includes both the flux-threaded plaquettes and auxiliary sites introduced by the unitary transformations. In these TRS-broken constructions, the CLSs host localized circulatory currents whose magnitude depends on the applied flux.

However, because the probed structures are smaller than the THz wavelength, finite-size and environmental effects can strongly influence the measured response. Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances.

In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes.

Introducing the concept of locally trivial pseudospectra (LTP), we show such assumptions are necessary for spectral computation. LTP adapts dynamically to system energies, enabling spectral analysis across a broad class of challenging non-Hermitian problems. Exploiting this framework, we overcome a longstanding obstacle by computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the imaginary cubic oscillator $H_{\\mathrm{B}} = p^2 + i x^3$ with error bounds and no spurious modes -- yielding, to our knowledge, the first such error-controlled result. We confirm, for instance, the 100th eigenvalue as $627.6947122484365113526737029011536\\ldots$.

The parameters of these ansatzes can be initialized from the output of a coupled cluster, singles and doubles (CCSD) calculation performed on a classical computer. However, truncating the number of repetitions of the ansatz, as well as discarding interactions to accommodate the connectivity constraints of near-term quantum processors, degrade the approximation to CCSD and the resulting energy accuracy. In this work, we propose two methods to improve the parameter initialization. The first method, which is applicable to both expectation value- and sample-based algorithms, uses compressed double factorization of the CCSD amplitudes to improve or recover the CCSD approximation. The second method, which is applicable to sample-based algorithms, uses approximate tensor network simulation to improve the quality of samples produced by the ansatz circuit. We validate our methods using exact state vector simulation on systems of up to 52 qubits, as well as experiments on superconducting quantum processors using up to 65 qubits.

Some of these states are localized at the side surfaces of the slab, some of them prefer top/bottom surfaces and some are localized in the hinges.

This approach enables observation of quantum effects in spectral regimes where conventional single-photon sources and detectors are unavailable or require cryogenic conditions. By constructing a high-fidelity approximation of a single-photon state with phase-averaged coherent states, we observe the normalized second-order intensity correlation dips significantly below the classical limit of 0.5.

These models generalize the $\u03c0$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Beyond symmetric models, we show that certain patterns of mirror-symmetry breaking induce selective boundary gap closings confined to a single boundary orientation while the bulk and other boundaries remain gapped. This mechanism extends to three dimensions, yielding hinge- and corner-selective transitions. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetry, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It is equal to the square of the minimum Bhattacharyya coefficient between the probability distributions induced by quantum measurements on the two states.

Here we address this gap, with a focus on minimal optimal measurements, which admit no nontrivial coarse graining that is still optimal. We show that there exists either a unique minimal optimal measurement or infinitely many inequivalent choices. Moreover, the first case holds if and only if the two density operators satisfy a weak commutativity condition.

We write down the associated Keldysh action and study its behavior for the specific case of the Ising Chain with monitoring of particle density and tunable anisotropy, interpolating between free fermions with strong U(1) symmetry and the Ising chain with Z$_2$ symmetry. We derive the effective field theory in terms of slowly varying fields and obtain the replica-diagonal saddle point, which we show to describe the average state.

Here we introduce an efficient estimation protocol by virtue of common randomized measurements (CRM) integrated with shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, which only requires $1/\u03b5$ circuits. Moreover, in many scenarios of practical interest, in the presence of depolarizing or Pauli noise for example, our protocol only requires a constant number of circuits, irrespective of the infidelity $\u03b5$ and the qubit number.

Here, we report the realization of a photon-pressure platform, in which a GHz circuit interacts with a MHz circuit via a magnetic-flux-tunable combination of dispersive and dissipative photon-pressure. In addition, both coupling rates are considerably enhanced by nonlinearities of the GHz-mode, which leads to the multi-photon coupling rates scaling stronger with the pump photon number $n_\\mathrm{c}$ than the usual $\\sqrt{n_\\mathrm{c}}$ dependence. We demonstrate that interference of the two interaction paths leads to a Fano-like response in photon-pressure induced transparency, and that the dynamical backaction is considerably modified compared to the dispersive case, including a parametric instability caused by a red-detuned pump tone.", "AI": {"tldr": " photon \u538b\u529b\u5e73\u53f0\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u5bfc\u7535\u8def\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 GHz \u65b9\u6cd5\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e MHz \u88c5\u7f6e\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u7387\u968f\u6cf5\u5149\u6570 n_c \u7684\u589e\u52a0\u6bd4 sqrt(n_c) \u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": " \u672c\u6587\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u5bfc\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5149\u538b\u529b\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5149-\u673a\u68b0Hamiltonian\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u4e0e\u6697\u7269\u8d28search\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": " \u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u8d85\u5bfc\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9891\u79fb\u8c03\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 GHz\u88c5\u7f6e\u4e0e MHz \u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u7684\u5149\u538b\u529b\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8026\u5408\u7387\u3002", "result": " \u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e24\u8026\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3cFano\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5149\u538b\u529b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7ea2\u79fb\u8c03\u5236\u6ce2\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5149-\u673a\u68b0Hamiltonian\u7684\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u4e0e\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We analyze how fluctuations in qubit frequency, drive amplitude, and coherence affect gate performance over time. The robust pulses suppress coherent errors from drive amplitude drifts over 15 times more than a Gaussian pulse with derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) corrections. Furthermore, the robust gates, originally designed to compensate for quasi-static errors, also demonstrate resilience to stochastic, time-dependent noise, which is reflected in the dephasing time.

A central task is to identify a minimal set of generators from which the algebra can be constructed. The classical search for such generators has so far relied on greedy construction steps applied to an exponentially growing number of candidate operators, making it rapidly computationally intractable. We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits. The presented mathematical framework is general and applicable well beyond chemistry in fields including quantum error correction, quantum control, quantum machine learning, and more universally wherever compact Pauli basis are required.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a new method for constructing Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs) for Lie Algebras, which are essential in quantum chemistry and other fields.

However, their low formation yield, both at the single-defect and ensemble levels, has limited further progress. Here, we demonstrate a controllable and efficient method for generating modified divacancy color centers in 4H-SiC via oxygen-ion implantation. Based on their distinct optical signatures and spin-resonance characteristics, we experimentally resolve four types of modified divacancies. Remarkably, single modified divacancies constitute above 90% of the total defect population and exhibit superior optical properties and spin coherence compared with defects created through conventional carbon- or nitrogen-ion implantation. We characterize the zero-phonon lines of these modified divacancies and reveal a distinct temperature-dependent behavior in the spin-readout contrast. By systematically optimizing the implantation dose and annealing temperature, we further achieve high-density ensembles and observe clear Rabi-oscillation beating patterns associated with different orientations of basal-type defects. These results establish oxygen-ion implantation as a powerful and versatile approach to engineering high-quality spin-active defects in SiC, representing a significant advance toward scalable solid-state quantum technologies.

The probability of the scattering of the system of the entangled photons is described by the Pryce-Ward cross section dependent on a difference of the azimuthal scattering angles in the fixed coordinate frame, while the independent scattering of single photons is described by the Klein-Nishina cross section dependent on the azimuthal angle relative to each photon's initial polarization. Since the singlet state of orthogonal polarizations is rotationally invariant, it does not carry any physical information on the initial polarizations of the single annihilation photons. In such bipartite state the angular origin for the Klein-Nishina cross section is undefined, making the Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina descriptions mutually exclusive. However, semi-classical simulations of the joint Compton scattering of entangled photons - implementing the Pryce-Ward cross section, but still treating the two photons as separate entities - can reconcile the Pryce-Ward correlations with the Klein-Nishina statistics for single photons by implementing a modified version of a scattering cross section presented in this work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u4ece\u57fa\u6001\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u6e6e\u706d\u4e2d\u91ca\u653e\u5e76\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u6781\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u5f62\u6210\u6781\u5927\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5f53\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7ecf\u5386\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6563\u5c04\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u76f8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u6563\u5c04\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002\u666e\u8d56\u65af-\u6c83\u5fb7\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6563\u5c04\u5149\u5b50\u89d2\u5ea6\u5dee\u7684\u8272\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\u7531 Klein-Nishina \u622a\u9762\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6781\u5316\u6001\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0a\u662f\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u643a\u5e26\u5173\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6e6e\u706d\u5149\u5b50\u6781\u5316\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e8c\u5143\u6001\u4e2d\uff0cKlein-Nishina \u622a\u9762\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u539f\u70b9\u662f\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u666e\u8d56\u65af-\u6c83\u5fb7\u548c Klein-Nishina \u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0d\u53ef\u8c03\u548c\u3002\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u60c5\u51b5\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u666e\u8d56\u65af-\u6c83\u5fb7\u622a\u9762\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u666e\u8d56\u65af-\u6c83\u5fb7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7684 Klein-Nishina \u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u76f8\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5728\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u79bb\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u666e\u8d56\u65af-\u6c83\u5fb7\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u8272\u76f8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u5355\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50 Klein-Nishina \u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u666e\u8d56\u65af-\u6c83\u5fb7\u622a\u9762\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8c03\u548c\u666e\u8d56\u65af-\u6c83\u5fb7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7684 Klein-Nishina \u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The framework finds a well-suited problem-specific structure of a variational ansatz. Among possible implementations of QAS the reinforcement learning (RL) stands out as one of the most promising. Current RL approaches are single-agent-based and show poor scalability with a number of qubits due to the increase of the action space dimension and the computational cost. We propose a novel multi-agent RL algorithm for QAS with each agent acting separately on its own block of a quantum circuit. This procedure allows to significantly accelerate the convergence of the RL-based QAS and reduce its computational cost.

We show that the proposed approach drastically outperforms existing methods, reducing qubit requirements where previous approaches are unable to do so for popular quantum circuits such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Fourier Transform~(QFT), and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) ans\u00e4tze, as well as leading to improvements of up to 95% for sparse random circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9QP_E\u3001QFT\u548cVQE\u7b49\u7535\u8def\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u8def\u5355\u5143\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5982\u7ecf\u5178\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95e8\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5f97\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u66f4\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9QP_E\u3001QFT\u548cVQE\u7b49\u5178\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Since the inception of the field, the choice of the cavity frequency was, with a few exceptions, been limited to a narrow range around 7 GHz due to a variety of fundamental and practical considerations. Here we report the first cQED implementation, where the qubit remains a regular transmon at about 5 GHz frequency, but the cavity's fundamental mode raises to 21 GHz. We demonstrate that (i) the dispersive shift remains in the conventional MHz range despite the large qubit-cavity detuning, (ii) the quantum efficiency of the qubit readout reaches 8%, (iii) the qubit's energy relaxation quality factor exceeds $10^7$, (iv) the qubit coherence time reproducibly exceeds $100~\u03bc\\rm{s}$ and can reach above $300~\u03bc\\rm{s}$ with a single echoing $\u03c0$-pulse correction. The readout error is currently limited by an accidental resonant excitation of a non-computational state, the elimination of which requires minor adjustments to the device parameters. Nevertheless, we were able to initialize the qubit in a repeated measurement by post-selection with $2\\times 10^{-3}$ error and achieve $4\\times 10^{-3}$ state assignment error.

We investigate the manipulation of single-photon scattering via a driven $\u039b$-type emitter coupled to a rectangular waveguide, examining both single- and multi-mode regimes. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism, we derive the scattering matrix and identify two distinct control mechanisms: Fano resonances induce complete reflection, and electromagnetically induce transparency (EIT) induce perfect transmission. In the single-mode regime, the external drive parameters-the detuning and Rabi frequency-precisely tune the positions and number of reflection peaks, allowing dynamic spectral engineering. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference between modes governs the scattering dynamics.

However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our results reveal that wave-particle duality in induced coherence is not limited by interferometer geometry but by measurement optimality in zero-error discrimination on the idler, with experimentally testable consequences predicting distinguishability beyond that inferred from visibility alone. In the presence of thermal noise we derive the hierarchy V <= F(rho_A, rho_B) <= P_I^{opt}, linking visibility, fidelity, and optimal discrimination.

Motivated by this question, we propose an essential geometric perspective on quantum cryptography in which projective Hilbert space and its entanglement foliations play a central role.

What remains secret is the choice of parameter $\u03b8$ that selects a specific entanglement functional $E_\u03b8$ and the corresponding foliation into constant-entanglement hypersurfaces. In this setting, classical messages are encoded not only in the sequence of states but also in the pattern of upward, downward, or tangential steps with respect to the hidden foliation.

We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model.

These requirements impose a strict rank bound, ruling out saturation by any faithful state.

This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms.

Second, we establish error bounds directly from experimental measurements alone, without relying on classical simulation--crucial for entering regimes of quantum advantage.

Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a simple construction of the random purification channel and explains its applications in quantum learning theory.", "motivation": "The paper addresses gaps in the understanding of random purification channels and provides clearer explanations of their properties.", "method": "A simple construction method is introduced, and its applications are systematically analyzed.", "result": "The channel is shown to purify non-i.i.d. states and to be effective in proving refined quantum divergence theorems.", "conclusion": "Simplifies the study of quantum purification techniques and expands their applicability."}}

In this work, a novel data-driven method for inferring such parameters from first-moment dynamics is presented using an open 2D quantum harmonic oscillator as an example. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain such parameters, which is obtained using the multichannel Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm; a theoretical connection of such affirmation is presented. The method is tested on the expected value of noiseless quadratures, retrieving oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, qubit-photon coupling strengths of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and a modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5% of their true values. When compared to Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new data-driven method is introduced for identifying Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems by analyzing first-moment dynamics using the mHAVOK algorithm based on Koopman operator theory, showing improved accuracy, particularly with strong dissipation.", "motivation": "Understanding Hamiltonian parameters is crucial for modeling and controlling quantum systems, especially in open environments with dissipation.
