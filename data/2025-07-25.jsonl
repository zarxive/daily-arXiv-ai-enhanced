SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to\naccommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies.\nSPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated\nf-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not\nonly sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming\ndark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily\nmodulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic\nhigh-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching\nsingle-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of\nEu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype\ndetector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier\nchain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\\pm$7 electrons in silicon\ntest samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a\ndemonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment\nin a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results.\nFinally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of\nathermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background\nenvironments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing\nperformance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our\nultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR\nprovides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing\nwith material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass\nrange of dark matter parameter space."}

The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical\nsystem, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate\nvariables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or\nquantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general\nrelativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to\nnon-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism\nthrough various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians\ndescribing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with\nlinear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians\nthat reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to\nrenormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the\nsingularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free\nblack-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning\nfrom a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside\nSchwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both\nsemi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure\nof self-gravitating compact objects and black holes."}

The y-edge ribbon\nexhibits significant spin splitting of edge-state bands in both energy and\nmomentum space, along with a strong angular dependence of the conductance. The\nobserved magnetotransport response indicates a spin quantization axis that\naligns with the out-of-plane spin quantization axis reported in previous\nexperimental studies.

Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to\nsystematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond\nchain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands\nin the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been\ncorroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude\ndistribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space\ncalculation.

Despite this advantage, CV-QKD\nis limited by challenges such as losses in terrestrial fibres and atmospheric\nscintillation in free-space channels. We introduce a QKD protocol that\nsurpasses the optimal Gaussian modulated CV-QKD (GG02) protocol by utilising\nprobabilistic filters without known physical representation. Our approach\nemploys a Gaussian filter at Alice's station and a non-Gaussian notch-like\nfilter at Bob's station. Alice's filter optimises modulation variance to\nachieve key rates near the optimal GG02 performance, while Bob's filter adapts\nthe effective channel conditions, which can result in higher key rates than the\noptimal GG02 protocol. Our security analysis avoids Gaussian extremality,\naccurately bounding Eve's information. The protocol dynamically optimises the\nsecret-key rate for rapidly changing channels, such as terrestrial links and\nsatellite-to-ground communications, and can extract keys in regions deemed\nnon-secure by parameter estimation. Implemented at software level, our protocol\nrequires no hardware modifications and can be integrated into existing QKD\nsystems.

The answer to this\nsimple question has important implications for the dynamic properties of the\ncrystal, such as the frequency of its cyclotron motion, and its phonon\nspectrum. In this work we introduce a precise definition of a sliding crystal\nand compute the corresponding current $\\mathbf{j}_c$ for topological electron\ncrystals in the presence of magnetic field. Our result is fully\nnon-perturbative, does not rely on Galilean invariance, and applies equally to\nWigner crystals and (anomalous) Hall crystals. In terms of the electron density\n$\\rho$ and magnetic flux density $\\phi$, we find that $\\mathbf{j}_c =\ne(\\rho-C\\phi)\\mathbf{v}$. Surprisingly, the current receives a contribution\nfrom the many-body Chern number $C$ of the crystal. When $\\rho = C\\phi$,\nsliding crystals therefore carry zero current. The crystalline current fixes\nthe Lorentz force felt by the sliding crystal and the dispersion of low-energy\nphonons of such crystals. This gives us a simple counting rule for the number\nof gapless phonons: if a sliding crystal carries nonzero current in a magnetic\nfield, there is a single gapless mode, while otherwise there are two gapless\nmodes. This result can also be understood from anomaly-matching of emanant\ndiscrete translation symmetries -- an idea that is also applicable to the\ndispersion of skyrmion crystals.

Our\nresults show that femtosecond-driven, ultrafast electrons provide a viable\nroute to modulate and even control bulk plasmon excitations in a volume,\nthereby extending beyond the conventional nanoplasmonics schemes on\nmanipulating surface plasmons by light. This indirect light-BP interaction\npaves the promising way for exploring fundamental light-matter interaction at\nultrafast and nanometer scales."}

The time-evolution\nof the population imbalance between the two species, as well as the coherence\nof the system are analyzed using a Bloch sphere model. We observe that the\nsystem exhibits relaxation of the Bloch vector components towards a stable\nequilibrium. In the population imbalance dynamics, the relaxation rates\npredicted by the Bogoliubov Born Green Kirkwood Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy are\nfound to be smaller than those calculated with a simple the mean field\napproximation. As for the coherence dynamics, the inclusion of correlations and\nfluctuations in the system can either increase or decrease the relaxation time,\ndepending on the initial conditions. We attribute the increase in the\nrelaxation time to the emergence of a structured noise, and the subsequent\nsuppression of certain dephasing channels. We also study the impact of\ncorrelations and fluctuations on time-averaged quantities like the drift speed,\nthe fringe visibility, the phase entanglement etc., and find the results to be\nin perfect agreement with the properties of the relaxation dynamics."}

Standard decoherence\ncorrections often lead to too strong coherence suppression. A simple and\ngeneral solution to this problem is to restrict decoherence to regions of low\nnonadiabaticity measured by the dimensionless Massey parameter. The same\nthreshold values are suitable for a variety of systems, regardless of their\nsize and absolute energy scale. When restricted to uncoupled regions, a\nGaussian overlap decoherence correction consistently leads to more accurate\npopulations than using no correction. The article also examines under what\ncircumstances it is appropriate to decohere instantaneously."}

In\nantiferromagnets, such pairs can be accessed in the ultrafast regime, where\ncoherent dynamics are dominated by magnons at the edge of the Brillouin zone.\nHowever, it has seemed impossible to generate a net spin current from coherent\nmagnon pairs. Here we show that a coherent superposition of multiple\nmagnon-pair modes can produce such a current in parity-time symmetric\nantiferromagnets. The ultrafast coherent spin currents are excited with\nlinearly polarized light, with the light polarization steering the current\ndirection. Finally, by superposing two orthogonal spin currents, circular spin\ncurrents can be generated, which have not been discussed for steady-state\ncurrents."}
