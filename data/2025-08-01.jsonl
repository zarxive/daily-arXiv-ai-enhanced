In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing\nconservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly\ndemonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We\nthen assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the\ngravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express\nthe correction in terms of generic $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to\nbe matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we\nargue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with\nfuture-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding\nphase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering\nat the same post-Newtonian order."}

Zero-Noise\nExtrapolation (ZNE), which we mainly consider in this work, is one of prominent\nquantum error mitigation methods. For algorithms with deep circuits - such as\niterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's\neffectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise. Extrapolation based\non such low-fidelity data often yields inaccurate estimates and requires\nsubstantial overhead. In this study, we propose a lightweight,\nextrapolation-based error mitigation framework tailored for structured quantum\nalgorithms composed of repeating operational blocks. The proposed method\ncharacterizes the error of the repeated core operational block, rather than the\nfull algorithm, using shallow circuits. Extrapolation is used to estimate the\nblock fidelity, followed by a reconstruction of the mitigated success\nprobability. We validate our method via simulations of the 6-qubit Grover's\nalgorithm on IBM's Aer simulator, then further evaluating it on the real\n127-qubit IBM Quantum system based on Eagle r3 under a physical noise\nenvironment. Our results, particularly those from Aer simulator, demonstrate\nthat the core block's error follows a highly consistent exponential decay.

The trade-off law holds for a broad range of\nresources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others --\nyielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel.

The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple\n(once one knows what to do) but its reasons are deep: it relies on the fact\nthat quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act\non them, via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here\nis just them tip of an iceberg - it implies the need to reconsider the basic\nunderstanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far\nbeyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation."}

Specifically, we are interested\nin a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local\noperator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to\ndetermine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a\nlocal operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy\nrelative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the\npresence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant\nbump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the\nquenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the\nquenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational\nscattering involving black holes."}

This generalization enables us to\nformulate a framework for generalized Krylov complexity, which serves as a\nmeasure of the complexity of states associated with continuous symmetries\nwithin a model. Furthermore, we investigate scenarios where different\ndirections of transformation lead to varying degrees of complexity, which can\nbe compared to geometric approaches to understanding complexity, such as\nNielsen complexity. In this context, we introduce a generalized\northogonalization algorithm and delineate its computational framework, which is\nstructured as a network of orthogonal blocks rather than a simple linear chain.\nAdditionally, we provide explicit evaluations of specific illustrative examples\nto demonstrate the practical application of this framework."}

The\nphysical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological\ninvariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored\nfor static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven\nscenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet\nnon-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological\nproperties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus\nexpansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and\nformulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven\nquasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered\ncomplex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust\n(despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving\nparameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to\nemergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame\napproach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when\nappropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To\nsubstantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit\n(TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the\nskin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of\ndistinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance\nprofiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework\nfor exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible\nTEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory."}

When the particle momentum satisfies a\ncertain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a\nnormal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result\nsuggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely\nalong the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted\nas a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse\ndeflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke\nEhrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized\nangular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle\nis an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like\nvoltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall\neffect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved\nsurface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a\nbinormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron\ntransport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC\nvoltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices.\nQuantum transport on a helical nanoribbon can be controlled by tuning the bends\nand twists of its surface, suggesting diverse applications in biopolymers and\nnanotechnology."}
