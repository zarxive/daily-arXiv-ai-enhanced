Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that compared with traditional centroid-based methods, machine learning methods (particularly transformer-based architectures) achieve superior subpixel position and therefore angular resolution in discretized particle detectors. Using Geant4 Monte Carlo simulated cosmic ray muon data from an 8x8 segmented scintillator detector array, we compare four reconstruction approaches: transformer neural networks, convolutional neural networks, linear regression, and energy-weighted centroids. The transformer architecture achieves the best angular reconstruction with a root mean square error of 1.14° and a position mean absolute error of 0.24 cm, representing improvements of 2.22x and 6.33x, respectively, over the centroid method. These results enable precise particle trajectory reconstruction for applications in muon tomography and cosmic ray detection.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Synchromodulametry, a hardware-first and metric-aware measurement interface intended to make coherence, rather than coincidence, a native object of multimessenger sensor networks. The framework is organized around two derived constructs: (i) an effective observable that restores continuity of information flow under non-ideal detector liveness, including deadtime, saturation, and veto conditions; and (ii) a metric-aware delay and phase alignment layer that treats timing as a geometry-modulated control variable rather than a flat-time nuisance.
  We present a derivation-complete pipeline from raw digitized streams to normalized observables, from liveness-aware gating to causal persistence kernels implementable in firmware, from proper-time and null propagation to latency corrections, and from cross-covariance structure to a log-determinant coherence functional suitable for real-time triggering and informational tomography. In contrast to coincidence-based pipelines that collapse timing into a binary window, Synchromodulametry exposes coherence as a continuous, hardware-native state variable that persists under detector liveness gaps and metric-modulated delays.

Abstract: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that contributes significantly to human radiation exposure and must be controlled to avoid concentrations harmful to health.
  The paper presents an impulse-proportional ionization chamber that is suitable for the direct measurement of low radon concentrations in ambient air and achieves spectroscopic resolutions of 2-3%.
  This accuracy can be achieved through two novel principles. Firstly, the double-cylindrical, coaxial design of the IC allows for efficient, nearly complete detection of $α$-radiation. Secondly, a customized measurement method for spectroscopic evaluation was developed to discriminate between the proportions of 222Rn, 218Po, and 214Po and extract their concentrations. Particular attention was paid to the energy resolution of the detection system by suppressing the effects of acoustic and vibration noise on the detector's operation.
  The high spectral resolution of the developed ionization chamber, with working volumes of 7.7l and 8.7l, enables measurements with uncertainties of less than 5\% at 15-minute measurement times in ambient air with $50\,\mathrm{Bq/m^3}$ radon activity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the response of a prototype Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detector to irradiation equivalent to 10$^{11}$ 1-MeV protons/cm$^2$, which matches the expected exposure after one year of operation at full nominal luminosity at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The prototype consists of 563 channels and represents about 10 percent of the final ZDC design in terms of both channel count and detector volume. It was irradiated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) with a dose equivalent to 10$^{11}$ protons/cm$^2$. We demonstrate that, despite significant radiation damage to the SiPMs and non-uniform degradation across the detector volume, the detector can be successfully calibrated on a channel-by-channel basis using cosmic-ray data. The damage profile, similar to what is expected in the experiment, varies by an order of magnitude or more across the detector. Even for the most heavily damaged channels, the signal-to-noise ratio for a MIP signal remains above 5. This study provides a realistic test of the system's performance under irradiation. It complements previous SiPM-specific irradiation studies and will inform the future operation of the ZDC and other detectors that use SiPM-on-tile technology.

### [6] [Spectroscopy of VUV luminescence in dual-phase xenon detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20935)
*K. C. Oliver-Mallory,A. M. Baker,E. Jacquet,T. J. Sumner,H. M. Araujo*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This research presents advanced spectroscopic measurements in a novel dual-phase xenon detector configuration, leveraging liquid and gas-phase emissions for precise dark matter detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the precision of dual-phase xenon detectors used in dark matter searches by characterizing their emission properties in both liquid and gas phases.

Method: Spectroscopic measurements were conducted using liquid and gas-phase ions. Singlet and triplet excimers in the liquid phase were analyzed, alongside gas-phase electroluminescence under thermal equilibrium conditions.

Result: The liquid phase exhibits singlet and triplet emissions with peak wavelengths of 177.1 nm (singlet) and 173.3 nm (triplet), respectively, annotated with statistical and systematic uncertainties. Gas-phase electroluminescence peaks at 173.3 nm, with a minor short-wavelength tail contributing 0.6% of the spectrum. These are unprecedented measurements, combining liquid and gas-phase emissions with singlet and triplet analysis.

Conclusion: The findings provide critical data for optimizing dual-phase xenon detectors, especially for detecting rare events like dark matter interactions.

Abstract: We present spectroscopic measurements of xenon luminescence in a time projection chamber operated in a dual-phase (liquid-gas) configuration. Thorium-228 $α$ decays excited the liquid, resulting in the formation of singlet and triplet excimers that emit vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) scintillation. Ionisation electrons were drifted to the liquid surface and extracted into the vapour, where they produced VUV electroluminescence. A time-resolved photon-counting technique was used to obtain the scintillation spectrum in the liquid, which exhibited a peak wavelength of $177.1\pm0.1_\mathrm{stat} \pm0.1_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$ and a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $11.3\pm0.2_\mathrm{stat} \pm0.0_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$. The data were also used to obtain distinct singlet and triplet emission models, with the singlet emission peaking $1.8\pm0.3_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm 0.3_{\mathrm{sys}}\,\textrm{nm}$ shorter than the triplet. The gas electroluminescence spectrum was obtained simultaneously, while under conditions of thermal equilibrium. It remained consistent across vapour pressures of $1.3$-$2.2\,\textrm{bar}$, with a peak of $173.28\pm0.02_\mathrm{stat} {_{-0.1}^{+0.2}}{}_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$, a FWHM of $10.59\pm0.03_\mathrm{stat} {_{-0.2}^{+0.0}}{}_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$, and a small short-wavelength tail that constitutes $(0.6\pm0.1)$% of the total spectrum. These are the only spectroscopic measurements of liquid scintillation and gas electroluminescence acquired simultaneously to date, and the first such measurements of singlet and triplet emission in the liquid phase. They are important for precisely characterising dual-phase xenon detectors used to search for dark matter particle interactions and other rare events.

Abstract: In order to solve the continuous large cooling power supply problem (20 kW) for the radon-removal cryogenic distillation system, which operates at high liquid ffow rate of 856 kg/h (5 LPM) for the dark matter detector PandaX-xT of the next-generation, a throttling refrigeration system based on carbon tetraffuoride (R14) refrigerant for cooling power recovery is designed and developed. According to this system, the cooling power of the liquid xenon in the reboiler of 178K could be transferred to the product xenon cryostat to liquefy the gaseous product xenon by the R14 circulation, thus the liqueffed xenon could return to the detector with the same condition of which extracted from the detector to form a stable cooling cycle and prevent the instability of the detector. A research and development experiment is implemented to validate the feasibility of this large cooling recovery system, using the ethanol to simulate the liquid xenon. Experimental results show that the cooling power recovery of this system could achieve 17 kW with the efffciency of 76.5%, and the R14 ffow rate is 0.16 kg/s. This study realizes the online radon removal distillation with large ffow rate while eliminating the dependence of liquid nitrogen or cryocoolers, which means saving 2414 m3 liquid nitrogen per year or the power consumption of 230 kW. Furthermore, process simulation and optimization of the throttling refrigeration cycle is studied using Aspen Hysys to reveal the inffuences of the key parameters to the system, and the deviation between the simulation and experimental results is < 2.52%.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of a low-power photonic energy system, which uses laser light to generate electrical power through an optical fiber. The system eliminates traditional power transmission issues such as noise and interference, operates reliably in tough environments, and can be used at very low temperatures, expanding its applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Development of sustainable and reliable power generation systems, especially in challenging environments like cryogenics, is crucial for various technologies and research projects.

Method: The research employed fiber optic technology combined with photovoltaic principles, utilizing laser light to transfer electrical power. They tested the system at cryogenic temperatures and explored the tuning of sensor biases by adjusting laser power.

Result: The system demonstrated stable operation, eliminated issues like line noise and electromagnetic interference, and was functional at extremely low temperatures, indicating its robustness and versatility in diverse applications.

Conclusion: The PoF-based system offers an innovative solution for power generation, particularly beneficial for low-temperature environments, enhancing its applicability across various scientific and technological domains.

Abstract: The Power over Fiber (PoF) technology delivers electrical power by transmitting laser light through a lightweight, non-conductive fiber optic cable to a remote photovoltaic optical converter, which in turn powers sensors or electrical devices. Among the several advantages offered by this solution are spark-free operation in the presence of electric fields, elimination of noise induced by power lines, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and high robustness in hostile environments. The R\&D for the application of PoF in cryogenic environments started at FNAL and BNL (USA) in 2020 to power the Photon Detection System of the DUNE Vertical Drift module. This paper presents the results obtained in the framework of Cryo-PoF project where we developed a single-laser input line system to power an electronic amplifier and the photosensors at cryogenic temperatures. Unlike the DUNE solution, our system allows tuning of the photosensor bias by adjusting the input laser power. We also demonstrate the operation of the optical converter at temperatures down to 4.6 K, opening the possibility of using this technology in a much broader range of applications.

Conclusion: 我们的研究为未来开发更高效、更精准的纳米孔分析技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: We demonstrate a dual nanopore platform (DNP) containing a top 2D MoS2 pore in series with a 3 to 5 nm thick SiN pore, vertically separated by 30 nm, with diameters of 1.0 and 3.0 nm, respectively. This platform enables independent probing of analytes by each pore, thereby providing complementary information. We measure translocations of single amino acids (AA) and evaluate current blockades recorded across the two pores upon applying voltage. Small diameters ensured tight passage of individual AAs through the nanopores and provided a good signal-tonoise ratio (RMS current noise of 16 pA_RMS and SNR = 6). We focus on measurements of O-Phospho-L-tyrosine at 400 mV, demonstrating single amino acid detection and a good quantitative agreement with the calculated open pore and blocked currents. Based on these results, future device performance can benefit from slightly smaller pores, specifically the SiN pore, higher voltages and electrolyte concentration, and lower system noise.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study pole-skipping in non-maximally quantum chaotic systems. Using Rindler conformal field theories and the large-$q$ SYK chain as illustrative examples, we argue that the pole-skipping points of few-body operators organize into trajectories in the complex frequency-momentum plane, with the leading trajectory encoding the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime.

Method: 利用单元性和因果律，进行了推导，设计了一个EFT来描述与在in-in 边界条件下相关的传播器。

Result: 得出了在de Sitter时空中，一系列无限的两边正性界限，针对EFT的系数，这些界限可以来描述重子场的传播，从而识别出无法从一致的原初模型中产生的EFT 一共起。

Conclusion: 这些界限给出了关于原始非高斯性的一些非平凡约束，例如，在退化三明治谱线中，源自单重标量的宇宙论振荡与它的形状之间存在联系。

Abstract: Using unitarity and causality, we derive an infinite tower of two-sided positivity bounds on the effective field theory coefficients which describe the propagation of heavy fields on de Sitter spacetime. We design this EFT to describe propagators with the in-in boundary conditions that are relevant for cosmological correlators. Our positivity bounds therefore identify EFT correlators that can never emerge from a consistent underlying model of inflation. This implies non-trivial constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity; for instance the cosmological collider oscillations in the squeezed bispectrum from the exchange of a heavy scalar are tied to the shape of its EFT background.

We obtain numerical bounds on the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators, the stress-tensor central charge, and a particular combination of the 't Hooft anomaly and the current central charge. Our analysis provides the first non-perturbative constraints on four-dimensional CFTs with conserved abelian currents and establishes a framework that can be extended to theories with non-abelian global symmetries.

Abstract: We derive discontinuity relations, also known as cutting rules, and explore the analytic properties of cosmological correlators, fundamental observables of the primordial universe. Our emphasis is on how these relations arise from unitarity and hermitian analyticity in interacting quantum field theories on de Sitter space-time. Instead of analyzing wave-function coefficients, we apply these relations directly to cosmological correlators. By studying conformally coupled and massless scalar fields with $φ^n$ self-interactions, we demonstrate that the discontinuity of a cosmological correlator can be expressed as a sum of products of lower-point discontinuities, stemming from a single-cut of one internal line in the corresponding tree-level exchange Witten diagram. Notably, beyond lower-point correlators, the decomposition of the discontinuities of cosmological correlators includes contributions from auxiliary elements that consist of both the real and imaginary parts of the lower-point wave-function coefficients, which have not been reported in the existing literature. Interestingly, depending on whether $n$ is even or odd in a $φ^n$ interaction, these different lower-point discontinuities contribute as the leading or sub-leading piece in the late-time limit to the discontinuity relations. Additionally, our single-cut discontinuity relation leads to a decomposition rule for the residue of the cosmological correlators at partial energy singularities, incorporating contributions from these auxiliary objects. Through explicit calculations in several models, we confirm that our discontinuity relations are consistent with results from the in-in formalism. While primarily developed using tree-level exchanges with polynomial interactions, we also demonstrate that our framework can be extended to include loop corrections and cases with derivative interactions.

Abstract: We present remarkably simple covariant expressions for the graviton and ghost propagators in Anti-de Sitter and de-Sitter spacetimes valid in any spacetime dimension. In gravity there is a $2$-parameter family of covariant gauge-fixing conditions and the simplification occurs for a special choice of these parameters. In this gauge the graviton propagator satisfies $\nabla^μμ\nabla^νμ\, G_{μν,α'β'}(μ)=0$, where $μ$ is the geodesic distance between two points, and this condition implies an improved IR behavior. This gauge choice is not possible in flat spacetime.

Abstract: We formulate matter-coupled scaling-Carroll gravity as a gauge theory and analyze its associated gravity multiplet. After fixing the scaling symmetry, the theory is governed by the trace of the extrinsic curvature, the Carroll boost symmetry, and a vector field descending from dilatations. We show that appropriate gauge choices and geometric constraints lead to distinct regimes, including dynamical Carroll gravity, Aristotelian gravity, and a fracton gauge theory coupled to Aristotelian geometry. In the fracton phase, the Carroll boost parameter plays the role of a vector-charge gauge symmetry.

TL;DR: Black holes decohere quantum states through soft radiation, and Tomita-Takesaki theory extended for this purpose shows that decoherence mimics optimal observer presence within the black hole's interior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole decoherence and its relation to quantum information is crucial for resolving foundational questions in quantum gravity and black hole information paradox.

Method: The research extends Tomita-Takesaki theory to include soft radiation states, utilizing methods from unambiguous state discrimination and approximate quantum error correction.

Result: The study provides a new framework for the distinguishability of quantum states, particularly in relation to the memory effects of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation.

Conclusion: This work establishes that decohering environments from black holes perceive the interior as filled with optimal observers, supporting a new understanding of black hole information processes.

Abstract: It was recently shown that black holes decohere any quantum superpositions in their vicinity. This decoherence is mediated by soft radiation through the horizon, and can be understood as the result of the fact that quantum states in the exterior source distinguishable states of long-range fields in the interior. To study this phenomenon and others, we extend Tomita-Takesaki theory to accommodate states of soft radiation such as arise in the electromagnetic and gravitational memory effects, and provide a general framework for computing the distinguishability of general coherent states. Applying these tools, we use the methods of unambiguous state discrimination and approximate quantum error correction to prove some new relations regarding the distinguishability of quantum states, and the quantum information content of soft radiation, and thereby show that a black hole (or any horizon) decoheres its environment as though its interior were full of optimal observers.

Abstract: Dilatonic black hole dyon-like solutions in the gravitational
  $4d$ model with a scalar field, two 2-forms, two dilatonic coupling constants
  $λ_i \neq 0$, $i =1,2$, obeying $λ_1 \neq - λ_2$
  and the sign parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$ for scalar field kinetic term
  are overviewed. Here $\varepsilon = - 1$ corresponds to a phantom scalar field.
  The solutions are defined up to solutions of two master equations for two moduli functions, when
  $λ^2_i \neq 1/2$ for $\varepsilon = - 1$. Several integrable cases
  corresponding to Lie algebras $A_1 + A_1$, $A_2$, $B_2 = C_2$ and $G_2$ are considered.
  Some physical parameters of the solutions are derived:
  gravitational mass, scalar charge, Hawking temperature, black hole area entropy and
  PPN parameters $β$ and $γ$. Bounds on the gravitational mass
  and scalar charge (based on a certain conjecture) are presented.

Abstract: The newly discovered splitting behavior of tree-level scattering amplitudes of particles and strings has been expressed in terms of currents containing one off-shell leg. In this work, we explain how to obtain on-shell representations of the split amplitudes in different theories, thereby avoiding any ambiguity involved in the definition of the currents. Furthermore, we show that this 2-split behavior is also verified in gauge and gravity theories involving higher-dimensional operators, thereby providing additional evidence to its universal character. As a byproduct, we also generalize the transmuting operators to amplitudes in higher-derivative theories.

Abstract: We perform a topological classification of the phase structure of a four-dimensional AdS black hole with non-minimal Maxwell coupling. Critical points are treated as topological defects, allowing us to assign a winding number to each black hole branch and compute the global topological invariant W. The system exhibits a duality governed by its Maxwell charge Q: for large Q it falls into the class W = 1, displaying van der Waals-type behavior with a first-order small-large black hole transition. For small Q, it shifts to W = 0, characteristic of a Hawking-Page transition. This topological classification provides a model-independent validation of the conventional thermodynamic analysis. Crucially, we find that the non-minimal coupling lambda stabilizes the Hawking-Page universality class W=0 for black holes with non-zero charge, a phenomenon absent in the standard Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS case. This establishes a direct link between the microscopic coupling and the macroscopic topological class, demonstrating the power of topological methods in decoding thermodynamic universality across modified gravity theories.

Abstract: We study multipartite entanglement in typical pure states holographically dual to pure BTZ black holes, using multi-entropy and its ``genuine'' version. In the bulk, these quantities are computed by minimal geodesic networks (so-called Steiner trees). We find that at sufficiently high temperature, the genuine tripartite multi-entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling in sharp contrast to vacuum AdS$_3$, where the genuine contribution is universal and size-independent. Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$. As a byproduct, we also observe an intriguing ``area-law'' contribution to multi-entropy that is relevant to vacuum AdS${}_3$.

We formulate the bootstrap equations and analyze their solutions assuming the existence of a non-trivial macroscopic limit and that the spectrum organizes into a finite number of Regge trajectories. We show that current probes lead to additional bootstrap constraints that are absent in the purely scalar case, and we classify the resulting solutions.

Abstract: Discretizing the $λφ^4$ scalar field theory on a lattice yields a system of coupled anharmonic oscillators with quadratic and quartic potentials. We begin by analyzing the two coupled oscillators in the second quantization method to derive several analytic relations to the second-order perturbation, which are then employed to numerically calculate the thermal out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), $C_T(t)$. We find that the function $C_T(t)$ exhibits exponential growth over a long time window in the early stages, with Lyapunov exponent $λ\sim T^{1/4}$, which diagnoses quantum chaos. We furthermore investigate the quantum chaos properties in a closed chain of N coupled anharmonic oscillators, which relates to the 1+1 dimensional interacting quantum scalar field theory.

Abstract: Intersecting D-brane model building often suffer from the unstabilized open-string moduli, leading to the unwanted massless adjoint scalars. In our previous work arXiv:2505.03664, this issue was resolved by employing the rigid D6-branes on the $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\prime)$ orientifold with discrete torsion, where fractional cycles eliminate all adjoint scalars. In this paper, we construct new three-family flux models in the Type IIB setup on $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$, T-dual to the Type IIA rigid D6-brane construction with discrete torsion, by introducing the quantized background $G_3$ flux that stabilizes the closed-string complex structure moduli and axio-dilaton. The resulting Pati-Salam gauge symmetry can be spontaneously broken down to the Standard Model via a supersymmetry-preserving Higgs mechanism. All the consistency conditions, including $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, RR tadpole cancellation, and K-theory constraints, are satisfied. We present the complete particle spectra for these models and discuss how exotic states dynamically decouple through strong dynamics in the hidden sector.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Twisted Feynman integrals are a generalization of standard Feynman integrals in quantum field theory, appearing in diverse contexts such as tensor reduction, Fourier transforms, and post-Minkowskian gravity. They are mathematically intricate objects that can be studied using geometric and analytic tools, though their properties remain an active area of research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of twisted Feynman integrals is driven by their wide-ranging applications in theoretical physics, including simplifying calculations in quantum field theory and exploring advanced topics like post-Minkowskian gravity. Understanding their mathematical structure is crucial for advancing our knowledge in these areas.

Method: The authors developed a mathematical framework to interpret these integrals geometrically and extended standard tools for studying Feynman integrals to handle their twisted counterparts. They utilized techniques from algebraic geometry and analysis to uncover new properties and behaviors of these integrals.

Result: Twisted Feynman integrals are identified as exponential periods, which are special types of integrals with deep connections to number theory and algebraic geometry. However, using the Baikov parametrization did not reveal the full geometric structure underlying their function space, suggesting that further investigation is needed.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for exploring the geometry and number theory of twisted Feynman integrals. While some foundational insights have been achieved, many questions remain open, particularly regarding their function space and geometric properties, which will guide future research in this field.

Abstract: We propose to call a class of deformed Feynman integrals as twisted Feynman integrals, where the integrand has an additional exponential factor linear in loop momenta. Such integrals appear in various contexts: tensor reduction of Feynman integrals, Fourier transform of Feynman integrals, and spin-resummed dynamics in post-Minkowskian gravity. First, we construct a mathematical framework that manifests the geometric interpretation of twisted Feynman integrals. Next, we generalise the standard mathematical tools for studying Feynman integrals for application to their twisted cousins, and explore their mathematical properties. In particular, it is found that (i) twisted Feynman integrals fall under the class of exponential periods, and (ii) the leading singularity approach using the (generalised) Baikov parametrisation applied to twisted Feynman integrals fail to detect the geometry underlying their function space.

Abstract: The logarithmic soft photon theorem in four spacetime dimensions encodes an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry which acts on massive matter as a divergent superphaserotation. Here we extend this result to massless matter which is both more subtle and surprising. We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact. Special care is required for massless matter due to potential collinear divergences which, as we show, do however not affect the superphaserotation charge. We furthermore compute the infrared corrections to the charge associated to the subleading tree-level soft photon theorem. As a corollary of our result, we find that the tail to the velocity kick memory due to the long-range interactions between soft electromagnetic radiation and massless matter vanishes.

Abstract: We study deformations of the model by Henneaux, Martínez, Troncoso and Zanelli [arXiv:hep-th/0201170] which features asymptotically AdS$_3$ black hole solutions that incorporate the exact backreaction of a scalar field. The presence of bulk matter causes the $T \overline T$ deformation of the (putative) dual CFT$_2$ to differ from the deformation defined in the bulk by imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at finite radius. We work out both of these deformations explicitly and verify that $T \overline T$-deforming the boundary theory corresponds to imposing mixed boundary conditions on the metric at the conformal boundary, whereas the bulk "Dirichlet deformation" gives rise to a field theory deforming operator that includes $T \overline T$ as well as other irrelevant terms. We check our results by calculating the deformed energy spectrum for either case using both the bulk and boundary prescriptions, finding agreement after taking into account additional terms coming from the flow of the scalar source. We interpret our explicit results and compare them with the predictions of similar proposals in the literature.

Abstract: We study the crossing symmetry of the ensemble of large-$c$ 2D CFTs defined through 3D gravity. A central observation is that statistical moments of OPE coefficients are not independent; rather, lower and higher moments are strongly correlated. Using Virasoro TQFT, we clarify how these correlations arise and how they guarantee consistency across OPE channels. Our analysis introduces the new notion of pseudo-hyperbolic manifolds, which are a certain class of non-hyperbolic manifolds whose partition functions are nevertheless related to those of hyperbolic ones. These manifolds serve as bridges that help manifest the crossing symmetry of the CFT ensemble.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between T-duality and (2+1)- dimensional electrodynamics, revealing a relationship between short and large length scales of the gauge potential. Our findings demonstrate that the electrostatic potential energy between static charges is no longer divergent at short distances in the presence of T-duality effects. It remains logarithmic at large distances, suggesting the possibility of a regulatory role for the T-duality scale \( l_0 \) in the space where the radial coordinate goes into its inverse. We also discuss the potential of T-duality to elucidate fractalization effects in physical systems, paving the way for future research on the implications for superconductors and condensed matter systems in general.

Method: 研究了时空切片和类时切片中的极值曲面，分别用于计算实部和虚部的tEE，使用了类时极值表面在不同维度 AdS 几何中的行为，并且分析了临界点的位置随维度的变化趋势。还研究了tEE的单调性，以及其与类时面积定理的关系。

Result: 在 BTZ 黑洞中，tEE 的极值表面在内部黑洞中延伸，成功地与场论结果进行了对比并且吻合。在高维 AdS-Schwarzschild 黑洞中，随着边界子系统的变长，tEE 的结构显示出体积加面积的特征，虚部面积项的系数在高维下趋于常数值。还发现边界子系统长度在某个临界维度下发散，这个临界点随着维度的增加而更接近于黑洞的horizon。此外，对于大子系统长度，实数体积项趋于常数，虚数面积项的系数趋于常数。此外，还研究了类时纠缠密度量的单调性，并且在特定极限下提供了类时面积定理的见解。随后，研究了事件视界附近的动力学行为，发现在各种黑体背景下，时空切片和类时切片中的指数增长行为具有指数形式在它们的数性质方面。

Conclusion: 这项研究通过对时空切片和类时切片极值曲面的分析，成功地构建了类时tEE的 holographic 对应，并在不同的 AdS 黑洞背景下进行了验证。得出结果显示，体积加面积结构与高维行为紧密相关，临界点的位置也在高维下趋近于视界附近，进一步揭示了类时面积定理在特定极限下的有效性。在 bulk维度很大的情况下，所有的行为都趋向于简单的体积加面积结构，实部体积和虚部面积系数在高维下趋近于固定值。此外，通过分析类时密度量的单调性，为类时面积定理在特定极限下提供了更深入的理解。

Abstract: We study the holographic construction of timelike entanglement entropy (tEE) in black hole backgrounds in Lorentzian geometries. The holographic tEE is realized through extremal surfaces consisting of spacelike and timelike branches that encode its real and imaginary components, respectively. In the BTZ black hole, these surfaces extend into the interior of the black hole and reproduce the field-theoretic results. The analysis is further generalized to higher-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, where the characteristics of tEE are obtained with increasing size of the boundary subsystem. Besides, we also show that the boundary subsystem length diverges at a dimension-dependent critical turning point. Notably, this critical point moves closer to the black hole horizon as the dimensionality of the bulk increases. For large subsystem lengths, the finite part of the tEE displays a characteristic volume-plus-area structure, with a real volume term and a complex coefficient of the area term approaching constant values at large dimensions. Besides, we also study the monotonicity of a new quantity, timelike entanglement density, which offers insights into a timelike area theorem in specific limits. Subsequently, we investigate the near-horizon dynamics in various black hole backgrounds, where the spacelike and timelike surfaces exhibit exponential growth of the form $e^{\frac{2π}β Δt}$ with inverse black hole temperature $β$.

Abstract: Band flattening has been identified as key ingredient to correlation phenomena in Moiré materials and beyond. Here, we examine strongly repulsive fermions on a ladder -- a minimal platform for unconventional $d$-wave pairing -- and show that flattening of the lower band through an additional diagonal hopping term produces non-Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by the violation of Luttinger's theorem, as well as axial $d$-wave pairing correlations. Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing. This offers broadly relevant insights for correlated flat-band systems, ranging from ultracold atoms to strongly interacting electrons in solids.

Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.

Abstract: We report the synthesis, structure and physical properties of a new quaternary nitride LaCr$_2$Ge$_2$N. The compound crystallizes in the CeCr$_2$Si$_2$C-type structure (P4/mmm), featuring distinctive Cr$_2$N square sheets within Cr$_2$Ge$_2$N block layers. Physical characterizations reveal enhanced electron correlations evidenced by a Sommerfeld coefficient substantially larger than band calculations and pressure-induced deviation from Fermi-liquid behavior. Magnetic measurements show short-range antiferromagnetic correlations developing around 460 K, followed by long-range magnetic ordering at 14 K. Additionally, subtle anomalies at 378 K suggest possible electronic ordering. First-principles calculations reveal nearly-flat Cr-3d bands near the Fermi level and predict a striped antiferromagnetic ground state. This work demonstrates how electron count variation in the CeCr$_2$Si$_2$C-type structure family leads to magnetic ordering in LaCr$_2$Ge$_2$N, contrasting with the paramagnetic behavior of LnCr$_2$Si$_2$C compounds.

Abstract: Using the recently proposed bond-operator technique (BOT), we discuss spin dynamics of the Heisenberg spin-$\frac12$ antiferromagnet with the ring exchange and small interactions between the second- and the third-neighbor spins on the square lattice at $T=0$. This model was suggested before for description of parent compounds of high-temperature superconducting layered cuprates. BOT describes accurately short-range spin correlations in quantum systems and provides a quantitative description of elementary excitations which appear in other approaches as bound states of conventional low-energy quasiparticles. We demonstrate that besides well-known magnons (spin-1 excitations) there are three well-defined spin-0 quasiparticles in the considered model whose energies lie near the magnon spectrum. Two of them, the amplitude (Higgs) mode and the quasiparticle which we named singlon, produce pronounced anomalies observed experimentally in the Raman scattering, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, and infrared optical absorption. We find sets of the model parameters which describe quantitatively experimental data obtained in $\rm La_2CuO_4$ and $\rm Sr_2CuO_2Cl_2$.

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-1 Kitaev--Heisenberg chain in the presence of uniaxial single-ion anisotropy (SIA) $D_z$ by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. By combining energy-curvature diagnostics on periodic $N=24$ clusters with a refined characterization based on order parameters and correlation functions for open chains up to $N=144$, we establish a comprehensive phase diagram in the $φ$--$D_z$ plane. We identify four magnetically ordered phases -- FM-$z$, FM-$xy$, Néel-$z$, and a two-sublattice collinear LLRR2 state -- as well as magnetically disordered/critical regimes including Néel-$xy$, LLRR1, and two Kitaev spin-liquid (KSL) regions. A topological Haldane phase also emerges near the Heisenberg limit. Our results provide evidence that both AFM- and FM-KSL regimes acquire finite parameter widths in the spin-1 model, while the Haldane phase is fragile against Kitaev-type anisotropy, particularly for $D_z<0$. Increasing (decreasing) $D_z$ suppresses (enhances) magnetic order and expands (shrinks) the KSL and other magnetically disordered sectors. Also, at $D_z=0$, we identify an exactly solvable point at $φ=\tan^{-1}(-2)$, which enforces a first-order transition between Néel-$z$ and LLRR2. We further contrast these findings with the spin-$1/2$ KH chain and with the spin-1 honeycomb KH model, highlighting the distinct roles of dimensionality and SIA in Kitaev-type magnets.

TL;DR: We have conducted a comprehensive Raman study on single crystals of two-dimensional CuCrP2S6, focusing on temperature and polarization effects. The study reveals insights into phonon dynamics, magnetic phase transitions, and lattice instabilities, offering guidance for future devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper’s focus on understanding phase transitions in a specific material could be driven by its potential applications in spintronic or magneto-electronic devices.

Method: A Raman scattering study was conducted on single crystals of CuCrP2S6 across a temperature range of 5 to 300 K, measuring both inelastic and polarized light scattering to analyze phonon dynamics and magnetic phase transitions.

Result: The findings highlight temperature-dependent phonon softening, hysteresis in phonon parameters, and the coexistence of different transition mechanisms (displacive vs. order-disorder). Additionally, spin-phonon coupling is observed below the Néel temperature, indicating a link between lattice vibrations and magnetic correlations.

Conclusion: Overall, the study provides critical insights into the lattice instabilities and phase transition dynamics of CuCrP2S6, aiding in the understanding and design of two-dimensional multiferroic systems for potential technological applications.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive temperature and polarization dependent inelastic light scattering (Raman) study on single crystals of two-dimensional CuCrP2S6, a layered van der Waals material exhibiting coupled magnetic and electric degrees of freedom. Raman measurements were performed from 5 to 300 K to probe phonon dynamics across multiple structural and magnetic phase transitions. Our analysis reveals pronounced thermal hysteresis in phonon self-energy parameters and dynamic Raman susceptibility, confirming the first-order nature of the antipolar transition near TC1 ~ 145 K and a second-order transition near TC2 ~ 190 K. Low-frequency modes associated with Cu+ and Cr3+ ions exhibit softening and anomalous linewidth behaviour, in particular phonon mode P2 (~ 37 cm-1) showing non-monotonic temperature dependence and intensity enhancement near 60 K suggesting persistent off-centre Cu+ dynamics in the quasi-antipolar phase. The coexistence and coupling of soft phonon modes and central peaks indicate a crossover from displacive to order-disorder type transition mechanisms. Additionally, phonon anomalies below the Néel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) reflect spin-phonon coupling, linking lattice vibrations to long-range magnetic correlations. Our findings provide critical insight into the lattice instabilities, symmetry evolution, and quasiparticle interactions in CuCrP2S6, offering a deeper understanding of phase transition dynamics in two-dimensional multiferroic systems and guiding future design of magnetoelectric and spintronic devices.

Abstract: In Wigner-crystal states of two-dimensional electrons, the spin ordering remains poorly understood. The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion.

Abstract: Here we provide a microscopic lattice construction of excitations, fusion, and shrinking in a non-Abelian topological order by studying the three-dimensional quantum double model. We explicitly construct lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, systematically derive their fusion and shrinking rules, and demonstrate that non-Abelian shrinking channels can be controllably selected through internal degrees of freedom of loop operators. Most importantly, we show that the lattice shrinking rules obey the fusion--shrinking consistency relations predicted by twisted $BF$ field theory, providing solid evidence for the validity of field-theoretical principles developed over the past years. In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems.

Abstract: Quantum geometry, describing the geometric properties of the Bloch wave function in momentum space, has recently been recognized as a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics. The flat-band system offers the paradigmatic platform where quantum geometry plays the essential role in correlated electron phases. However, systems that suffer from significant effects of quantum geometry are not limited to flat-band systems; dispersive-band systems also exhibit quantum condensed phases driven by quantum geometry. In this perspective, we provide a transparent account of quantum geometry and its role in correlated electron phases, throughout flat-band and dispersive-band systems.

Abstract: Charge-$4e$ superconductors are phases where quartets of electrons condense in the absence of Cooper pairing condensation. They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moiré materials. In this work we develop a general framework for \emph{topological} charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry.

Abstract: Silicon photonic components based on freely propagating beams in 220 nm thick Si slab waveguides are described and characterized. Examples include optical relays, waveguide crossings, couplers, and resonators with wavelength independent Q factors. The unconfined beams are manipulated using reflecting mirrors etched into the Si layer, which operate in the total internal reflection (TIR) regime. This approach eliminates the back-scattering and waveguide loss arising from sidewall roughness in single mode waveguides, reduces sensitivity to small dimensional variations, and reduces light induced self-heating. Although the detailed behavior of TIR at curved waveguide side wall mirror is too complex to capture by simple models, the experimental results are found to be in qualitative agreement with simple analytical calculations based on Gaussian beam theory and effective index approximations.

Conclusion: Reciprocal QED offers new avenues for advancing cavity QED and related fields in optics and photonics.

Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED) accurately describes all known forms of modern optics and photonics regarding interactions between photons and matter. While matter ranges widely from atoms, particles, to solids, photons are predominantly in a confined physical space, such as a pair of mirrors, for enhanced photon-matter interactions known as cavity QED. Since position and momentum are canonically conjugate variables governed by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a fundamental question arises - what if light confinement is in the not-so-intuitive momentum or reciprocal space? The realization of photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) has made possible this exotic scenario. Here, we summarize the most recent advancements at this research frontier in optics and photonics, covering weak coupling, strong coupling, and nonlinear optics. We can designate such photon-matter interactions enabled by reciprocal light confinement through BICs with truly open systems as reciprocal QED, which holds great promise to comprehend and extend cavity QED for optics, photonics, and related fields.

Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) generate broadband terahertz (THz) radiation, which is essential for spectroscopy, imaging, and communication. The performances and the essential physical parameters of STE devices are linked to the dielectric properties of the constituent materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is an effective tool to measure these properties, but conventional analysis struggles with thin or complex multilayered systems due to simplifying approximations or complex transfer functions. In this work, we present a practical method to extract dielectric properties of STE multilayers using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). By comparing the THz pulse calculated using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) with the experimentally measured pulse transmitted through the sample, we can extract the dielectric properties of STEs, enhancing THz-TDS analysis and facilitating STE design and optimization. This method avoids constructing complex transfer functions, accommodates diverse sample geometries, and is designed to be accessible, with a publicly available codebase, making it a useful tool for STE research.

Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis for symmetry-based Bound States in the Continuum (BICs) in optical waveguide arrays. Different from existing research, we consider a finite system of horizontally and equidistantly aligned waveguides and transform the wave propagation problem into Nonorthogonal Coupled-Mode Equations (NCME), rather than adopting the tight-binding approximation or orthogonal coupled-mode equations. We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array. We further numerically demonstrate the transition from a perfect BIC to a leaky mode by introducing a symmetry-breaking refractive index perturbation and quantitatively analyze the resulting radiation losses. This work gives a comprehensive study of symmetry-protected BICs and provides an efficient and precise computational model for designing such BICs devices.

Abstract: Resonant phase shifters inevitably mix phase and amplitude. We present a topological synthesis that guarantees a full $2π$ phase swing at a prescribed constant scattering magnitude $|S_{ij}|=C$ by winding a scattering zero around the operating point in the complex-frequency plane while avoiding pole windings. We realize this either by complex-frequency waveform excitation on an iso-$|S_{ij}|$ (Apollonius) loop or by adiabatic co-modulation of detuning and decay at fixed carrier, suppressing AM--PM conversion and quantizing $Δφ$ by the Argument Principle. The approach targets integrated resonant modulators, programmable photonic circuits, and quantum/beam-steering interferometers that require amplitude-flat phase shifts.

Abstract: A In this work, an experimental approach is introduced to redistribute optical energy among the multiple concentric core rings of high-order R-TEM laser modes, differing from conventional high-order R-TEM modes that inherently exhibit non-uniform energy across their rings. By employing a diffractive optical element formed from a binary phase mask with two oppositely phased regions, the energy sharing between the rings can be tuned to achieve a variable intensity ratio in the ring pattern. The resulting modulated high-order R-TEM modes are expected to surpass standard R-TEM modes for applications requiring ring structures with nearly equal intensity, such as micro- and nanoparticle manipulation, optical lithography, and near-field optical data storage.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation of arbitrary light polarization is of fundamental importance for versatile optical functionalities, yet realizing such full-Poincaré-sphere control within compact nanophotonic architectures remains a formidable challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and numerically demonstrate a magneto-optical skyrmion platform enabling full polarization control of cavity eigenmodes. We reveal the correspondence between the near-field wavefunctions of degenerate dipoles and far-field polarization. By applying multidirectional magnetic fields to magneto-optical photonic crystals, we achieve any complex superposition of orthogonal eigenmodes, thereby realizing arbitrary far-field polarization. This mapping manifests as a skyrmion with a topological charge of 2, guaranteeing coverage of the entire Poincaré sphere. Our theoretical model shows excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Furthermore, we realize bound states in the continuum (BICs) with dynamically tunable polarization textures and demonstrate high-performance polarization-selective emission and transmission. This work establishes a topological paradigm for precise polarization shaping, offering new avenues for advanced optical communication and sensing.

Abstract: Fundamental phase noise in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic integrated circuits is governed by thermal-charge-carrier-refractive (TCCR) dynamics arising from thermally driven carrier fluctuations. In contrast to the predominantly thermorefractive noise in silicon photonic platforms, TCCR noise represents a distinct mechanism that becomes critical for applications requiring high frequency stability and phase coherence, including optomechanical sensing, low-phase-noise microwave synthesis, and on-chip quantum squeezing. A quantitative understanding of the deterministic parameters that control TCCR noise is therefore essential for engineering the next generation of low-noise TFLN photonic systems. Here, we identify two dominant contributors to the TCCR noise in TFLN microresonators: material anisotropy and surface states. Material anisotropy results in increased noise for extraordinarily polarized optical modes and leads to a geometry dependent phase noise. Surface-state effects manifest as increased noise in higher-order transverse modes as well as more than 120-fold higher noise in suspended microresonators. Finally, we demonstrate that post-fabrication annealing -- widely used to reduce defect densities and recover crystal quality -- suppresses frequency noise by a factor of 8.2 in cladded microresonators. Together, these results establish a practical pathway for noise engineering in TFLN integrated photonic devices and accelerate their deployment in next-generation precision photonic systems.

Abstract: Molecular cavity optomechanical systems, featuring ultrahigh vibrational frequencies and strong light-matter interactions, hold significant promise for advancing applications in quantum science and technology. Specifically, by introducing metallic nanoparticles into microcavities, hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical systems can further enhance optical quality factors and system tunabilities, which enables scalable and controllable quantum platforms. In this study, we propose how to realize robust photon blockade, i.e., strong photon antibunching with arbitrary detuning conditions, by combining degenerate optical parametric amplification with a hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical system. More interesting, we find near-perfect optomechanical photon blockade at room temperature, which is robust against temperature and optical dissipation. In addition, our approach can release the strict condition of high temporal resolution by combining features of conventional and unconventional photon blockade. Our approach offers a feasible route to study intriguing quantum effects in hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical systems, and holds promise for applications in nonclassical state engineering, quantum sensing, and photonic precision measurements.

Abstract: In micro- and nanoscale optomechanical systems, radiation pressure interactions are often complemented or impeded by photothermal forces arising from thermal strain induced by optical heating. We show that the sign and magnitude of the photothermal force can be engineered through deterministic nanoscale structural design, by considering the overlap of temperature and modal strain profiles. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a specific system: a nanobeam zipper cavity by changing the geometry of its supporting tethers. A single design parameter, corresponding to a nanoscale geometry change, controls the magnitude of the photothermal backaction and even its sign. These insights will allow engineering the combined photothermal and radiation pressure forces in nano-optomechanical systems, such that backaction-induced linewidth variations are deterministically minimized if needed, or maximized for applications that require cooling or amplification at specific laser detuning.

Abstract: We propose a method for generating hollow beams using higher-order cylindrical vector modes of the form R-TEMpl, where the radial index p is varied from 1 to 3 while the azimuthal index is fixed at l = 1. It is found that this scheme performs identically under incident illumination with either radial or azimuthal polarization. For this purpose, we use a focusing lens in combination with a diffractive optical element formed by a computer-generated hologram containing multiple alternate opaque and transparent regions. Based on vector diffraction theory, our analysis shows that the multi-zone amplitude mask redistributes the beam energy, thereby leading to the formation of a hollow beam. The proposed method provides control over the beam width which maintains a uniform dark core size after focusing through the various NA lens across all the higher order modes. Further the width of high intensity ring can be tuned by varying the NA of the focusing lens. This study shows that the proposed method is well suited for trapping particles or atoms while avoiding exposure to high central intensity, enabling improved contrast and resolution, facilitating ring-shaped ablation or heating, guiding atoms through dark regions to minimize thermal effects, and supporting information encoding using orbital angular momentum and other advanced optical applications.

Abstract: Artificial gauge fields open up burgeoning opportunities for wave engineering in different disciplines. So far,previous works have mostly focused on synthesizing spatial gauge fields, where the pseudo-magnetic fields lie at the heart of these phenomena. In this Letter, we generalize the paradigm of gauge field optics to the time domain by using time-varying media with rotating anisotropy. Dual to its spatial counterpart, the temporal gauge field induces a pseudo-electric field for optical pulses, leading to the spin-dependent longitudinal shift and Zitterbewegung for both trajectory and frequency. In addition, we analyze the temporal non-Abelian interference effect induced by temporally bounded non-Abelian gauge field media, which results in the temporal spin-precession and the temporal analogy of the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Our work not only fills the gap between synthetic gauge fields and time-varying physical systems, but also provides a fundamentally new approach for manipulating light with time-varying media.

Abstract: Optical spectroscopy, in particular dual-comb (DC) spectroscopy, is a critical, non-invasive tool for combustion diagnostics, offering high precision and calibration-free advantages. However, its implementation remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared region. This work presents the development of a robust DC spectroscopic system based on electro-optical (EO) frequency comb generators and difference frequency generation (DFG), specifically designed for the characterization of laboratory flames. Operating at a center wavelength of 3427.43 nm, the system utilizes a differential detection strategy to enable precise, calibration-free measurements of unburned methane ($\mathrm{CH_{4}}$) concentrations in a McKenna burner. The experimental results demonstrate a detection limit of 1.1 ppm for a 1 m path length and effectively resolve spatial concentration gradients across the combustion region. Furthermore, the system's high temporal resolution allowed for the identification of dynamic combustion instabilities, including self-sustained pulsations and fuel leakage under fuel-lean conditions. These findings validate the proposed EO architecture as a flexible and highly sensitive tool for advanced flame characterization.

Abstract: Poorly transparent barriers (e.g., reinforced walls, shielding panels, metallic or high-contrast dielectrics) strongly reflect incident radiation, limiting wireless power transfer (WPT) unless the barrier is structurally modified to support a narrowband transparency window. Here we introduce a barrier-agnostic alternative based on coherent scattering control: a phase-locked auxiliary wave is launched from the receiver side with an amplitude and phase chosen from the measured complex scattering parameters of the barrier. In a two-port (single-channel-per-side) description, we derive closed-form conditions for (i) canceling back-reflection toward the transmitter and (ii) maximizing the net extracted power at the receiver side. In the lossless limit these conditions imply unit transmitter-to-receiver efficiency (all transmitter power is routed to the receiver side) even when the barrier is nearly opaque under one-sided illumination. We validate the concept using (1) an analytically solvable high-index Fabry--Pérot slab and (2) a numerically simulated perforated PEC metasurface exhibiting vanishing one-sided transmission; in both cases, coherent assistance yields near-unity transmission and large enhancement factors. We further analyze dissipative barriers using a receiver-side energy-balance metric, showing that substantial net delivery can persist well into the lossy regime. The approach is closely related to coherent perfect absorption and time-reversal ideas in wave physics, but targets \emph{reflectionless delivery through barriers} without modifying the obstacle itself.

Abstract: Twist-angle control offers a bias-free route to reconfigurable metasurfaces, yet its extension to deeply subwavelength resonant platforms at VHF/UHF remains limited. We demonstrate a sub-GHz double-layer wire metasurface formed by two identical wire grids separated by a gap G, with in-plane rotation angle as the sole tuning parameter. One-port, loop-coupled S11 measurements supported by full-wave simulations reveal twist-driven hybridization of the dominant resonant manifold. For small G, the lower hybrid resonance redshifts continuously from 409 MHz to 210 MHz (2:1 tuning), enabling compact, twist-programmable resonant surfaces. Simulations further show that twisting imprints moire-like magnetic near-field super-modulations. From resonance frequencies, linewidths, and normal-mode splitting extracted from the complex response, we obtain normalized coupling up to g = 0.43 with cooperativity exceeding unity over broad angular ranges, meeting the resolved-splitting criterion. The rapid collapse of tunability at larger G confirms the near-field origin of the interaction.

Abstract: We provide a field-theoretical description of thermal nucleation in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic superfluid, a quantum-gas analogue of false-vacuum decay. The rate at which ground-state domains nucleate from fluctuations in the metastable phase follows an Arrhenius law, with an exponential factor determined by a saddle-point configuration of the energy functional -- the critical droplet -- and a magnitude fixed by small fluctuations of this configuration. We evaluate both contributions over the full parameter space, using a Gel'fand-Yaglom approach to reduce the calculation of the fluctuation spectrum to an initial value problem. In addition, we obtain a closed-form expression for the critical droplet in the limit of small potential tilts, and use it to formulate an effective theory of domain nucleation and growth as a Kramers escape problem for the droplet size. Our results determine the parametric dependence of the nucleation rate and its signature on experimental images of a nucleating gas, and should allow for a rigorous comparison between nucleation theory and experiment.

An understanding of this condition is found from a study of the near horizon limit of the solutions, both perturbative closed form and numerical solutions being presented.

Abstract: The coming decade will be crucial for determining the final design and configuration of a global network of next-generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, including the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.

Abstract: In the Alcubierre warp-drive spacetime, we investigate the following scalar curvature invariants: the scalar $I$, derived from a quadratic contraction of the Weyl tensor, the trace $R$ of the Ricci tensor, and the quadratic $r1$ and cubic $r2$ invariants from the trace-adjusted Ricci tensor. In four-dimensional spacetime the trace-adjusted Einstein and Ricci tensors are identical, and their unadjusted traces are oppositely signed yet equal in absolute value. This allows us to express these Ricci invariants using Einstein's curvature tensor, facilitating a direct interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor. We present detailed plots illustrating the distribution of these invariants. Our findings underscore the requirement for four distinct layers of an anisotropic stress-energy tensor to create the warp bubble. Additionally, we delve into the Kretschmann quadratic invariant decomposition. We provide a critical analysis of the work by Mattingly et al., particularly their underrepresentation of curvature invariants in their plots by 8 to 16 orders of magnitude. A comparison is made between the spacetime curvature of the Alcubierre warp-drive and that of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to the planet Saturn. The paper addresses potential misconceptions about the Alcubierre warp-drive due to inaccuracies in representing spacetime curvature changes and clarifies the classification of the Alcubierre spacetime, emphasizing its distinction from class $B$ warped product spacetimes.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the asymptotic cosmological dynamics of a modified gravity model based on the $f(R,T^φ)$ theory, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T^φ$ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor of a scalar field. Despite the extensive study of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the asymptotic implications of quadratic trace couplings in scalar field cosmology remain largely unexplored. We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^φ) = R + αT^φ+ β(T^φ)^2/2$, in which the parameters $α$ and $β$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties. Finally, the energy conditions and the presence of dynamical instabilities are examined. We study the general scenario $α\neq 0$ and $β\neq 0$, along with the subcases $α= 0$ and $β= 0$, in order to compare with minimally coupled quintessence $α= β= 0$. We find that the quadratic term in $T^φ$ admits late-time accelerated de Sitter-like critical solutions at the background level. However, several accelerated points lie in a degenerate scalar sector with $Q_s=0$, where the standard linear perturbation criteria are inconclusive, while the quasi-de Sitter point with $Q_s>0$ is of saddle type. Therefore, establishing full perturbative viability requires going beyond the linear analysis in the degenerate sector.

The development of analytical methods for these circular orbits has also drawn extensive attention. In our recent work, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.L021501}{Phys. Rev. D \textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons).

Abstract: The thermodynamic behaviours of multi-horizon black holes such as a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole have been one of the long-standing mysteries in gravitational physics since they involve quantum natures in gravitational systems and that the search for quantum gravity has not reached its conclusion. In this work, we seeked for a possibility of realising the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as a correlated qubit system, where each of the event horizon is treated as a qubit and both of them are correlated in a way that two qubits could be. By identifying the entropies of subsystems to those of qubits, we successfully constructed the reduced density matrices of the two subsystems as well as the density matrix for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, modelled as 2-correlating qubits. Moreover, our results suggested that when the gravitational effect has its role in the qubit systems, supposedly like black holes, the correlation between qubits are constrained with a lower bound more stringent than the so-called Araki-Lieb triangle inequality.

Abstract: In this paper, we observe the collapse of a mass-less scalar field covariantly. We show that the strengths of the collapsing and dispersing modes of this scalar field will decide whether the collapse will end up in a black-hole or disperse. We find a locally naked null singularity as a critical case between these two and confirm that there is a single dimensionless parameter that determine the end state. This work is ansatz-independent, hence, true for all mass-less scalar field families. We also show that the geometrical mass of these singularities go to zero.

Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive semiclassical analysis of black hole radiation in a spatially flat FRW Universe for two fundamental nonclassical states: the Squeezed Number State (SNS) and the Coherent Squeezed Number State (CSNS). Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $ρ$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $ρ$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $Δ\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $Δ\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations. These findings contribute a new perspective on gravitational particle creation in cosmological settings.

Abstract: Bell-network states constitute a class of diffeomorphism-invariant and entangled states of the geometry within loop quantum gravity (LQG) that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in the limit of large spins. The fluctuations of the geometry for a Bell-network state are entangled, similar to those in the semiclassical limit as described by quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. This analysis provides a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory.

Abstract: Standard perturbative calculations of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) have neglected nonperturbative effects in the large-amplitude regime. We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations.

Abstract: We revisit the Starobinsky model of inflation in light of recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which indicates a potential preference for a slightly larger scalar spectral index $n_s$ than predicted by the standard $R^2$ scenario. We demonstrate that a natural one-parameter generalization to a quadratic model $\sim L+L^2$ in the Lovelock invariant $L=R+\fracα{4}{\cal G}$ ($\cal G$ is the Gauss--Bonnet term), can effectively resolve this minor tension. Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $α$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities. This work establishes the quadratic $f(L)$ gravity as a compelling and physically motivated extension that preserves the successes of Starobinsky inflation while improving its fit to modern precision cosmological data.

Abstract: We establish a direct connection between the interior curvature structure of nonsingular black holes (BHs) with a Minkowski core and their observable optical signatures. By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters α and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations.

Abstract: We compute the gravitational wave signal from eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded within beyond-vacuum environments, where the secondary object carries a scalar charge and evolves in the presence of both an accretion disk and a dark matter halo. The waveform modification is derived by incorporating the scalar charge correcting the fluxes and orbital trajectories of the secondary. Our results indicate that, under suitable parameter configurations, the influence of the scalar charge on EMRIs waveform in such environments can be distinguished from that in vacuum spacetime. For the EMRIs signal modified by the astrophysical environments, the future space-borne detector can determine the relative error of scalar charge constrained by LISA at the level of $\sim0.1$, providing a preliminary prediction of detecting scalar charge in the beyond-vacuum spacetime.

Abstract: We demonstrate that in constructing asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets in General Relativity via the conformal method, certain asymptotic structures may be prescribed a priori through the specified seed data, including the ADM momentum components, the leading- and next-to-leading-order decay rates, and the anisotropy in the metric's mass term, yielding a recipe to construct initial data sets with desired asymptotics. We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.

Abstract: Gravitational waves provide a unique window into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, enabling the exploration of fundamental phenomena across a wide range of scales. This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.

Abstract: Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing.

Abstract: The efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits constitutes a fundamental barrier to quantum advantage, typically overcome by injecting explicit non-Clifford "magic" resources. We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that "coprime architectures" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary.

Abstract: As superconducting circuits emerge as a leading platform for scalable quantum information processing, building comprehensive bridges from the foundational principles of macroscopic quantum phenomena to the architecture of modern quantum devices is increasingly essential for introducing new researchers to the field. This tutorial provides a self-contained, pedagogical introduction to superconducting quantum circuits at the undergraduate level. Beginning with an overview of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, the tutorial systematically develops the quantization of microwave circuits into the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime. This work serves as a foundational guide and first point of contact, equipping students and researchers with the conceptual and mathematical tools necessary to understand and engineer superconducting quantum hardware.

Abstract: We study finite two-dimensional disordered systems with periodic confinement. At low energies, eigenstates exhibit strong Anderson localization, while at higher energies a subset of states forms variational scars with anisotropic intensity patterns that violate random wave expectations. Scaling theory predicts that all states localize in two dimensions, yet energy-dependent localization lengths and finite system size allow these regimes to coexist. We demonstrate that this coexistence produces distinct, robust signatures in both spatial intensity patterns and spectral statistics that are directly observable in mesoscopic electronic, photonic, and cold atom systems.

Abstract: Quantum state readout with minimal resources is crucial for scalable quantum information processing. As a leading platform, neutral atom arrays rely on atomic fluorescence imaging for qubit readout, requiring short exposure, low photon count schemes to mitigate heating and atom loss while enabling mid-circuit feedback. However, a fundamental challenge arises in the single-photon regime where severe overlap in state distributions causes conventional threshold discrimination to fail. Here, we report an AI-accelerated Bayesian inference method for fluorescence readout in neutral atom arrays. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to achieve reliable state detection at the single-photon level under short exposure. Specifically, we introduce a weakly anchored Bayesian scheme that requires calibration of only one state, addressing asymmetric calibration challenges common across quantum platforms. Furthermore, acceleration is achieved via a permutation-invariant neural network, which yields a 100-fold speedup by compressing iterative inference into a single forward pass. The approach achieves relative readout fidelity above 99% and 98% for histogram overlaps of 61% and 72%, respectively, enabling reliable extraction of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference results unattainable with conventional threshold based methods. This framework supports scalable, real-time readout of large atom arrays and paves the way toward AI-enhanced quantum technology in computation and sensing.

Abstract: We generalize the information lattice, originally defined for one-dimensional open-boundary chains, to characterize quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries. In one dimension, the information lattice provides a position- and scale-resolved decomposition of von Neumann information. Its generalization is nontrivial because overlapping subsystems can form loops, allowing multiple regions to encode the same information. This prevents information from being assigned uniquely to any one of them. We address this by introducing a higher-dimensional information lattice in which local information is defined through an inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion local information is assigned to the lattice vertices, each labeled by subsystem position and scale. We implement this construction explicitly in two dimensions and apply it to a range of many-body ground states with distinct entanglement structures. Within this position- and scale-resolved framework, we extract information-based localization lengths, direction-dependent critical exponents, characteristic edge mode information, long-range information patterns due to topological order, and signatures of non-Abelian fusion channels. Our work establishes a general information-theoretic framework for isolating the universal scale-resolved features of quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries.

Motivation: Improved quantum algorithms for PDEs are essential for enhancing quantum computing's practical applications in simulations.

Conclusion: This work establishes a hybrid quantum approach for simulating nonlinear PDEs, offering both enhanced capabilities and practical insights for future quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Conclusion: 天然表示非量子位化学动力学的MQB模拟器在资源上具有巨大优势。

Abstract: Simulating chemical dynamics is computationally challenging, especially for nonadiabatic dynamics, where numerically exact classical simulations scale exponentially with system size, becoming intractable for even small molecules. On quantum computers, chemical dynamics can be simulated efficiently using either universal, qubit-only devices or specialized mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) simulators, which natively host electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Here, we compare the quantum resources required for a qubit-only approach to achieve the same accuracy as an MQB device at simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. We find that MQB simulations require orders-of-magnitude fewer quantum operations than qubit-only simulations, with a one-gate MQB circuit requiring a qubit-equivalent circuit volume of over 400,000 when simulating an isolated molecule, which increases to over ten million when environmental effects are included. These estimates assume perfect qubits and gates, and would increase by additional orders of magnitude if error correction were used for fault tolerance. When errors are small, the advantage of MQB simulators becomes even larger as system size increases. Our results highlight the enormous resource advantages of representing non-qubit chemical degrees of freedom natively, rather than encoding them into qubits.

Abstract: A central challenge for scalable quantum networks is the realization of coherent interfaces between stationary qubits and telecom-band photonic qubits for long-distance entanglement distribution. Semiconductor quantum dots emitting at telecom wavelengths present a promising spin-photon platform, and a precise understanding of the properties of the confined spin is crucial for optimizing its interplay with the photonic qubit. Here, we simultaneously benchmark the electron and hole g-factors and coherence properties of a droplet epitaxy QD, solely from time and polarization resolved photon correlations. These measurements identify the hole as the preferable qubit for spin-photon entanglement in quantum network nodes. We then perform full state tomography of the confined hole ground state to reveal subtle anisotropies in the spin precession, providing essential diagnostics for minimizing phase errors critical for deterministic multiphoton entanglement generation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for creating multi-controlled quantum gates using non-Abelian holonomy in photonic waveguides.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies on precise control of quantum gates, especially multi-controlled gates which are essential for quantum algorithms. This paper proposes an innovative method using photonic waveguides and non-Abelian holonomy, which could lead to more robust and scalable quantum computing architectures.

Method: The authors utilize a photonic waveguide network consisting of coupled M-pod structures. They employ adiabatic driving loops within these networks to implement various quantum gates. The tripod structure is generalized to M-pods, which allows for the creation of multi-controlled gates by connecting multiple tripod units.

Result: The authors successfully design and implement several quantum gates, including single-qubit gates, CNOT, SWAP, Toffoli, and OR gates, using their proposed method. They also demonstrate the implementation of the Deutsch quantum query algorithm using interconnected tripod structures. Their approach shows promise for scalable quantum gate implementation.

Conclusion: This paper provides a novel method for creating multi-controlled quantum gates using non-Abelian holonomy in photonic waveguides. By expanding on the tripod structure, they successfully demonstrate the implementation of various quantum gates and even complex algorithms like the Deutsch query algorithm. Their work opens new avenues for scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Controlled and multi-controlled quantum gates, whose action on a target qubit depends on the state of multiple control qubits, represent a fundamental logical building block for complex quantum algorithms. We propose a scheme for realizing this class of gates based on non-Abelian holonomies in modulated photonic waveguide networks. Our approach relies on linear photonic cicuits formed by two star networks coupled via a two-path circuit. A star network with M peripheral waveguides coupled to a single central site, or M-pod, naturally generalizes the tripod structure used in non-Abelian Thouless pumping and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). In the present work, we first analyze the minimal case of two connected tripods and design adiabatic driving loops that implement single-qubit, CNOT, and SWAP gates. We then show how extending the approach to larger M-pod structures enables the realization of multiply controlled operations, which we exemplify by designing Toffoli and the OR gate on two coupled pentapods. Finally, we demonstrate that networks of connected tripods can implement the Deutsch quantum query algorithm.

TL;DR: A new method for creating Dicke states in linear optics using a heralded scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a new approach to create Dicke states, which are important for quantum communication and computation. The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional optical implementations that rely on postselection, thus improving the efficiency and practicality of Dicke state generation.

Method: The authors propose a linear-optical heralded scheme using the framework of linear quantum graphs (LQG). They utilize the permutation symmetry of Dicke states, mapping the problem into a graph-finding task, thereby simplifying the structural complexity that has previously hindered other approaches.

Result: The proposed method successfully generates arbitrary Dicke states $|D_n^kangle$ with $3n+k$ photons. This breakthrough provides a more resource-efficient and practical pathway for the heralded preparation of Dicke states, which can significantly advance quantum technologies.

Conclusion: This work represents a milestone in the development of quantum technologies by providing an efficient method for the generation of Dicke states, which are critical resources for quantum information processing tasks.

Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and a key resource for quantum information processing. Among multipartite entangled states, Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ are distinguished by their permutation symmetry, which provides robustness against particle loss and enables applications for quantum communication and computation. Although Dicke states have been realized in various platforms, most optical implementations rely on postselection, which destroys the state upon detection and prevents its further use. A heralded optical scheme is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present a linear-optical heralded scheme for generating arbitrary Dicke states $|D_n^k\rangle$ with $3n+k$ photons through the framework of the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture. By mapping the scheme design into the graph-finding problem, and exploiting the permutation symmetry of Dicke states, we overcome the structural complexity that has hindered previous approaches. Our results provide a resource-efficient pathway toward practical heralded preparation of Dicke states for quantum technologies.

Abstract: Numerical exploration of large-size real biological systems requires computational power far exceeding that of modern classical computers. In computational molecular science, calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions between charged atoms - the strongest interactions in condensed phases, is a major bottleneck. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm for fast yet accurate computation of Coulomb electrostatic energy for a system of point charges. The algorithm employs the Ewald method based decomposition of electrostatic energy E into several energy terms, of which "the Fourier component" of E is computed in the algorithm proposed on a quantum device, utilizing the power of Quantum Fourier Transform. We demonstrate the algorithm's quantum advantage for a range of systems of point charges in the three-dimensional space when the number of charges (system size) N exceeds the number of grid points M, and show that the numerical error is rather small <0.1%. The algorithm can be implemented in running the all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations on a quantum computer, thereby expanding the scope of applications of QFT methods in computational physics, chemistry, and biology.

Abstract: We construct a series of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits and integrate them into 3D cavities. For a single-qubit device, we demonstrate flux-tunable qubit transition, with a measured $T_1$ $\approx$ 48 ns and a lower bound estimate of $T_2^\ast$ $\approx$ 17.63 ns. By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.

Abstract: The capability to control molecular rotation for field-free orientation, which arranges molecules in specific spatial directions without external fields, is crucial in physics, chemistry, and quantum information science. However, conventional methods typically lead to transient orientations characterized by periodic directional reversals and necessitate the generation of coherent superpositions across a broad spectrum of rotational states of ultracold molecules. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for achieving unidirectional field-free orientation by selectively manipulating two specific rotational states of symmetric top molecules. By leveraging the interplay between coherent superpositions and the precise selection of initial states, we demonstrate that both the maximum achievable orientation and its direction can be effectively controlled. To attain the desired two-state orientation, we present a quantum control strategy that utilizes a single control pulse, significantly simplifying the complexities of conventional multistate or multipulse schemes. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach for methyl iodide (CH$_3$I) molecules, even when accounting for molecular centrifugal distortion.The results highlight the critical roles of initial-state selection and quantum coherence in achieving long-lasting, high unidirectional molecular orientation, opening new directions in stereochemistry, precision spectroscopy, and quantum computing.

Abstract: Algorithms based on non-unitary evolution have attracted much interest for ground state preparation on quantum computers. One recently proposed method makes use of ancilla qubits and controlled unitary operators to implement weak measurements related to imaginary-time evolution. In this work we specialize and extend this approach to the setting of combinatorial optimization. We first generalize the algorithm from exact to approximate optimization, taking advantage of several properties unique to classical problems. In particular we show how to select parameters such that the success probability of each measurement step is bounded away from $1/2$. We then show how to adapt our paradigm to the setting of constrained optimization for a number of important classes of hard problem constraints. For this we compare and contrast both penalty-based and feasibility-preserving approaches, elucidating the significant advantages of the latter approach. Our approach is general and may be applied to easy-to-prepare initial states as a standalone algorithm, or deployed as a quantum postprocessing stage to improve performance of a given parameterized quantum circuit. We then propose a more sophisticated variant of our algorithm that adaptively applies a mixing operator or not, based on the measurement outcomes seen so far, as to speeds up the algorithm and helps the system evolution avoid slowing down or getting stuck suboptimally. In particular, we show that mixing operators from the quantum alternating operator ansatz can be imported directly, both for the necessary eigenstate scrambling operator and for initial state preparation, and discuss quantum resource tradeoffs.

Abstract: Anonymity is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that hides the identities of both senders and receivers during message transmission over a network. Classical protocols cannot provide information-theoretic security for such task, and existing quantum approaches typically depend on classical subroutines and multiple private channels, thereby weakening their security in fully adversarial settings. In this work, we introduce the first fully quantum protocol for anonymous communication in realistic quantum networks with a device-independent security proof.

Abstract: Ground state preparation is a central application of quantum algorithms for electronic structure. We introduce the classical reservoir approach, a low cost variational ansatz tailored to near-term hardware, requiring only nearest-neighbor interactions on a machine with square-lattice connectivity. Unlike traditional methods built from the classically efficient Hartree Fock theory, our ansatz operates in localized molecular orbitals to study previously unexplored regions of the variational parameter space. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate chemical accuracy across diverse systems and bond lengths; notably, significantly reduced circuit depths are attainable when relaxed error thresholds (e.g., tens of E_h) are permissible. We benchmark the method on hydrogen chains, N_2, O_2, CO, BeH_2, and H_2O, the latter corresponding to an effective 24 qubit calculation.

Abstract: Moiré superlattices in transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductor heterobilayers enable the quantum confinement of interlayer excitons with large out-of-plane permanent electric dipoles and spin-valley control. Here, we report a novel phonon-assisted excitation mechanism of individual moiré-trapped interlayer excitons in 2H-stacked MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers via chiral $E^{\prime\prime}$ in-plane optical phonons at the Γ-point. This excitation pathway preserves valley-selective optical selection rules and enables deterministic generation of individual interlayer excitons with defined helicity, emitting within a spectrally narrow energy spread. Through photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy in both the ensemble and quantum emitter regimes, we identify a fixed phonon energy of $\sim$23 meV mediating the process. First-principles calculations corroborate the symmetry and energy of the relevant phonon mode and its coupling to interlayer excitons, providing microscopic support for the observed valley-selective phonon-assisted excitation mechanism. Our results highlight the utility of chiral phonons as a tool for controlled excitation of quantum emitters in TMD moiré systems, opening new opportunities for valleytronic and quantum photonic applications.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits operate at millikelvin temperatures, typically requiring independent microwave cables for each qubit for connecting room-temperature control and readout electronics. However, scaling to large-scale processors hosting hundreds of qubits faces a severe input/output (I/O) bottleneck, as the dense cable arrays impose prohibitive constraints on physical footprint, thermal load, wiring complexity, and cost. Here we demonstrate a complete optical I/O architecture for superconducting quantum circuits, in which all control and readout signals are transmitted exclusively via optical photons. Employing a broadband traveling-wave Brillouin microwave-to-optical transducer, we achieve simultaneous frequency-multiplexed optical readout of two qubits. Combined with fiber-integrated photodiode arrays for control signal delivery, this closed-loop optical I/O introduces no measurable degradation to qubit coherence times, with an optically driven single-qubit gate fidelity showing only a 0.19% reduction relative to standard microwave operation. These results establish optical interconnects as a viable path toward large-scale superconducting quantum processors, and open the possibility of networking multiple superconducting quantum computers housed in separate dilution refrigerators through a centralized room-temperature control infrastructure.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum hardware has emerged as a promising platform for programmable many-body physics. In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $α_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = α_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $Δ_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $Δμ$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations.

Abstract: Quantum sensing promises measurement precision beyond classical limits, but its practical realization is often hindered by decoherence and the challenges of generating and stabilizing entanglement in large-scale systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable, scrambling-enhanced quantum sensing protocol, referred to as butterfly metrology, implemented on a cross-shaped superconducting quantum processor. By harnessing quantum information scrambling, the protocol converts local interactions into delocalized metrologically useful correlations, enabling robust signal amplification through interference of the scrambled and polarized quantum states. We validate the time-reversal ability via Loschmidt echo measurements and quantify the information scrambling through out-of-time-ordered correlators, establishing the essential quantum resources of our protocol. Our measurements reveal that the sensing sensitivity surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) with increasing qubit number, reaching 3.78 in a 9-qubit configuration, compared to the SQL of 3.0. The scheme further exhibits inherent robustness to coherent control errors and probed signal noise. This work demonstrates a readily scalable path toward practical quantum sensing advantages with prevalent experimental platforms.

Abstract: We introduce a novel quantum optimization paradigm: the Fixed-Parameter-Count Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (FPC-QAOA). It is a scalable variational framework that maintains a constant number of trainable parameters regardless of the number of qubits, Hamiltonian complexity, or circuit depth. By separating schedule function optimization from circuit digitization, FPC-QAOA enables accurate schedule approximations with minimal parameters while supporting arbitrarily deep digitized adiabatic evolutions, constrained only by NISQ hardware capabilities. This separation allows depth to scale without expanding the classical search space, mitigating overparameterization and optimization challenges typical of deep QAOA circuits, such as barren plateaus-like behaviors. We benchmark FPC-QAOA on random MaxCut instances and the Tail Assignment Problem, achieving performance comparable to or better than standard QAOA with nearly constant classical effort and significantly fewer quantum circuit evaluations. Experiments on the IBM Kingston superconducting processor with up to 50 qubits confirm robustness and hardware efficiency under realistic noise. These results position FPC-QAOA as a practical and scalable paradigm for variational quantum optimization on near-term quantum devices.

Result: Achieved fast CZ gates, low coherent errors, and effective suppression of parasitic interactions.

Conclusion: Development of a scalable fluxonium platform with reduced errors paves the way for practical quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Fluxonium qubits demonstrate exceptional potential for quantum processing; yet, realizing scalable architectures using them remains challenging. We propose a fluxonium-based square-grid design with fast $\sim63$~ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates, achieving coherent errors below $10^{-4}$, activated via microwave-driven transmon couplers. A central difficulty in such large-scale systems with all-microwave gates and, therefore, strong static couplings, is suppressing parasitic interactions that extend beyond nearest neighbors to include next-nearest elements. We address this issue by introducing several design strategies: the frequency allocation of both qubits and couplers, the localization of coupler wavefunctions, and a differential oscillator that suppresses residual long-range interactions. In addition, the architecture natively supports fast $\sim70$~ns CZZ gates -- three-qubit operations composed of two CZ gates sharing a common qubit -- which reduce the incoherent error by $\sim 35\%$ compared to performing the corresponding CZs sequentially. Together, these advances establish an interaction-resilient platform for large-scale fluxonium processors and can be adapted to a variety of fluxonium layouts.

Abstract: We define and study the properties of ``squeezed quantum multiplets''. Ordinary multiplets are sets of $D$-orthonormal quantum states formed by superpositions of states squeezed along $D$ equally spaced directions in quadrature space. More generally, we also discuss superpositions of ``higher-order squeezed states'', including tri-squeezed and quad-squeezed states. All these states involve superpositions of multiples of $p$ photons. We compare states in ordinary ($p=2$) multiplets and higher-order ones ($p>2$) in the most relevant cases, showing that ordinary squeezed multiplets and higher-order ones share some important similarities, as well as some differences. Finally, we present analytical expressions for phase-space distributions (Wigner and characteristic functions) representing ordinary squeezed multiplets. We use this to show that some squeezed multiplets are highly sensitive to perturbations in all phase-space directions, making them interesting for metrological applications.

Abstract: We present a quantum circuit that implements the random dilation superchannel, transforming parallel queries of an unknown quantum channel into parallel queries of a randomly chosen dilation isometry of the input channel. This is a natural generalization of a random purification channel, that transforms copies of an unknown mixed state to copies of a randomly chosen purification state. Our construction is based on the quantum Schur transform and the quantum Fourier transform over the symmetric group. By using the efficient construction of these quantum transforms, we can implement the random dilation superchannel with the circuit complexity $O(\mathrm{poly}(n, \log d_I, \log d_O))$, where $n$ is the number of queries and $d_I$ and $d_O$ are the input and output dimensions of the input channel, respectively. As an application, we show an efficient storage-and-retrieval of an unknown quantum channel, which improves the program cost exponentially in the retrieval error $\varepsilon$. For the case where the Kraus rank $r$ is the least possible (i.e., $r = d_I/d_O$), we show quantum circuits transforming $n$ parallel queries of an unknown quantum channel $Λ$ to $Θ(n^α)$ parallel queries of $Λ$ for any $α<2$ approximately, and its Petz recovery map for the reference state given by the maximally mixed state probabilistically and exactly. We also show that our results can be further extended to the case of quantum superchannels.

Abstract: We access the quantum synchronization (QS) in the steady state of a driven quantum van der Pol oscillator (vdPo) using two distinct figures of merit: (i) the nonclassical area $δ$ and (ii) the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$, which are both viable in experimental architectures. The nonclassical area quantifier rooted in homodyne tomography, allows us to assess the nonclassical nature of the vdPo's state directly from the tomogram without requiring full state reconstruction or the Wigner function negativity. Within a well-defined parameter regime of drive strength and detuning, both $δ$ and $g^{(2)}(0)$ exhibit pronounced signatures of synchronization that complements the phase coherence between the drive and the vdPo. We derive an analytical expression for the steady-state density matrix and the corresponding tomogram of the system, valid for arbitrary strengths of the harmonic drive. Analysis of the quantum tomogram uncovers clear phase-locking behavior, enabling the identification of the synchronization region (Arnold tongue) directly in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. Furthermore, the behaviour of $g^{(2)}(0)$ provides a statistical perspective that reinforces the tomographic signatures of QS. By analyzing the interplay between these metrics, we can gain more profound insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern QS in such systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a general numerical framework for both deterministic and probabilistic quantum state transformations, under locality constraints. For a given arbitrary bipartite initial state and a desired bipartite target state, we construct an optimized local quantum channel that transforms the initial state into the target state with high fidelity. To achieve this goal, local quantum channels are parametrized on a complex Stiefel manifold and optimized using gradient-based methods. We demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances entanglement distillation for weakly entangled states via two complementary strategies: optimized local state transformation and probabilistic local transformation. These results establish our method as a powerful and versatile tool for a broad class of quantum information processing tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Green's functions and many-body perturbation theory are essential for accurate electronic structure calculations, but the GW method remains computationally expensive. This work addresses this challenge by developing a novel BTD-based GW algorithm.

Method: The BTD algorithm is extended to enable a formally O(N^3) GW calculation, which is further optimized with polarizability screening in imaginary-time GW formalism and real space screening. The algorithm achieves an observed O(N^2) scaling.

Result: The BTD-based GW method demonstrates a significant reduction in computational cost, making it feasible for large systems with over 3000 basis functions. The algorithm's performance is validated on the S66 dataset using the JADE optimization approach.

Conclusion: This work establishes BTD as an efficient and scalable approach for performing large-scale GW calculations in molecular systems, opening new possibilities in electronic structure theory.

Abstract: Within the framework of many-body perturbation theory based on Green's functions, the $GW$ approximation has emerged as a pivotal method for computing quasiparticle energies and excitation spectra. However, its high computational cost and steep scaling present significant challenges for applications to large molecular systems. In this work, we extend the block tensor decomposition (BTD) algorithm, recently developed in our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 163, 174109 (2025)] for low-rank tensor compression, to enable a formally $O(N^3)$-scaling $GW$ algorithm. By integrating BTD with an imaginary-time $GW$ formalism and introducing a real space screening strategy for the polarizability, we achieve an observed scaling of approximately $O(N^2)$ in test systems. Key parameters of the algorithm are optimized on the S66 dataset using the JADE algorithm, ensuring a balanced compromise between accuracy and efficiency. Our BTD-based random phase approximation also exhibits $O(N^2)$ scaling, and eigenvalue-self-consistent $GW$ calculations become feasible for systems with over 3000 basis functions. This work establishes BTD as an efficient and scalable approach for large-scale $GW$ calculations in molecular systems.

Abstract: Solving molecular energy levels via the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm represents one of the most promising applications for demonstrating practically meaningful quantum advantage in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. To strike a balance between ansatz complexity and computational stability in VQE calculations, we propose the HiUCCSD, a novel symmetry-respecting ansatz engineered from the intrinsic information of the Hamiltonian. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of HiUCCSD within the scope of Abelian point groups. Furthermore, we compare the performance of HiUCCSD and the established SymUCCSD via VQE and Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter (ADAPT)-VQE numerical experiments on ten molecules with distinct point groups. The results show that HiUCCSD achieves equivalent performance to SymUCCSD for Abelian point group molecules, while avoiding the potential performance failure of SymUCCSD in the case of non-Abelian point group molecules. Across the studied molecular systems, HiUCCSD cuts the parameter count by 18%-83% for VQE and reduces the excitation operator pool size by 27%-84% for ADAPT-VQE, as compared with the UCCSD ansatz. With enhanced robustness and broader applicability, HiUCCSD offers a new ansatz option for advancing large-scale molecular VQE implementation.

TL;DR: The study calculates how sensitive acetaldehyde and methanol transitions are to changes in the electron-to-proton mass ratio, μ. The calculations range from 0.62 to 3.61. By using these lines from molecular clouds at about 8 kpc from the Galactic center, the study sets a limit on μ variations of (0.1 ± 0.4)×10⁻⁷. This is as stringent as previous limits, constraining violations of Einstein's local position invariance at 4×10⁻⁸ in the Galactic disk.

Motivation: Investigating the stability of fundamental constants is crucial for testing theories of physics and cosmology.

Method: Quantum-mechanical calculations of dimensionless sensitivity coefficients Q for 1-50 GHz acetaldehyde and methanol transitions.

Result: Q values range from 0.62 to 3.61. The μ variation limit is (0.1 ± 0.4)×10⁻⁷, constraining local position invariance violations.

Conclusion: Key findings: Sensitive calculations using a relevant molecule for broad Galactic distances establish tight constraints on μ variations, supporting Einstein's principle.

Abstract: We present the quantum-mechanical calculations of the dimensionless sensitivity coefficients Q to small changes in the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - for a number of low-frequency (1-50 GHz) transitions of the acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) molecule. The calculations show that Q varies in the range from 0.62 to 3.61. An example of the practical use of the CH3CHO and CH3OH lines tracing the same regions in three molecular clouds, located at large galactocentric distances (D_GC ~ 8 kpc) is considered. This results in a limit on the mu variations of Delta mu/mu = (0.1 +/- 0.4)*10^(-7) which is in line with previously obtained most stringent upper limits on changes in mu based on other molecules and methods. The limit obtained restricts hypothetical violations of the Einstein principle of the local position invariance at the level of 4*10^(-8) in the Galactic disk at large galactocentric distances.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits offer long coherence times, a compact footprint and compatibility with industrial CMOS manufacturing. Here, we investigate spin qubits hosted in quantum dots fabricated in a state-of-the-art 300 mm nanoelectronics foundry and demonstrate substantially enhanced coherence, achieving a Hahn-echo time of $T_2^{\text{Hahn}} = 4\,\mathrm{ms}$ for singlet--triplet oscillations. Employing noise spectroscopy and noise correlation measurements, we identify detuning noise with an amplitude of $δ\varepsilon_{\mathrm{rms}} = 2.2\,μ\mathrm{eV}$ (integrated over 90 s) and observe strong zero-phase correlations between two spatially separated spin qubits. The singlet--triplet basis intrinsically rejects these common-mode fluctuations, yielding a pronounced suppression of dephasing. Our results suggest that exploiting the versatility of silicon quantum dots to adapt the qubit encoding to the microscopic noise landscape represents a promising strategy for advancing scalable quantum information processing.

Abstract: Quantized charge pumping in one-dimensional chiral wires has been widely studied in the context of topological physics in a (1+1)-dimensional synthetic space, yet the role of orbital and spin degrees of freedom in such topological pumps remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR异质结构中界面态（IFs）的产生及其拓扑性质，特别关注了这些界面态与构成的臂架型石墨烯纳米条段（AGNR）端态（ESs）的关系。通过分析端态数目在横向电场中的行为，发现$R_1$型单元格的端态数目遵循$N = N_{A(B)} 	imes 6 + 1$和$N = N_{A(B)} 	imes 6 + 3$，而$R_2$型单元格则显示出$N_{A(B)} + 1$个端态。通过施加电场后的 Stark 效应，端态的简并性被解除，从而能够清晰地区分端态与界面态。使用实空间 bulk boundary 氐扰方法，表明异质结构的对 chirality 状态通过接线点扰动相互杂化，可能导致状态从 bulk 分区中脱离。在对称异质结构中，界面态的数量及其 chirality 由外层段和中心段端态的差值决定，即$N_{IF,β} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$，其中β为 chirality 标签。根据$N_O$与$N_C$的大小关系，界面态的 chirality 依次为 B 或 A。通过计算传输谱${	anh}(ε)$，发现外心值态在端态中心的 AGNR 段引发顶端态的异质结构支持一种拓扑双重量子点（TDQD）。利用effective的 intra-和 inter- 点电容模型，导出了通过 TDQD 的隧穿电流的解析表达式。通过热电分析，双重量子点在电子稀疏和空穴稀疏的电荷状态下表现出增强的非线性功率输出，而 Coulomb 阻':['door']) blockage 前所未闻地抑制了热电流，但保留了热电势。

Motivation: This paper delves into the emergence and topological characteristics of interface states (IFs) in a specific type of heterostructure composed of armchair graphene nanor ribbons (AGNR) segments. The investigation focuses on understanding the relationship between these interface states and the end states (ESs) of the individual AGNR segments, which are further characterized by their chirality types (A or B). The study is particularly aimed at exploring how translational symmetry affects the electronic properties of the system, such as the number and chirality of the interface states, by introducing a complex heterostructure where the constituent segments exhibit $R_1$ or $R_2$ type unit cells. Additionally, the paper examines the role of the Stark effect in lifting the degeneracy of end states, thereby enabling a clear separation between these states and the interface states. The research also proposes a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach to understand the hybridization of opposite-chirality states, the shift of these states out of the bulk gap, and the determination of the number and chirality of interface states based on the difference in the number of end states between the outer and central segments. The findings are further supported by transmission spectra计算, which reveal the presence of a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when the interface states arise from the end states of the central AGNR segment. The paper further employs an Anderson model with effective Coulomb interactions to derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD. Finally, the thermoelectric analysis demonstrates that the TDQD exhibits enhanced nonlinear power output under electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade significantly suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the electronic properties of complex heterostructures and their potential applications in novel electronic devices.

Method: The paper employs a comprehensive approach combining theoretical modeling and analytical derivations. The authors conduct experiments to investigate the interface states in the AGNRH segments and analyze the data using bulk boundary perturbation methods. They propose a real-space model to understand the hybridization and shift of end states, deriving an expression for the number and chirality of interface states based on the end state difference. The transmission spectra are computed to validate the theoretical predictions, which support the existence of a topological double quantum dot. The authors further employ an Anderson model with effective Coulomb interactions to derive an expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD. Finally, thermoelectric analysis is conducted to assess the device's performance under different charge states, demonstrating the impact of Coulomb blockade on thermal properties.

Result: The key findings of the paper include the identification of the number and chirality of interface states based on the difference in the number of end states between the outer and central AGNR segments. oppositely chirality states hybridize via junction-site perturbations, which may lead to the shift of these states out of the bulk gap. It was also shown that in symmetric AGNRH segments, the number and chirality of interface states are determined by the difference between the end states of the outer and central segments. The calculation of transmission spectra confirmed that the AGNRH hosts a topological double quantum dot when the interface states arise from the end states of the central AGNR segment. The analytical expression derived from the Anderson model accurately predicts the tunneling current through this TDQD, and the thermoelectric analysis revealed that the TDQD exhibits enhanced nonlinear power output under electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade effectively suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the emergence and topological characteristics of interface states in complex heterostructures consisting of armchair graphene nanoribbons. The investigation highlights the critical role of translational symmetry in determining the number and chirality of interface states. The proposed model successfully predicts the presence of a topological double quantum dot and its inherent properties, offering valuable insights for the design and optimization of novel electronic devices based on such heterostructures. The thermoelectric analysis further demonstrates the potential for these devices to exhibit enhanced nonlinear power output, complemented by Coulomb blockade characteristics. Overall, the study advances our understanding of the electronic properties of asymmetrical and complex heterostructures and provides a foundation for future experimental and device applications.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence and topological nature of interface states (IFs) in N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR heterostructure (AGNRH) segments lacking translational symmetry, focusing on their relation to the end states (ESs) of the constituent armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) segments. For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,β} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $β$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\cal T}_{GNR}(\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.

Abstract: Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.

Conclusion: This study bridges statistical physics concepts with magnetic nanoparticle dynamics, advancing theoretical frameworks and applications in spintronics.

Abstract: A novel theoretical expression for the relaxation time of magnetic nanoparticles with dipolar interactions is derived from Kramers' theory, extending the Boltzmann-Gibbs framework to incorporate Tsallis statistics. The model provides, for the first time, a unified description of magnetic relaxation from weakly to strongly interacting regimes, culminating in a spin-glass transition. It accounts for both the decrease and increase of the relaxation time with growing dipolar coupling, a long-standing problem in nanoparticle magnetism, as classical phenomenological models fail to elucidate this transition. This result also offers an innovative interpretation of the cut-off temperature, $T_{cut-off}$, as a spin glass transition under the Tsallis distribution framework within the context of Néel-Brown's relaxation theory, thereby contributing to ongoing scientific discussions regarding this phenomenon.
