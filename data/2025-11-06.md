Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 分析了一种用于研究几何约束磁体材料磁性状态的熵释放方法，通过数值模拟和实验对比揭示了不同材料的熵特征及其与经典模型的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 磁性材料的熵释放特性有助于理解其磁性状态，特别是在几何约束条件下，这类特性更为显著，因此研究这种现象具有重要意义。

Method: 通过数值模拟和实验测量来分别计算和比较不同材料的熵值，结合一些经典模型进行理论推导。

Result: 发现更高自旋三角形层状材料和SCGO/BSZCGO材料的熵释放行为符合某些经典模型的预测，表明材料的低能态由双重态构成。

Conclusion: 该研究表明几何约束下磁体材料的磁性状态可以用低能态来描述，未来需要用更精确的热力学测量方法来验证这一结论。

Abstract: The entropy that an insulating magnetic material releases upon cooling can
reveal important information about the properties of spin states in that
material. In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat
capacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states
continuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the
Ising model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy
associated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically
the values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered
systems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally
measured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$,
$FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from
the classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be
connected. This comparison suggests that the lowest-energy states of
higher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described in terms of
doublet states on individual magnetic sites. Our analyses demonstrate how the
values of entropy can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF
compounds and call for more accurate thermodynamic measurement in GF magnetic
materials.

### [2] [The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in correlated topological metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03299)

TL;DR: This paper discusses the electronic properties of CoTe₂ and NiTe₂, two layered 3D TMDs known as topological Dirac Type-II metals. Despite their $d$-bands not showing the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO, the authors use single-particle methods and valence band resonant PES to measure $U_{dd}$ for these materials. They also perform CT cluster simulations to compare the electronic parameters of CoTe₂ and CoO, finding that CoTe₂ has lower $U_{dd}$ and a negative CT energy, indicating it behaves as a topological metal due to band inversion in correlated metals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work was likely motivated by the need to understand the electronic properties of TMDs and how correlation effects influence their topology. The study aims to clarify the electronic parameters of CoTe₂ and NiTe₂, which are important for potential applications in spintronics and other emerging technologies.

Method: The authors used a combination of single-particle partial density of states and two-hole correlation satellite in valence band resonant PES to measure $U_{dd}$. They also performed CT cluster simulations to validate their findings and compare the electronic parameters of CoTe₂ and CoO.

Result: The study reveals that CoTe₂ has $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV, while CoO has $U_{dd}$ = 5.0 eV/4.0 eV. CT energy $igtriangleup$ is -2.0 eV for CoTe₂ and 4.0 eV for CoO. The electronic parameters of CoTe₂ are lower than those of CoO, and the reduced $U_{dd}$ and negative $igtriangleup$ contribute to CoTe₂ being a topological metal due to band inversion in correlated metals.

Conclusion: This research provides valuable insights into the electronic properties of CoTe₂ and NiTe₂ and establishes a framework for achieving topological behavior in correlated metals via band inversion.

Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CoTe$_2$ and
NiTe$_2$ are topological Dirac Type-II metals. Their $d$-bands do not exhibit
the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO. We address
this conundrum by quantifying the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via
single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation
satellite using valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES), and
obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV for CoTe$_2$/NiTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT)
cluster model simulations of the measured core-level PES and x-ray absorption
spectra of CoTe$_2$ and CoO validate their contrasting electronic
parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe$_2$,
and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength
$T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$<$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in
CoTe$_2$ is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from
ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced
$U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$>$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a
topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$${p}$ type lowest energy excitations.
Similarly, we obtain a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe$_2$
compared to NiO. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and
reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for
achieving topological behavior via band inversion in correlated metals.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are quantum phases of matter featuring collectively
entangled states and emergent fractional many-body excitations. While methods
exist to probe three-dimensional quantum spin liquids experimentally, these
techniques lack the sensitivity to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids.
This seriously hampers the study of potential monolayer quantum spin liquid
candidates such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. Scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) have recently been suggested as
promising probes of the quantum spin liquid state, as they can access the
spinon spectrum through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). In this work,
we employ this approach on the quantum spin liquid candidate material
1T-TaSe$_2$ and directly measure its low-energy inelastic excitations. We
observe the emergence of a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction driven by
the substrate, equivalent spectroscopy across all spin sites and coexistence of
zero and finite energy excitations. We show that these observations are
consistent with a modulated $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ spin liquid ground state.
Our results demonstrate that IETS provides a powerful route to obtain
atomic-scale insight into the magnetic excitations of two-dimensional
materials, allowing to explore the effects of moir\'e modulations on potential
quantum liquid phases.

### [4] [Free Majorana Modes in Superconducting Quantum Wires](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03380)
*Karyn Le Hur*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Zero-energy edge solutions in a magnetic impurity model are analyzed, showing how such solutions can correspond to Majorana fermions in a p-wave superconducting wire, with implications for Majorana zero modes in d-wave superconductors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding Majorana zero modes in superconducting systems is crucial for advancing efforts in topological quantum computing and exploring exotic quantum phases.

Method: The analysis involves building a model of a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with a spin bound state in a Luther-Emery wire, which represents a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave superconducting state. This model is used to investigate zero-energy solutions and their relation to Majorana fermions.

Result: The study demonstrates that zero-energy edge states in the magnetic impurity model correspond to Majorana zero-mode solutions in the p-wave wire, offering a pathway to realize Majorana fermions through magnetic impurities in d-wave superconductors.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of Majorana fermions and their potential realization in d-wave superconductors mediated by magnetic impurities, highlighting the importance of studying zero-energy edge solutions in such systems.

Abstract: An s-wave superconducting wire with attractive interactions can admit a
zero-energy bound state equation (solution) at an edge similar to the
Jackiw-Rebbi model; this is a specific aspect of low-dimensional quantum
systems, Dirac equation and e.g. of the Luther-Emery liquid with a spin gap. In
this Letter, K. Le Hur Europhys. Lett., 49 (6), pp. 768-774 (2000), I
introduced a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with such a (spin) bound
state in a Luther-Emery wire representing then a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave
superconducting state. This method is general and show how Majorana fermions at
zero energy, i.e. Majorana zero modes, can take place in a superconducting wire
model from the two-channel Kondo effect. Within these two channels (wires), the
Luther-Emery form of the superconducting term can be reached within the
weak-coupling attractive limit. Due to the interest in Majorana zero modes from
magnetic impurities interacting with an s-wave superconductor, I take time to
analyze zero-energy edge solutions in my model and present a correspondence
with the p-wave superconducting wire in the topological phase through
alternatives versions of the quantum field theory. I develop the relation
between the edge magnetic susceptibility and the local capacitance measure in a
p-wave superconducting wire. I elaborate on the idea that Majorana zero modes,
i.e. free Majorana fermions, can be realized with magnetic impurities bridging
the gap between two s-wave superconducting wires. The spin gap and the
resonance with the impurity can protect the free Majorana solutions when
including perturbations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the SU(2) gauge theory for spin fluctuations in the
two-dimensional Hubbard model, where the electron field is fractionalized in
terms of spinons and chargons. In this theory, spinons are described by a
non-linear sigma model, while chargons are treated as fermions at a mean-field
level. We investigate the instability to a superconducting state SC*, arising
from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) where pairing between chargons occurs.
Consistent with previous studies, our analysis reveals a coexisting phase
characterized by both magnetic and superconducting order for the chargons. The
central contribution of this work is the calculation of the feedback of
superconductivity on spatial and temporal spin stiffnesses, thereby quantifying
its impact on spin fluctuations. Our key finding is that superconductivity
significantly suppresses these spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin
fluctuations. This enhancement suggests that superconductivity can play a
crucial role in stabilizing quantum disorder against long-range magnetic
ordering.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) characterizes the continuous
transition beyond Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, occurring between two phases
that exhibit distinct symmetry breaking. The debate over whether genuine DQCP
exists in physical SU(2) spin systems or the transition is weakly first-order
has persisted for many years. In this letter, we construct a non-Hermitian
easy-plane $J$-$Q$ model and perform sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC) simulation to explore the impact of non-Hermitian microscopic
interactions on the transition that potentially features a DQCP. Our results
demonstrate that the intensity of the first-order transitions significantly
diminishes with the amplification of non-Hermitian interactions, serving as
numerical evidence to support the notion that the transition in $J$-$Q$ model
is quasi-critical, possibly in the vicinity of the fixed point governing DQCP
in the complex plane, described by a non-unitary conformal field theory (CFT).
The non-Hermitian interaction facilitates the approach towards such a complex
fixed point in the parameter regime. Furthermore, our QMC study on the
non-Hermitian J-Q model opens a new route to numerically investigating the
nature of complex CFT in the microscopic model.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过连续相似变换方法研究二维交错磁体中磁子激发的量子效应，不仅能够定量分析磁子色散和动态结构因子，还能够预测连续相似变换的发散性，这些发散性则为量子相变和磁子非弹性现象提供了新的重要信息。

Abstract: We investigate quantum effects on magnon excitations in a minimal spin-1/2
Heisenberg model for 2D altermagnets on the square lattice. A continuous
similarity transformation is applied in momentum space to derive an effective
Hamiltonian that conserves the number of magnon excitations. This allows us to
quantitatively calculate the one-magnon dispersion, the effects of
magnon-magnon interactions, and the dynamic structure factor in a certain range
of parameters. In particular, we focus on the altermagnetic spin splitting of
the magnon bands and the size of the roton minimum. We further map out
divergencies of the continuous similarity transformation for different types of
generators, which signal either the breakdown of the N\'eel-ordered phase or
the presence of significant magnon decay.

Abstract: We report a study of nano-scale structural peculiarities of the
antiferromagnetic layered semimetal EuSn2As2, and show that they are
responsible for its puzzling magnetic properties. The high resolution
transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of planar defects in the
lattice of the studied single crystals. Using a combination of microstructural
and DFT analysis we demonstrated that a single planar nano-defects forms a
layer of a distinct phase EuSnAs2, that is different from the EuSn2As2 phase of
the bulk lattice. The smaller distance between Eu layers in the planar
nano-defect promotes formation of local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of the Eu
atoms. On average, the planar defects form a weak ferromagnetic phase in the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) host lattice. The obtained results explain several
puzzling features in magnetic properties of A-type AFM materials: the nonlinear
magnetization in low in-plane fields, ferromagnetic-type hysteresis in low
field, and the upturn of the magnetic susceptibility in the AFM state at
temperatures approaching zero.

Conclusion: 所有 AdS 中的黑洞都可以通过饱和化定量发楔和外视界的特定组合进行孤立，这导致了因素分隔在中间的香农与视界之间，这点对量子引力和相关领域有重要影响。

Abstract: Using holographic realizations of the Araki-Lieb (AL) inequality, we show
that typical pure states in large-N holographic conformal field theories (CFTs)
possess two characteristic length scales determined solely by energy and
conserved charges: a microscopic L_UV and an infrared L_IR > L_UV. Degrees of
freedom between these scales effectively factorize -- one purifying the
ultraviolet (scales < L_UV) and the other the infrared sector (scales > L_IR).
Remarkably, the pure-state factor including the ultraviolet sector is
determined solely by energy and conserved charges up to exponentially
suppressed corrections. Our results imply that all black holes in anti-de
Sitter space can be isolated from an asymptotic region, the "corona", formed by
the inclusion of entanglement wedges for which the AL inequality is saturated,
and that an effective factorization emerges in the buffer region between the
corona and the outer horizon.

TL;DR:  paper investigates the structure of conformal manifolds around AdS_3 × S^3, which lift from flat directions in a gauged supergravity derived from six-dimensional N=(1,1) supergravity. They use a combination of numerical and symbolic methods—symbolic regression with Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo samplers—to find hidden polynomial relations and parametrize a new solution family.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  studying conformal manifolds and their structure around specific geometric backgrounds (AdS_3 × S^3) is important in understanding the dualities and properties in string theory and supergravity. Extracting hidden polynomial constraints from the scalar potential's flat directions provides a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and mathematical structure.

Method:  the authors employ a dual approach using numerical exploration and symbolic inference. For the symbolic part, they developed a novel algorithm called Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo samplers, which is particularly suited for finding polynomial constraints in high-dimensional spaces. This method combines Annealed Importance Sampling with Sequential Monte Carlo samplers to uncover hidden relations in complex parameter spaces.

Result:  their study successfully reconstructed a set of polynomial relations that describe an explicit analytic parametrization of a new family of solutions. These findings represent a significant advancement in understanding the structure of conformal manifolds and their parametrization in the context of the given supergravity setup.

Conclusion:  this work opens up new avenues for exploring similar structures in other high-energy physics contexts by providing a methodological framework for finding hidden patterns and relations in complex scalar potentials. The combination of numerical and symbolic techniques offers a powerful tool for analyzing geometric and algebraic structures in theoretical physics.

Abstract: We investigate the structure of conformal manifolds around AdS$_3 \times S^3$
which lift from continuous flat directions in the scalar potential of gauged
supergravity resulting from six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supergravity.
Our approach combines numerical exploration and symbolic inference. For the
latter, we develop a symbolic regression algorithm based on Annealed Sequential
Monte Carlo samplers, a combination of Annealed Importance Sampling and
Sequential Monte Carlo samplers, well-suited to uncovering polynomial
constraints in high-dimensional parameter spaces. The algorithm reconstructs a
set of polynomial relations that provides an explicit analytic parametrization
of a new family of solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is focused on finding solutions to the discrete Nahm equation, which is a nonlinear difference equation for complex matrices, and applies these solutions to study hyperbolic monopoles.

Method: The authors use Platonic symmetries to impose boundary conditions and solve the discrete Nahm equation, then compute the spectral curves of the resulting monopoles.

Result: New solutions of the discrete Nahm equation are derived using Platonic symmetries, and the corresponding spectral curves for hyperbolic monopoles are calculated.

Conclusion: The research provides a novel method for solving the discrete Nahm equation and offers insights into the properties of hyperbolic monopoles through spectral curve analysis.

Abstract: The discrete Nahm equation is an integrable nonlinear difference equation for
complex $N\times N$ matrices defined on a one-dimensional lattice, with rank
and symmetry boundary conditions at the ends of the lattice. Solutions of this
system correspond to $SU(2)$ magnetic monopoles of charge $N$ in hyperbolic
space, with the curvature related to the number of lattice points. Here some
solutions of the discrete Nahm equation are obtained by imposing platonic
symmetries, and the spectral curves of the associated hyperbolic monopoles are
calculated directly from these solutions.

Abstract: We study the BPS states of $U(N)_k\times U(1)_{-k}$ vector Chern-Simons
theory on a sphere at weak coupling $\lambda=\frac{N}{k}\ll 1$, dual to an
AdS$_4$ higher spin gravity. Higher spin currents are well known to be
anomalous at $\lambda\neq 0$. We show that these non-BPS higher spin particles
form multi-particle `BPS bounds' at low energy, and interpret them as a
primordial form of small black hole states. We also construct a new heavy BPS
operator at $N=2$. We study the BPS phases of this system from the large $N$
index at Planckian `temperatures'. The deconfined saddles at high temperature
exist only above a threshold, similar to the BTZ black holes. The low
temperature saddles are given by novel 2-cut eigenvalue distributions. Their
phase transition involves subtle issues like the holomorphic anomaly and the
background independence, whose studies we initiate. In particular, we obtain a
lower bound on the critical temperature by studying the eigenvalue instantons.

Abstract: How can we detect the difference in the effects of the quantum corrections
included in the metric of a spacetime and the quantum corrections included in
the entropy of such a system? Recently, J. Barrow designed an expression based
directly on black hole (BH) entropy of Bekenstein-Hawking where the geometry of
the event horizon can also have an intricate, non smooth, structure, a fractal
geometry. These fractal features are represented by a numerical constant
parameter, the fractal parameter (FP). Since then, several interesting issues
have been explored in the literature. In this work, we investigate the
inversion temperature connected to the Joule-Thomson expansion from the
thermodynamics of AdS-Reissner-N\"ordstrom BH by using the Barrow entropy
equation where the FP has several values within a certain validity interval. We
include quantum corrections in a cosmological fluid that can describe phantom
dark matter or quintessence, both in a Kiselev scenario. The description of
such physical systems also involves numerical solutions concerning the FP. The
results are shown by temperature-pressure curves for multiple values of the
parameters of the system used here. In conclusion of our analysis, we also show
isenthalpic curves corresponding to fixed-mass BH processes, and we respond
numerically to the question made in the first line of this abstract.

Abstract: Among the available perturbative approaches in quantum field theory, heat
kernel techniques provide a powerful and geometrically transparent framework
for computing effective actions in nontrivial backgrounds. In this work,
resummation patterns within the heat kernel expansion are examined as a means
of systematically extracting nonperturbative information. Building upon
previous results for Yukawa interactions and scalar quantum electrodynamics, we
extend the analysis to spinor fields, demonstrating that a recently conjectured
resummation structure continues to hold. The resulting formulation yields a
compact expression that resums invariants constructed from the electromagnetic
tensor and its spinorial couplings, while preserving agreement with known
proper-time coefficients. Beyond its immediate computational utility, the
framework offers a unified perspective on the emergence of nonperturbative
effects (such as Schwinger pair creation) in relation to perturbative heat
kernel data, and provides a basis for future extensions to curved spacetimes
and non-Abelian gauge theories.

Abstract: Scrambling is a diagnostic of quantum chaos in strongly coupled systems, and
plays a central role in the holographic description of black hole dynamics. We
study scrambling in high-temperature holographic CFTs, with an emphasis on
perturbations dual to particles on infalling and bound trajectories in the bulk
description. For BTZ and AdS-Schwarzschild geometries, we derive an analytic
expression relating the difference in scrambling times to the particles'
kinematics. We match this to a 2d CFT computation by constructing the smeared
operator that creates the bulk particle with the desired kinematics and
calculating the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). For higher-dimensional
holographic CFTs, the scrambling slows and eventually ceases when the dual bulk
particle has insufficient energy to overcome the angular momentum barrier.

Abstract: We compute tree-level celestial operator product expansions (OPE) in a
bosonic sub-sector of the Berkovits-Witten conformal supergravity from the
scattering amplitudes in the MHV configuration. While the OPE between a leading
soft graviton current for a positive helicity graviton and any of the primary
operators exhibits the same singularity structure as in a gravitational theory
with two-derivative kinetic terms, the OPE of a subleading soft graviton
current with a positive helicity hard graviton primary operator receives
corrections, as a consequence of the non-universal nature of the subleading
soft graviton theorem in the bulk. Remarkably, the subleading soft graviton
terms remain consistent with the Ward identity of the chiral
$\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R}) $ current algebra, albeit with a different
realisation where particle-changing operators play a role. Our analysis
suggests that the dual celestial CFT continues to enjoy at least the chiral
$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ symmetry, though in a non-trivial way, and possibly a
conformal extension of it.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The crossed product, and consequent transition from von Neumann algebras of
type III to II, is recovered from a truncation of more general gravitational
dressing constructions, about certain spacetimes. This is done by extending
"standard dressing" constructions previously used to give a perturbative
definition of "gravitational splittings," defining approximate localization of
information. This result appears to illustrate that this algebraic transition
is a small piece of a more general algebraic, or other mathematical, structure
associated with quantum gravity. The leading-order structure involves
noncommutativity from separated regions, and at the nonperturbative level
connects with a possible explanation of holographic behavior for gravity.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in alternating magnetic spin groups and finds that in half of these materials, the extrinsic AHC is comparable to the intrinsic AHC, even in the clean limit. However, in other materials, the extrinsic contribution is negligible. The difference arises from the nonanalytic dependence of the intrinsic AHC on spin-orbit coupling, which is linked to the lifting of spin degeneracy along nodal planes due to weak spin-orbit coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of AHC in magnetic materials is important for applications in spintronic devices and for understanding the role of spin-orbit coupling in materials.

Method: The paper uses a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical calculations to study the AHC in different magnetic materials.

Result: In materials with a finite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the extrinsic AHC is significant even in the clean limit, whereas in other materials, it is mostly negligible.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that spin-orbit coupling plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of AHC in magnetic materials, and this has important implications for the design of spintronic devices.

Abstract: We find the extrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) to be comparable to
the intrinsic one in roughly half of the altermagnetic spin Laue groups in the
limit of large exchange splitting. In materials with a finite
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interaction, the extrinsic contribution is essential
even in the clean limit. In other altermagnets it is mostly negligible. This
peculiar behavior is linked to the nonanalytic dependence of the intrinsic AHC
on spin-orbit coupling. Both originate from the lifting of the spin degeneracy
along the nodal planes as the weak spin-orbit coupling breaks the
nonrelativistic spin symmetry.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了洛伦兹错散射作为主导机制的高迁移率材料中的逆磁输运现象，为强逆磁输运提供了基本原理，并为后续的器件设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In materials with broken inversion symmetry, nonreciprocal magneto-transport
(NRMT) manifests as a bilinear dependence of charge conductivity on applied
electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields. This phenomenon is deeply rooted in
symmetry and electronic quantum geometry, holding promise for novel
rectification and detector technologies. Existing experimental studies
generally attribute NRMT to Zeeman-driven mechanisms and exhibit quadratic
scaling with conductivity. Here, we report a previously unknown NRMT
microscopic mechanism - Lorentz skew scattering (LSK) - revealed through the
discovery of an unprecedented quartic scaling law of NRMT as well as
quantitative agreement between theory and experiment in BiTeBr. LSK emerges
from the interplay of Lorentz force and skew scattering, bridging classical
field effect to quantum scattering effect on the Fermi surface. We demonstrate
that the LSK dominates NRMT in BiTeBr, and elucidate that this dominance over
other possible contributions stems from high mobility and strong Rashba
splitting. The finding of LSK mechanism is of unique importance because it
unveils the leading NRMT effect in high-mobility systems and suggests a
universal principle towards strong NRMT by enhancing electronic relaxation time
in topological materials, rendering a new designing idea for low-dissipation
rectifiers and high-performance quantum electronics.

TL;DR:  papers on nonlinear Hall effect found a new mechanism in graphene-hBN moire superlattices induced by perpendicular magnetic fields, offering a giant and tunable Hall effect compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  studying and controlling the nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) has important implications for rectification and energy harvesting in various materials. understanding how external fields can control NHE signals is a key motivation.

Method:  the study involves investigating a graphene-hBN moire superlattice under a perpendicular magnetic field, measuring the Hall effect, and identifying the Lorentz skew scattering (LSK) mechanism as the source of the NHE.

Result:  the discovery shows that the field-induced NHE has a linear dependence on magnetic field and a pronounced unidirectional angular dependence. The magnitude of this NHE reaches up to 32% of the linear Hall signal, and exhibits a unique quartic scaling law. The Hall conductivity near van Hove singularities is over an order of magnitude larger than previous reports.

Conclusion:  this work demonstrates that Lorentz skew scattering induced by a perpendicular magnetic field provides an efficient and scalable method for obtaining giant Hall rectification in high-mobility materials, opening up new possibilities for advancing both fundamental understanding and technological applications of the nonlinear Hall effect.

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can enable rectification and energy
harvesting, and its control by external fields, including gate, strain and
magnetic field, has been pursued intensively. However, existing tuning pathways
rely predominantly on fully quantum mechanical effects and are typically
inefficient, resulting in weak NHE signals that limit further progress. In this
work, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire
superlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called
Lorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This
field-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a
pronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches
up to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE
originating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a
record-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\mu}mV-1{\Omega}-1) near van
Hove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude
larger than all previously reported NHEs. Our findings establish an efficient,
magnetic-field-driven route to giant Hall rectification in high-mobility
materials, offering a broadly applicable paradigm for modulating the NHE beyond
electrostatic gating.

Motivation: Understanding plasmon dispersion in plasmonic crystals has implications for advancing optical devices and meta-materials.

Method: The study involves fabrication of AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron systems (2DES), characterization of Terahertz (THz) spectrum, and development of analytical models to explain the observed dispersion and plasmon behavior.

Result: The research identifies and validates the existence of slot plasmons with square-root dispersion, obeying a specific wave-vector quantization rule based on the gate-to-substrate distance and slot width. The model explains reflection phase shifts and confirms persistence up to room temperature.

Conclusion: This study paves the way for designing plasmonic devices with enhanced control over optical properties via controlled surface plasmon excitations.)

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the terahertz spectrum of plasma excitations in
a plasmonic crystal based on AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron system (2DES).
While screened plasmon modes with linear dispersion are readily observed in the
plasmonic crystals, the existence of unscreened modes localized in the slots
between the gates has remained unobserved until now. We discover this slot
plasma excitation exhibiting square-root dispersion. It turned out that these
slot plasmons follow an unconventional wave-vector quantization rule, $q_u=(N +
1/4) \times \pi/l_u$ for even integers $N$, and require the condition for
excitation $q_u h \ll 1$, where $h$ is the gate-to-2DES distance and $l_u$ is
the slot width. We develop an analytical model that accurately captures the
found dispersion and relaxation, revealing a non-trivial $-\pi/4$ phase shift
upon plasmon reflection at the gate edge. Experiments demonstrate that the slot
plasmons persist up to room temperature, thereby enabling a broad range of
opportunities for the advancement of plasmonic devices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) reduces data transfer latency by rolling memory
and logic elements into one compute location. As an emergent material candidate
for such an architecture, we propose a strained Weyl semimetal based
spin-orbit-torque random-access memory (SWSM-SOTRAM) device. The spin-orbit
torque (SOT) originates from two mechanisms: (1) the inverse spin Galvanic
effect (iSGE), which generates nonequilibrium in-plane spin accumulation at
interfaces, and (2) a bulk spin Hall effect (SHE), which produces a transverse
spin current carrying out-of-plane spin angular momentum. The latter is tunable
via an exchange Zeeman field. Both effects are evaluated using the
tight-binding model coupled with a nonequilibrium Green's function (TB-NEGF)
formalism for quantum transport. Information write is achieved through SOT
switching of an out-of-plane free magnet. A piezo attached to a
magnetostrictive selector modulates the strain in the latter, leading to the
rotation of the magnetization and hence the exchange Zeeman field exerted on
the Weyl semimetal. This strain-controlled exchange field enables the symmetry
tuning of the Weyl semimetal and modulation of its spin Hall effect. The
TB-NEGF calculations of SHE and iSGE, combined with Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
(LLG) simulations of magnetization dynamics, establish the SOT switching
mechanism and demonstrate a pathway toward the SWSM-SOTRAM PIM device.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Negative refraction of coherent phonons is crucial for thermal management and
quantum information processing, but it remains unrealized because achieving the
suitable dispersion for negative refraction simultaneously with long-range
coherence is challenging. In this letter, we overcome this limitation by
introducing a momentum compensation mechanism mediated by discrete
translational symmetry. Interfacial reciprocal lattice vectors provide momentum
compensation during phonon tunneling and induce asymmetric mode matching,
resulting in negative refraction without requiring strong dispersion anisotropy
or a negative-curvature band. Using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism,
we demonstrate coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in
graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures. This general mechanism
enables active control of phonon flow via interfacial design, paving the way
for applications in atomic-scale phonon lenses and directional thermal
transport.

Abstract: There has been experimentally implemented a technique of neutralization of an

carriers in strong electric fields in the multilayer InGaAs/GaAs
heterostructures with quantum wells. The technique is implemented by means of
deposition of a shunting semi opaque silver film on the heterostructure surface
between the ohmic contacts. In absence of shunting the domain appearance leads
to current decrease, current oscillations and also to a strong decrease of the
band-to-band emission during a voltage pulse applied to the sample. The
shunting eliminated the current decrease and enabled it to strongly enlarge the
band-to-band emission intensity.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the electrical tunability of ultrastrong terahertz light-matter interactions between a GHz circuit-based complementary split ring resonator and a 2D electron gas under strong magnetic fields and electric gate bias, showing how confinement of electrons to 410 nm enables in situ tuning of the coupling strength from 0.46 to 0.18.

Motivation: Understanding and extensively controlling ultrastrong terahertz light-matter interactions is vital for next-level terahertz applications such as imaging, sensing, and communication.

Method: Use of transmission spectroscopy under a magnetic field, different electric gate biases, and analyzing Landau polariton dispersion, with electron confinement down to 410 nm via gating.

Result: Achieves in-situ tunability of the coupling strength from 0.46 to 0.18, marking the first demonstration of terahertz far-field spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single THz resonator and 2D electrons in a GaAs quantum well system.

Conclusion: The work opens a new avenue for ultrastrong terahertz interactions between resonators and 2D electron systems, providing a foundation for future in situ studies and applications.

Abstract: We study the electrical tunability of ultrastrong light-matter interactions
between a single terahertz circuit-based complementary split ring resonator
(cSRR) and a two-dimensional electron gas. For this purpose, transmission
spectroscopy measurements are performed under the influence of a strong
magnetic field at different set points for the electric gate bias. The
resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as
the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely
sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for
the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective
tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator. This allows the
normalized coupling strength to be tuned in-situ from $\eta$ = 0.46 down to
$\eta$ = 0.18. This is the first demonstration of terahertz far-field
spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single terahertz
resonator and electrons in a GaAs quantum well heterostructure.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of single-atom bits for high-density memory with mechanical interactions, achieving low heat generation and high-density recording through magnetic exchange force microscopy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to develop memory devices with minimal energy loss and high density, highlighting the potential for new technologies in information storage.

Method: Magnetic exchange force microscopy was used to read and write the spin orientation of holmium adatoms on MgO thin films. The adatom's spin was stabilized by adatom-specific anisotropy and measured via exchange forces between the tip and the adatom. TheTip's approach facilitated spinwriting by affecting exchange symmetry.

Result: The research successfully demonstrated billionth-of-a-meter manipulation of magnetic bits for high-density and low-power memory. The implementationpaves the way for atom-scale mechanicspintronics with potential for future advancements.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept opens new possibilities for future memory technologies utilizing atomic-scale mechanically-driven spin manipulation.

Abstract: The integration of single-atom bits enables the realization of the highest
data-density memory. Reading and writing information to these bits through
mechanical interactions opens the possibility of operating the magnetic devices
with low heat generation and high density recording. To achieve this visionary
goal, we demonstrate the use of magnetic exchange force microscopy to read and
write the spin orientation of individual holmium adatoms on MgO thin films. The
spin orientation of the holmium adatom is stabilized by the strong uniaxial
anisotropy of the adsorption site and can be read out by measuring the exchange
forces between the magnetic tip and the atom. The spin orientation can be
written by approaching the tip closer to the holmium adatom.We explain this
writing mechanism by the symmetry reduction of the adsorption site of the Ho
adatom. These findings demonstrate the potential for information storage with
minimal energy loss and pave the way for a new field of atomic-scale
mechano-spintronics.

TL;DR: ENDF/B-VIII.1 presents updated nuclear data for key elements like Pu, O, F, and other actinides, incorporating international efforts and addressing data issues for high burnup applications. The library shows improved consistency, particularly for U and Pu in the resonance region, and Materials like stainless steel and others were affected by previous data. Resultantly, library performance is comparable to other standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuclear data accuracy is crucial for applications like nuclear power and research, so updates to the library are motivated by enhancing reliability and addressing gaps in prior versions like ENDC/B-VIII.0. The update leverages international collaboration to improve covariance and uncertainty quantification, ensuring more robust predictions for integral experiments and design work.

Method: ENDF/B-VII.1 library methodology likely involved here methods like multicycle diffusion theory or Monte Carlo simulations to compute cross sections and uncertainties. The updated data may have incorporated new experimental data, continuing experiments performed in the previous version, and enhancing model accuracy for precise uncertainty quantification.

Result: The findings indicate that the ENDF deliverables and covariance evaluations are validated through a combination of experimental and computational methods. The results emphasize the importance of accurate neutron cross-section data for systematic uncertainty treatment and application in various nuclear science and technologies. Regions with pronounced uncertainty, such as those for high-burnup materials, have been addressed to improve practical utility in applications like the mentioned benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ENDF/B-VIII.1 library represents a more reliable resource for nuclear data, enhanced through international collaboration, multicycle calculations, and systematic covariance assessments. It addresses the limitations of prior versions, making them less suitable for modern high-burnup applications. The availability of these updated data in standard formats like ENDF-6 and GNDS supports continued advancements in nuclear technology and research.

Abstract: The ENDF/B-VIII.1 library is the newest recommended evaluated nuclear data
file by the Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) for use in nuclear
science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the six
years since the release of ENDF/B-VIII.0. Among key advances made are that the
$^{239}$Pu file was reevaluated by a joint international effort and that
updated $^{16,18}$O, $^{19}$F, $^{28-30}$Si, $^{50-54}$Cr, $^{55}$Mn,
$^{54,56,57}$Fe, $^{63,65}$Cu, $^{139}$La, $^{233,235,238}$U, and
$^{240,241}$Pu neutron nuclear data from the IAEA coordinated INDEN
collaboration were adopted. Over 60 neutron dosimetry cross sections were
adopted from the IAEA's IRDFF-II library. In addition, the new library includes
significant changes for $^3$He, $^6$Li,$^9$Be, $^{51}$V, $^{88}$Sr, $^{103}$Rh,
$^{140,142}$Ce, Dy, $^{181}$Ta, Pt, $^{206-208}$Pb, and $^{234,236}$U neutron
data, and new nuclear data for the photonuclear, charged-particle and atomic
sublibraries. Numerous thermal neutron scattering kernels were reevaluated or
provided for the very first time. On the covariance side, work was undertaken
to introduce better uncertainty quantification standards and testing for
nuclear data covariances. The significant effort to reevaluate important
nuclides has reduced bias in the simulations of many integral experiments with
particular progress noted for fluorine, copper, and stainless steel containing
benchmarks. Data issues hindered the successful deployment of the previous
ENDF/B-VIII.0 for commercial nuclear power applications in high burnup
situations. These issues were addressed by improving the $^{238}$U and
$^{239,240,241}$Pu evaluated data in the resonance region. The new library
performance as a function of burnup is similar to the reference ENDF/B-VII.1
library. The ENDF/B-VIII.1 data are available in ENDF-6 and GNDS format at

### [33] [Oscillatons in Scalar-Field Dark Matter from a Full Fourier Expansion of an Exponential Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02878)
*A. Mahmoodzadeh,K Ghaderi,P. Amiri*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 文章提出了自引力标量场（SFDM）中的振荡子结构，并通过详细的数学分析和数值模拟，揭示了这些结构的时间依赖性及其在能量密度、能量流量等方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自引力标量场中的振荡子结构，特别是具有指数自相互作用的振荡子，有助于理解标量场暗物质的形成和演化。

Method: 文章采用Fourier展开（Jacobi-Anger）方法，系统的处理了时间依赖的度量和势，统一了二次、四次及更高阶的相互作用，通过Bessel级数截断法进行数值求解。

Result: 主要结果包括：1) 通过闭合的无量纲边界值问题，精确数值求解了振荡子的径向分布；2) 计算了能量密度、能量流量、压力等时 resolved和 time averaged 观测量，发现这些量依赖于耦合常数λ和中心振幅，且只包含基频的偶数谐波；3) 指出径向流主要在2!谐波振荡；4) 分析了瞬时压力，发现通过经典能量条件诊断（WEC/NEC/SEC）能够合理评估它们。

Conclusion: 文章为研究SFDM振荡子提供了可控和可扩展的数学框架，这对稳定性分析和观测约束具有重要意义。

Abstract: Real, time-dependent scalar fields can form oscillating, self-gravitating
configurations-oscillatonsthat are viable candidates for scalar-field dark
matter (SFDM). We revisit oscillatons with an exponential self-interaction and
develop a full Fourier (Jacobi{Anger) treatment that resums the time dependence
of both the metric and the potential, thereby unifying quadratic, quartic, and
higher-order interactions within a single framework. After fixing the
small-amplitude normalization V0 = m2 {\Phi}=({\lambda}2k0), we derive a
closed, dimensionless boundary-value problem for the radial profiles and solve
it numerically via Bessel-series truncation with controlled convergence. We
compute time-resolved and time-averaged observables energy density, radial
energy flux, radial/tangential pressures, and total mass and map their
dependence on the coupling {\lambda} and central amplitude. The geometry
exhibits only even harmonics of the fundamental frequency, while composite
observables inherit a DC part plus even harmonics; the radial flux oscillates
predominantly at 2!. Apparent negative instantaneous pressures arise from
coherent oscillations and are assessed consistently through classical
energy-condition diagnostics (WEC/NEC/SEC). Our formulation provides a
reproducible and extensible baseline for stability analyses and observational
constraints on SFDM oscillatons

TL;DR: 研究了静态轴对称非Killing视界，发现通常存在于不具有圆性对称性的时空，向外界提出了三种不同的表面重力：无缩因子、法向、 Zealover。发现前两种一般不相等，后两种总是相等，但其中无缩因子、法向、Zealover均不恒定。通过 tunnelling 方法计算霍金辐射谱，发现温度由非恒定的 Zealover表面重力控制。回顾了视界不满足Killing条件下的四个-black hole力学定律的状况。为广义相对论之外的黑洞热动力学发展了深化的理解。

Motivation: 为了探索比广义相对论更复杂的黑洞热动力学，研究了没有圆性对称的视界及其力学特征，以及不同表面重力的定义与计算方法。

Method: 定义并计算了三种表面重力，使用Smarr公式和tunnelling方法验证了霍金辐射的温度依赖性。

Result: 表面重力的非恒定性质和霍金辐射的温度关系，补充了黑洞力学定律在非-Killing视界的情况。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个更深入的黑洞热力学理解框架，特别是在广义相对论之外的情况。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanics of stationary axisymmetric non-Killing horizons,
which emerge in spacetimes that do not enjoy the symmetry known as circularity
-- as is commonly the case for rotating black holes beyond general relativity.
Specifically, we define and compute three notions of surface gravity:
inaffinity, normal, and peeling; and find that the inaffinity and normal
definitions generically differ, while the normal and peeling definitions always
agree, although none of them is constant over the horizon. We then derive a
version of Smarr's formula, which appears to involve an average over the
horizon of the normal surface gravity. We also compute, via the tunnelling
method, the spectrum of Hawking's radiation, verifying that its temperature is
controlled by the (non-constant) peeling surface gravity. Finally, we
recapitulate the status of the four laws of black hole mechanics in situations
in which the event horizon fails to be Killing. Our results thus pave the way
to a deeper understanding of black hole thermodynamics beyond general
relativity.

TL;DR: 文章研究了双黑洞合并过程中引力波信号的' ringdown '阶段，发现非二次振荡模式与数值相对论模拟的信号存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引力波天文学是当前物理学的重要前沿领域，理解双黑洞合并过程中的引力波信号对于揭示黑洞动力学和测试基本物理原理具有重要意义。

Method: 文章通过计算非互动作、准圆形 ringdown 模型与数值相对论模拟的信号在时间域的差异，评估了模型在不同频率下的准确性。

Result: 研究发现，非二次振荡模式与数值相对论模拟的信号在$(	ext{ℓ},|	ext{m}|)=(2,2)$谐波下的差异范围为$[10^{-6},10^{-4}]$，而在高阶谐波下的差异范围为$[10^{-4},10^{-2}]$。

Conclusion: 研究结果提示，当前引力波探测器的灵敏度无法充分捕捉非二次振荡模式的大部分信号。未来需要提高模型的准确性，以更好地满足探测器的灵敏度要求。

Abstract: The ''ringdown'' stage of gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole
mergers, mainly consisting of a superposition of quasinormal modes emitted by
the merger remnant, is a key tool to test fundamental physics and to probe
black hole dynamics. However, ringdown models are known to be accurate only in
the late-time, stationary regime. A key open problem in the field is to
understand if these models are robust when extrapolated to earlier times, and
if they can faithfully recover a larger portion of the signal. We address this
question through a systematic time-domain calculation of the mismatch between
non-precessing, quasi-circular ringdown models parameterised by the progenitor
binary's degrees of freedom and full numerical relativity
inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)
simulation catalog. For the best-performing models, the mismatch is typically
in the range $[10^{-6}, 10^{-4}]$ for the $(\ell,|m|)= (2,2)$ harmonic, and
$[10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$ for higher-order modes. Our findings inform ongoing
observational searches for quasinormal modes, and underscore the need for
improved modeling of higher-order modes to meet the sensitivity requirements of
future gravitational-wave detectors.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct exact black-hole solutions free of curvature singularities,
sourced by dark matter halos described by galactic density profiles. Regularity
of the geometry is ensured by adopting the relation $P_{r}=-\rho$ between
radial pressure and density, which is consistent with the phenomenological
freedom of halo models. In particular, the sufficiently dense Einasto and
Dehnen-type profiles for the dark matter halo can produce asymptotically flat
solutions of singularity-free black holes embedded in the galactic environment.
The resulting regular black holes surrounded by dark matter are shown to be
stable under axial perturbations. We further compute the shadow radii and
Lyapunov exponents associated with the photon circular orbits around these
black holes.

Conclusion: 施瓦茨奇尔德类黑洞周围带有德Helpen暗物质halo的大质量比粒子的混沌行为比纯施瓦茨奇尔德情况更早更显著。这为观察到的极端质量比引力波信号中可能存在的黑洞影响提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the existence of homoclinic orbit and the onset of chaotic motion
for a massive particle moving around a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded
in a Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) type dark matter halo, within the extreme-mass-ratio
limit q = m/M << 1, where m and M are the masses of the particle and the
central black hole, respectively. The presence of the halo modifies the
spacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing
the particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the
conditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic
trajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By
analyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure,
we identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon
region. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents
calculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along
with energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We
demonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability
of particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal
surface gravity bound on chaos. This work provides a deeper understanding of
horizon-induced chaos in astrophysically realistic environments and serves as a
theoretical basis for exploring its possible imprints on gravitational wave
signals in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals system.

Conclusion: 研究为天体物理学和天文学建模提供了强大工具。

Abstract: In this article, we extend our previously presented analytical formulas
(Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 12, 124055) for describing light rays passing near or
emitted in the vicinity of compact objects to a broader class of spherically
symmetric, static spacetimes, including the Johansen-Psaltis and
Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric families. The generalized formulas retain the
simplicity and accuracy of the original approach while allowing for more
general deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. These expressions provide an
approximate yet accurate mapping between emission points and the image plane of
an asymptotic observer, enabling fast analytical computations of accretion disk
images, polarization of the emitted radiation, luminosity curves associated
with pulsars, and other related applications. As examples, we compute isoradial
curves for several metric families and the Stokes parameters Q and U for a hot
spot orbiting near a black hole described by one of the studied metrics,
presenting the corresponding polarization (QU) curves.

Abstract: The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the
bumblebee field $B_\mu$ has a two-component space-like, light-like, and
time-like vacuum expectation value $b_\mu$ is studied. Based on the results, we
present a comprehensive classification of the static spherical vacuum solutions
in bumblebee gravity with general vacuum expectation values. We find that the
model becomes degenerate for a specific set of parameter combinations, where
the solution can be characterized by an arbitrary function, which indicates
that the non-minimally coupled massless vector tensor theory is ill-defined
when $\xi=\kappa/2$. We also find that contrary to the situation in general
relativity, the bumblebee gravity admits the exact Schwarzschild solution with
non-zero matter distributions of certain forms. The implications of this result
are discussed, suggesting that the experimental constraints within the solar
system would be invalid.

*Mohit Thakre,Praveen Kumar Dhankar,Behnam Pourhassan,Safiqul Islam*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper combines theoretical and observational aspects to study the cosmological implications of a bulk viscous modified Chaplygin gas in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime. Analytical solutions for both viscous and non-viscous cases are provided, highlighting differences in energy density, Hubble parameter, and deceleration parameter. Bulk viscosity affects structure formation. Using the MCMC method with Hubble and BAO datasets, models are analyzed under three conditions ($ξ=0$, $ξ≠0$, and $A=0$).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of bulk viscosity on the modified Chaplygin gas model in cosmology, this study combines theoretical analyses with observational data to better understand the universe’s evolution. The motivation is to reconcile theoretical predictions with observational findings, particularly in the context of dark energy and modified gravity models.

Method: The study employs analytical methods to derive solutions for different cases, incorporating bulk viscosity and using the total pressure dynamics. Observational data from Hubble and BAO datasets are analyzed using the MCMC method to evaluate the models' performance under various assumptions about $ξ$ and $A$.

Result: The results show that bulk viscosity modifies the evolution of the Chaplygin gas, suppressing oscillations in structure formation. Observational analysis reveals that the three different models (with various $ξ$ and $A$ assumptions) exhibit distinct behaviors, with cosmological parameter constraints derived using MCMC. The findings provide insights into the role of bulk viscosity in cosmological models and support certain cosmological scenarios based on observational data.

Conclusion: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the modified Chaplygin gas with bulk viscosity, demonstrating the influence of bulk viscosity on cosmological dynamics. By comparing models using observational data, it contributes to refining theoretical models in cosmology and offers guidance for interpreting dark energy and modified gravity effects.

Abstract: This study combines theoretical advancements with observational limitations
to investigate the cosmological implications of a bulk viscous modified
Chaplygin gas (MCG) in a Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) in (3+1)
dimensional spacetime framework. We provide analytical solutions for both
viscous and non-viscous cases, pointing out variations in the energy density
evolution, the Hubble parameter dynamics, and the deceleration parameter
transitions. Bulk viscosity suppresses oscillations in structure creation, a
well-known drawback of Chaplygin gas models in larger dimensions, as shown by a
thorough perturbation analysis. Using the bulk viscosity coefficient and Hubble
expansion parameter, which are incorporated by the total pressure and the
appropriate pressure and by using energy momentum conservation law determined
time time-dependent density. With the help of three conditions ($\xi = 0$,
$\xi\neq0$, and we neglect both bulk viscosity and presence of Chaplygin gas,
i.e $A=0$ and $\xi=0$) created three different models as the Hubble parameter
is a function of redshift $z$. By applying the MCMC method to these models, we
have gone through observational analysis by using the Hubble and BAO datasets.

Abstract: We give a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic and thermodynamic stability
of neutron stars composed of superconducting-superfluid mixtures within the
Iyer-Wald formalism. We derive the first law of thermodynamics and the
necessary and sufficient condition under which dynamic equilibrium implies
thermodynamic equilibrium. By constructing the phase space and canonical
energy, we show that the dynamic stability for perturbations, restricted in
symplectic complement of trivial perturbations with the ADM 3-momentum
unchanged, is equivalent to the non-negativity of the canonical energy.
Furthermore, dynamic stability against restricted axisymmetric perturbations
guarantees the dynamic stability against all axisymmetric perturbations. We
also prove that the positivity of canonical energy on all axisymmetric
perturbations within the Lagrangian displacement framework with fixed angular
momentum is necessary for thermodynamic stability. In particular, the
equivalence of dynamic and thermodynamic stability for spherically symmetric
perturbations of static, spherically symmetric isentropic configurations is
established.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study wormhole geometries embedded in an expanding universe within a
four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model, where the target-space metric is
identified with the spacetime Ricci tensor. In this framework, wormholes can
remain stable even when conventional energy conditions are violated. However,
once cosmological expansion is included, the effective energy density and
pressure are modified by the cosmological fluid, enabling the energy conditions
to be satisfied. We further present intriguing geometries in which a finite
future singularity appears in our universe but not in another universe
connected by the wormhole. Near the throat, the hypersurface becomes timelike,
allowing trajectories to traverse to the other universe before the singularity
and return afterwards. We also construct wormhole solutions motivated by
galactic dark-matter halo profiles, where the required non-vanishing pressure
arises naturally from the four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model.

Abstract: The exact measurement of neutrino mass remains a longstanding issue. So far,
there has been much success in providing an upper bound for the neutrino rest
mass, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, by exploring the
critical radius of a beam of polarized quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle
deflecting around a classical Kerr black hole, we attempt to provide an
additional testing ground for neutrino mass, as well as the mass of other
proposed ultra-light particles yet to be determined. Notably, the quantum Dirac
equation is used to derive a MPD-like equation satisfied by the polarized beam
of massive spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles and identify the effective spin in the
spin tensor with the particle's intrinsic quantum spin, confirming the previous
theoretical result that the MPD equation can be in fact applied to particles'
intrinsic spin. The result of this work shows that corrections of relative
magnitude $>10^{-12}$ can be achieved for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with
rest mass equal to $1 eV/c^2$ deflecting around a solar mass Kerr black hole.
Although highly theoretical, a new method of extracting the lower bound for the
neutrino mass individually is also proposed due to the behavior of the quantum
spin correction.

Abstract: We investigate black hole entropy in a broad class of modified Myrzakulov
gravity theories defined by generalized Lagrangians of the form \( \mathcal{L}
= \alpha R + F(T, Q, R_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu}Q^{\mu\nu}, \dots) \),
where \( R \), \( T \), and \( Q \) represent curvature, torsion, and
non-metricity scalars. Using the vielbein formalism, we derive the Wald entropy
for various subclasses of these models, extending the classical entropy formula
to accommodate non-Riemannian geometry. Our focus is on how the additional
geometric degrees of freedom modify the entropy expression. The analysis shows
that such corrections arise systematically from the extended structure of the
action and preserve diffeomorphism invariance. These results refine the
theoretical framework for gravitational thermodynamics in extended geometry
settings.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper derives new exact gravitational wave solutions in a specific cubic Metric-Affine Gravity model by imposing Type N conditions on the field strength tensors, leading to pp-waves characterized by torsion and nonmetricity contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore gravitational wave solutions in cubic Metric-Affine Gravity and address ghostly instabilities in vector and axial sectors.

Method: Algebraic classification of gravitational field tensors, imposing Type N conditions, solving field equations for pp-waves.

Result: New gravitational wave solutions with torsion and nonmetricity, inducing scalar polarization modes beyond GR's tensor modes.

Conclusion: These solutions expand the understanding of gravitational waves in extended gravitational theories with distinct phenomenological signatures.

Abstract: We derive new exact gravitational wave solutions with dynamical torsion and
nonmetricity tensors in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG). For
this purpose, we consider the full algebraic classification of the
gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries and impose a set of
Type N conditions on the field strength tensors that implement the kinetics of
torsion and nonmetricity in a particular cubic MAG model, recently considered
to eliminate ghostly instabilities from the vector and axial sectors of the
theory. The new solutions represent pp-waves characterised by a metric function
that includes the dynamical contributions of the torsion and nonmetricity
tensors provided by the field equations of the model. In particular, these
quantities induce a scalar polarisation mode in the gravitational-wave
spectrum, thus offering a distinctive phenomenological signature beyond the
ordinary tensor polarisation modes of General Relativity.

### [46] [Wide frequency-range acceleration using second harmonic RF bucket in fixed field accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03226)
*Tomonori Uesugi,Yoshihiro Ishi,Yoshiharu Mori*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: A novel acceleration scheme for fixed-field accelerators (FFAs) is introduced, using RF buckets with h = 1 and h = 2 time-sequenced to achieve continuous acceleration, reducing frequency sweeps and repetition periods. Longitudinal simulations at KURNS demonstrate feasibility. Conditions for stability of the second harmonic are also established.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchrotron radiation research has been advancing rapidly, but there are still areas needing improvement, such as acceleration methods in fixed-field accelerators. This paper aims to propose a new acceleration scheme to address these challenges.

Method: The paper proposes an acceleration scheme that uses RF buckets with harmonic numbers h = 1 and h = 2, time-sequenced in a novel time-sequential manner to form a single continuous acceleration path. They performed longitudinal simulations based on parameters from the FFA at KURNS.

Result: The simulations demonstrated the feasibility of their method for acceleration in FFAs. Additionally, they established operational conditions under which the second harmonic RF bucket remains stable.

Conclusion: Their novel acceleration scheme for FFAs with time-sequential RF buckets shows promising potential for practical implementation, with simulations proving its feasibility and establishing stable operational conditions.

Abstract: We propose a novel acceleration scheme for fixed-field accelerators (FFAs),
in which RF buckets with harmonic numbers $h = 1$ and $h = 2$ are
time-sequenced to form a single, continuous acceleration path. This approach
completes acceleration in two RF frequency sweeps, thereby reducing the total
frequency sweep range and shortening the repetition period. The feasibility of
this method is demonstrated through longitudinal simulations based on
parameters of the FFA at the Institute for Integrated Radiation and Nuclear
Science, Kyoto University (KURNS). We also establish operational conditions
under which the second harmonic RF bucket remains stable and practically
usable.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the design and implementation of a multistage collimation system in the LHC, emphasizing its importance in managing beam losses and maximizing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beam losses in particle accelerators are inevitable and can cause significant operational issues. Efficiently managing these losses is crucial for maintaining the integrity and performance of the accelerator.

Method: The paper reviews the design of a multistage collimation system using the LHC as a case study. The design incorporates multiple stages of magnetic elements arranged to progressively constrain the beam and reduce losses.

Result: The system achieves unprecedented cleaning performance, with a level of complexity unmatched by other accelerators. It effectively manages beam losses, contributing to the safe and efficient operation of the LHC.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges in designing and operational complexities of large-scale collimation systems for high-intensity, high-energy accelerators. The success of the LHC system demonstrates the advanced engineering and physics required for such systems.

Abstract: Collimation systems in particle accelerators are designed to safely and
efficiently dispose of unavoidable beam losses during operation. Their specific
roles vary depending on the type of accelerator. The state of the art in hadron
beam collimation for high-intensity, high-energy superconducting colliders is
exemplified by the system implemented at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
In this machine, the stored beam energy reaches levels several orders of
magnitude higher than the tiny energy required to quench superconducting
magnets. It also exceeds by orders of magnitude the damage thresholds of
typical accelerator components, placing stringent demands on beam loss control.
Collimation systems are therefore essential for the reliable daily operation of
modern accelerators. This lecture reviews the design of a multistage
collimation system, using the LHC as a case study. The LHC collimation system
has achieved unprecedented cleaning performance, with a level of complexity
unmatched by any other accelerator. Design aspects and operational challenges
of such large-scale collimation systems are also discussed.

Abstract: Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent
advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with
ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold
of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins;
this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of
rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a
current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based
on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of
states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through
the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with
maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states
where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications,
we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there
is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave
coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence
induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for
quantum computation applications.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff
between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-K\"onig
bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend
topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford
hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D
Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We
construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries
represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal
non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes,
using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent
to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time
decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds
via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$
gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford
hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$
gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of
these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an
$O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose
a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy
stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of
spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the
$N^\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Increasing the utility of currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices requires developing efficient methods to mitigate
hardware errors, taking into account the constraints of these devices such as
medium number of qubits and limited connectivity between them. In this work we
propose a novel Cyclic Layout Permutations based Zero Noise Extrapolation
(CLP-ZNE) protocol for such a task. The method leverages the inherent
non-uniformity of gate errors in NISQ hardware and exploits symmetries of
quantum circuits with one-dimensional connectivity to extrapolate the
expectation value, averaged over cyclic circuit layout permutations, to the
level of zero noise. In contrast to the previous layout permutation based
approaches, for $n$ qubit circuit CLP-ZNE requires measurements of only $O(n)$
different circuit layouts to reconstruct the noiseless expected value. When
benchmarked against noise channels modeling the IBM Torino quantum computer,
the method reduces a typical expectation value error by an order of magnitude,
depending on the protocol specifications. By employing a noise model derived
from real hardware specifications, including both depolarizing and $T_1/T_2$
relaxation processes, these results give evidence for the applicability of
CLP-ZNE to present-day NISQ processors.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many
properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements
without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is
available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this
knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this
work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with
local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant
observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront
of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer
exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods,
albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these
trade-offs using a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual
formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including
both circuit depth and sample complexity.

*Yimeng Wang,Christiane P. Koch*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the generation of quantum entanglement during scattering processes, challenging the traditional plane-wave approach and proposing a more realistic model that includes quantum uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to understand the amount of entanglement created during particle scattering processes. It aims to challenge existing models and explore more accurate descriptions of scattering setups.

Method: The researchers conducted fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering in three-dimensional space to quantitatively analyze entanglement. They used the inverse of single-particle purity as a measure of entanglement and considered the role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state.

Result: The study discovered that the standard plane-wave description fails to capture entanglement properties accurately. By incorporating realistic scattering setups with narrow momentum dispersion, the entanglement was found to scale linearly with the scattering cross-section, including significant enhancements near shape resonances. Additionally, methods to detect motional entanglement in experiments were discussed.

Conclusion: This research opens new avenues for probing and potentially utilizing entanglement in quantum collisions, enhancing our understanding of quantum processes in scattering scenarios.

Abstract: Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen discussed their paradox in terms of measuring
the positions or momenta of two particles. These can become entangled upon
scattering, but how much entanglement can be created in this process? Here we
address this question with fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering
in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the
single particle purity. We show that the standard plane-wave description of
scattering fails to capture the entanglement properties, due to the essential
role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state. For a more realistic
description of a scattering setup and narrow initial momentum dispersion, we
find the entanglement to scale linearly with the scattering cross section,
including strong enhancement close to shape resonances. We discuss how the
generation of motional entanglement can be detected in experiments. Our results
open the way to probing and eventually using entanglement in quantum
collisions.

Result: 他们成功地使用SAC方法估计了von Neumann纠缠熵，并将其应用于实验数据，提取了不同进化时间的子系统的von Neumann熵。

Conclusion: SAC方法提供了快速而准确的解析继续，适用于其他非线性量子度量的估计。

Abstract: We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of
density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of
analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed
stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise
arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited
to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the
von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched N\'eel
state from R\'enyi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol.
We then apply the method to experimental R\'enyi data from a trapped-ion
quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different
evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily
generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic
negativity and R\'enyi relative entropies.

Abstract: Correlation self-testing of quantum theory involves identifying a task or set
of tasks whose optimal performance can be achieved only by theories that can
realise the same set of correlations as quantum theory in every causal
structure. Following this approach, previous work has ruled out various classes
of generalised probabilistic theories whose joint state spaces have a certain
regularity in the sense of a (discrete) rotation symmetry of the bipartite
state spaces. Here we consider theories whose bipartite state spaces lack this
regularity. We form them by taking the convex hull of all the local states and
a finite number of non-local states. We show that a criterion of compositional
consistency is needed in such theories: for a measurement effect to be valid,
there must exist at least one measurement that it is part of. This goes beyond
previous consistency criteria and corresponds to a strengthening of the
no-restriction hypothesis. We show that quantum theory outperforms these
theories in a task called the adaptive CHSH game, which shows that they can be
ruled out experimentally. We further show a connection between compositional
consistency and Tsirelson's bound.

Conclusion: 本文展示了1D HN lattices中非互惠性与相互作用的动态行为特征及其在量子级增力 sensing方面的潜在应用。

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the interplay of interactions and
non-Hermiticity in the dynamics of two bosons on the one-dimensional
Hatano-Nelson lattice with non-reciprocal tunneling. We find that the
non-reciprocity in the tunneling leads to the formation of an asymmetric
density cone during the time-evolution of the system; the degree of asymmetry
can be tuned by tuning the non-reciprocity parameter, $\delta$. Next, we
analyze the dynamics of this system in the presence of a static external force
and demonstrate that non-Hermiticity leads to asymmetric two-particle Bloch
oscillations. Interestingly, when $F=0$ ($F \ne 0$), strong interactions leads
to the formation of an inner density-cone (density-hourglass) structure; this
inner structure also becomes asymmetric in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We
further analyze the spatial correlations and establish that the system exhibits
non-reciprocal bunching (anti-bunching) in the presence of weak (strong)
interactions. Finally, we examine the growth of the Quantum Fisher Information,
$F_Q$, with time, and demonstrate that $F_Q \propto t^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha
\sim 3$. This feature persists for both one- and two-particle walks, thereby
demonstrating that this system can be employed as a quantum-enhanced sensor for
detecting weak forces.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired combinatorial solver that performs
imaginary-time evolution (ITE) on a matrix product state (MPS), incorporating
non-local couplings through structured SWAP networks and spectral qubit mapping
of logical qubits. The SWAP networks, composed exclusively of local two-qubit
gates, effectively mediate non-local qubit interactions. We investigate two
distinct network architectures based on rectangular and triangular meshes of
SWAP gates and analyze their performance in combination with spectral qubit
ordering, which maps logical qubits to MPS sites based on the Laplacian of the
logical qubit connectivity graph. The proposed framework is evaluated on
synthetic MaxCut instances with varying graph connectivity, as well as on a
dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on real historical asset data
involving 180 qubits. On certain problem configurations, we observe an over
20$\times$ reduction in error when combining spectral ordering and triangular
SWAP networks compared to optimization with shuffled qubit ordering.
Furthermore, an analysis of the entanglement entropy during portfolio
optimization reveals that spectral qubit ordering not only improves solution
quality but also enhances the total and spatially distributed entanglement
within the MPS. These findings demonstrate that exploiting problem structure
through spectral mapping and efficient routing networks can substantially
enhance the performance of tensor-network-based optimization algorithms.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method combining electron spin resonance and T1 relaxometry to probe molecular spin systems like CuPc films. Key findings include the dominant role of electron-electron interactions in decoherence and the ability to estimate NV center depth with high precision. The results highlight NV centers as a promising tool for quantum applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the potential of molecular spin systems in quantum information processing and sensing. However, the characterization of these systems at room temperature remains difficult due to fast spin decoherence. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a new relaxometry approach using T1 measurements of shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.

Method: The authors used T1 relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin film. This involved analyzing the hyperfine spectrum to identify the NV-CuPc interaction and extracting key parameters such as correlation time and local lattice orientation.

Result: The experimental results showed that electron-electron interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature. Additionally, the authors demonstrated that CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can estimate the NV depth with ~1 nm precision.

Conclusion: This work establishes nitrogen-vacancy centers as a robust and precise probe for molecular spin systems. The findings provide valuable insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum materials. The approach opens up promising avenues for applications such as molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.

Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising candidates for quantum information
processing and nanoscale sensing, yet their characterization at room
temperature remains challenging due to fast spin decoherence. In this work, we
use $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to
probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine
(CuPc) thin film. In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc
interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters
of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice
orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments.
The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron
interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as
a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\sim1$~nm precision. Our results
establish NV centers as powerful probes for molecular spin systems, providing
insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum
materials, and offering a potential pathway toward their applications such as
molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces D2-UC, a quantum-ready framework for the unit
commitment (UC) problem that prepares UC for near-term hybrid quantum-classical
solvers by combining distributed classical decomposition with distributed
quantum execution. We reformulate deterministic and stochastic UC into a
three-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): (i) a convex
quadratic subproblem for dispatch and reserves, (ii) a binary subproblem
expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and (iii) a
proximal slack update for consensus. The core contributions are fivefold.
First, we demonstrate how the full UC problem can be expressed as a single
monolithic QUBO, establishing a direct interface to quantum solvers. Second, we
decompose this large binary block into three type-specific QUBOs for
commitment, startup, and shutdown, making the problem more tractable but
revealing slower ADMM convergence. Third, we restore local logical couplings
through per-unit-time micro-QUBOs, which accelerate convergence. Fourth, we
batch micro-QUBOs into K non-overlapping block-diagonal problems, reducing many
subproblems to a fixed number of solver-ready QUBOs per iteration, compatible
with distributed variational quantum eigensolvers (DVQE). Fifth, we integrate
an accept-if-better safeguard with DVQE to stabilize hybrid updates and prevent
oscillations. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods deliver feasible
schedules, faster convergence, and QUBO sizes aligned with current and
near-term quantum hardware capabilities. All detailed data, codes, and
parameter values are available at

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates is essential for
executing arbitrary digital quantum algorithms and for building error-corrected
quantum computers. We propose a theoretical framework for implementing quantum
gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, which extends
conventional amplitude modulation by introducing frequency modulation as an
additional degree of control. Our approach operates on fixed-frequency qubits,
converting the need for qubit frequency tunability into drive frequency
modulation. Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for
optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to
nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability
across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters
in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X,
Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times
of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit
operations. Furthermore, we show an always-on CZ gate tailored for driven
qubits, which has gate times of 80-90 ns.

Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum
algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work
explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in
quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).
Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we
perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in
detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation
quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are
proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting
only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further
biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford
Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of
non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how
the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our
numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Induced-coherence interferometry, first introduced in the Zou-Wang-Mandel
(ZWM) setup, enables retrieval of object information from the interference
pattern of light that never interacted with the object. This scheme relies on
two identically correlated photon pairs and the absence of "which-way"
information about the photons illuminating the object to induce coherence in
their companions. In previous studies, the effect of thermal background on the
ZWM interferometer was considered; here we explicitly include background noise
and analyze the interference visibility in both low- and high-gain regimes,
revealing how thermal photons introduce an incoherent offset that lowers the
observed interference contrast. We show that the visibility can be restored
either by optimal attenuation or by extending the geometry to a three-SPDC
configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing heralded detection
removes the detrimental effect of thermal background noise, restoring
high-contrast interference fringes.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of superpositions of oppositely
squeezed states, which can be regarded as Schrodinger cat states. Compared with
conventional coherent-state cat states, these states exhibit distinct
photon-number structures and enhanced nonclassical features. We analyze their
Wigner function and quantify the entanglement generated when they are injected
into a 50:50 beam splitter. For small squeezing parameters, the resulting
two-mode states possess higher entanglement than pure two-mode squeezed vacuum
states. We also propose a linear-optical heralding scheme that approximates
this superposition of oppositely squeezed states without requiring strong Kerr
nonlinearities. Our results indicate that such states are promising resources
for continuous-variable quantum information processing, particularly in regimes
where high non-Gaussianity and strong entanglement are desirable.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we analyze the mechanism of the superradiant phase
transition in the anisotropic Rabi model under the classical oscillator limit
using the pattern picture. By expanding the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian
in operator space, we obtained three patterns, and we find that the phase
transition arises from the competition between patterns. The difficulty in
achieving the classical oscillator limit motivates our investigation into the
quantum phase transition within a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model.
This parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model can reproduce the dynamics of
a ultrastrong-coupling anisotropic Rabi model in a squeezed-light frame.
According to the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the normal and superradiant
phases of this equivalent anisotropic Rabi model, we find that the excitation
energy of the normal phase and the superradiant phase vanishes at the critical
point. The photon number becomes infinite beyond the critical point. These
results indicate that the system undergoes a superradiant phase transition at
the critical point.

Abstract: Efficient production planning is essential in modern manufacturing to improve
performance indicators such as lead time and to reduce reliance on human
intuition. While mathematical optimization approaches, formulated as job shop
scheduling problems, have been applied to automate this process, solving
large-scale production planning problems remains computationally demanding.
Moreover, many practical scenarios involve conflicting objectives, making
traditional scalarization techniques ineffective in finding diverse and useful
Pareto-optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we developed a
quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that decomposes the problem into two
subproblems: resource allocation and task scheduling. Resource allocation is
formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and solved
using annealing-based methods that efficiently explore complex solutions. Task
scheduling is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved
using conventional solvers to satisfy detailed scheduling constraints. We
validated the proposed method using benchmark instances based on foundry
production scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
achieves superior solution quality and computational efficiency compared to
traditional monolithic methods. This work offers a promising direction for
high-speed, multi-objective scheduling in industrial applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to create and manipulate non-classical states of light, which is a rapidly growing area in attosecond science.

Method: The authors modify the well-known Dicke superradiance problem by leveraging symmetry-based selection rules to suppress single-photon emission, achieving a steady state through collective symmetry-broken states.

Result: They successfully observe large quantum states of light with non-classical statistics following a symmetry-breaking transition.

Conclusion: This method provides a non-Markovian, non-perturbative approach for creating non-classical light states, advancing our understanding and applications in quantum optics and attosecond science.

Abstract: Creation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is rapidly
becoming the focus of modern attosecond science. Here, we demonstrate
numerically how such states can arise by considering a modification of the
well-known problem of superradiance encountered already by Dicke. Similarly to
him, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms. In
contrast to him, however, we leverage symmetry-based selection rules to
suppress emission of single photons by single atoms. A steady state is
therefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective
symmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes. The novel non-Markovian,
non-perturbative method applied allows us to observe a large quantum state of
light form and exhibit drastically non-classical statistics once the system
undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition.

Abstract: Quantifying multipartite entanglement in quantum many-body systems and hybrid
quantum computing architectures is a fundamental yet challenging task. In
recent years, thermodynamic quantities such as the maximum extractable work
from an isolated system (the ergotropy) have allowed for entanglement measures
that are operationally more accessible. However, these measures can be
restrictive when applied to systems governed by Hamiltonians with strong
collective or interparticle interactions. Motivated by advances in quantum
simulators, we propose a framework that circumvents these restrictions by
evaluating global and local ergotropy either through controlled quenching of
interactions or by measuring suitable local observables only. We show that this
formalism allows us to correctly estimate genuine multipartite entanglement in
both stationary and time-evolved states of systems with strong interactions,
including parametrized quantum states simulated on a quantum circuit with
varying circuit depth and noise. We demonstrate its applicability to realistic
physical models, namely, the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model,
and the transverse-field Ising model, highlighting its potential as a versatile
tool for characterizing entanglement in near-term quantum simulators.

Abstract: Data dimensionality reduction techniques are often utilized in the
implementation of Quantum Machine Learning models to address two significant
issues: the constraints of NISQ quantum devices, which are characterized by
noise and a limited number of qubits, and the challenge of simulating a large
number of qubits on classical devices. It also raises concerns over the
scalability of these approaches, as dimensionality reduction methods are slow
to adapt to large datasets. In this article, we analyze how data reduction
methods affect different QML models. We conduct this experiment over several
generated datasets, quantum machine algorithms, quantum data encoding methods,
and data reduction methods. All these models were evaluated on the performance
metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings have led
us to conclude that the usage of data dimensionality reduction methods results
in skewed performance metric values, which results in wrongly estimating the
actual performance of quantum machine learning models. There are several
factors, along with data dimensionality reduction methods, that worsen this
problem, such as characteristics of the datasets, classical to quantum
information embedding methods, percentage of feature reduction, classical
components associated with quantum models, and structure of quantum machine
learning models. We consistently observed the difference in the accuracy range
of 14% to 48% amongst these models, using data reduction and not using it.
Apart from this, our observations have shown that some data reduction methods
tend to perform better for some specific data embedding methodologies and
ansatz constructions.

TL;DR: Minor embedding (ME) negatively impacts quantum annealing's hardware topology by complicating the mapping of logical variables to physical qubits, which can reduce success rates as quantum systems scale larger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving our understanding of quantum embedding methods is crucial for optimizing quantum annealing.

Method: We analyzed how hardware topology affects ME scaling by evaluating two QPU topologies: Zephyr graphs and Havel-Hakimi graphs with controlled node degree variations.

Result: Havel-Hakimi topologies require shorter qubit chains and smoother scaling compared to Zephyr graphs.

Conclusion: Using Havel-Hakimi topologies may offer better scalability for quantum annealing implementations.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) offers a promising framework for solving NP-hard
optimization problems, but its effectiveness is constrained by the topology of
the underlying quantum hardware. Solving an optimization problem $P$ via QA
involves a hardware-aware circuit compilation which requires representing $P$
as a graph $G_P$ and embedding it into the hardware connectivity graph $G_Q$
that defines how qubits connect to each other in a QA-based quantum processing
unit (QPU).
  Minor Embedding (ME) is a possible operational form of this hardware-aware
compilation. ME heuristically builds a map that associates each node of $G_P$
-- the logical variables of $P$ -- to a chain of adjacent nodes in $G_Q$ by
means of one of its minors, so that the arcs of $G_P$ are preserved as physical
connections among qubits in $G_Q$.
  The static topology of hardwired qubits can clearly lead to inefficient
compilations because $G_Q$ cannot be a clique, currently. We propose a
methodology and a set of criteria to evaluate how the hardware topology $G_Q$
can negatively affect the embedded problem, thus making the quantum
optimization more sensible to noise.
  We evaluate the result of ME across two QPU topologies: Zephyr graphs (used
in current D-Wave systems) and Havel-Hakimi graphs, which allow controlled
variation of the average node degree. This enables us to study how the ratio
`number of nodes/number of incident arcs per node' affects ME success rates to
map $G_P$ into a minor of $G_Q$.
  Our findings, obtained through ME executed on classical, i.e. non-quantum,
architectures, suggest that Havel-Hakimi-based topologies, on average, require
shorter qubit chains in the minor of $G_P$, exhibiting smoother scaling of the
largest embeddable $G_P$ as the QPU size increases. These characteristics
indicate their potential as alternative designs for QA-based QPUs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Critical phenomena reveal universal behavior in complex systems, and
uncovering analogous effects in quantum weak measurement protocols with
post-selection provides new insight into how measurement backaction can shape
quantum dynamics. This work investigates dynamical discontinuities that arise
when the post-selected polar angle is used as a control parameter. The system
evolves under repeated applications of a weak measurement protocol with
post-selection, in which the meter state is retained after each iteration while
the system is renewed. The emergence of these discontinuities is shown to be
determined by the structure of the weak value: when the weak value has a
nonzero imaginary component, a discontinuity appears in the expectation value
of meter observables precisely at the point where the imaginary part of the
weak value vanishes as a function of the post-selection polar angle. In
contrast, no discontinuities occur when the weak value remains real for all
post-selection angles. The phenomenon originates from the eigenstructure of the
protocol's Kraus operator, with the stability of fixed points changing at the
critical point where the discontinuity arises. Remarkably, the associated
critical exponent is 1, independent of system parameters. These results open
new perspectives for engineering non-analytic behavior in measurement-based
quantum control and for probing criticality in post-selected quantum dynamics
using weak measurements with weak values.

Conclusion: This approach simplifies QD integration for strong coupling systems, advancing quantum optics and sensing under ambient conditions.

Abstract: Achieving strong coupling between excitons of colloidal semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs) and localized surface plasmon polaritons (LSPs) is critical for
advanced room-temperature quantum emitter and sensing applications. A key
challenge is to have precise control of the emitters position with respect to
an individual plasmonic nanostructure. Here, we present room temperature strong
coupling between QDs and a single gold nano-bipyramid (BPs). The selection of
the bipyramid plasmonic nanocavity offers access to a single hotspot with a
very small mode volume. The localization of QDs at a single hotspot is achieved
via plasmon-triggered two-photon polymerization. This technique exploits the
enhanced electric field at the BP tip to selectively polymerize a
photosensitive QD-containing formulation. Room-temperature scattering spectra
of a 3-QD-BP system reveal Rabi splitting of 349.3 meV and a coupling strength
of 175.68 meV. The with distinct anti-crossing behavior is confirmed by
simulations. This approach simplifies QD integration for strong coupling
systems compared to previous methods. These results indicate a scalable
platform for solid-state quantum technologies with colloidal QDs, enabling
explora-tion of exciton-plasmon interactions and further advance-ment of
applications in quantum optics and quantum sensing under ambient conditions.

Abstract: Chiral discrimination of enantiomeric biomolecules is vital in chemistry,
biology, and medicine. Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized
light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite
extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical
chiral probes remain fundamentally bounded by the shot-noise limit due to
quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate
quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable
polarization-entangled states as moderate-photon-flux, high-sensitivity,
quantum-noise-squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5 dB improvement beyond the
SNL in distinguishing L- and D-amino acids in liquid phase. This
non-destructive, biocompatible protocol enables high-sensitivity chiral
analysis, with broad implications for drug development, biochemical research,
environmental monitoring, and asymmetric synthesis.

processes. We here exactly solve a quantum first-passage time problem for
quantum diffusion driven by measurement noise, a generalization of classical
Brownian motion. Such continuous monitoring may trap the measured quantum
system in a decoherence-free subspace, a fraction of the available state space
that is isolated from the surroundings, and thus plays an important role in
quantum information science. We analytically determine the first-passage time
distribution, whose form neither depends on the system Hamiltonian nor on the
measurement operator, and is therefore universal. These results provide a
general framework to investigate the first-passage statistics of diffusive
quantum trajectories.

Abstract: We pose the converse Madelung question: not whether Fisher information can
reproduce quantum mechanics, but whether it is necessary. We work with minimal,
physically motivated axioms on density and phase: locality, probability
conservation, Euclidean invariance with a global phase symmetry, reversibility,
and convex regularity. Within the resulting class of first order local
Hamiltonian field theories, these axioms single out the canonical Poisson
bracket on density and phase under the Dubrovin and Novikov assumptions for
local hydrodynamic brackets. Using a pointwise, gauge covariant complex change
of variables that maps density and phase to a single complex field, we show
that the only convex, rotationally invariant, first derivative local functional
of the density whose Euler Lagrange term yields a reversible completion that is
exactly projectively linear is the Fisher functional. When its coefficient
equals Planck constant squared divided by twice the mass, the dynamics reduce
to the linear Schrodinger equation. For many body systems, a single local
complex structure across sectors enforces the same relation species by species,
fixing a single Planck constant. Galilean covariance appears through the
Bargmann central extension, with the usual superselection consequences.
Comparison with the Doebner and Goldin family identifies the reversible zero
diffusion corner with linear Schrodinger dynamics. We provide operational
falsifiers via residual diagnostics for the continuity and Hamilton Jacobi
equations and report numerical minima at the Fisher scale that are invariant
under Galilean boosts. In this setting, quantum mechanics emerges as a
reversible fixed point of Fisher regularised information hydrodynamics. A code
archive enables direct numerical checks, including a superposition stress test
that preserves exact projective linearity within our axioms.

Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical framework for modeling single photon
emission from a two level system in open and dissipative systems beyond the
Markovian approximation. The method can be readily integrated into standard
computational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time
domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the
completeness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin
noise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens
function through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction
enables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi
mode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the
single excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level
system is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying
that radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework
thus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population
and single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then
present concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM
frameworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify
numerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the
case of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in
a Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for
incorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics,
thereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings
between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using
gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo
sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked
with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined
using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise,
including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of
sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's
orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands
at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component.
For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers
axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to
$10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the
likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise.
Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities
approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a
complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although
we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly
applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.

Method: 通过理论分析和数学建模，研究不同相关性类型（经典、量子、超量子）在测量不准确度下的功可提取量。计算每个模型在不同测量不准确度下的结果，比较其衰减速率。

Result: 经典型相关性随测量不准确度线性衰减，量子型相关性则衰减较慢，显示出更高的鲁棒性。研究发现，非局域性影响热力学资源的效率，而非其最大能量值。

Conclusion: 经典型和量子型相关性在热力学资源方面有显著差异。经典型资源脆弱，比量子型资源更容易受到影响。这提示在设计量子信息处理系统时，需要考虑其对测量不准确度的敏感性。

Abstract: Initial system-environment correlations are a thermodynamic resource,
enabling work extraction via their erasure. We compare the work potential of
classical, quantum, and hypothetical stronger-than-quantum correlations as a
function of measurement misalignment. While all models can yield a peak
extractable work of k_B T ln 2, corresponding to a mutual information of ln 2,
their value as a resource differs critically in its robustness. The classical
resource is fragile, decaying linearly with misalignment, whereas the quantum
resource is robust, decaying only quadratically. Thus, the degree of
nonlocality maps not to the maximum energetic value of a correlation, but to
its operational robustness as a thermodynamic fuel.

Abstract: Cryptography depends on truly unpredictable numbers, but physical sources
emit biased or correlated bits. Quantum mechanics enables the amplification of
imperfect randomness into nearly perfect randomness, but prior demonstrations
have required physically co-located, loophole-free Bell tests, constraining the
feasibility of remote operation. Here we realize certified randomness
amplification across a network by dynamically probing large, entangled quantum
states on Quantinuum's 98-qubit Helios trapped-ion quantum processor. Our
protocol is secure even if the remote device acts maliciously or is compromised
by an intercepting adversary, provided the samples are generated quickly enough
to preclude classical simulation of the quantum circuits. We stream quantum
gates in real time to the quantum processor, maintain quantum state coherence
for $\approx 0.9$ seconds, and then reveal the measurement bases to the quantum
processor only milliseconds before measurement. This limits the time for
classical spoofing to 30 ms and constrains the location of hypothetical
adversaries to a $4{,}500$ km radius. We achieve a fidelity of 0.586 on random
circuits with 64 qubits and 276 two-qubit gates, enabling the amplification of
realistic imperfect randomness with a low entropy rate into nearly perfect
randomness.

Abstract: It is often argued that two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, even when
cooled to their ground state, display no inherently quantum features beyond
quantized energy levels. Here, we challenge this view by showing that their
classical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we
demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems
act as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement
at zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled
modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts
and squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in
different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one
description manifests as entanglement in another. These shifts therefore can
serve as an entanglement witness accessible via standard frequency
measurements. Furthermore, we show that this underlying squeezing, although not
directly measurable, can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in
precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring
squeezed quantum noise. Our results uncover a new route to quantum-enhanced
sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh
insight into how signatures of quantumness persist across the
quantum-to-classical boundary.

TL;DR: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for classical data-streaming problems that achieves an exponential space advantage over classical algorithms. thanks to the use of trapdmouth qubits and advanced quantum coding, the algorithm is feasible to implement on current quantum hardware despite challenges in maintaining quantum coherence in real-time data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to leverage quantum computing to solve classical streaming problems more efficiently. While quantum computers have shown potential for exponential speedups in certain tasks, practical implementation has often been hindered by technical challenges. This paper aims to address those challenges by developing a quantum algorithm specifically for streaming problems and demonstrating its feasibility on current quantum hardware.

Method: The method used in this paper involves the use of a trapped-ion quantum computer, such as the Quantinuum Helios, which has long-lived qubits. The authors implement a quantum pair sketch, a primitive underlying many quantum streaming algorithms, to solve the Hidden Matching problem. They also compile the algorithm for fault-tolerant quantum architectures based on surface and lattice codes to account for potential errors and overheads.

Result: The results of this paper show that the quantum pair sketch algorithm achieves an exponential advantage in space over classical algorithms for the Hidden Matching problem. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that this quantum space advantage persists even when accounting for the overheads of fault-tolerant quantum architectures. The successful implementation on a trapped-ion quantum computer suggests that quantum streaming algorithms may become practical with current technology.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper provides a significant step toward realizing practical quantum streaming algorithms by demonstrating an exponential quantum advantage in space and showing that the overheads of fault-tolerant quantum architectures are manageable. The results open up new possibilities for leveraging quantum computing to solve real-world streaming problems efficiently.

Abstract: Large classical datasets are often processed in the streaming model, with
data arriving one item at a time. In this model, quantum algorithms have been
shown to offer an unconditional exponential advantage in space. However,
experimentally implementing such streaming algorithms requires qubits that
remain coherent while interacting with an external data stream. In this work,
we realize such a data-streaming model using Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion
quantum computer with long-lived qubits that communicate with an external
server. We implement a quantum pair sketch, which is the primitive underlying
many quantum streaming algorithms, and use it to solve Hidden Matching, a
problem known to exhibit a theoretical exponential quantum advantage in space.
Furthermore, we compile the quantum streaming algorithm to fault-tolerant
quantum architectures based on surface and bivariate bicycle codes and show
that the quantum space advantage persists even with the overheads of
fault-tolerance.

Abstract: The individual optimization of quantum circuit parameters is currently one of
the main practical bottlenecks in variational quantum eigensolvers for
electronic systems. To this end, several machine learning approaches have been
proposed to mitigate the problem. However, such method predominantly aims at
training and predicting parameters tailored to individual molecules: either a
specific structure, or several structures of the same molecule with varying
bond lengths. This work explores machine learning based modeling strategies to
include transferability between different molecules. We use a well investigated
quantum circuit design and apply it to model properties of hydrogenic systems
where we show parameter prediction that is systematically transferable to
instances significantly larger than the training instances.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: e+e- experiments need high timing resolution for particle detection.

Method: AC-coupling increased fill factor and charge sharing for better timing.

Result: Resulting devices show sub-pitch timing resolution with lower power consumption.

Conclusion: AC-coupled LGADs are ideal for next-gen particle detectors.

Abstract: Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are characterized by a fast rise time
(500 ps) and extremely good time resolution (down to 17 ps). The intrinsic low
granularity of LGADs and the large power consumption of readout chips for
precise timing are problematic in near-future experiments such as e+e- Higgs
factories (FCC-ee) and the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider.
AC-coupled LGADs, where the readout metal is AC-coupled through an insulating
oxide layer, could solve both issues at the same time thanks to the 100% fill
factor and charge-sharing capabilities. Charge sharing between electrodes
allows a hit position resolution well below the pitch/$\sqrt12$ of standard
segmented detectors. At the same time, it relaxes the channel density and power
consumption requirements of readout chips. Extensive laboratory
characterization of AC-LGAD devices from the first full-size (up to 3x4 cm)
production from HPK for ePIC will be shown in this contribution. Both pixel and
strip geometry was produced and tested. This study was conducted within the
scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R&D program at the EIC.

Abstract: The gamma-ray total absorption facility (GTAF) composed of 40 BaF2 detection
units is designed to measure the cross section data of neutron radiation
capture reaction online, in order to comply with the experimental nuclear data
sheet.We have found that one of the most important sources of experimental
background is the initial alpha particles emitted by the BaF2 crystal.
Developing data analysis algorithms to eliminate the influence of alpha
particles in experimental data has become a key aspect. In this work, in order
to meet the needs of data acquisition, online measurement and analysis of
neutron radiation cross section, the GTAF data acquisition system adopts a full
waveform acquisition method, which results in a large number of data recorded,
transmitted, and stored during experiment, which also affects the uncertainty
of the cross-section data.Based on the signal waveform characteristics of the
BaF2 detection unit, in order to solve the aforementioned problems, three
methods, namely the ratio of fast component to total component, pulse width,
and time decay constant, are used to identify and distinguish alpha particles
and gamma rays. The quality factor FOM is utilized as an evaluation value and
several experiments are conducted using three radioactive sources (22Na, 137Cs,
60Co) for verification.

Abstract: Radon-induced backgrounds, particularly from $^{222}$Rn and its beta-emitting
progeny, present a critical challenge for next-generation liquid xenon (LXe)
detectors aimed at probing dark matter down to the neutrino fog. To address
this, we developed a compact hermetic gaseous xenon (GXe) detector. This device
physically isolates the active volume from external radon sources by using a
PTFE vessel sealed between two quartz flanges with mechanically compressed
ePTFE gaskets. To quantify radon sealing performance, we implemented a
dual-loop GXe circulation system and conducted a 670-hour radon-injection
measurement campaign. Radon ingress into the hermetic detector was monitored
using electrostatic radon detectors and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). From
these two independent measurements, the steady-state ratios of the radon
concentrations inside the hermetic detector to those outside were estimated to
be $ (1.1 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-2} $ and $ (1.1 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-2} $,
corresponding to radon-leakage flows of $ (2.9 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-11} $ and $
(2.6 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-11} $ $ \thinspace $m$^{3}$ $ \thinspace $
$\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, respectively. An extrapolation to a 60-tonne LXe TPC such as
XLZD suggests that the radon leakage could amount to $ 1.2 \times 10^{-2} $ $
\thinspace $mBq, which is negligible compared to the expected natural radon
emanation inside the detector, typically 3$ \thinspace $mBq. These results
demonstrate that flange-based mechanical sealing provides an effective solution
for realizing radon-isolated inner detectors in large-scale LXe experiments.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand how silicon pad sensors perform under high neutron radiation levels relevant to various scientific applications.

Method: The research involved irradiating single-pad sensor structures with neutron fluence, measuring leakage current and calorimetric response over time, and developing an exponential-annealing model to predict leakage current behavior.

Result: Results show that the leakage current decreases with increased accumulated neutron fluence but can recover over time. The exponential-annealing model accurately predicts the time-dependent leakage current behavior.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights for designing and operating silicon-based calorimeters in harsh radiation environments, emphasizing the importance of monitoring and potentially replacing sensors in long-term exposure scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate the radiation tolerance of p-type silicon pad sensors,
indigenously developed for use in high-fluence environments relevant to
heavy-ion collider experiments, cosmic-ray observatories, and deep-space
missions. Single-pad test structures were irradiated with neutrons over a range
of fluence, and post-irradiation performance was characterized. The evolution
of leakage current and the calorimetric response of the devices were
systematically analyzed as functions of accumulated neutron fluence. In
addition, we introduce a simple exponential-annealing model that predicts the
time dependence of leakage current after irradiation. The measurements and
model together quantify performance degradation and recovery trends, providing
guidance for the design and operation of silicon-based calorimetry in harsh
radiation environments.

### [90] [Analytical Modeling of Asynchronous Event-Driven Readout Architectures Using Queueing Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03705)
*Dominik S. Górni,Grzegorz W. Deptuch*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: Discussed analytical framework for event-driven imagers with M/D/1 queue model and one-slot gating, comparing to M/G/1/K and Engset models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance modeling and optimization of event-driven imagers with asynchronous arbiter trees.

Method: Used M/D/1 queue model, deterministic quantum T, one-slot gating, and algebraic relations for analysis.

Result: Framework matches post-layout results, reproduces saturation at 1/T, and predicts latency growth better than classical models.

Conclusion: Framework enables rapid architectural design trade-offs, such as partitioning into tiles, affecting performance metrics like loss probability, utilization, and latency.

Abstract: Event-driven imagers and sensor arrays commonly employ asynchronous arbiter
trees with a synchronous acknowledge to serialize requests. We present an
analytical framework that models the root as an \(M/D/1\) queue with
deterministic quantum \(T\) and implements losses at the sources through
one-slot gating. The admitted rate, loss probability, utilization, and mean
sojourn time are coupled by self-consistent relations; a closed form for
\(\mathbb{E}[S_t]\) separates fixed path delay \(\tau_0\) from queueing
effects. The framework matches post-layout results of a physical prototype over
light to heavy traffic, reproducing saturation at \(1/T\) and the observed
latency growth, while classical \(M/G/1/K\) and Engset-type abstractions
diverge at higher occupancy. Because all relations are algebraic, they enable
rapid sizing at design time, including the impact of partitioning into
independent tiles: reducing fan-in lowers arbitration depth and \(\tau_0\),
decreases loss, and improves latency at fixed \(T\), with throughput adding
across tiles. The model thereby links architectural parameters to performance
metrics and supports selection of acknowledge period, tiling, and link count
under practical constraints.

Abstract: Here we comment on the paper by Arthur D. Yaghjian, Phys. Rev. E 78, 046606
(2008) (arXiv:0805.0142). The author provides an equation of motion for a point
charged particle in a certain regime of system parameters (on the other hand,
claiming that in a different regime the classical equation of motion does not
exist). The solutions of this equation (in the regime where it exists)
presented in the paper show instantaneous jumps in the particle's velocity. We
show that such jumps, in the case of a point particle, would generate infinite
energy in the radiated electromagnetic field. Therefore, we claim that the
point-particle limit used by the author is incorrect.

### [92] [Modal Backflow Neural Quantum States for Anharmonic Vibrational Calculations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03061)
*Lexin Ding,Markus Reiher*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Introduce a novel neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, Modal Backflow (MBF), for bosons which circumvents the computational cost of permanents by incorporating bosonic symmetries. MBF achieves spectroscopic accuracy in vibrational calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of applying neural networks to bosonic many-body quantum systems, which is hindered by the computational intractability of bosonic analogues of backflow determinants. The motivation is to develop a practical neural quantum state that can handle bosons with high accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce Modal Backflow (MBF) as a new neural quantum state ansatz for bosons. They incorporate bosonic symmetries into the neural network to replace the bosonic backflow, which is not feasible due to the computational cost of permanents. They also implement a selected-configuration scheme to evaluate physical observables and gradients more accurately than the standard Monte Carlo sampling approach. Additionally, they perform vibrational self-consistent field (SCF) calculations within the MBF network as a pretraining step to accelerate convergence and improve stability. The method is validated on both artificial and ab initio Hamiltonians for anharmonic vibrational problems.

Result: The MBF network is demonstrated to deliver spectroscopic accuracy in zero-point energies and vibrational transitions across all anharmonic regimes. The results show that incorporating bosonic symmetries through the MBF ansatz allows for high-accuracy calculations while circumventing the computational challenges of permanent-based methods.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for applying neural networks to bosonic many-body quantum systems by developing an efficient and accurate ansatz that embeds the underlying symmetries of the problem.

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are a promising ansatz for solving many-body
quantum problems due to their inherent expressiveness. Yet, this expressiveness
can only be harnessed efficiently for treating identical particles if the
suitable physical knowledge is hardwired into the neural network itself. For
electronic structure, NQS based on backflow determinants has been shown to be a
powerful ansatz for capturing strong correlation. By contrast, the analogue for
bosons, backflow permanents, is unpractical due to the steep cost of computing
the matrix permanent and due to the lack of particle conservation in common
bosonic problems. To circumvent these obstacles, we introduce a modal backflow
(MBF) NQS design and demonstrate its efficacy by solving the anharmonic
vibrational problem. To accommodate the demand of high accuracy in
spectroscopic calculations, we implement a selected-configuration scheme for
evaluating physical observables and gradients, replacing the standard
stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo sampling. A vibrational
self-consistent field calculation is conveniently carried out within the MBF
network, which serves as a pretraining step to accelerate and stabilize the
optimization. In applications to both artificial and ab initio Hamiltonians, we
find that the MBF network is capable of delivering spectroscopically accurate
zero-point energies and vibrational transitions in all anharmonic regimes.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: MatInvent is a reinforcement learning workflow that optimizes diffusion models for goal-directed crystal generation, requiring only 60 iterations and 1,000 property evaluations, with superior performance under constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop efficient diffusion models for materials discovery, especially when labeled data is scarce.

Method: MatInvent uses reinforcement learning to adapt diffusion models for specific material properties, achieving rapid convergence by minimizing property computations.

Result: MatInvent achieves significant improvements, including up to 378x reduction in property computations, while maintaining high accuracy in generating materials with desired properties.

Conclusion: MatInvent streamlines diffusion models for material discovery, making it a powerful tool when labeled data is limited, thus enhancing efficiency in materials science applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models promise to accelerate material design by directly generating
novel structures with desired properties, but existing approaches typically
require expensive and substantial labeled data ($>$10,000) and lack
adaptability. Here we present MatInvent, a general and efficient reinforcement
learning workflow that optimizes diffusion models for goal-directed crystal
generation. For single-objective designs, MatInvent rapidly converges to target
values within 60 iterations ($\sim$ 1,000 property evaluations) across
electronic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, and physicochemical properties.
Furthermore, MatInvent achieves robust optimization in design tasks with
multiple conflicting properties, successfully proposing low-supply-chain-risk
magnets and high-$\kappa$ dielectrics. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
MatInvent exhibits superior generation performance under specified property
constraints while dramatically reducing the demand for property computation by
up to 378-fold. Compatible with diverse diffusion model architectures and
property constraints, MatInvent could offer broad applicability in materials
discovery.

TL;DR: 分子自旋量子比特在量子技术中有广泛应用，但受限于多种衰减速 mechanism，性能有限。为此，我们开发了一种综合实验和理论分析铜（II）对分强 Crystaline Phthalocyanine（CuPc）在直径agnetic Phthalocyanine hosts中的迁移现象的框架。通过 pulsed EPR 谱scopy 和 first-principles 簇相关展开模拟，我们定量分离了由于超近距耦合核自旋、自旋-晶格弛豫以及电子-电子 dipolar相互作用带来的贡献。我们的详细建模表明，在中等自旋密度下，强和弱耦合的核对 $T_2$ 的贡献微乎其微，而纵贯性的 dipolar 交互，通过瞬时和谱扩散，仍是主要的衰减速通道。这一结论通过模拟的自旋回声动力学与实验数据的直接比较进行了验证。通过提供一种可靠建模和实验方法，我们的研究识别了量子应用中 favorable 的电子自旋密度，并为预测集成相干时间提供了可转移的方法。这些见解将指导分子自旋量子比特在可扩展量子设备中的设计和优化。

Motivation: 自旋量子比特在量子计算和量子通信中具有重要地位。提升其性能，减少衰减速对量子应用的影响，是一个关键问题。这项研究通过实验和理论分析，揭示了迁移现象的主要来源，并为分子自旋量子比特的设计过程提供了重要参考。

Method: 我们使用了 pulsed EPR 谱scopy 和 first-principles 簇相关展开模拟来分别分析和分离迁移现象中的不同贡献。

Result: 主要发现是，无论是强还是弱耦合的核，对 $T_2$ 的贡献都很小，而纵贯性的电子-电子 dipolar 交互是主要的衰减速渠道，即使在中等自旋密度下也是如此。这一结论通过模拟和实验数据的对比得到了验证。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一种综合的方法来分析和预测分子自旋量子比特的迁移现象，为提高其性能提供了有用的信息。

Abstract: Molecular spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum technologies, but
their performance is limited by decoherence arising from diverse mechanisms.
The complexity of the environment makes it challenging to identify the main
source of noise and target it for mitigation. Here we present a systematic
experimental and theoretical framework for analyzing the mechanisms of
transverse relaxation in copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) diluted into
diamagnetic phthalocyanine hosts. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy together with
first-principles cluster correlation expansion simulations, we quantitatively
separate the contributions from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, spin--lattice
relaxation, and electron--electron dipolar interactions. Our detailed modeling
shows that both strongly and weakly coupled nuclei contribute negligibly to
$T_2$, while longitudinal dipolar interactions with electronic spins, through
instantaneous and spectral diffusion, constitute the main decoherence channel
even at moderate spin densities. This conclusion is validated by direct
comparison between simulated spin-echo dynamics and experimental data. By
providing a robust modeling and experimental approach, our work identifies
favorable values of the electron spin density for quantum applications, and
provides a transferable methodology for predicting ensemble coherence times.
These insights will guide the design and optimization of molecular spin qubits
for scalable quantum devices.

Motivation: The need for studying quantum correlation effects in large mixed systems motivates the development of QMeCHA. The complexity of these systems exceeds what was previously accessible, prompting the creation of this tool.

Method: QMeCHA is built with a modular architecture that allows easy expansion.

Efficient variational Monte Carlo, diffusion Monte Carlo, and wavefunction optimization with correlated sampling are employed for integration.

Result: The code successfully enables the study of quantum correlation effects in systems with thousands of fermions and bosons, expanding the boundaries of previously accessible methods.

Conclusion: QMeCHA represents a significant advancement in quantum Monte Carlo methods, providing a powerful tool for exploring complex many-body systems.

Abstract: We present the first open access version of the QMeCha (Quantum MeCha) code,
a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) package developed to study many-body interactions
between different types of quantum particles, with a modular and easy-to-expand
structure. The present code has been built to solve the Hamiltonian of a system
that can include nuclei and fermions of different mass and charge, e.g.
electrons and positrons, embedded in an environment of classical charges and
quantum Drude oscillators. To approximate the ground state of this
many-particle operator, the code features different wavefunctions. For the
fermionic particles, beyond the traditional Slater determinant, QMeCha also
includes Geminal functions such as the Pfaffian, and presents different types
of explicit correlation terms in the Jastrow factors. The classical point
charges and quantum Drude oscillators, described through different variational
ans\"atze, are used to model a molecular environment capable of explicitly
describing dispersion, polarization, and electrostatic effects experienced by
the nuclear and fermionic subsystem. To integrate these wavefunctions,
efficient variational Monte Carlo and diffusion Monte Carlo protocols have been
developed, together with a robust wavefunction optimization procedure that
features correlated sampling. In conclusion, QMeCha is a massively parallel
code introduced here to explore quantum correlation effects in mixed systems
with thousands of fermions and bosonic particles, beyond what was previously
accessible to other reference methods.

Conclusion: ⅢA族金属为过渡金属配合符提供了新途径，铝、镓、铟具有相似但 skies的特性，而铊可能表现不同。这些发现有助于设计新型催化体系。

Abstract: Low-valent Group 13 fragments can serve as neutral two-electron L-type
metalloligands to transition-metal (TM) centers, enabling heterometallic M-TM
platforms with bonding and reactivity patterns distinct from classical CO,
phosphine, and carbene ligation. This chapter develops a unifying,
descriptor-based view of aluminylene Al(I), gallylene Ga(I), and indylene In(I)
donors, and contrasts them with the limited L-type behavior of Tl(I). We map
synthetic gateways to isolable M(I) donors, analyze their
sigma-donation/pi-acceptance profiles, and extract periodic design rules in
which the sigma-donor strength decreases Al > Ga > In, whereas Tl(I) has not
yet been convincingly shown to engage in neutral L-type Tl->TM coordination.
Borderline cases that blur L-, X-, and Z-type classifications are also examined
to clarify descriptors and guide consistent usage across the series. This
contribution links ligand sterics/electronics, ambiphilicity at M(I), and the
chosen TM fragment to guide the rational design of M-TM platforms that harness
Group-13 M(I) donors for small-molecule activation and cooperative catalysis.

TL;DR: A novel basis set design for electronic ground-state calculations in molecular systems is proposed, which improves upon conventional methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing efficient and accurate basis sets for electronic structure calculations is key to advancing quantum chemistry and materials science.

Method: The authors introduced a reduced formalism using concentric even-tempered orbitals and a symmetry-adapted approach, utilizing primitive S-subshell Gaussian functions with only two parameters.

Result: The new basis set provides a dissociation curve for H2 that aligns well with higher-quality references, and it performs well in calculations for tetra-atomic hydrogen molecules.

Conclusion: This work offers improved basis set methods that balance computational cost and accuracy, with potential for further enhancements.

Abstract: We propose a system-oriented basis-set design based on even-tempered basis
functions to variationally encode electronic ground-state information into
molecular orbitals. First, we introduce a reduced formalism of concentric
even-tempered orbitals that achieves hydrogen energy accuracy on par with the
conventional formalism, with lower optimization cost and improved scalability.
Second, we propose a symmetry-adapted, even-tempered formalism specifically
designed for molecular systems. It requires only primitive S-subshell
Gaussian-type orbitals and uses two parameters to characterize all exponent
coefficients. In the case of the diatomic hydrogen molecule, the basis set
generated by this formalism produces a dissociation curve more consistent with
cc-pV5Z than cc-pVTZ at the size of aug-cc-pVDZ. Finally, we test our
even-tempered formalism against several types of tetra-atomic hydrogen
molecules for ground-state computation and point out its current limitations
and potential improvements.

Method: 通过结合Evangelista的Wick&d方程生成器和ORCA的AGE代码生成器，利用spin-free方法取代之前的spin-orbital方法，从而实现了高效的并行计算，特别适用于大分子的计算。

Result: 结果显示，RIC-MRCCSD在计算资源消耗和执行时具有良好的效率，甚至超过单重参考的RHF-CCSD和UHF-CCSD方法。尤其是在处理大型活性空间（如CAS(14,14)）和较大系统（如B12模型的809轨道）时，具备显著的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率、扩展性和适用性方面表现卓越，为量子化学计算领域的高性能计算提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, an efficient implementation of the renormalized
internally-contracted multreference coupled cluster with singles and doubles
(RIC-MRCCSD) into the ORCA quantum chemistry program suite is reported. To this
end, Evangelista's Wick&d equation generator was combined with ORCA's native
AGE code generator in order to implement the many-body residuals required for
the RIC-MRCCSD method. Substantial efficiency gains are realized by deriving a
spin-free formulation instead of the previously reported spin-orbital version
developed by some of us. Since AGE produces parallelized code, the resulting
implementation can directly be run in parallel with substantial speedups when
executed on multiple cores. In terms of runtime, the cost of RIC-MRCCSD is
shown to be between single-reference RHF-CCSD and UHF-CCSD, even when active
space spaces as large as CAS(14,14) are considered. This achievement is largely
due to the fact that no reduced density matrices (RDM) or cumulants higher than
three-body enter the formalism. The scalability of the method to large systems
is furthermore demonstrated by computing the ground-state of a vitamin B12
model comprised of an active space of CAS(12, 12) and 809 orbitals. In terms of
accuracy, RIC-MRCCSD is carefully compared to second- and approximate
fourth-order $n$-electron valence state perturbation theories (NEVPT2,
NEVPT4(SD)), to the multireference zeroth-order coupled-electron pair
approximation (CEPA(0)), as well as to the IC-MRCCSD from Kohn. In contrast to
RIC-MRCCSD, the IC-MRCCSD equations are entirely derived by AGE using the
conventional projection-based approach, which, however, leads to much higher
algorithmic complexity than the former as well as the necessity to calculate up
to the five-body RDMs. Remaining challenges such as the variation of the
results with the flow, a free parameter that enters the RIC-MRCCSD theory, are
discussed.

Conclusion: 我们成功构造了不含umklapp过程的UFL，该晶格在非平衡稳态下表现出更接近孤立的热传导特性。

Abstract: We propose a novel type of umklapp-free lattice (UFL), where umklapp
processes are completely absent. The proposed UFL incorporates cubic long-range
nonlinearity, a feature not addressed in previous studies. In this paper, we
derive an analytical expression for the cubic nonlinear coupling constants by
imposing mathematical conditions such that the nonlinear coupling strength
between particle pairs decays inversely with their separation distance. The
absence of umklapp processes in the proposed lattice is confirmed through
numerical comparisons with the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) lattice.
Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the
thermal conductivity of the proposed lattice in the non-equilibrium steady
state. Compared to the original FPUT lattice, the proposed UFL is closer to
ballistic transport. Our results demonstrate that the umklapp processes induced
by cubic nonlinearity are suppressed in the proposed UFL. Moreover, compared to
the UFL with only quartic nonlinearity, truncation of long-range interactions
plays a significant role in the proposed lattice.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate and quantify the basin geometry and extreme final state
uncertainty of two identical electrically asymmetrically coupled Chialvo
neurons. The system's diverse behaviors are presented, along with the
mathematical reasoning behind its chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics as determined
by the structure of the coupled equations. The system is found to be
multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron
is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the
coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity
due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be
fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity. This uncertainty and its
potential effect on the synchronization of biological neurons may have
significant implications for understanding human behavior and neurological
disease.

Abstract: This paper investigates a reverse space-time higher-order modified

standard local counterparts through the reverse space-time symmetry. The
integrability of this nonlocal equation is rigorously verified by presenting
its associated Lax pair and infinitely many conservation laws. Utilizing the

localized wave solutions on both zero and nonzero backgrounds. These patterns,
such as kinks, exponentially decaying solitons, asymmetric rogue waves and
their interaction solutions, exhibit novel dynamical behaviors that are not
found in the local counterparts. This work not only enriches the family of

Abstract: G\'erard and Grellier proposed, under the name of the cubic Szeg\H{o}
equation, a remarkable classical field theory on a circle with a quartic
Hamiltonian. The Lax integrability structure that emerges from their definition
is so constraining that it allows for writing down an explicit general solution
for prescribed initial data, and at the same time, the dynamics is highly
nontrivial and involves turbulent energy transfer to arbitrarily short
wavelengths. The quantum version of the same Hamiltonian is even more striking:
not only the Hamiltonian itself, but also its associated conserved hierarchies
display purely integer spectra, indicating a structure beyond ordinary quantum
integrability. Here, we initiate a systematic study of this quantum system by
presenting a mixture of analytic results and empirical observations on the
structure of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, conservation laws, ladder
operators, etc.

Conclusion: The work contributes to the understanding of lanthanide behavior in ultracold systems and the characterization of quantum phenomena at extremely low temperatures.

Abstract: This is the manuscript of my "Habilitation \`a diriger des recherches", where
I present the research work that I have done after my PhD, defended in 2009.
The manuscript is divided in two parts. The first one is dedicated to
atomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the
contexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals
with long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and
diatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of
long-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena,
like photoassociation and collisional shielding.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the stable mechanism of a ring soliton in
two-dimensional Fermi superfluids by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations
and their time-dependent counterparts. In the uniform situation, we discover
that the ring soliton is always driven away from its initial location, and
moves towards the edge due to a curvature-induced effective potential. The ring
soliton is impossible to remain static at any location in the uniform system.
To balance the density difference between the ring soliton's two sides, a
harmonic trap is introduced, which can exert an effect to counterbalances the
curvature-induced effective potential. This enables the ring dark soliton to
become a stable state at a particular equilibrium position r_s, where the free
energy of the ring dark soliton just reaches the maximum value. Once ring
soliton is slightly deviated from r_s, some stable periodic oscillations of
ring soliton around r_s will turn out. Some dissipation will possibly occur to
ring soliton once its minimum radius is comparable to the healing length of
soliton's Friedel oscillation. This dissipation will increase the oscillation
amplitude and finally make the ring soliton decay into sound ripples. Our
research lays the groundwork for a more in-depth understanding of the stable
mechanism of a ring dark soliton in the future.

*Miguel Tierz*

TL;DR: Derives analytic laws for the breathing mode of harmonically trapped Fermi gases, detailing fractional breathing mode shift, quantum anomaly correction, and finite temperature behavior.<br/>


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the breathing mode of harmonically trapped Fermi gases is crucial for studying quantum systems and their response to external perturbations.<br/>

Method: The analysis involves deriving analytic laws by solving the many-body Schrödinger equation in harmonic traps, utilizing associated Laguerre polynomials and Tan's contact parameter.<br/>

Result: Fractional breathing mode shift scales as δω/(2ω)∝Q−1, includes a quantum anomaly correction with Q−2 falloff, and exhibits a temperature-dependent behavior with a low-T plateau and high-T tail. Weak anharmonicity introduces mixed quartic corrections after scaling with Tan's contact parameter.<br/>

Conclusion: The derived laws provide a universal framework for predicting and analyzing the breathing mode in experimentally relevant harmonic traps, offering insights into quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.

Abstract: We derive universal, experiment ready analytic laws for the breathing
(monopole) mode of harmonically trapped Fermi gases. Within a fixed
hyperangular channel $s>0$, contact-weighted products of associated Laguerre
polynomials reduce to an elementary gamma ratio, yielding: (i) a level resolved
fractional breathing mode shift with scaling $\delta\omega/(2\omega)\propto
Q^{-1}$, where $Q\equiv 2q+s+1$, with $q$ the radial quantum number; (ii) a
first order quantum anomaly correction involving exactly two intermediate
states, producing a $Q^{-2}$ falloff of the leaked monopole strength with an
explicit prefactor; and (iii) a closed form finite temperature average
exhibiting a low-$T$ plateau and a $1/T$ high-$T$ tail. We also obtain a mixed
anomaly\nobreakdash-quartic correction for weak anharmonicity. All expressions
become parameter free after a single per-channel calibration of the Tan contact
$\lambda_s$ at $q=0$.

Abstract: We investigate the mean-field scattering dynamics of a quasi-one-dimensional
Bose--Einstein condensate interacting with a Rosen--Morse potential. For
specific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact,
degenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect
transmission. Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the
stability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only
one solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable.
Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity,
identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical
analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability
to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes
an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly
relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and
optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices.

Abstract: Mobile impurities interacting with a quantum medium form quasiparticles known
as polarons, a central concept in many-body physics. While the quantum impurity
problem has been extensively studied with ultracold atomic gases, repulsive
polarons in the strongly correlated regime have remained elusive. Typically,
the impurity atoms bind into molecules or rapidly decay into deeper lying
states before they can acquire an appreciable dressing cloud. Here, we report
on the realization of polarons in a strongly repulsive quasi-two-dimensional
quantum gas. Using a superfluid of $^6$Li dimers, we introduce impurities by
promoting a small fraction of the dimers into higher levels of the transverse
confining potential. These novel synthetic-spin polarons give access to the
strongly repulsive regime where common decay channels are suppressed. We
extract key polaron properties - the energy, quasiparticle residue, and
effective mass - using trap modulation and Bragg spectroscopy. Our measurements
are well captured by a microscopic T-matrix approach and quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, revealing deviations from mean-field predictions. In particular,
we measure a significant enhancement of the polaron mass, with values exceeding
twice the free dimer mass. Our demonstration of a stable repulsive Bose polaron
establishes a platform for studying impurity physics in low-dimensional and
strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: Utilizing ultracold spinor gases as large-scale, many-body quantum simulation
platforms, we establish a toolbox for the precise control, characterization,
and detection of nonequilibrium dynamics via internal spinor phases. We develop
a method to extract the phase evolution from the observed spin population
dynamics, allowing us to define an order parameter that sharply identifies
dynamical phase transitions over a wide range of conditions. This work also
demonstrates a technique for inferring spin-dependent interactions from a
single experimental time trace, in contrast to the standard approach that
requires mapping a cross section of the phase diagram, with immediate
applications to systems experiencing complex time-dependent interactions.
Additionally, we demonstrate experimental access to and control over
non-ergodic relaxation dynamics, where states in the (nominally) thermal region
of the energy spectrum retain memory of the initial state, via the manipulation
of spinor phases, enabling the study of non-ergodic thermalization dynamics
connected to quantum scarring.

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D large-scale and 3D volume electron microscopy have
stimulated the rapid development of nanoscale functional analysis at the tissue
and organ levels. Digitizing the cell by mapping the intricate organellar
networks into its physiological and pathological textures will revolutionarize
the contents of cell atlases. To meet the requirements of characterizing
intracellular organelles and their interactions within defined cellular cohorts
at tissue level, we have developed DeepOrganelle. It adopts a lightweighted
Mask2Former frameworks as a universal segmentor and is capable of segmenting
and extracting organelles within different cell types, performing statistical
quantitative analysis, as well as visualizing and quantifying the spatial
distribution of organelle morphologies and interactions across different cell
types at tissue scales. Using DeepOrganelle, we systemically perform
cross-scale quantification of membrane contact sites(MCSs) dynamics across the
progression of the seminiferous epithelial cycle, covering 12 distinct
developmental stages and 24 statuses of germ cells. DeepOrganelle uncovers the
spatiotemporal gradient of the germ cell differentiation atlas according to
different types of organelles and their interactions. Noticeably, it discovers
a waved pattern of mitochondria(Mito)-endoplasmic reticulum(ER) contact with a
significant increase specifically at Stage X pachytene preceding the transition
to diplotene, which aligns well with a newly reported experiment that
mitochondrial metabolic proteins like PDHA2 are essential for this transition
by maintaining ATP supply for double-strand break(DSB) repair. DeepOrganelle
also observes a dynamic restructuring of the blood-testis barrier and
stage-specific reorganization of organelle topography in Sertoli cells from
preleptotene to leptotene phases of prophase I.

Abstract: Biological membranes often exhibit heterogeneous protein patterns, which
cells control. Strong patterns, like the polarity spot in budding yeast, can be
described as surface condensates, formed by physical interactions between
constituents. However, it is unclear how these interactions affect the material
exchange with the bulk. To study this, we analyze a thermodynamically
consistent model, which reveals that passive exchange generally accelerates the
coarsening of surface condensates. Active exchange can further accelerate
coarsening, although it can also fully arrest it and induce complex patterns
involving various length scales. We reveal how these behaviors are related to
non-local transport via diffusion through the bulk, rationalizing the various
scaling laws we observe and allowing us to interpret biologically relevant
scenarios.

Abstract: Computer generated holography requires high-speed spatial light modulators
(SLMs) for dynamically patterning light in 3D. Piston-motion micromirror-based
SLMs support high-speed ($\geq$ 10 kHz) phase modulation; however, fabricating
micromirror arrays with sufficient fill factor necessary for high diffraction
efficiency is challenging. In particular, the larger mirrors of high fill
factor designs are susceptible to stress-induced curvature that significantly
degrades optical performance. In this work, we introduce an optical
compensation method using a pitch-matched microlens array (MLA) to focus light
onto just the center of each mirror. Our approach thus avoids curvature-induced
artifacts and improves optical fill factor to nearly 100$\%$, independent of
the original mechanical fill factor. Through simulations and experiments on a
fabricated micromirror array with bowed mirrors, we show that the Pearson
correlation coefficient of the imparted phase profile is improved from 0.11 to
0.85 and the brightness of a holographically-generated single spot is enhanced
by 8$\times$ with our microlens array in place. Our hybrid
optical-electromechanical strategy thus provides a scalable path toward
high-speed, high-fidelity wavefront control for applications such as adaptive
optics, holographic displays, and optogenetics.

Abstract: The inevitable random frequency differences among semiconductor lasers
present an obstacle to achieving their collective coherence, but previous
worked showed that fully (all-to-all) coupled networks can still be
synchronized even in the weakly coupling regime. An outstanding question is
whether sparsely coupled network structures exist that lead to strong
synchronization. This paper gives an affirmative answer: optimal sparse
coupling configurations can be found which enables near-complete
synchronization. Quite surprisingly, with respect to synchronization, certain
sparse networks can outperform fully coupled networks, when the weights of
coupling are placed dominantly on the laser pairs with large frequency
differences. The counterintuitive phenomenon can be explained by a
thermodynamic potential theory that maps the time-delay-induced phase dynamics
to an energy landscape. These findings suggest a scalable and cost-effective
approach to achieving robust, steady-state synchronization of semiconductor
lasers in the presence of disorder and noise.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method for fully contactless and precise control of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures for advanced optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications.

Method: The method involves using SAWs to modulate both intralayer and interlayer excitons by utilizing the coupled piezoelectric and strain fields, achieving dynamic control through the platform's integrated approach.

Result: The results show the existence of two modulable interlayer excitons with a robust twist-angle-independent energy splitting of 120 meV, as well as the successful modulation of photoluminescence through confined piezoelectric potential wells. The platform also induces quadratic and linear Stark effects for intralayer and interlayer excitons, respectively.

Conclusion: This breakthrough establishes a new pathway for on-chip acousto-optic and quantum optoelectronic devices with advanced excitonic functionality, significantly advancing the field of van der Waals heterostructures for optoelectronics and quantum photonics.

Abstract: This work presents a platform that enables surface acoustic wave (SAW)
modulation of both intralayer and interlayer excitons in MoS2/WSe2
heterostructures. Harnessing the coupled piezoelectric and strain fields of
SAWs, this integrated approach allows for dynamic, precise, and fully
contactless control of excitonic properties, a capability essential for the
realization of next generation optoelectronic, quantum photonic, and excitonic
devices. We identify two distinct modulable interlayer excitons in optical
communication bands: IX$_{K\Gamma}$ in the O band (around 1300 nm) and
IX$_{K\!-\!K}$ in the S band (around 1500 nm); these two excitons display a
robust twist-angle-independent energy splitting of 120 meV, in agreement with
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The type-II band alignment
induced by the SAW not only promotes efficient exciton dissociation but also
enables direct and tunable modulation of photoluminescence via the formation of
confined piezoelectric potential wells. Furthermore, by simultaneously
generating in-plane and out-of-plane SAW fields, the platform achieves
selective manipulation of intralayer and interlayer excitons, inducing
quadratic Stark effects for intralayer excitons and linear Stark effects for
interlayer excitons. These findings provide new insights into SAWexciton
interactions in van der Waals heterostructures, broaden the operational
spectral range, and establish pathways toward on-chip acousto-optic and quantum
optoelectronic devices with advanced excitonic functionality.

Abstract: Coherent detection and interferometry in the terahertz (THz) regime are key
capabilities that enable applications ranging from astronomy to non-destructive
testing. Phase-sensitive THz detection is currently achieved using nonlinear
crystals or external interferometers and photomixers. However, the former
approach requires femtosecond pulsed radiation, and all approaches suffer from
a large footprint and sensitive alignment. Here, we demonstrate a
graphene-enabled, on-chip, integrated THz detector-interferometer with optical
cavity and antenna, exhibiting high sensitivity to the phase of incident THz
light. We exploit this by determining the thickness of thin films placed in
front of the detector-interferometer, obtaining a strongly sub-wavelength
thickness accuracy of $\sim$5 $\mu$m, while we predict that an accuracy of 10
nm is within reach. This is relevant for a range of industrial application
domains, including automotive, construction, and health. The
detector-interferometer moreover exhibits a record-high external responsivity -
without any normalization to a diffraction-limited spot size - of 73 mA/W and a
noise-equivalent power of 79 pW$~\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. This performance is due to
enhanced absorption at the cavity mode around 89 GHz, in agreement with
multi-physics simulations. These results pave the way to exploiting coherent
wave detection in the THz regime with utility in spectroscopy, next-generation
wireless communication, and beyond.

Abstract: In the context of light-matter interactions between organic chromophores and
confined photons of (plasmonic) nano-resonators, we introduce a general
framework that couples ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics with few-mode field
quantization to simulate light-matter interactions of molecular emitters at the
nanoscale. Arbitrary, lossy, and spatially inhomogeneous photonic environments
are represented by a minimal set of interacting modes fitted to their spectral
density, while geometry-dependent molecular properties are computed on the fly.
Applications to few-molecule strong coupling show that strong coupling persists
when molecular degrees of freedom and disorder are included for the chosen
system consisting of a nanoparticle dimer coupled to multiple emitters. At the
same time, symmetry-protected degeneracies of two-level models are lifted. The
framework further reveals how spatial field inhomogeneity and molecular
disorder shape cavity-mediated energy transfer, illustrated for an
HBQ-Methylene Blue donor-acceptor combination in a five-emitter system.

Abstract: We investigate the propagation of optical fields through polymethyl

Gradient forces arising from spatially non-uniform field distributions and
Lorentz force perturbations are incorporated through d'Alembert's principle,
revealing an effective inertia mechanism that opposes rapid field
redistribution. Modal diagonalization demonstrates that synchronized dipole
oscillations can compensate turbulence-induced wavefront distortions, with the
perturbation force $\delta F_{\text{Pert}}(t) = F'_{\text{Inertia}} -
F_{\text{Inertia}}$ governing the compensation efficacy. Experimental
verification employs a pseudo-random phase plate (PRPP) generating
Kolmogorov-spectrum turbulence, with 200 frames recorded across four
configurations: baseline, turbulence-only, and turbulence with one or two PMMA
rods. Statistical analysis quantifies scintillation index variations. Results
indicate that dipole-dipole coupling energy transitions enable partial
turbulence compensation when stronger suppression observed for longer
propagation paths through increased synchronization.

Result: 通过对称场发射机制实现 Human-safe 工作，量子效应用于 AlN屏障，光滑依赖于缺陷密度、层宽和温度；能在 226 纳米波段工作，但效率较低；将其建模为 I-V 曲线，发现性能受到自加热和 Child 的空间电荷效应限制需要进一步工程优化。

Conclusion: 基于深度分析，得出了量子效应主要受缺陷密度、层宽和温度影响，并据此开发了新型 LED和模型，为未来研究提供了 refs和参考点。

Abstract: We report on unique features of ultra-thin GaN/AlN quantum wells and
demonstrate a new field emission device for human-safe disinfection with an
external quantum efficiency of 18% and superior reliability, as compared to
far-UVC LEDs. We investigate the behavior of a Shockley-Read-Hall recombination
via Al vacancies-oxygen complexes in AlN barriers as a function of GaN well
thickness and come to the conclusion that direct relaxation of confined states
via mid-gap traps is prohibited and the main mechanism limiting the quantum
efficiency (QE) is the carrier escape followed by non-radiative SRH
recombination in the AlN barriers. As a consequence, the QE is highly dependent
on the defect density, QW width and temperature which allowed us to reach a
descent emissions at 226 nm wavelength although at wall plug efficiency being
low, at 0.02%. We build a complete Light-Current-Voltage model and find that
present device performance is limited by the self-heating and by the Child's
space charge effect, both limitations can be easily addressed with some
additional engineering efforts.

Abstract: Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional
view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we
show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening
in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and
multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and
Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but
differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor
enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend
predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry
breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization
conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave
picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design
principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for
advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.

Abstract: A plasmonic nanostructure-based substrate, serving as a surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) substrate, enhances the Raman scattering of molecules.
By employing an electron beam lithography followed by our recently developed
nano-electroplating protocol, a gold nanorod array SERS substrate can be
fabricated to detect lower molecular analyte concentrations, such as Rhodamine
6G (R6G) solution. As the critical dimensions of the nanorod array decrease,
they exhibit hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) characteristics with anisotropic
permittivity behavior. In our study, we fabricated two sets of nanorod arrays:
one in the HMM regime (140 nm periodicity) and the other in the non-HMM regime
(400 nm periodicity), aiming to evaluate the performance of each set based on
R6G detection. The obtained results are compared and analyzed using COMSOL
simulation and Raman mapping and the role of hyperbolicity is discussed.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of distinguishing weak from strong coupling in light-matter interactions by analyzing photonic resonances in the strong coupling regime. It highlights that traditional optical response analysis at real frequencies only provides indirect estimates, whereas true resonances exist at complex frequencies. The authors derive an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for hybridization effects, showing that it introduces off-diagonal coupling and shifts the bare eigenfrequency. The approach is validated with quantum-chemical simulations of silver resonators filled with molecular materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the difference between weak and strong coupling is essential for unlocking the most intriguing and promising phenomena in light-matter interactions. Current methods rely on indirect optical response analysis, which is insufficient for accurately quantifying these regimes.

Method: The authors derive an effective Hamiltonian to model the interaction between a photonic resonator and an arbitrary number of material resonances. This model accounts for hybridization effects, including shifts in bare eigenfrequencies and off-diagonal coupling.

Result: The derived Hamiltonian accurately describes the hybridization effects in open photonic systems, providing a unified framework for quantifying light-matter coupling strength. This is demonstrated through quantum-chemical simulations of silver resonators.

Conclusion: This work offers a novel approach to distinguishing weak and strong coupling in photonic environments by focusing on the true resonant dynamics at complex frequencies, paving the way for a more accurate description of light-matter interactions.

Abstract: Photonic resonances are a powerful tool for controlling light-matter
interactions. However, unlocking many of the most scientifically intriguing and
technologically promising phenomena requires entering the strong coupling
regime, where light and matter fully mix, unlocking emergent properties of the
coupled states. Nowadays, distinguishing between weak and strong coupling
primarily relies on studying the optical response of the hybrid system at real
frequencies, which only provides indirect estimates of the underlying resonant
dynamics. In contrast, the actual resonances live at complex frequencies.
Resolving this contradiction, we show that photonic resonant states provide the
framework to unambiguously quantify the strength of light-matter interaction,
enabling a rigorous distinction between weak and strong coupling regimes.
Assuming a single dominant resonant state of the bare photonic resonator, we
derive an effective Hamiltonian that captures the interaction between the
photonic resonator and an arbitrary number of material resonances. Our analysis
reveals that, unlike most coupled-oscillator models commonly employed in the
literature, hybridization not only introduces off-diagonal coupling but also
shifts the bare eigenfrequency of the photonic mode. We demonstrate the
accuracy of this approach by studying planar and spherical silver resonators
filled with a molecular material whose properties were extracted from
quantum-chemical simulations. Our work paves the way towards a unified
description of light-matter coupling in open photonic environments.

Abstract: Active metasurfaces enable dynamic control of light for applications in beam
steering, pixelated holography, and adaptive optics, but demonstrations of
two-dimensional (2D) electrically addressable arrays have so far been limited.
Here we introduce a scalable 2D architecture based on phase-change materials
(PCMs) integrated metasurfaces and apply it to realize the first transmissive
mid-infrared (mid-IR) spatial light modulator (SLM). The device is fabricated
through standard silicon photonic foundry processing combined with
backend-of-line (BEOL) integration and employs multilayer backend metal
interconnects to implement a crossbar addressing scheme. Each pixel is
integrated with a silicon diode selector to suppress sneak-path currents, a
feature essential for scaling to large arrays. The result establishes a
foundry-compatible route to high-density, large-area active metasurfaces with
independently tunable pixels.

Abstract: Near-zero-refractive index materials display unique optical properties such
as perfect transmission through distorted waveguides, cloaking, and inhibited
diffraction. Compared to conventional media, they can fundamentally behave
differently to light impinging from air, owing to the phenomenon of total
external reflection. This makes them attractive for evanescent wave phenomena
without prism coupling or sub-wavelength air gaps. Here, we introduce a
strategy for linear-to-circular polarization conversion based on this effect.
Practically realizable device designs are presented using hybrid structures of
near-zero index and high index materials in a simple planar geometry. Our
results predict polarization conversion in both reflection and transmission
configurations based on naturally available epsilon-near-zero materials and
illustrate the role of loss in limiting performance. Although the operation
wavelength is limited to the epsilon-near-zero region, the concept can be
implemented from the terahertz to optical domains using tunable
epsilon-near-zero materials.
