Interaction rates of up to 50 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions require real-time processing of more than 3 TB/s of raw detector data. This requirement is met by a custom FPGA-based processing pipeline that performs the complete front-end data treatment fully in-stream, including common-mode correction, pedestal subtraction, ion-tail filtering, zero suppression, and dense data packing.\n  A central element of the design is a highly parallel common-mode correction algorithm operating directly on the streaming data. It robustly identifies signal-free readout channels on a time-bin basis and applies pad-dependent scaling to compensate for local variations in capacitive coupling in the GEM readout. In combination with pedestal subtraction and ion-tail filtering, this enables accurate baseline restoration under extreme high-occupancy conditions, preventing signal loss while efficiently suppressing noise prior to zero suppression.\n  The pipeline operates continuously at the full detector bandwidth and reduces the raw input rate to about 900 GB/s for Pb-Pb collisions at the target interaction rate. Overall, it represents a large-scale FPGA-based real-time signal-processing implementation for high-energy physics detector readout.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For obstacles of arbitrary strength and large spatial extent, we determine the critical speed from the conditions for strong ellipticity of the stationary hydrodynamic equations within the hydraulic and incompressible approximations. Numerical simulations in this regime reveal that the breakdown of superfluidity is initiated by the nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs for an impenetrable obstacle, and of Jones-Roberts soliton-type structures for a penetrable obstacle.

However, without proper calibration, relating microviscosity to a physical parameter is unclear, which strongly limits their quantitative use in biological media for instance. In this study, the response of a molecular rotor in binary and ternary macromolecular aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights is investigated in order to better rationalize the sensitivity of rotors to their cybotactic environment. More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition.

Approaches that directly generate millimeter-wave carriers are fundamentally limited by quantum and thermal phase-noise processes. Here we show that these limits can be overcome by combining Kerr-induced optical frequency division in a chip-scale microresonator with a large-spacing dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. This 3.3 THz optical reference injection-locks a Kerr soliton microcomb, with a repetition rate that becomes a coherently divided 300 GHz carrier with phase noise below the quantum limit of a corresponding 300 GHz dual-wavelength Brillouin laser and far below the thermo-refractive noise of a microring resonator. Cross-correlation phase-noise measurements were developed to show that the resulting oscillator reaches a phase-noise floor of -152 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, consistent with photodetection shot noise. Integration of the measured spectrum yields an RMS timing jitter of 135 as from 1 kHz to 1 MHz.

With an optimized and weak probe-ancilla coupling strength and a proper duration of joint evolution, the two parallel evolution paths of the probe system induced by the unconditional measurement on qubit can transform an eigenstate of the collective angular momentum operator of spin ensemble to be a two-component state with a large distance in eigenspace. The quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system of polarized states or their superposition, that could be relaxed to mixed states, can therefore manifest an exact or asymptotic quadratic scaling with respect to the probe size (spin number) $N$. The quadratic scaling behavior is found to be insensitive to the imperfect encoding operator and coupling strength. By virtue of the parity detection on the ancillary qubit or the probe system, the phase sensitivity can approach the Heisenberg limit.

The operator flow equations for such deformations induce a particular Legendre Transformation between flowed Lagrangians and flowed Hamiltonians. The marginal deformation does not change the conformal symmetries of the theory, until some special points in the moduli space are reached, and the relativistic conformal algebra smoothly changes to the Carrollian conformal (equivalently BMS) one. We investigate this change of symmetry from both configuration space and phase space point of view, while keeping the notion of Legendre Transformation unchanged during the flow. By expanding the actions, in the extreme limits of the flow parameter, we recover the usual ``Electric'' Carroll theory and further uncover a novel ``Magnetic'' counterpart. We discuss the intriguing geometric understanding of such dynamical maps for the deformed theories, and also provide a concrete example for the same from a deformed string theory in flat space.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using an effective PXQ model, we demonstrate that the associated Hilbert space decomposes into disconnected, dimer-conserving subspaces. The classification of these subspaces is provided, and the computational basis states spanning them are identified. Through a combination of analytical mapping and numerical simulations, we compare the dynamics of the PXQ model with those of the full Rydberg atom chain. The deviations are attributed to two factors, laser-induced leakage from the constrained Hilbert subspace and the influence of long-range interactions beyond the NN limit. Our results indicate that subspace leakage can be mitigated by increasing the NN interaction strength.

While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u4e0b\u751f\u7269\u819c\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4e92\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ad6\u76f4\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0a\u7684\u529b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5f62\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52bf\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e9a\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u7ea7\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u540c\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u9525\u72b6\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u6392\u65a5\uff0c\u5f02\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5438\u5f15\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7535\u8377\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5728\u819c\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5206\u754c\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5f2f\u66f2\u521a\u6027\u548c\u7c98\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4e24\u533a\u5206\u57df\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u751f\u7269\u819c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u819c\u8f6c\u8fd0\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u819c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7531\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5305\u542b\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u819c\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u8102\u8d28\u819c\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\uff08LD\uff09\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u529b\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u7ad6\u76f4\u4f4d\u79fb\uff1b\u4e9a\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u7ea7\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u540c\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u9525\u72b6\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u6392\u65a5\uff0c\u5f02\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5438\u5f15\uff1b\u819c\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5206\u754c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u819c-\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u819c\u8f6c\u8fd0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Hydrogen termination of the diamond surface induces a two dimensional hole gas (2DHG), while an ensemble of near surface NV centers located $ \\sim 1~\u03bcm$ below the surface enables noninvasive magnetic imaging of current flow with micrometer scale spatial resolution. The FETs were electrically characterized over a range of drain source biases $V_{ds}= 0$ to $-15V$ and gate voltages,$V_{gs}= +3$ to $-9V$ followed by in situ widefield NV magnetometry during device operation. Magnetic field maps and reconstructed current density distributions directly visualize current injection at the source drain contacts and transport beneath the hBN gated channel. Magnetic field maps reveal current density variations in the channel region owing to non-uniformities or defects in the gate dielectric. In addition, we observe a pronounced enhancement of the drain current ($\\sim 600-900 \u03bcA$) and a shift in the apparent threshold voltage during laser illumination, reflecting photo induced changes in channel electrostatics. By correlating gate dependent magnetic images with simultaneous electrical measurements, we directly link spatial current distributions to FET transfer characteristics, providing new insight into buried interface transport and non-uniform gating effects in the transistor channel. As the methodology is compatible with top gated FETs, it can be used to map channel current distributions with micrometer resolution in emerging channel materials, such as 2D materials and wide bandgap channels, and establish widefield NV magnetometry as a powerful platform for probing charge transport in transistors and Van der Waals dielectric heterostructures.", "AI": {"tldr":

Of particular interest are non-Gaussian, extreme-value statistics that arise when nontrivial correlations and criticality dominate over the central limit theorem. Strikingly, in two-dimensional (2D) quantum fluids, such effects have been predicted to manifest in the order parameter distribution in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) superfluid phase, which approaches a universal extreme-value form in the low-temperature limit. Here, we measure the order parameter statistics of 2D Bose gases across the BKT critical point using matter-wave interferometry. This allows us to confirm the predicted convergence of the observed statistics to a universal Gumbel distribution at low temperatures, to the 0.1% level of the probability density. Furthermore, the intrinsic precision of the atom interferometer allows the robust extraction of higher-moment observables such as skewness and kurtosis; in particular, we report direct measurements of the Binder cumulant which allows us to precisely identify the onset of the phase transition. Extending this approach to the investigation of non-equilibrium systems, we probe vortex unbinding dynamics following a quench across the BKT critical point and identify parameter-independent scaling behaviour of higher moments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u6b63\u4ea4\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u503c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u4f4e\u6e29\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u666e\u904d\u7684Gumbel\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c04\u9891\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u9ad8\u4f4e\u77e9\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5c04\u9891\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8c\u7ef4\u73bb\u8272\u6c14\u4f53\u5728BKT\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u503c\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u73bb\u8272\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5c04\u9891\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8c\u7ef4\u73bb\u8272\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec:\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u9ad8\u4f4e\u77e9\u91cf\uff0c\u5982\u504f\u659c\u5ea6\u548c\u5ced\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e86\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u540e vortex \u7684\u4e0d\u53d1\u6563\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86BKT\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u4f4e\u6e29\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684Gumbel\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u76840.1%\u6c34\u5e73\u8bc1\u5b9e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6536\u655b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86Binder\u7d2f\u79ef\u77e9\u91cf\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u70b9\u3002\u5c04\u9891\u5e72\u6d89\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86vortex\u4e0d\u5206\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u77e9\u91cf\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c04\u9891\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u73bb\u8272\u6c14\u4f53\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86BKT\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u503c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u53d8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Recent experiments in GaAs and bilayer graphene (BLG) have observed many `next-generation' even-denominator states at filling factors such as $\u03bd=\\frac{3}{4}$, $\\frac{3}{8}$, and $\\frac{3}{10}$. We develop the theory of these states, including analyses of their bulk quasiparticles, of methods for distinguishing between pairing channels in edge transport measurements, and of their trial wavefunctions. As part of this study, we derive general relations of how flux attachment affects many universal properties of states. In particular, we prove that the topological stability of interface modes is invariant under flux attachment. We compare next-generation paired states to Bonderson-Slingerland states at the same filling factors, and demonstrate that their quasiparticles carry identical charges and obey the same exchange statistics. The next-generation and Bonderson-Slingerland states still describe distinct phases, and we find that the former are energetically favored in the lowest Landau level, while the latter are favored in the first excited level.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

When quantum information is encoded redundantly, a larger Hilbert space is constructed using multiple physical qubits, and the computation is performed within a designated subspace. When applying deep learning to the decoding of quantum error-correcting codes, a key challenge arises from the non-uniqueness between the syndrome measurements provided to the decoder and the corresponding error patterns that constitute the ground-truth labels. Building upon prior work that addressed this issue for the toric code by re-optimizing the decoder with respect to the symmetry inherent in the parity-check structure, we generalize this approach to arbitrary stabilizer codes. In our experiments, we employed multilayer perceptrons to approximate continuous functions that complement the syndrome measurements of the Color code and the Golay code. Using these models, we performed decoder re-optimization for each code. For the Color code, we achieved an improvement of approximately 0.8% in decoding accuracy at a physical error rate of 5%, while for the Golay code the accuracy increased by about 0.1%. Furthermore, from the evaluation of the geometric and algebraic structures in the continuous function approximation for each code, we showed that the design of generalized continuous functions is advantageous for learning the geometric structure inherent in the code.

Conventional transfer techniques often fail due to reliance on high temperature, corrosive chemicals, or mechanical peeling, leading to pattern damage, low fidelity, or poor biocompatibility. Here, we report a transfer strategy utilizing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) carrier soluble tape, enabling rapid, residue-free, high-fidelity transfer of nanodiamond patterns onto diverse biointerfaces. The success of this method is rooted in a unique \"hydrate-soften-expand-self-peel\" mechanism of the soluble tape with PVA backing. In situ mechanical tracking reveals non-uniform PVA swelling upon hydration generates transient local normal and shear stresses at the interface. These stresses delaminate the tape within 3 minutes at room temperature while promoting adhesion of the nanodiamond array to the substrate. In contrast, conventional water-soluble tapes with composite structures undergo passive dissolution and collapse, causing residue contamination and reduced efficiency. Leveraging this mechanism, we achieve conformal patterning on ultra-soft hydrogels (~0.6 kPa) and highly curved bio-surfaces (hair, 100 \u03bcm^-1). Additionally, we demonstrate a dual-identity verification system integrating data storage and physical unclonable functions on a hydrogel contact lens.

The two dimensional Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ heterostructures that form the basis of these measurements are hexagonal in structure. We study the magnetic and structural properties of bulk Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ synthesized by quenching from 1000 $^{\\circ}$C with the goal of relating the magnetic, structural, and electronic properties. This quenched phase is metastable, hexagonal, and displays different magnetic properties from the slow-cooled and more thermodynamically stable monoclinic phase. High-resolution x-ray diffraction of the quenched hexagonal phase finds a first-order transition to a lower symmetry monoclinic phase on \\textit{heating} above $\\sim$ 550 K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of the quenched hexagonal phase reveal ferromagnetic ordering above room temperature, along with the two distinct transitions at $\\sim$ 220~K and $\\sim$ 70~K. Through neutron diffraction studies, we find the $\\sim$ 220 K anomaly is a spin reorientation transition of the ferromagnetically aligned magnetic moments and the $\\sim70$ K feature represents a transition from a high temperature ferromagnet to a low temperature antiferromagnet. We suggest that these magnetic transitions are related to changes in the unit cell dimensions and are connected to the temperature dependent Hall resisitivity studied in two-dimensional heterostructures.

The most commonly used model architectures are constrained to fulfill a number of physical laws exactly, from geometric symmetries to energy conservation. Evidence is mounting that relaxing some of these constraints can be beneficial to the efficiency and (somewhat surprisingly) accuracy of MLIPs, even though care should be taken to avoid qualitative failures associated with the breaking of physical symmetries. Given the recent trend of \\emph{scaling up} models to larger numbers of parameters and training samples, a very important question is how unconstrained MLIPs behave in this limit. Here we investigate this issue, showing that -- when trained on large datasets -- unconstrained models can be superior in accuracy and speed when compared to physically constrained models. We assess these models both in terms of benchmark accuracy and in terms of usability in practical scenarios, focusing on static simulation workflows such as geometry optimization and lattice dynamics. We conclude that accurate unconstrained models can be applied with confidence, especially since simple inference-time modifications can be used to recover observables that are consistent with the relevant physical symmetries.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal. More so, we show that there exists a sharp transition in computational quantum capacity from nearly maximal to zero when the channel complexity leaves the polynomial realm.

The PBD model represents DNA as a chain of nonlinearly coupled oscillators, which makes it possible to analyze the processes of melting and mechanical denaturation. The main focus is on cases where an external force is applied to the terminal or central site of a DNA molecule, simulating stretching at a constant rate.

Here we show that in individual carbon nanotube bundles exfoliated from highly conductive solution-spun fibers, different probes, including the field scales and magnitudes of WL and UCF and nonlocal magnetoconductance, lead to strikingly disparate estimates of coherence lengths. WL magnetoconductance measured in a perpendicular magnetic field yields a phase-coherence length of approximately 50 nm. In contrast, UCF amplitudes are comparable to e squared over h even for an 8 micrometer long segment, and nonlocal magnetoconductance persists across a 4 micrometer separation of electrodes, revealing phase-coherent transport over micrometer length scales within a single bundle. The coexistence of short- and long-range coherence implies that locally diffusive electrons remain partially phase-correlated among nanotubes within the same bundle.

Their sequence specificity is commonly summarized by a consensus binding motif. However, eukaryotic genomes contain billions of low-affinity DNA sequences to which TFs associate with a sequence-dependent binding energy. We currently lack insight into how the genomic sequence defines this spectrum of binding energies and the resulting pattern of TF localization. Here, we set out to obtain a quantitative understanding of sequence-dependent TF binding to both motif and non-motif sequences. We achieve this by first pursuing accurate measurements of physical binding energies of the human TF Klf4 to a library of short DNA sequences in a fluorescence-anisotropy-based bulk competitive binding assay. Second, we show that the highly non-linear sequence dependence of Klf4 binding energies can be captured by combining a linear model of binding energies with an Ising model of the coupled recognition of nucleotides by a TF. We find that this statistical mechanics model parametrized by our in vitro measurements captures Klf4 binding patterns on individual long DNA molecules stretched in the optical tweezer, and is predictive for Klf4 occupancy across the entire human genome without additional fit parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "We developed an integrated model to quantitatively predict TF binding patterns across the human genome based on binding energy measurements and sequence analysis.", "motivation": "Understanding how transcription factors bind to DNA is crucial for comprehending gene regulation and its implications in health and disease.", "method": "Our method involved (1) precise measurement of TF binding energies using a fluorescence-based assay, (2) combining these measurements with an Ising model to capture the non-linear sequence dependence, and (3) applying the model to predict TF occupancy across the genome.", "result": "We successfully captured the binding pattern of Klf4 on long DNA sequences and achieved precise genomic-level predictions of TF occupancy without additional parameters.", "conclusion": "This approach bridges in vitro binding measurements with in vivo genome-wide predictions, offering a powerful new tool for studying transcription factor dynamics."}}

These observations were interpreted as evidence for a direct link between superconductivity and the charge-transfer gap, and more broadly revived the long-standing question of the role of apical oxygens in cuprate superconductivity.

Here, we demonstrate that when the in-plane symmetry is rigorously kept, the transition can also be occurred, provided the out-of-plane asymmetry is designed, which is called \u03c3h -qBICs in this work. When the {\u03c3h symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes. This process not only enables controlled radiation coupling of BICs but also introduces a defect-immune qBIC regime.

This approach reveals how network topology shapes quantum dissipative dynamics, providing a basis for controlling quantum coherence through tailored network structures. Second, we propose a mean-field approach that extends the network to larger scales and captures dissipative dynamics in large-scale networks, connecting network topology to quantum coherence in complex systems and revealing the sensitivity of quantum coherence to network structure.

In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u6784\u9020(111)-\u671d\u5411\u76843d/5d\u754c\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba4\u6e29\u78c1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u78c1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u5ba4\u6e29\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u6784\u9020(111)-\u671d\u5411\u7684SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO)\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u548c\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u63ba\u6742\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u754c\u9762\u589e\u5f3a\u754c\u9762\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7535\u5b50\u5e73\u5747\u81ea\u7531\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d6\u6d88LSMO\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u52363d/5d\u754c\u9762\u7684\u6784\u9020\u548c\u671d\u5411\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a fast calculation algorithm for generating hologram data for holo-HMDs, which requires low computational power.

A fundamental open question is how constraints on check weight limit the achievable parameters of qLDPC codes. Here, we study stabilizer and subsystem codes with constrained check weight, combining analytical arguments with numerical optimization to establish strong upper bounds on their parameters. We show that stabilizer codes with checks of weight at most three cannot have nontrivial distance. We also prove tight tradeoffs between rate and distance for broad families of CSS stabilizer and subsystem codes with checks of weight at most four and two, respectively. Notably, our bounds are applicable to general qLDPC codes, as they rely only on check-weight constraints without assuming geometric locality or special graph connectivity. In the finite-size regime, we derive numerical upper bounds using linear programming techniques and identify explicit code constructions that approach these limits, delineating the landscape of practically relevant qLDPC codes with tens or hundreds of physical qubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), nanopillars are widely used to induce localized emission, yet the underlying confinement mechanism and the relative roles of strain versus dielectric environment remain unclear. The general problem addressed here is whether strain alone explains quantum emitter formation and placement in MoSe$_2$, or whether dielectric contrast at suspended-supported interfaces is also required. Here, we combine hyperspectral superlocalization of photoluminescence with co-registered AFM topography and phase to map the positions of localized states (LS) in MoSe$_2$ suspended on GaN pillars and correlate them with bending strain and the local dielectric context. Contrary to the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation, LS frequently occur at suspended--supported interfaces around the pillar apex and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold, while being scarce along high-strain ripples. Our data indicate that deterministic emitter positioning in Mo-based TMDs benefits from co-engineering both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity, rather than strain alone.

Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram.

We analyzed the tidal forces both for a static observer and for a radially infalling observer and showed that differences arise depending on the choice of observer. We used the tidal forces together with the stellar binding forces to determine the Roche radius for neutron stars, white dwarfs, and Sun-like stars, and to investigate how the Simpson--Visser regularization affects the tidal disruption of these astrophysical objects. We also examined whether, for astrophysical black holes such as M87* and Sgr~A*, these stellar disruption processes occur inside or outside the event horizon, and thus whether they are observable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Simpon-Visser\u9ed1\u6d1e\u56de\u58f0\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u4e0b\u5f15\u529b\u6495\u88c2\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u3001\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u9633-like\u6052\u661f\u7684\u7f57 Che\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f15\u529b\u6495\u88c2\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u88ab\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6495\u88c2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684 Astrophysics \u9886\u57df\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165 Simpon-Visser\u9ed1\u6d1e\u56de\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6495\u88c2\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6052\u661f\u6495\u88c2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6570\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9759\u6b62\u548c\u5f84\u5411\u4e0b\u843d\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6495\u88c2\u529b\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6052\u661f\u7684\u7f57 Che\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89c6\u754c\u5185\u5916\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6495\u88c2\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5404\u7c7b\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7f57 Che\u6781\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u529b\u6495\u88c2\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f4d\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89c6\u754c\u5185\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u88ab\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728 Simpon-Visser \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6495\u88c2\u529b\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6052\u661f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5982\u9ed1\u6d1e\u56de\u58f0\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u4ec5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u76f8\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Two distinct operational schemes are analyzed. A single frequency scheme employs cascaded second harmonic generation and inverse second harmonic generation (SHG/iSHG) using two Type-I SHG interactions, whereas a dual frequency scheme employs cascaded SHG and optical parametric amplification (SHG/OPA). Exact theoretical solutions and numerical calculations show cascadable amplification and digital on/off switching. A new optical phenomenon of nonlinear transparency is predicted by the theoretical solutions and confirmed by the numerical solutions in each scheme of the cascaded SHG/iSHG and SHG/OPA.

Our framework is designed to numerically determine a self-consistent pair of $\u03c1(\u03bb)$ and $w_n$ that simultaneously satisfies these two requirements. In the concrete implementation, we employ a least-squares method, for which no sign problem arises in principle, and therefore the method can be formally applied also to Minkowski-type models.

Given the diversity of atomic species, experimental modalities, and architectures, integrated optical modulators designed to operate across the visible to near-infrared spectrum are a key step towards portable, robust, and compact quantum computers, clocks, and sensors. Integrated optical modulators that are wavelength-independent, CMOS-compatible, and capable of maintaining low waveguide losses and a high resonator quality factor, DC-coupled broadband frequency response, and low power consumption, are essential for scalable photonic integration. Yet progress towards these goals has remained limited. Here we demonstrate four types of integrated stress-optic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) silicon nitride modulators: a coil Mach-Zehnder modulator, a coil pure phase modulator, and bus-coupled and add-drop ring resonator modulators, with operation from 493 nm to 780 nm. The coil MZM operates at 532 nm with a V$\u03c0$ of 2.8V, a 0.4 MHz 3-dB bandwidth, and an extinction ratio of 21.5dB. The coil phase modulator operates at 493 nm with a V$\u03c0$ of 2.8V and low residual amplitude modulation of -34 dB at a 1kHz offset. The bus-coupled ring resonator modulator operates at 493 nm and the add-drop ring resonator modulator operates at 780 nm. The ring-based modulators have an intrinsic quality factor of 3.4 million and 1.9 million, a linear tuning strength of 0.9 GHz/V and 1 GHz/V, and a 3-dB bandwidth of 2.6 MHz and 10 MHz, respectively. All four modulator designs maintain the low optical waveguide loss of SiN, are DC coupled with broadband frequency response, operate independent of wavelength, and consume only tens of nW per actuator. Such solutions unlock the potential for further integration with other precision SiN components to realize chip-scale atomic and quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, the silicon vacancy hosts an S=3/2 ground state, a native qudit that enables compact encodings and subspace-selective control, but also introduces spectator transitions: short, detuned pulses can coherently drive non-addressed level pairs and create crosstalk. Here we use broadband Ramsey interferometry to reveal and quantify such spectator-transition crosstalk. Experimentally, the Ramsey Fourier spectra display multiple lines beyond the addressed single-quantum transition. Analytically, we map each line to a pairwise energy difference between qudit levels of the rotating-frame Hamiltonian and assign its weight via compact amplitudes set by the prepared state and the microwave pulse parameters, predicting a deterministic six-branch structure. Numerical time-domain propagation with the experimental sampling reproduces the detuning map, and the measured peak positions coincide with the analytic branch lines without frequency fitting. Together these results provide a practical, spectator-aware framework for multilevel control in the silicon vacancy qudit.

Despite these advantages, achieving low-loss fabrication of monolithic microrings on the Ta2O5 platform remains challenging due to its inherent hardness and brittleness, which often result in rough sidewalls and significant scattering losses. In this work, we successfully demonstrated monolithic Ta2O5 microring resonators with exceptionally high intrinsic and loaded quality (Q) factors. This was accomplished through the innovative application of photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technology. By optimizing the coupling region between the microring and the bus waveguide, as well as meticulously controlling surface roughness during fabrication, we achieved near-critical coupling in the resulting microrings. The devices exhibited loaded Q factors of 2.74X10(6) in the telecom band without employing expensive electron-beam lithography, showing an intrinsic Q factor as high as 4.47X10(6) and a low propagation loss of only 0.0732 dB/cm - representing the highest results reported for strongly confined Ta2O5-based microring resonators to date.

Statistical descriptors of nine polarization characteristics formed a 72-dimensional feature vector for a total of 296 fibers spanning six material classes, including polyamide 6, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide 6.6, polypropylene, cotton and wool. The designed fully connected deep neural network achieved an accuracy of 96.7 % on the validation data, surpassing that of common machine-learning classifiers. Explainable artificial intelligence analysis with Shapley additive explanations identified eigenvalue-ratio quantities as dominant predictors, revealing the physical basis for classification.

Using tensor networks, we construct circuits composed solely of nearest-neighbor gates and extract time-evolution data by four-type circuit measurements. In addition, to enhance the accuracy of time-evolution and state-preparation circuits, we propose techniques based on algorithmic error mitigation and on iterative circuit optimization combined with merging into matrix product states, respectively. Verifications using a noiseless simulator for the 8-qubit one-dimensional Hubbard model using an ancilla qubit show that the proposed algorithm achieves accuracies with 0.4--4.7\\% error from a true energy gap on an appropriate time-step size, and that accuracy improvements due to the algorithmic error mitigation are observed. We also confirm the enhancement of the overlap with matrix product states through iterative optimization. Finally, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on IBM Heron devices with Q-CTRL error suppression for 8-, 36-, and 52-qubit models using more than 5,000 2-qubit gates.

The ZK equation admits three scalar conserved quantities -- mass, momentum, and energy -- represented as $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, as well as a vector-valued quantity $\\bm{I}_4$. In high-accuracy numerical simulations on a finite double-periodic domain, most of these quantities are well preserved, while a systematic temporal drift is observed only in the $x$-component $I_{4x}$. We show that the nontrivial evolution of $I_{4x}$ originates from an explicit boundary-flux contribution, which is induced by fluctuations of the solution and its spatial derivatives at the domain boundaries. We successfully identify the source of the inaccuracy in the numerical solutions. Motivated by this analysis, we define a modified center-of-mass quantity $I_{4x}^{\\mathrm{mod}}$ and demonstrate its conservation numerically for single-pulse configurations. The modified quantity thus provides a consistent conservation law for the ZK equation and yields an appropriate description of center-of-mass motion in finite-domain numerical simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates conservation laws of the ZK equation and identifies the source of numerical errors.", "motivation": "Understanding conservation laws and improving numerical methods for PDEs are important areas in mathematical physics.", "method": "The authors analyze the ZK equation using symmetry and numerical simulations to identify quantity drifts.", "result": "Conserved quantities almost preserved, but drift detected in one component, linked to boundary effects.", "conclusion": "The study highlights the importance of boundary conditions in maintaining conservation laws numerically and suggests modifications to improve accuracy."}}

In lithium niobate waveguides, nonlinear optical processes are often limited by the so-called photorefractive effect, which limits the maximum input or output powers and impacts the nonlinear spectral response. Therefore, strategies for the management of photorefractive damage are a key consideration in device design. Usually, the photorefractive damage threshold, i.e. the maximal permissible operating power, can be increased by high temperature operation of devices. This approach, however, is not applicable in cryogenic environments, which may be required for specialized applications. To better understand the impact of photorefraction in nonlinear optical applications, we study the impact of photorefraction on the phase-matching spectra of two nonlinear-optical sum-frequency generation experiments at 1) high temperatures and 2) cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we present an approach to reduce the impact of photorefraction which is compatible with cryogenic operation. This comprises an auxiliary light source, propagating in the same waveguide, which is used to restore phase-matching spectra impacted by photorefraction, as well as reduce pyroelectric effects. Our work provides an alternative route to photorefraction management applicable to cryogenic environments, as well as in situations with tight energy budgets like space applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u996e\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u81f4\u76f8\u53d8\uff08PDL\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u660e\u4eae\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u5cf0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f85\u52a9\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6b64\u5f71\u54cd", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u80cc\u666f\uff1a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5149\u81f4\u76f8\u53d8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u89c2\u5bdf\u76f8\u53d8\u5cf0\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f85\u52a9\u5149\u6e90\u4ee5\u8865\u507f\u76f8\u53d8\u6548\u679c", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0PDL\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u53d8\u5cf0\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u5149\u6e90\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f8\u53d8\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e cryogenic \u73af\u5883\u7684\u5149\u81f4\u76f8\u53d8\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b49\u53d7\u9650\u5e94\u7528\u60c5\u5883"}}

Nikitin"], "title": "Size-dependent Dielectric Permittivity of Perovskite Nanocrystals", "comment": "29 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising building blocks for quantum photonic devices. Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed.

However, its practical deployment for real-world applications has been limited by architectures that rely on delicate wavelength management or phase-sensitive coherent detection. Here, we demonstrate the first multimode opto-electronic neural network (MOENN) on a silicon-on-insulator platform. By utilizing orthogonal waveguide eigenmodes as independent information carriers, our architecture achieves robust single-wavelength computation that is inherently immune to spectral crosstalk and phase noise. The fabricated MOENN chip monolithically integrates all functional components, including input encoders, programmable mode-division fan-in/-out units, and most importantly, the nonlinear multimode activation functions.

We prove that this smoothness implies the splitting of an initially localized excitation into counter-propagating wave packets. Consequently, unsplit spreading can occur only when $\u03c9(k)$ develops singular features, precisely what long-range interactions enable. Remarkably, this phenomenon was clearly visible in published quantum simulation experiments as early as 2014, yet it has remained unrecognized or discussed as a distinct physical effect. We show that unsplit spreading emerges in realistic open quantum systems, such as 1D and 2D subwavelength atomic arrays, where the long-lived subradiant states host effective dispersion with the required singularities. Our work establishes unsplit spreading as an experimentally accessible, smoking-gun signature of singular band structure induced by long-range physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Conventional lattice models assume smooth dispersion relations, which lead to wave packets splitting upon excitation. However, unsplit spreading can only occur if the dispersion relation develops singular features, which arise from long-range interactions. This phenomenon was observed in quantum simulation experiments but not recognized. The conclusion is that unsplit spreading is a distinct physical effect with experimentally accessible signatures in realistic open quantum systems. The paper highlights that singular band structures, induced by long-range physics, serve as a basis for identifying this effect. This bears profound implications for future experimental explorations of 1D/2D subwavelength atomic arrays and related systems.

The paper presents new perspectives and experimental implications that weren't discussed before. It also provides significant insights that can provoke further studies. The researcher achieved the goal of detection and explanation in an experimental context. The reasoning in this work is solid, and the conclusion is reasonable given the importance of magnon and phonon dispersion.

The analysis of the findings presents a convincing explanation with practical relevance to experiments, which makes sense.", "method": "The methodology used in this paper starts with theoretical analysis. Specifically, the authors proved mathematically that smoothness in dispersion relations leads to wave packet splitting, and only dispersion with singularities can prevent this splitting. This is done using Hamiltonian models in conventional lattice systems and then extending it to realistic open quantum systems such as 1D and 2D subwavelength atomic arrays. The singular band structures that develop experimentally in these systems are connected to the presence of long-range interactions. The authors conclude that the phenomena observed in quantum simulation experiments in 2014 indicate singular dispersion in real systems, suggesting that unsplit spreading happens in realistic systems. The paper uses a combination of analytical approaches and experiments to analyze the dispersion and spreading behaviors.", "result": "The key contributions of this paper are:1) Analyzing conventional lattice models and identifying smoothness-induced wavepacket splitting; 2) Demonstrating that unsplit spreading can emerge only when dispersion develops singular features, linked to long-range interactions; 3) Highlighting that these singularities occur in realistic open quantum systems like 1D and 2D subwavelength atomic arrays; 4) Presenting supported experimental evidence of unsplit spreading with subradiant states; 5) Establishing unsplit spreading as a clear signature in singular band structures, serving as an accessible experimentally verifiable phenomenon. These findings resolve the long-standing question of why unsplit spreading was observed but not recognized and establish it as a broad and unique phenomenon with practical experimental and fundamental implications.", "conclusion": "The paper explores conventional models and reveals that the smoothness assumption leads to wave packet splitting. By developing singular dispersion features through long-range physics, unsplit spreading becomes possible. This had been observed in 2014 quantum simulations but was not recognized. The researchers identify realistic systems like 1D and 2D subwavelength atomic arrays with long-lived subradiant states as hosts for effective dispersion with singularities, enabling unsplit spreading. The paper concludes that singular band structures are a distinguishing signature of this effect, offering experimental accessibility. This is a promising candidate for identifying new physics in many realistic lattice systems with nontrivial topology and geometry. The work builds a bridge between theory and experiment, validating the idea that novel physics can emerge from both mathematics and experiments."}}

We investigated the MaxCut problem in three different families of graphs using QAOA ansats with parameter transfer initialization followed by targeted single layer optimization. For 3 regular (3R), Erdos Renyi (ER), and Barabasi Albert (BA) graphs, the parameter transfer approach achieved mean approximation ratios of 0.9443 for targeted-single layer optimization as compared to 0.9551 of full optimization. It represents 98.88 percent optimal performance, with 8.06 times computational speedup in unweighted graphs. But, in weighted graph families, optimal performance is relatively low (less than 90 percent) for higher nodes graph, suggesting parameter transfer followed by targeted-single-layer optimization is not ideal for weighted graph families, however, we find that for some weighted families (weighted 3-regular) this approach works perfectly. In 8.92 percent test cases, targeted single layer optimization outperformed the full optimization, indicating that complex parameter landscape can trap full optimization in sub-optimal local minima. To mitigate this inconsistency, ridge (L2) regularization is used to smoothen the solution landscape, which helps the optimizer to find better optimum parameters during full optimization and reduces these inconsistent test cases from 8.92 percent to 3.81 percent. This work demonstrates that efficient parameter initialization and targeted-single-layer optimization can improve the efficiency of QAOA with minimal performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We prove that the truncation error admits an average-case bound without assuming randomness, provided that the state is sufficiently entangled. Counterintuitively, entanglement--usually an obstacle for classical simulation--alleviates classical simulation error. We further show that such entangled states can be generated either by tensor-network classical simulation or near-term quantum devices.

The presence of doublers carries over to the `second quantised' version of the walks represented by quantum cellular automata, which may lead to spurious solutions when introducing interactions. Moreover, we also consider pseudo-doublers, which have high energy but behave like low energy Dirac particles, and cause potential problems regarding the stability of the vacuum. To address these issues, we propose a family of quantum walks, that are free of these doublers and pseudo-doublers, but still simulate the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, there remain a small number of additional low energy solutions which do not directly correspond to Dirac particles.

While most automated optimization techniques focus on transforming circuits into equivalent ones that implement the same unitary, we show that substantial new opportunities for resource reduction can be achieved by (1) allowing approximate local transformations and (2) employing mixed quantum channels to approximate pure circuits. Our novel automated protocol for approximate circuit rewriting is a refined evolution of automated optimization techniques based on the ZX-calculus, where we add a greedy strategy that selectively replaces ZX-diagrams with small phase angles with stochastic mixtures of the identity and carefully chosen over-rotations, which are designed to reduce the overall gate count in expectation while staying within a strict error budget.

Most prior studies have focused on imperfections in quantum states and operations. Here, we investigate the effect of coarse graining in quantum measurement through both theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration. Using an interferometer with a squeezed vacuum and a laser input, we analyze how coarse graining in homodyne detection affects the precision of phase estimation. We evaluate the Fisher information under various coarse-graining conditions and determine, in each case, an optimal estimation strategy that saturates the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound. Remarkably, even extremely coarse-grained measurement -- with only two bins -- enables phase estimation beyond the standard quantum limit and even achieves a precision that follows the Heisenberg scaling. We experimentally demonstrate quantum-enhanced phase estimation under coarse-grained homodyne detection. To determine an optimal estimation strategy, we employ the method of moments and present calibration procedures that enable its application to general experimental settings. Using only two bins, we observe a quantum enhancement of 1.2 dB compared to the classical method using the ideal measurement, improving towards 3.8 dB as the bin number increases. These results highlight a practical pathway to achieving quantum enhancement under the presence of severe experimental imperfections.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quantum metrology can surpass classical limits in measurement precision, but it's often affected by experimental imperfections. Previous studies focused on state and operation imperfections. This paper explores the effect of coarse graining in quantum measurement through theoretical and experimental analysis. They used an interferometer with a squeezed vacuum and a laser input to analyze how coarse graining in homodyne detection affects phase estimation precision. They evaluated Fisher information under various coarse-graining conditions and determined an optimal estimation strategy that saturates the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound. They found that even extremely coarse-grained measurement\u2014with only two bins\u2014enables phase estimation beyond the standard quantum limit and achieves precision following Heisenberg scaling. They experimentally demonstrated quantum-enhanced phase estimation under coarse-grained homodyne detection and presented calibration procedures for determining optimal estimation strategies. Results show significant quantum enhancement, up to 3.8 dB with increased bin numbers. This opens a practical pathway for achieving quantum enhancement under severe experimental imperfections.", "motivation": " Metrology has become a critical area of research, particularly in quantum mechanics, where achieving measurement precision beyond classical limits is essential. However, practical limitations such as experimental imperfections often restrict the effectiveness of these advanced quantum techniques. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the impact of coarse graining\u2014a common experimental imperfection\u2014on quantum measurement strategies, aiming to find methods that can still achieve quantum enhancements despite these limitations.", "method": "The authors employed an interferometer with a squeezed vacuum and a laser input to study phase estimation under coarse-grained homodyne detection. They used the Fisher information method to evaluate the precision of phase estimation and determined optimal strategies by saturating the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound. The method involved numerical simulations and experimental setups, requiring careful calibration procedures to ensure accurate analysis of measurement outcomes under varying levels of coarse graining.", "result": "The key results reveal that even with minimal coarse graining\u2014such as only two measurement bins\u2014the authors achieved significant quantum enhancement in phase estimation. The Fisher information analysis showed that the optimal estimation strategies effectively compensated for coarse graining, and the experimental outcomes confirmed these theoretical predictions. Notably, the phase estimation precision followed Heisenberg scaling even with coarse measurements, demonstrating resilience to experimental imperfections. Additionally, experiments revealed an improvement of up to 3.8 dB in quantum enhancement as more bins were used, indicating a scalable solution for practical quantum metrology applications.", "conclusion": "This work provides a practical pathway for achieving quantum-enhanced metrology under the presence of experimental imperfections, particularly coarse graining. By optimizing estimation strategies and leveraging Fisher information analysis, it is feasible to maintain quantum advantages even when measurements are coarse. The demonstrated techniques and calibration procedures open new possibilities for robust quantum metrology in realistic experimental setups, significantly advancing the field towards practical applications."}}

While Shor's algorithm demands high-fidelity quantum gates, Hamiltonian optimization schemes, with prime factors encoded as degenerate ground states of a problem Hamiltonian, generally require substantial classical post-processing to determine control parameters. We propose an all-quantum, measurement-based feedback approach that iteratively steers a quantum system toward the target ground state, eliminating the need for classical computation of drive parameters once the problem Hamiltonian is determined and realized. As a proof of principle, we experimentally factor the biprime 551 using a three-qubit NMR quantum register and numerically analyze the robustness of the method against control field-errors. We further demonstrate scalability by numerically implementing the FALQON factorization of larger biprimes, 9,167 and 2,106,287, using 5 and 9 qubits, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We then extend the same separation to discrete time for general stable multimode bosonic Gaussian channels: for any stable Gaussian channel, we construct an explicit Gaussian similarity transformation that gauges away diffusion at the level of the channel parametrization.

In this work we introduce a pipeline by which \\emph{any} finite, ergodic HMM can be compressed in this manner, providing a route for effective quantum dimension reduction of general HMMs. We demonstrate the method on both a simple toy model, and on a speech-derived HMM trained from data, obtaining favourable memory--accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u91cf\u5b50\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff08QHMMs\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u6709\u9650\u7684\u3001\u904d\u5386\u7684HMM\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff08HMMs\uff09\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790HMM\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u538b\u7f29QHMMs\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29 pipeline\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u6709\u9650\u7684\u3001\u904d\u5386\u7684HMM\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u73a9\u5177\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u7684HMM\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u5b58-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86QHMMs\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We prove that both converge in polynomial time for several non-commuting systems, including high-temperature local lattices, weakly interacting fermions, and 1D spin chains.

Focusing on zero-energy eigenstates at infinite temperature, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy $k$-body microscopic thermal equilibrium for any $k\\ge4$. We further show that this bound is tight by explicitly constructing two-body nonintegrable Hamiltonians whose stabilizer eigenstates reproduce thermal expectation values for all two-body and all three-body observables.

Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions.
