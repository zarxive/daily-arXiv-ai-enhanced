Motivation: Understanding quantum spin-orbit coupling is crucial for advancing fields like quantum computing and materials science, where such effects play a key role.

Method: Paper employs Hamilton's action principle applied to the Pauli equation, analyzing both existing and new force terms that contribute to spin-orbit interactions.

Result: Two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations are identified. The framework is validated using the Madelung-Rashba equations and can be implemented numerically.

Conclusion: This work provides new theoretical tools to analyze and predict spin-orbit coupling phenomena, opening avenues for further research and applications.

Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.
