However, direct experimental observations of interfacial thermal conductance across molecular junctions have remained challenging due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required for probing. Here, we report dynamic energy transport processes across multi-component molecular junctions observed at the atomic level by employing reflection ultrafast electron diffraction. A clear temporal sequence of energy transfer is revealed at early times following photoexcitation of Au(111) surfaces chemically bonded with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols: from the gold surface layer (SL) to the head groups of a SAM and then to the CH2-CH2 methylene lattice. Remarkably, the structural dynamics of the gold SL differ significantly from those of clean gold. Furthermore, the methylene lattice dynamics exhibit chain-length insensitivity but with a length-dependent retention time to reach full thermalization. Quantitatively, we find an agreement in the increased out-of-plane atomic motions between the surface gold atoms and the SAM methylene units, signifying the nature of motion-based coupling for interfacial energy transport. High interfacial thermal conductance (~300 MW/m^2/K) and high thermal conductivity for the methylene lattice (~60 W/m/K) are obtained under the condition of impulsive heating, which provide strong support for previous room-temperature theoretical predictions and also the ballistic nature of intrachain heat transfer. This time- and spatially-resolved experimental approach will enable future quantitative assessment of interfacial energy transport across solid-molecule junctions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\u5206\u5b50\u63a5\u679d\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u8d85\u5feb\u7535\u5b50\u884d\u5c04\u5728\u539f\u5b50 Resolution \u4e0b\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u63a5\u679d\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u5149\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002AU(111)\u8868\u9762\u88ab\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\uff08\u5982\u7532\u70f7\u786b\uff09\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ece\u91d1\u5c5e\u5c42\u2192\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u2192\u7a7a\u5355\u5143\u9635\u5217\u3002agnetic dynamics\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6e29\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5219\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5728\u6e29\u5347\u611f\u6d4b\u4e0b\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728 Molecular junctions \u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u754c\u9762\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u662f\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002 AU(111)\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u63a5\u679d\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u70ed\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u7406\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u5c04\u8d85\u5feb\u7535\u5b50\u884d\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u5149\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0b\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u7387\u548c\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u52a0\u70ed\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5ba4\u6e29\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u5b8c\u7f8e\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u79bb\u57df\u52bf\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u94fe\u5f0f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u5c42\u5728\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u6253\u4e0b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

A key strategy for addressing this challenge which effectively leverages current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardwares yet remains under-benchmarked is active space selection. We introduce a benchmark that heuristically proposes criteria based on chemically grounded metrics to classify the suitability of a molecule for using quantum computing and then quantifies the impact of active space choices across the VQE pipeline for quantum drug discovery. The suite covers several representative drug-like molecules (e.g., lovastatin, oseltamivir, morphine) and uses chemically motivated active spaces. Our VQE evaluations employ both simulation and quantum processing unit (QPU) execution using unitary coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) and hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA). We adopt a more comprehensive evaluation, including chemistry metrics and architecture-centric metrics. For accuracy, we compare them with classical quantum chemistry methods.

We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The analysis progresses to wavelength-modulation spectroscopy (WMS), highlighting its advantages in noise rejection and robustness in harsh environments.

In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response.

It is known that exciting massive fields with the Unruh thermal bath is heavily suppressed when the field's rest energy is much larger than the acceleration energy scale, $Mc^2 \\gg\\hbar a/c$. However, the standard literature lacks an explicit quantitative derivation of this suppression. In this work, we first fill this gap by deriving the exponential suppression, $\\sim \\exp(-\\text{constant}\\times Mc^2/(\\hbar a/c))$, in two different frameworks: a (3+1)-dimensional Unruh-DeWitt detector and a (1+1)-dimensional cavity QED setup. This shows the suppression is universal and sets an insurmountable barrier for any detection method that relies on exciting massive fields. For an electron-mass field at achievable accelerations ($a \\sim 10^{20}$ m/s$^2$), the suppression exceeds $10^9$ orders of magnitude. To avoid this suppression, the field's rest energy must be less than or of the order of the acceleration energy scale, $M c^2 \\lesssim \\hbar a / c$. Achieving this condition, however, requires astronomically high accelerations. For example, detecting the effect for an electron-mass field would require accelerations of $a \\gtrsim 4.6\\times 10^{29}$ m/s$^2$, which is far beyond experimental reach. While using a massless field avoids this suppression, we show the best strategy is not to avoid mass, but to engineer a small effective mass that satisfies the optimal condition $\\hbar a / c \\gg M_{\\text{eff}} c^2$. We propose a concrete implementation using a superconducting circuit with a Josephson persistent-current qubit (the analog of a UDW detector) coupled to a microwave resonator (the analog of the scalar field). For this system, the optimal condition is $2I_p\u0394\u03a6\\gg \u0394$, where $I_p$ is the persistent current, $\u0394\u03a6$ is the magnetic flux swing, and $\u0394$ is the qubit's tunneling energy gap....", "AI": {"tldr": "Detecting the Unruh effect is extremely challenging due to exponential suppression, making it practically undetectable for massive fields under current experimental conditions.

This asymmetry arises because laser field is frequency-chirped not only during the free-evolution intervals of atoms, but also during the Ramsey pulses. As a result, the effective detuning from the working atomic transition during the pulses also depends on the chirping rate, which, in turn, leads to the lineshape-asymmetry-caused shift (LACS). It is shown that this shift has an inverse cubic dependence of $\\propto 1/T^3$ on the duration of the interval between the Ramsey pulses $T$, which markedly contrasts with the $\\propto 1/T^2$ dependence typical in atomic interferometry. Therefore, the metrological importance of this shift substantially increases for compact atomic interferometers with a short baseline. For example, for interferometers-gravimeters using two-photon transitions in rubidium atoms, at $T\\sim 1$~ms we estimate the LACS shift and its variations at the level of 0.1-1~mGal, while for $T\\sim 100$~$\u03bc$s this can reach a value of 0.1-1~Gal.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper discusses the shift in atomic interferometers caused by asymmetry in laser spectroscopic lineshapes.

Leveraging insights from natural language processing, we show that our transformer-based architecture predicts the correct molecule with 55.2% accuracy within the first 15 predictions using only the $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra, thus overcoming the combinatorial growth of the chemical space while also being extensible to experimental data via fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef41H\u548c13C NMR\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u8131 novo\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe55.2%\uff0c overturns \u56fa\u6709\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u786e\u5b9a\u662f\u6709\u673a\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u76ee\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "method": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u6574\u67b6\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572815\u6761\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u768455.2%\u6b63\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Such gamma-ray sources have long been anticipated by the scientific community, as they promise new powerful tools for the study of high-energy physical phenomena and the development of novel nuclear technologies. In such devices, a piezoelectric transducer induces tens of MHz harmonic waves inside a silicon monocrystal. Ultra-relativistic charged particles traversing the crystal get trapped within the channels formed by the extremely strong electric fields of the acoustically modulated lattice planes, undergoing undulation and emitting gamma radiation. Precise characterization of the acoustic field in the crystal is crucial for the determination of the expected characteristics of the secondarily generated gamma rays. For this purpose, fast laser refraction imaging is used here to image the acoustic waves by exploiting the spatial redistribution of a laser beam optical intensity caused by the acoustic field. A dedicated computational model is developed for the estimation of the spatial distribution of the pressure and lattice deformation inside the crystal. This methodology provides a framework for future novel gamma-ray sources in high-energy facilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By decomposing the response into contributions from different multi-photon resonant processes, we systematically study the dependence of excited-carrier density and absorbed energy on key pump-pulse parameters: duration, amplitude, and photon energy. Our results reveal a complex interplay between these parameters, governed by resonant Rabi-like dynamics and competition between different multi-photon absorption channels.

In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the \"modulated wiggle well,\" which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility.

We search both for seconds-scale burst-like emission, primarily from fundamental (f-)mode oscillations, and for longer quasi-monochromatic transients up to four months in duration, primarily from quasi-static quadrupolar deformations. We find no significant detection candidates, but for the first time we set direct observational upper limits on gravitational strain amplitude that are stricter than what can be indirectly inferred from the overall glitch energy scale.

A systematic inverse-volume expansion allows us to derive the four-dimensional off-shell potential in the presence of warping and non-ISD 3-form fluxes. This corresponds to integrating out all massive Kaluza-Klein modes using the ten-dimensional equations of motion. We further propose a warped K\u00e4hler potential in four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity, and show that it is consistent with our ten-dimensional results. In the KKLT framework, we find that classical warping corrections, as well as mixed corrections involving non-ISD fluxes and quantum effects, are dominant, rendering the scenario effectively uncontrollable with current methods. By contrast, in LVS-like constructions these corrections are suppressed by inverse powers of the volume, specifically $\\mathcal{V}^{1/2}$ or $\\mathcal{V}^{1/6}$, depending on the concrete model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u578b IIB \u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u5bf9\u5176\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u4e86 F \u9879\u7684\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u9006\u4f53\u79ef\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u542b\u975e ISD 3-\u5f62\u5f0f\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u56db\u7ef4\u975e\u58f3\u5c42\u52bf\u88ab\u6c42\u5f97\u3002\u8be5\u52bf\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u79ef\u5206\u6240\u6709\u9ad8\u6a21\u5143\u5f97\u6765\u7684\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u9006\u4f53\u79ef\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u56db\u7ef4 N=1 \u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u8d85\u5f15\u529b K\u00e4hler \u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5728 KKLT \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u6d89\u53ca\u975e ISD \u78c1\u573a\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879brace err \u7ea6\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6574\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u800c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e LVS \u7684\u6784\u9020\u4e2d\u5219\u88ab\u6162\u5316\u6216\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u88ab\u9006\u4f53\u79ef\u56e0\u5b50\u660e\u663e\u6291\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u578b IIB \u7406\u8bba\u5728\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5bf9\u52bf\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u4f46\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728 KKLT \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6b64\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u540c\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9006\u4f53\u79ef\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5728\u5341\u7ef4\u65b9\u7a0b\u7269\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u6c42\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u7ef4\u975e\u58f3\u5c42\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Warping \u6539\u6b63\u9879\u3002\u968f\u540e\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8d85\u5f15\u529b K\u00e4hler \u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5341\u7ef4\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83 KKLT \u548c LVS \u6784\u9020\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u524d\u8005\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u5bf9\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u540e\u8005\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u578b IIB \u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u9006\u4f53\u79ef\u5c55\u5f00\u7684 warped K\u00e4hler \u52bf\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u6a21\u6570\u53e0\u52a0\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e0e KKLT \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cLVS \u578b\u6784\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u4f1a\u88ab\u6297 bg \u5206\u9694\u6d88\u9664\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bd4\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5747\u4f4d\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u578b IIB \u7406\u8bba\u4e2d warping \u66f4\u6b63\u5bf9\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728 KKLT \u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728 LVS \u578b\u6784\u9020\u4e2d\u5219\u76f8\u5bf9\u53ef\u63a7\u3002\u8fd9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6784\u9020\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u89e3\u9664\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We prove that the classical integrable cases of the heavy top--spherical, Lagrange, Kovalevskaya, and Goryachev-Chaplygin--correspond precisely to degenerate curvature signatures of this field, namely isotropic, orthogonally split, and symmetric-pair signatures. This yields a geometric necessary and sufficient condition for Liouville integrability: the geodesic flow (and the heavy top with axis-symmetric potential) is integrable if and only if the curvature signature is degenerate. Beyond the classical list, the atlas reveals a balanced-mixed regime (inertia ratio 2:2:1) that, while non-integrable, admits an exact curvature-balance relation and a family of pure-precession solutions. We formulate a curvature deviation functional quantifying the distance to integrability, describe near-integrable dynamics near the 2:2:1 regime, and present a complete integrability map in the plane of inertia ratios.

While much is known about their individual swimming dynamics, our understanding of their transport properties at the population level remains limited. This is primarily due to the experimental challenges associated with tracking, in three dimensions and under flow, a large sample of these microorganisms. Here we investigate, through fast digital holographic microscopy (DHM), a suspension of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 bacteria in a confined Poiseuille flow. Based on the analysis of several thousand Lagrangian trajectories, we first demonstrate the ability of DHM to discriminate between the fraction of bacteria that adhere to walls, those that are only convected by the flow, and those for which motility helps them migrate through the channel and cross streamlines. Focusing on the motile part of the population, we report new experimental results concerning the spatial and orientational distributions across the confinement direction. In the central part of the flow, migration and shear trapping are observed and well described by existing kinetic models. Close to the walls, averaging over the entire motile population clearly shows an accumulation layer but with no net orientational order, which contradicts models that neglect hydrodynamic interactions with solid surfaces. We think that DHM coupled with the analysis of large-scale bacterial populations will help to understand their transfer mechanisms from the bulk to surfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u80a0\u6746\u83cc\u5728\u6709\u7f1d\u6d41\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u901f\u6570\u5b57\u5168\u606f\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u6c99\u66fcella oneidensis\u76841000\u591a\u6b21\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9644\u7740\u7387\u3001\u7eaf\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u83cc\u7fa4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e0d\u540c\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6d41\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u4e49\u91cd\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u901f\u6570\u5b57\u5168\u606f\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u7ec6\u83cc\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6d41\u52a8\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u526a\u5207\u6355\u83b7\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u79bb\u58c1\u8f83\u8fd1\u5904\u5219\u51fa\u73b0 accumulate\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5168\u606f\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7814\u7a76\u7ec6\u83cc\u5728\u6709\u7f1d\u6d41\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Applying EOMC to the Lorenz-96 dynamical system (a very popular model of a simplified atmosphere dynamics)in chaotic and strongly-chaotic regimes reveals that its dynamics is essentially described by a metastable regime-switching process, making infrequent transitions between the very persistent three-dimensional attractive manifolds. The dimensionality of these manifolds appears to remain unchanged, and their overall number gradually grows with the growing external forcing of the Lorenz-96 model. At the same time, the Markovian mean exit times and relaxation times (that bound the predictability horizons for the identified regime-switching process) appear to decrease only very slowly with the growing external forcing - indicating approximately two-fold longer prediction horizons then is currently anticipated based on analysis of positive Lyapunov exponents for this system, even in very chaotic model regimes. It is also demonstrated that when applied for a lossy compression of the Lorenz-96 output data in various forcing regimes, EOMC achieves several orders of magnitude smaller compression loss - when compared to the common PCA-related linear compression approaches that build a backbone of the state-of-the-art lossy data compression tools (like JPEG, MP3, and others).

Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting.

First, we present a way of implementing fold-transversal operations on Floquet codes in order to yield logical Hadamard and S gates. And second, we present a way of implementing logical CNOT gates on Floquet codes via Dehn twists. We discuss the requirements for these techniques, and show that they are applicable to a wide family of Floquet codes defined on colour code lattices. Through numerical benchmarking of the logical operations on the CCS Floquet code, we establish a logical-gate threshold of 0.25-0.35% and verify sub-threshold exponential error suppression.

This thermodynamic view underlies diverse theoretical frameworks -- from autopoiesis and relational biology to autocatalytic sets and hypercycles -- yet dissipation is typically treated as a necessary consequence of living organization rather than as a property shaped by its internal dynamics. Here, through explicit calculations of biotic chemical reactions and empirical documentation, we show that living systems universally function as non-normal chemical accelerators. Their elevated entropy production emerges from the asymmetric and hierarchical architecture of their biochemical networks. We introduce a general conceptual and mathematical framework in which biological structuration is understood as a dynamical property. Characterized by asymmetric couplings and transient amplification despite asymptotic stability, non-normal dynamics are shown to naturally generate kinetic acceleration, enhanced energy throughput, and phase-transition-like reorganizations without classical bifurcations. In this view, biological organization is not merely compatible with dissipation but actively structured to amplify free-energy flux and entropy export. We support this perspective with empirical and theoretical evidence that biochemical networks generically give rise to intrinsically non-normal operators through non-reciprocal interactions and hierarchical design. This framework yields testable predictions for dissipation rates, robustness, and evolutionary design principles, and suggests a kinetic principle of evolution in which living systems preferentially construct increasingly non-normal reaction architectures, driving sustained amplification of chemical fluxes and entropy flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u547d\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u6301\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f53\u73b0\u4e3a\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u547d\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ef4\u6301\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u5e8f\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u5b66\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u901a\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u7c7b\u4f3c\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5bb9\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7f51\u7edc\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u52a8\u548c\u71b5\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u597d\u6784\u5efa\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u7684\u4ee3\u8c22\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u71b5\u6d41\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u5f3a\u3002"}}

The algorithm which we use for computing CLVs is the one developed by Ginelli and collaborators (G&C), which is quite efficient and has been used previously in many numerical investigations. Using two low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems as toy models, we develop a method for measuring the convergence rates of vectors and subspaces computed via the G&C algorithm, and we use the time it takes for this convergence to occur to determine the appropriate transient time lengths needed when applying this algorithm to compute CLVs. The tangent dynamics of the centre subspace of the H\u00e9non-Heiles system is investigated numerically through the use of CLVs, and we propose a method that improves the accuracy of the centre subspace computed with the G&C algorithm. As another application of the method of CLVs to the H\u00e9non-Heiles system, we find that the splitting subspaces (which form a splitting of the tangent space and define the CLVs) become almost tangent during sticky regimes of motion, an observation which is related to the hyperbolicity of the system. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of bubbles (i.e. thermal openings between base pairs) in homogeneous DNA sequences using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois lattice model of DNA. For the purpose of studying short-lived bubbles in DNA, the notions of instantaneous Lyapunov vectors (ILVs) are introduced in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics. While we find that the size of the opening between base pairs has no clear relationship with the spatial distribution of the first CLV at that site, we do observe a distinct relationship with various ILV distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Pierre", "B. Dhieux Lestavel"], "title": "Toward an usage of americium-241 for filter calibration", "comment": null, "summary": "In nuclear safety and environmental studies, it is necessary to measure the activity of aerosols collected on filters. The calibration of these filters' measurement chains currently involves producing a reference filter with a controlled deposit of aerosol marked by a specific radionuclide. In France, commonly used radionuclides include 137 Cs for gamma or beta emitters, 90 Sr/ 90 Y for beta emitters, and 239 Pu for alpha emitters. However, using 239 Pu presents several issues, notably the destruction of the filter required to determine its traceable activity and the associated uncertainties. The challenge of this project is to propose a radionuclide enabling non-destructive, SI-traceable measurement while retaining the reference filter. The proposed radionuclide is 241 Am, which is both alpha and gamma-emitting and allows for precise non-destructive measurements. Reference filters are produced on the IRSN's ICARE test bench with calibrated aerosols tagged with 241 Am.

These threads have so far largely progressed independently, whereas placing free electrons in a driven nonlinear system can potentially activate coherent parametric interaction channels for joint state engineering of both types of particles. Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schr\u00f6dinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here we extend the technique by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are quantitatively described by an ellipsoid model, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements.

Our analysis reveals a characteristic evolution of the wave-packet center of mass, which undergoes an initial acceleration, subsequently slows down, and ultimately enters a regime of uniform motion, accompanied throughout by exponential amplification of the wave-packet amplitude. To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation.

On its face, it repudiates many of the key features of the mechanical conception of physical reality. However, the challenge of developing a precise, coherent alternative to that conception has yet to be met. Here, I argue that a major hindrance to the project of quantum interpretation is its existing interpretative methodologies, which suffer from a lack of systematicity in their judgements about what aspects of the theory are interpretational relevant. In particular, I argue that current interpretations tend to marginalize the informal part of the theory in favour of its formal part, and place inappropriate emphasis on the natural language component of the formalism over its detailed mathematical structure. To counterbalance these biases, I propose that an interpretation-free zone be constructed around the theory, wherein an interpreter initially adopt a descriptive stance which considers all parts of the theory, and that the results of this deliberation~(and the judgements about what facts are interpretationally relevant) are reported as part of their interpretation.\n  I argue that the interpretation of quantum theory poses special challenges and difficulties which necessitate this interpretation-free zone, and that existing interpretative methodologies are insufficient to address them. Further, I argue that a reconstructive interpretative methodology, which harnesses the recent results of the quantum reconstruction program, provides a powerful means to identify almost all facts that could be interpretationally relevant, and naturally meets these challenges and difficulties. Moreover, I argue that the quantum reconstruction program offers a powerful way to discover new physical principles, and offers a systematic pathway to build a rich, coherent conception of quantum reality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper investigates the emergence of cosmic space by synthesizing two key thermodynamic approaches: the equilibrium perspective, where the first law of thermodynamics is applied to the apparent horizon, and the dynamic perspective of Padmanabhan, where the cosmic space emerges as cosmic time progresses. The central element of our study is the incorporation of a mass-to-horizon entropy relation, $M=\u03b3{c^2 L^n}/{G}$, where $M$ denotes the effective mass associated with the system, $L$ corresponds to the cosmological horizon, and $\u03b3$ is a constant with dimensions $[L]^{1-n}$. We first use this relation within the Clausius relation and apply the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=T_h dS_h+WdV$, on the apparent horizon to derive the modified Friedmann equations. Subsequently, we embed the mass-to-horizon entropy relation into Padmanabhan's cosmic emergence proposal, the dependence of the volume change on the degrees of freedom in the bulk and on the boundary, and show its consistency with the thermodynamically derived equations. The successful reconstruction of the modified Friedmann equations through these independent yet convergent thermodynamic routes strongly suggests that the mass-to-horizon entropy is a fundamental bridge between the information-theoretic microstructure of spacetime and its effective cosmological description.

Precisely, we investigate chaos through the topological horseshoes associated with the first, second, and third return maps, obtained by varying the amplitude of an external force term while keeping all other parameters fixed. Our new finding demonstrates that, when the force amplitude exceeds a certain value, the topological (Smale) horseshoe degenerates into a pseudo-horseshoe, while chaotic invariant set persists. This phenomenon indicates that the lower bound of the topological entropy decreases as the force amplitude increases, thereby enriching the dynamics in the perturbed Duffing system.\n  Furthermore, we identify a critical value of the force amplitude governing the attractivity of the chaotic invariant set. For amplitudes slightly below this value, the basin of attraction of the chaotic invariant set progressively shrinks as the amplitude increases. In contrast, for larger amplitudes, both Lyapunov exponents become negative while the topological horseshoe persists, suggesting that the chaotic invariant set loses attractivity as the amplitude grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u6ce2uidpaired\u7535\u8377\u632f\u8361\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u573a\u81f4\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u5149\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u5fae\u6ce2\u5668\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7 atomistic simulation\u6355\u83b7\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6709\u9650\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u7075\u548c\u78f7 murky\u7eb3\u7c73\u6761\u590d\u5408\u4f53\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b50\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6216\u76f8\u4e92\u6b63\u4ea4\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u56db\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u5f02\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u6ce2uidpaired\u7535\u8377\u632f\u8361", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5f02\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f7d\u6d41\u4f53\u6d53\u5ea6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5b9a\u8c10\u6ce2\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b50ics\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Using a circulating mass model, we show that hidden momentum arises in uniform fields when an object carries angular momentum. On the quantum side, we analyze the Dirac Hamiltonian in a uniform potential, construct its Foldy--Wouthuysen form, and evaluate the Heisenberg evolution of spin-polarized Gaussian packets. The state used previously, with $\\langle p\\rangle =0$, is not at rest: because canonical and kinetic momenta differ, the packet carries a spin-dependent hidden momentum from $t=0$. Imposing $\\langle x(0)\\rangle =\\langle v(0)\\rangle=0$ requires a compensating spin-dependent $\\langle p(0)\\rangle$; with this preparation $\\langle x(t)\\rangle =0$ to leading order in the gravitational acceleration $g$. Generalizing, an exact Foldy--Wouthuysen transformation (linear in $g$ but to all orders in $1/c$) shows that spin-dependent transverse motion begins no earlier than at $O(g^2)$ for a broad class of wave packets. We conclude that a uniform field does not produce a gravitational spin Hall effect at linear order; the previously reported drift stems from inconsistent initial states and misinterpreting canonical momentum.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We extend the model to explain the observed difference in density of ribosomes on the structures of the ER. Due to the capture efficiency of tubules, less ribosomes are needed on those structures. For flat sheets, more ribosome coverage at biological separation distance is needed to match the same fraction of relative flux.

In the classical limit the system dynamics is converged to a strange chaotic attractor. The quantum properties of this system are studied for the density matrix in the frame of Lindblad equation. In the case of dissipative quantum evolution the steady-state density matrix is converged to a quantum strange attractor being similar to the classical one. It is shown that depending on the dissipation strength there is a regime when the eigenstates of density matrix are localized at a strong or moderate dissipation.

To improve operational robustness, a resistive anode has been implemented using a DLC layer deposited on a Kapton substrate. While this design enhances detector stability, the resistive layer may influence rate capability, signal formation, and detector capacitance, altering timing performance.\n  This work presents a comprehensive study of a resistive design, including an analytical model and finite-element simulations to quantify rate-dependent gain reduction due to ohmic voltage drop on the resistive layer. An analytical solution for the voltage across a finite-size resistive layer is derived, and a numerical model is developed to evaluate gain suppression under intense particle fluxes. The impact of the resistive layer on signal formation is investigated using time-dependent weighting fields and the Garfield++ simulation framework. The contribution of signal components induced by the resistive layer is quantified, and preservation of the signal leading edge is found for surface resistivities above 100 kohm per square.\n  Single-channel resistive-anode prototypes were designed, constructed, and experimentally characterized. Laboratory measurements using single photoelectrons and power spectral density analysis show the predicted reduction in signal amplitude while preserving the leading edge.

Recent numerical studies in several microscopic models reveal that increasing the bandwidth in an FCI can drive a direct transition into a charge-2e superconductor rather than a conventional Fermi liquid. Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $\u03bd= 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes.

Electrically, multiple phase levels can be encoded by controlling the heater power and employing different microheater architectures to induce varying degrees of PCM amorphization. However, encoding a large number of levels is not straightforward. In this work, we first investigate a phase shifter structure based on a GeSe PCM integrated on top of a silicon-on-insulator waveguide, employing a simple rectangular-shaped heater under pulse-width modulation (PWM). We numerically demonstrate that multilevel phase shifts can be achieved because of non-uniform heating in the GeSe PCM layer. However, the resulting phase levels for this basic configuration are highly non-linear because of the uniform power dissipation along the light propagation direction characterized by the same cross-section. To overcome this limitation, we designed a novel PCM-based phase shifter with a segmented heater whose width gradually increases along the light propagation direction. This configuration enables the encoding of hundreds of well-spaced phase levels between 0 and $\u03c0$, facilitated by smoother amorphization arising from the combined effects of non-uniform heating across segments and within each segment, while achieving an insertion loss of only 0.6 dB in the worst case. Furthermore, when evaluating both heater architectures under pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) at a fixed pulse duration, we observe behavior consistent with the trends observed for PWM, confirming the superior performance of the segmented heater design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u53d8\u8d28\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u591a\u7ea7\u76f8\u79fb\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u52a0\u70ed\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u76f8\u79fb\u7ea7\u6570\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bbd\u5ea6\u52a0\u70ed\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u76f8\u79fb\u5668\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u635f\u8017\u53ea\u67090.6 dB\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u5b50\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u76f8\u79fb\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7ea7\u76f8\u79fb\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u635f\u8017\u662f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u53d8\u8d28\u6750\u6599\uff08PCM\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6bb5\u52a0\u70ed\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u52a0\u70ed\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u76f8\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u52a0\u70ed\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u76f8\u79fb\u7ea7\u6570\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bbd\u5ea6\u52a0\u70ed\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u635f\u8017\u660e\u663e\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u6bb5\u52a0\u70ed\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u7ea7\u76f8\u79fb\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b50\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u7684\u76f8\u79fb\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

During a single cooldown and over a period of 95 hours, we monitored several parameters for 8 qubits, including coherence times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, which exhibit fluctuations originating primarily from the interaction between two-level system (TLS) defects and the host qubit. We also demonstrate that subtractively-fabricated superconducting quantum devices align with the theoretical predictions that higher mean lifetimes $T_1$ correspond to larger fluctuations. To assess long-term stability, we tracked two representative qubits over 10 cooldown cycles spanning more than one year.

In recent work, a geometric proposal was put forward for how 5-branes and gauge bundles are carried across such transitions. It was observed that compactifications connected in this way lead to 4-dimensional effective theories with the same massless spectrum. Here we provide much stronger evidence that these heterotic conifold transitions do indeed lead to dual theories.

Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\\unboldmath$\u03bb/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration.

In AFM, the tip or sample is typically scanned using piezoelectric scanners, which convert applied voltages into precise mechanical displacements with sub-nanometer accuracy and high bandwidth. However, because piezo elements exhibit nonlinear responses, actual displacements can deviate from the applied driving signal by up to 20-30%. Various methods have been developed to improve positional accuracy, but they often suffer from limited scan speed, increased noise, or complex calibration procedures. From the perspective of routine maintenance, ease of calibration is more advantageous for applications where an error of around 1-2% is acceptable, especially when measuring dynamic molecular motions. Motivated by this, we developed a simple method to generate scan waveforms via software-based feedforward control, which can be easily implemented and calibrated. We identify four distinct sources of positioning error in piezo scanners and demonstrate that these errors can be compensated, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in positioning accuracy compared with uncompensated operation.

This paper explores how the design choices of a next-generation GXeTPC time projection chamber can impact the overall performance of the experiment. We study the performance of systems using xenon enriched in the isotope $^{136}$Xe or natural xenon, focusing on scenarios that incorporate one tonne of source isotope. The detector size, copper shielding mass, energy resolution, pressure, and diffusion amount are surveyed to evaluate the overall performance dependencies on these parameters. A detector optimized for using enriched xenon is preferred, with a factor of 10 lower background rate, driven by the large intrinsic backgrounds introduced by the copper shielding used in the detector. The performance of three types of gas TPC technologies was also explored based on different gas additives used to reduce diffusion to different levels. For all TPC technologies, we find background rates of a fraction of a count per tonne year in the region of interest are achievable. These performances are contingent on suitable energy resolution and event position placement in the drift direction being achieved for the specific detector technology. When factoring in the considerations for the construction of the detector in addition to the selection performance, there is no clear optimum pressure, with advantages and disadvantages if a high or low pressure default configuration is chosen.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Micro-elastography has recently emerged as a promising tool to estimate cellular viscoelastic properties within a millisecond, without the need for mechanical modeling. Here, we report a fully contactless approach to single-cell micro-elastography, using acoustically oscillating gas microbubbles positioned near individual cells (20~\\textmu m diameter megakaryocytes) as localized shear wave sources. Using this approach, we successfully performed micro-elastography on cells up to five times smaller than those studied in previous works, establishing the smallest single-cell elastography measurements to date. Spherical or non-spherical bubble oscillations generated 15~kHz elastic waves, which we detected using a high-speed camera coupled to a standard bright-field microscope. Noise correlation elastography enabled the measurement of average and local shear-wave velocities within single cells. Our results demonstrate that this method is robust and reproducible across multiple cells from the same cell line, paving the way for real-time, label-free mechanical monitoring of single cells during fast biological processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a novel method for single-cell micro-elastography that uses acoustically oscillating gas microbubbles to measure cellular viscoelastic properties in real-time, achieving unprecedented resolution at sub-microscopic cell sizes.", "motivation": "Understanding the mechanical properties of cells is crucial for various fields, including physiology, pathology, and drug testing.

Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction.

The reconstruction of the model background parameters according to the kind of specific connection between the parameters of cosmological perturbations is proposed. By the slow-roll approximation, as functions of the e-fold number, the scalar field potential and the Hubble parameter are determined. The logarithmic dependence between the scalar field evolution and the number of e-folds is investigated as the example. The derived model was found to obey a quadratic law between the parameters of cosmological perturbations. On the basis of suggested approach, a new cosmological inflation model with an exponential potential is proposed. This complies with existing observational constraints for both background and perturbation spectrum parameters. A comparison of obtained results with the solutions obtained by the symbol regression is made. The restrictions for arbitrary parameters in the model with logarithmic potential are also considered. The proposed form of the scalar field potential is consistent with one of the optimal potentials obtained when using machine learning methods to analyze the correspondence of inflationary models to observational data and gravitational waves contribution to the anisotropy and polarization of the CMB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6f14\u5316\u548ce-\u6298\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66 inflation\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6162-roll\u8fd1\u4f3c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u52bf\u80fd\u548c\u54c8\u52c3\u53c2\u6570\u4e0ee-\u6298\u6570\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6307\u6570\u52bf\u7684\u65b0\u578binflation\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5df2\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u7b26\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99 Perturbation parameters \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa inflation \u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86 Slow-roll approximation\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6307\u6570\u52bf\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1. \u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e86 Including \u80cc\u666f\u548c Perturbation \u53c2\u6570\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u30022. \u627e\u5230\u4e86\u5bf9 number of e-folds \u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u95f4\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f9d\u8d56\u30023. \u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u672c\u6587\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u52bf\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u4e00\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65b0 inflation \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Earlier work by Babichev et al. arXiv:0809.2013 concluded that DBI strings with the standard Mexican-hat potential possess no BPS limit, implying an unavoidable nonzero binding energy. In contrast, using the BPS Lagrangian method, we show that DBI strings do admit BPS solutions, provided the potential is chosen self-consistently. Imposing the existence of Bogomol'nyi equations uniquely determines the admissible potential and yields exact first-order BPS equations for DBI vortices. We independently verify the consistency of these equations using the stressless (vanishing-pressure) condition on the energy-momentum tensor. The resulting solutions saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound, exhibit zero binding energy, and smoothly recover the Nielsen-Olesen string in the limit $\u03b1\\to 0$. Regularity of the gauge-field equation requires $\u03b1< \u03c0^2$. A notable outcome of the construction is that the BPS-compatible potential takes a trigonometric form closely related to the sine-Gordon potential, revealing a natural correspondence between the sine-Gordon string and the BPS DBI string.

The load reflection is introduced to an equivalent magnetron model to theoretically evaluate the system performance. The effects of different load reflection levels on the magnetron's output are numerically analyzed. Experiments are performed while the load reflection is varied using an E-H tuner between a magnetron and a circulator. A narrower locking bandwidth is observed under constant injection power with increasing load reflection. The proper-mismatched system suppresses its sideband energy, thereby reducing phase noise. The experimental features qualitatively validate the theoretical analyses results.

Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \\SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $\u03b2$-spectrum endpoint of \\SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time. In this work, we present the first results obtained in this effort, using a chain of commercial ultra-high-precision voltage references, read out by precision multimeters and a \\emph{field mill} device. The currently available precision on high voltage is, in the conservative case, as low as \\SI{0.2}{ppm} per \\SI{1}{kV} single board and $\\lesssim$ \\SI{50}{mV} over the \\SI{10}{kV} series, presently limited by field mill read-out noise.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Unambiguously identifying unconventional magnetic orders requires probes that are directly sensitive to their momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order.

The influence of the black hole parameters on the horizon structure, thermodynamic stability, and geometric deformation of spacetime is systematically investigated. Explicit expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity are derived, revealing the formation of black hole remnants and extended stability phases induced by Lorentz symmetry-violating (LSV) effects. The sparsity of Hawking radiation is quantified, showing that Lorentz violation suppresses the continuum limit and produces a more discrete, less thermal emission spectrum. A detailed analysis of null geodesics is performed to determine the photon region and shadow morphology, indicating that increasing l and Q compresses and distorts the shadow boundary, while rotation diminishes its overall size. The ergosphere geometry is analyzed in detail, showing that increases in a, l, and Q not only enlarge and distort the ergoregion but also intensify frame-dragging, thereby maximizing the efficiency of energy extraction via the Penrose process. These results reveal clear and potentially observable deviations from standard Kerr-Newman-AdS predictions, providing a powerful new avenue to probe Lorentz symmetry breaking and test the fundamental structure of gravity in extreme strong field regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u7684AdS\u51ef\u5c14-\u7ebd\u66fc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u89c6\u754c\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u542b\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u51ef\u5c14-\u7ebd\u66fc-AdS\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u71b5\u548c\u70ed\u5bb9\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f59\u4f53\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u79bb\u6563\u3001\u66f4\u4e0d\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u53d1\u5c04\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u96f6\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5149\u73af\u533a\u57df\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u589e\u5927\u65cb\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570a\u3001\u6781\u89d2\u53c2\u6570l\u548c\u7535\u8377Q\u53ef\u4ee5\u538b\u7f29\u5e76\u626d\u66f2\u9634\u5f71\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u800c\u65cb\u8f6c\u5219\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u9634\u5f71\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u89d2\u52a8\u5cf0\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53a\u3001l\u548cQ\u589e\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6269\u5927\u548c\u53d8\u5f62\u4f1a\u52a0\u5f3a\u81ea\u65cb\u62d6\u62fd\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7Penrose\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u51ef\u5c14-\u7ebd\u66fc-AdS\u9ed1\u6d1e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u529b\u672c\u4f53\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5f3a\u573a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f3a\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u3001\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u548c\u5206\u6790Berry\u6307\u6807\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u8ba8\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a\n1) \u542b\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u7684AdS\u51ef\u5c14-\u7ebd\u66fc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u71b5\u548c\u70ed\u5bb9\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\n2) \u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f59\u4f53\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002\n3) \u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u6291\u5236\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4f7f\u5149\u8c31\u66f4\u79bb\u6563\u3001\u66f4\u4e0d\u8d8b\u70ed\u3002\n4) \u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u96f6\u5f15\u529b\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5149\u73af\u533a\u57df\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n5) \u8003\u8651\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u6781\u89d2\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7535\u8377\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u89d2\u52a8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u65cb\u62d6\u62fd\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9AdS\u51ef\u5c14-\u7ebd\u66fc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

While effective at describing \\textit{what} elite players do, these approaches often fail to explain \\textit{why} such motions are physically necessary from a mechanistic perspective. This paper proposes a deterministic, physics-based approach to the tennis serve using a 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the human upper body. Rather than fitting the model to motion capture data, we solve the inverse kinematics problem via trajectory optimization to rigorously satisfy the aerodynamic boundary conditions required for Flat, Slice, and Kick serves. We subsequently perform an inverse dynamics analysis based on the Principle of Virtual Power to compute the net joint torques. The simulation results reveal that while the kinematic trajectories for different serves may share visual similarities, the underlying kinetic profiles differ drastically. A critical finding is that joints exhibiting minimal angular displacement (kinematically ``quiet'' phases), particularly at the wrist, require substantial and highly time-varying torques to counteract gravitational loading and dynamic coupling effects. By elucidating the dissociation between visible kinematics and internal kinetics, this study provides a first-principles framework for understanding the mechanics of the tennis serve, moving beyond simple imitation of elite techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new physics-based model for understanding the biomechanics of tennis serves shows that the physical movements behind different serves (flat, slice, kick) result from complex gravitational and dynamic forces that rely on the active participation of joints, particularly in the wrist, to maintain stability and power.", "motivation": "Explaining why elite tennis players perform certain serve motions from a mechanistic perspective.", "method": "Developed a 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the upper body using inverse kinematics and dynamics analysis.", "result": "Joints with minimal angular displacement, especially the wrist, require significant, time-varying torques to counteract gravity and coupling effects.", "conclusion": "Provides a framework that emphasizes the active role of joints beyond mere imitation of elite techniques, highlighting the importance of joint compensation and active torque in serving mechanics."}}

Undershoot-driven baseline artifacts and pulse broadening are addressed by a time-domain co-design of the anode geometry and decoupling network. The design is validated through a staged workflow that combines full-wave electromagnetic simulations, vector network analyzer measurements, circuit-level transient models, and end-to-end mass spectra. The resulting planar circular patch anode with anode-proximal decoupling confines fields, preserves peak amplitude, and suppresses post-pulse energy, leading to fast settling and minimal baseline wander. We show that the effective high-pass corner set by the decoupling capacitance directly governs undershoot decay and baseline recovery. Measurements in a representative TOF-MS test setup demonstrate waveguide-level pulse fidelity at a fraction of the mass and volume of heritage waveguide-based detectors, with residual ripples in the measured response originating from downstream cable and digitizer terminations rather than the detector itself. By limiting detector-induced temporal broadening and inter-peak baseline coupling, the design supports high mass resolution and dynamic range in miniaturized TOF-MS architectures. Variants of this planar flight-ready architecture are being implemented in several next-generation spaceborne TOF-MS instruments currently under development at the University of Bern.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We demonstrate that this apparent tension reflects a fundamental covariance obstruction: no assignment of classical past variables can simultaneously be covariant under spacetime embeddings, screen off quantum correlations, and reproduce AQFT statistics. This obstruction is distinct from dynamical nonlocality or signalling violations. We formalize this as a no-go theorem in the category-theoretic framework of LCQFT, showing that Bell's notion of local causality -- requiring factorization conditioned on a common past -- is structurally incompatible with diffeomorphism covariance. The failure of Bell locality thus reflects not a breakdown of relativistic causality but the impossibility of embedding quantum correlations into a classical causal framework without introducing preferred foliations or non-covariant beables.

In our simulations, we begin with water filling completely the void space, and then we progressively increase the inter-surface separation, maintaining the water content. We find that, as the inter-surface separation progresses, the dimensionality of the water channel decreases from 2D to 1D, the latter consisting of self-confined water channels along surface grooves. The morphologies and self-diffusion coefficients of these 1D water nanochannels are strongly dependent on the nature of the water-surface interaction and on the diameter of the nanotubes.

In the nonrelativistic limit this approach leads to the Schr\u00f6dinger-Newton equation, which is often assumed to be consistent at least in the weak-field regime. In this work, we reexamine this assumption for spatial quantum superpositions of massive particles. We show that, when the quantum state is properly normalized, no modification of the Newtonian gravitational potential arises at leading order. However, at first post-Newtonian order the semiclassical coupling generically produces state-dependent contributions involving the mass density and the mass current of the superposition. These terms have a parametric scaling which is different from that of the corresponding relativistic corrections and which does not have Planck mass suppression. Our results therefore impose a strong post-Newtonian consistency constraint on deterministic semiclassical gravity, indicating that sourcing the metric solely by expectation values is insufficient to recover a consistent relativistic weak-field expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The first method uses that scalar Feynman integrals are CM, meaning that all their derivatives have a fixed sign, in the Euclidean kinematic region. This imposes strong constraints on the function space. Simultaneously, these integrals obey systems of linear differential equations with respect to kinematic parameters. By imposing that the solutions to these differential equations satisfy complete monotonicity across the Euclidean region, we develop an efficient and highly constraining numerical bootstrap method. We provide a proof of principle of the power of our approach by applying it to a class of multi-loop Feynman integrals with internal masses. The second method is based on a refinement of CM. We prove that Feynman integrals, within a certain range of parameters, such as dimension and propagator exponents, are not only CM but in fact Stieltjes functions. The latter can be described efficiently by Pad\u00e9 approximants that are known to converge in the cut complex plane. This means that these representations are valid also in analytically continued kinematics, such as physical scattering regions. These insights allow us to obtain rational approximations to Feynman integrals from minimal information, such as a Taylor expansion about a soft limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to a 20-loop banana-type Feynman integral.

Preprint submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal", "summary": "We present a vision simulator device (Katsim), a compact near-eye optical display designed for assessing postoperative corrected vision, preoperative intraocular lens (IOL) assessment, and objective IOL characterization. The system forms a virtual image using an amplitude-modulated LCoS spatial light modulator (AM-SLM), RGB LED illumination, and a high-speed varifocal lens. In the proposed architecture, the LED illumination and varifocal lens diopter changes are triggered in synchrony with the SLM RGB subframes, rendering three depth planes perceptually simultaneously via high-frequency time-multiplexing. Operating at 60 frames per second (fps), the system achieves an effective 180 Hz depth-coded cycle, enabling sharp, multi-depth rendering within a dynamically adjustable depth range from 0.2 m to optical infinity. The system's eyebox is configurable from 1 to 5 mm, while maintaining a fixed spatial location and preserving angular magnification regardless of changes in focus or eyebox size. The designed system features a 9.15-degree field of view. An integrated infrared pupil-tracking module detects non-cataractous regions of the cataractous crystalline lens, and the projected imagery is mechanically steered through those clear zones in real time. The proposed vision simulator supports both subjective simulation of post-surgical vision for patient-specific counseling and objective optical evaluation of IOLs, including resolution and contrast fidelity (e.g., modulation transfer function, contrast transfer function, and defocus curves). By decoupling depth modulation from eyebox position and size, the system offers a modular, portable platform that supports enhanced preoperative planning, personalized IOL selection, objective IOL characterization, and use as a novel research vision tool.", "AI": {"tldr":

The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm.

Preparing for such experiments, investigations of weak gravitational forces have employed mechanical resonators to detect time-dependent gravitational forces from actuated source masses. Here, we demonstrate a source mass approach which utilizes capacitive actuation of a 1 mg gold sphere embedded on a silicon nitride membrane, rather than piezoelectric or motorized actuation. The design simultaneously provides a method for microwave optomechanical implementation by coupling the membrane position to the electromagnetic mode of a 3D cavity. The cavity quality factor is not significantly compromised by electromagnetic leakage to the actuation electrode, allowing DC and kilohertz AC voltages to be introduced in the region where electric fields are strongly concentrated. We measure over 700 nm of driven oscillation amplitude and more than ten percent tunability in the mechanical resonance frequency of the loaded membrane, giving the potential to match the oscillations to the frequency range of a detector in future experiments. An optomechanical readout is demonstrated by measuring the cavity resonance at cryogenic temperatures, while room temperature measurements provide complimentary understanding of the mechanisms which influence the mechanical response, including repulsive contact due to collisions within the device.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, for most systems of practical interest, the solution to the Hedin equations is rendered nearly numerically intractable because the Hedin equations are of functional derivative form. Integral equations are much more numerically tractable, than functional derivative equations, as they can often be solved iteratively. In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In 1983, Couch and Torrence (CT) found -- surprisingly -- that the massless wave equation continues to display this symmetry on the background of an extremal (and asymptotically flat) black hole, where the inversion interchanges horizon and infinity while preserving the singularity structure of the separated radial mode equation. We revisit this CT inversion symmetry and investigate its possible extensions beyond the extremal (Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m or Kerr) setting in which it was originally identified. Using the example of the static lukewarm de Sitter black hole, we show that neither the exchange of horizon with infinity, nor the preservation of radial singularities, are essential features needed for a CT inversion to exist. Instead, we interpret CT transformations through their action on photon spheres, providing a unified viewpoint that extends to the (phase-space-dependent) CT inversions of the extremal Kerr-Newman geometry. For scalar fields on that spacetime, we find a simple relation between the fixed point of a CT inversion and the coefficient of superradiant scattering. Finally, we exhibit a hidden CT inversion symmetry that arises in the static limit of the Kerr Laplacian for all spins. Together, these results suggest that CT symmetry may admit a broader generalization than previously understood.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While the transient vibroacoustic behavior of single-walled shells has been extensively investigated, extending these analyses to double-wall cylindrical configurations introduces increased complexity due to multiple inter-shell acoustic reflections and strong coupling between acoustic fields and structural vibrations. These structures often feature mechanical interconnections between the shells to ensure structural integrity, load sharing, alignment, and enhanced resilience against static and dynamic loads. These links introduce additional pathways for vibration transmission and significantly influence the overall behavior of the system, thus making the analytical description of the coupled vibroacoustic response even more challenging. This study investigates the transient vibroacoustics of an inter-connected double-wall cylindrical shell subjected to an acoustic shock, considering fully coupled fluid-structure interactions. A comprehensive two-dimensional acoustoelastic model is developed in polar coordinates, incorporating the surrounding medium, the fluid occupying the inter-shell gap, and the fluid inside the inner shell. A semi-analytical solution method is employed to capture the time-domain evolution of acoustic fields and shell vibrations. The model's accuracy is verified by benchmarking against available data reported in the literature. Leveraging the passive dynamics of the system, we present a hybrid mechanism that integrates optimized nonlinear vibration absorbers with piezoelectric actuators to control the vibroacoustic behavior. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid mechanism in mitigating shock-induced acoustic pressure waves and enhancing the structural resilience of the double-wall cylindrical shell.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u5c42\u5706\u67f1\u58f3\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u58f0\u538b\u51b2\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u58f0-\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u632f\u52a8\u5438\u6536\u5668\u548c\u538b\u7535\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u5c42\u5706\u67f1\u58f3\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u51b2\u51fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u58f0-\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6297\u52a8\u6001\u8f7d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u58f0-\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u58f0\u573a\u548c\u58f3\u4f53\u632f\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u51b2\u51fb\u58f0\u538b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u5c42\u5706\u67f1\u58f3\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u58f0-\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u632f\u52a8\u5438\u6536\u5668\u548c\u538b\u7535\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid.

Our study introduces an innovative methodology leveraging cavity polygon modes within an X-cut thin-film lithium niobate microdisk to achieve highly efficient multi-chromatic Raman microlasers. Specifically, high-Q square modes characterized by two parallel sides oriented perpendicularly relative to the optical axis of lithium niobate crystal were excited. These modes offer distinct advantages, including enhancing both mode-field overlap and improved phase matching, achieved through the utilization of the largest second-order susceptibility component (d_33), which is critical for Raman-quadratic nonlinear interactions. The experimental results highlight significant advancements in multi-wavelength multi-wavelength laser generation, with forward stimulated Raman laser signals exhibiting a high conversion efficiency of up to 65.02% and an impressively narrow integral linewidth of only 5.2 kHz. Simultaneously, our system enables the generation of multi-wavelength Raman-quadratic laser signals across the ~800 nm and ~530 nm spectral bands. These findings are further underscored by an impressive absolute conversion efficiency of 1.33% for the 797.4-nm Raman laser, achieved at a remarkably low pump power of just 1.07 mW.

They can act as quasi-particles that can be generated, manipulated and annihilated, and hold promise for future memory and logic devices. As of now, all-optical stochastic nucleation of skyrmion ensembles, mostly in small applied magnetic fields, has been shown. However, to research their true potential, the ability to selectively toggle switch individual single skyrmions would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we demonstrate the field-free optical control of single stable skyrmions via single femtosecond laser pulses with diameters down to 175 nm, containing a fixed chirality. By engineering ferrimagnetic Co/Gd-based multilayers, we resolve the competition between deterministic and stochastic processes, and thereby overcome the challenge of optically writing and annihilating sub-micron skyrmions on demand.

The model integrates the combined effects of exponential localization in banded capacitance matrices, suppression of virtual couplings through detuning products across intermediate modes, and evanescent decay of below-cutoff electromagnetic fields, yielding predictive scaling relations for coupling strength as a function of spatial separation and spectral detuning. Experimental characterization of a $4 \\times 4$ superconducting-qubit lattice with inductive shunt pillars reveals exponential spatial decay and frequency-dependent suppression consistent with theoretical predictions, achieving quantitative agreement for all nearest-neighbor couplings across the \\qtyrange[range-phrase = --, range-units = single]{4}{6}{\\giga\\hertz} operating range.

Moreover, a susceptibility maximum occurs below 4 T, whereas Fermi-liquid coherence is recovered above 8 T. In addition, thermodynamic anomalies ($T_{\\rm A}$ and $H_{\\rm A}$) occur in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat at intermediate fields (6--10 T) along the [111] direction. Furthermore, a nontrivial fifth-order nonlinear susceptibility is observed in the normal-state magnetization of UBe$_{13}$. These results suggest a close relationship between the field-induced multipolar correlations of $5f$-electron degrees of freedom and the Fermi-surface reconstruction accompanying the crossover from the NFL state to the Fermi-liquid state in UBe$_{13}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53UBe13\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u573a\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u7387\u548c\u6bd4\u70ed\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u975e\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u78c1\u5316\u7387\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u70ed\u5bb9\u5f02\u5e38\u5219\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u6709\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u573a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0b\u7684 stressed \u6027\u8d28", "method": "\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u9ad8\u538b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6d4b\u91cf\u78c1\u5316\u7387\u548c\u6bd4\u70ed\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316", "result": "\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\uff0c\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u975e\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u78c1\u5316\u7387\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u70ed\u5bb9\u5f02\u5e38\u5219\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\u6709\u5173", "conclusion": "\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e865f\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u591a\u6781\u5173\u8054"}}

The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit.

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We study polarization dependent photon propagation in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes permeated by strong magnetic fields, with the aim of quantifying how finite emission and detection radii modify vacuum birefringence signals. Working in the geometric optics limit of nonlinear electrodynamics, we formulate the two polarization modes as null geodesics of distinct effective (optical) metrics. We then develop a controlled weak-coupling expansion that cleanly separates the standard gravitational deflection from the birefringent contribution induced by the electromagnetic nonlinearity. Using a finite distance Gauss-Bonnet construction on the associated optical manifolds, we derive a general expression for the \\emph{differential} bending angle in which the source and observer are kept at arbitrary radii, thereby extending the usual scattering-at-infinity treatment. As benchmark applications, we specialize our results to the Euler-Heisenberg effective action of QED and to Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We find that the observable birefringence is generically reduced by finite-distance truncation of the curvature flux, and we provide explicit correction series suitable for data analysis. For magnetar-motivated dipolar fields, this geometric effect yields a suppression factor that can diminish the predicted polarization-dependent deflection by as much as $\\sim 50\\%$ for limb emission relative to asymptotic scattering estimates.

The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the \"roton minimum\" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u516d\u65b9\u5bc6\u5806\u79ef\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u6297\u94c1\u78c1\u6709\u5e8fHeisenberg\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u78c1\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u7269\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\uff08QMC\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u7ea7\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\uff08SE\uff09\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u76f8\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\uff08CST\uff09\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u516d\u65b9\u5bc6\u5806\u79ef\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u78c1\u5b50\u4e0e\u5e73\u65b9\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u516d\u65b9\u5bc6\u5806\u79ef\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u78c1\u5b50\u5728\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u89d2\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u6563\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\uff08QMC\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u7ea7\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\uff08SE\uff09\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u76f8\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\uff08CST\uff09\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e8e\u5e73\u65b9\u6676\u683c\u7684'\u7f57 don \u5931\u53bb'\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u516d\u65b9\u5bc6\u5806\u79ef\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u78c1\u5b50\u5728\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u89d2\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u6563\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CST\u5728\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u78c1\u5b50\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u516d\u65b9\u5bc6\u5806\u79ef\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u518d\u6210\u7acb\u3002"}}

Depending on how the electric field acts on the quantum dot, the spin can be driven either by a modulation of its g-factor or by a displacement of the wavefunction. Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance.", "AI": {"tldr":

We present a platform that sandwiches a superconducting transmon qubit between two microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) arrays, enabling real-time detection of radiation-induced phonon bursts. By synchronizing MKID event detection with single-shot measurements of qubit energy relaxation ($T_1$) and phase coherence ($T_2$), we observe statistically significant reductions in both $T_1$ and $T_2$-up to 30.5%-immediately following dual MKID events attributed to penetrating muons.

Allowing for ferromagnetism, a phase diagram is built as a function of the parameter that controls anisotropy and the strength of the interactions. It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears. The phase transition from the paramagnetic to the magnetically ordered phases is of second order, while the phase transition between ferromagnet and altermagnet states is first order.

Among the many degrees of freedom of light, orbital angular momentum (OAM) further expands these capabilities by unlocking new regimes of control in information encoding, particle manipulation, and symmetry-driven selection rules. However, exploiting OAM to drive nonlinear, non-perturbative effects in solids remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral regime, a key region for accessing these effects in ambient air, where spatial light modulators do not operate. Here, we circumvent this limitation by generating femtosecond, few-cycle MIR Bessel-Gauss vortex (BGV) and Perfect optical vortices (POVs), using a robust, static spatial-shaping strategy. Using those beams to drive the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in solids, we show that the resulting harmonic beams faithfully inherit the structural properties of the drivers: the constant-intensity ring of the POV is preserved across harmonic orders, while the harmonic BGVs retain their intrinsic TC-dependent profiles. Furthermore, by verifying the OAM up-scaling law, we confirm OAM conservation during HHG in solids. These results establish strong-field HHG in solids as a robust platform for synthesizing ultrafast structured harmonic light with controllable, high-value OAM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5149\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5149\u6a21\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5149\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u5149\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u6765\u64cd\u63a7\u5149\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5149\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528 Femtosecond \u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u548cstatic spatial-shaping\u7b56\u7565\u4ea7\u751f MIR \u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u675f\uff0c\u5982BGV\u548cPOV\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u8c03\u548c\u5149\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u5165\u5149\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86OAM\u5b88\u6052\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u573a\u9ad8\u8c03\u548c\u5149\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u6a21\u5f0f\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u9ad8\u901f\u5149\u5b66\u901a\u4fe1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light.

The fundamental package cavity mode is far detuned from the 4 GHz to 8 GHz band of interest, and the pin transmission exhibits less than 3 dB of ripple across this range. We demonstrate the use of this package to extract the loss tangent of superconducting ring resonators, measuring a value of (1.10 +- 0.09) x 10^-6, which agrees with measurements of lambda/4 resonators in wirebond-based packaging.

In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that neither anisotropy nor magnetic fields affect the traversability of the wormhole. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry.

The Euclidean time evolution is induced by the Rindler Hamiltonian and behaves as the regulator that tames the divergence induced by the local operator, while the Lorentzian one is induced by the uniform Hamiltonian. Under these time evolutions, we investigate the time ordering effect of the Rindler Euclidean and uniform Lorentzian time evolution operators. Consequently, we find the remarkable differences between those time evolutions are induced by whether those are unitary or non-unitary. Especially, we find that the unitary time evolution induces the late-time logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy, while the non-unitary time evolution induces the late-time constant behavior.

Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals. These methods are generic and can be applied to any conductor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u53d6\u4ecb\u7535\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ecb\u7535\u6548\u5e94\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6750\u6599\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u6d88\u51cf\u6742\u6563\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u73af\u8def\u78c1\u6ede\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5584\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u78c1\u504f\u573a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e94\u7528\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u53cd\u76f8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d88\u9664\u6742\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u5de5\u5f02\u5e38\u4ecb\u7535\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u5bfc\u4f53\u90fd\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u4ecb\u7535\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

A recently-developed alternative is holographic endoscopy, which exploits controlled light transport through hair-thin optical fibres. With minimal invasiveness, it provides observations at comparable spatial resolution, while extending its applicability to unprecedented depths. It has been used to resolve details of sub-cellular structural connectivity, record neuronal signalling, and monitor blood flow from the deepest locations of the living brain. Yet, its use, particularly in densely labelled brain regions, has so far been constrained by significant contrast loss, primarily due to the absence of a practical mechanism for rejecting out-of-focus fluorescence light -- a capability inherently provided by confocal and multi-photon microscopy. Exploring opportunities in the structure of light modes of different MMF types we identify the possibility of achieving an analogue to confocal fluorescence microscopy through MMF-based endoscopes. Using a novel composite fibre probe that combines graded-index and step-index MMFs, we enable spatially resolved signal collection and selective rejection of out-of-focus light. This confocal filtering significantly enhances image contrast and resolution by suppressing background and off-plane signals.

By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728Si\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u5076\u6781\u81ea\u65cb\u5171\u632f\uff08EDSR\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u78c1\u57df\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7535\u5b50\u5076\u6781\u77e9\uff0c\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u8def\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u501f\u52a9\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5bf9\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u52a0\u9c81\u68d2\u3002\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5408\u91d1\u4e0d\u7eaf\u5ea6\u5728Si/SiGe\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u5316\u4e86\u80fd\u5792\u5206\u88c2\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u80fd\u7ea7\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u95f4\u8dc3\u8fc1\u6253\u5f00\u6f0f\u8def\u901a\u9053\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u53ca\u5408\u91d1\u4e0d\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8c37\u7535\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5f31\u65f6\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8c37\u7535\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u8109\u51b2\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3002\u5f53\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u552f\u6709\u8ba9\u4e24\u80fd\u7ea7\u7684\u5206\u88c2\u8f83\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u8f83\u4e3a\u5fae\u5c0f\uff0c\u65b9\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u95f4\u9694\u6ce2\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u8870\u51cf\u8f83\u4e3a\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u80fd\u591f\u8f83\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u6539\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002\u6700\u540e\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u64cd\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u907f\u5f00\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6742\u8d28\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65b9\u9762", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76Si\u548cSiGe\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u7ea7\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u78c1\u57df\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8bbe\u8ba1", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5728\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6742\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8c37\u7535\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6742\u8d28\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Existing state-of-the-art techniques, including Qubitization, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), and Quantum Signal Processing (QSP), rely heavily on block-encoding the Hermitian matrix. These methods are often constrained by the complexity of preparing the block-encoded state, the overhead associated with the required ancillary qubits, or the challenging problem of angle synthesis for the polynomial's phase factors, which limits the achievable circuit depth and overall efficiency.\n  In this work, we propose a novel and resource-efficient approach to implement arbitrary polynomials of a Hermitian matrix, by leveraging the Generalized Quantum Signal Processing (GQSP) framework. Our method circumvents the need for block-encoding by expressing the target Hermitian matrix as a symmetric combination of unitary conjugates, enabling polynomial synthesis via GQSP circuits applied to each unitary component. We derive closed-form expressions for symmetric polynomial expansions and demonstrate how linear combinations of GQSP circuits can realize the desired transformation. This approach reduces resource overhead, and opens new pathways for quantum algorithm design for functions of Hermitian matrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff08GQSP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610fHermitian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "Hermitian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u7b49\uff0c\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff08GQSP\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Hermitian\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u5355\u4f4dary\u5171\u8f6d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528GQSP\u7535\u8def\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0Hermitian\u77e9\u9635\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8eGQSP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Despite its apparent simplicity, this exercise is deeply rooted in highly non-trivial developments in superstring theory and holography, and it addresses what is arguably one of the most profound questions in quantum gravity: the fate of information in black hole evaporation. For this reason, one is naturally compelled to examine this exercise as carefully as possible, closely following the original authors.\n  This chapter presents thus a detailed overview of recent work by Almheiri et al. and Penington on the AdS2 black hole information loss paradox and its proposed resolution within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The roles of generalized entanglement entropy, quantum extremal surfaces, the island conjecture, holography, and replica wormholes in this resolution are discussed in detail. The distinction between the von Neumann entropy and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in black hole physics is carefully clarified. It is shown that a phase transition at the Page time, between the trivial quantum extremal surface at the horizon and a non-vanishing quantum extremal surface located behind the horizon, leads to the correct Page curve.\n  A simplified version of the information loss problem for the eternal AdS2 black hole, together with its resolution along similar lines, is also presented. The replica trick and its crucial role in computing entanglement entropies for various intervals in AdS2 are discussed at some length.

In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "FF-STEM \u5171\u4eab\u4e86ptychography\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6210\u50cf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8865\u5145\u4e86 dark-field\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684 4D-STEM \u5b9e\u65f6\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "_phase contrast \u5728 STEM \u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5f31\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u5bf9\u675f\u654f\u611f\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "FF-STEM \u5229\u7528 ptychographic \u76f8\u4f4d\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u503e\u659c\u6821\u6b63\u7684 dark-field \u6210\u50cf\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u91c7\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06bright-field\u548cdark-field\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0cFF-STEM \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8f6c\u79fbgap\u65e0\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "FF-STEM \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684 4D-STEM \u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf STEM \u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

In this context, the present work considers the derivation of linear and quadratic Casimir operators corresponding to representations of the Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT) group associated with a five-dimensional spacetime of signature (1,4). This LCT group, which emerges naturally as the symmetry group of the relativistic quantum phase space, is isomorphic to the symplectic group Sp(2,8). The latter notably contains the de Sitter group SO(1,4) as a subgroup. This geometric setting provides a unified framework for extending the Standard Model of particle physics while incorporating cosmological features. Previous studies have shown that the LCT group admits both fermionic-like and bosonic-like representations. Within this framework, a novel classification of quarks and leptons, including sterile neutrinos, has also been proposed. In this work, we present a systematic derivation of the linear and quadratic Casimir operators associated with these representations, motivated by their fundamental role in the characterization of symmetry groups in physics. The construction is based on the relations between the LCT group and the pseudo-unitary group U(1,4). Three linears and three quadratics Casimir operators are identified: two corresponding to the fermionic-like representation, two to the bosonic-like representation, and two hybrid operators linking the two representations. The complete eigenvalue spectra and corresponding eigenstates for each operator are subsequently computed and identified", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By means of a nontrivial canonical transformation, the minisuperspace dynamics is mapped into that of a two dimensional hyperbolic oscillator with a fixed frequency ratio, rendering the Wheeler DeWitt equation exactly solvable by separation of variables. The resulting Wheeler-DeWitt solutions are expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions and are parametrised by a continuous separation constant, reflecting the constrained nature of the theory and the absence of a standard Schrodinger time parameter.

This shift fundamentally alters the way fields, interactions, and symmetries are understood. NCFT uniquely integrates with supersymmetry, making it a natural framework for unifying quantum mechanics and gravity. It also provides a consistent mechanism for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Unlike conventional QFT, which quantizes fields on a fixed spacetime, NCFT begins by quantizing spacetime itself. This perspective reveals novel phenomena, such as ultraviolet-infrared mixing and a natural transition from discrete to continuous geometries. It offers insights into quantum gravity at the Planck scale. Mathematically, NCFT bridges quantum mechanics and geometry through operator algebras, enabling the exploration of new theories unattainable in traditional frameworks.

In contrast to conventional two-dimensional designs, which by symmetry may support either transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) polarization, our volumetric architecture accepts both TE and TM modes simultaneously, reflecting the dimensionality and versatility required by the photonic devices. The metasurface comprises a periodic lattice of gold nanostructures embedded in a dielectric polymer matrix, creating complex metal-dielectric interfaces that sustain tightly confined plasmonic resonances. When driven by ultrafast near-infrared pulses, these resonances concentrate optical energy at the nanoscale, enabling efficient third-harmonic generation and upconversion of visible light into the ultraviolet (UV) and deep-UV regimes with enhanced conversion efficiency. We perform spatial and temporal mapping of the nonlinear response under both TE and TM excitation. Our measurements reveal polarization-agnostic field enhancement and spectral tunability arising from the three-dimensional morphology-capabilities unattainable in planar metasurfaces, where two-dimensional symmetry inherently limits polarization flexibility and functional bandwidth. This 3D platform provides a flexible design toolbox for polarization-independent UV and deep-UV light sources.

Furthermore, depending on how the energy compares to another scale associated with the phenomenon of superradiance, the radiation either comes out as mostly non-superradiant or mostly superradiant. For non-superradiant emission, it is found that the quantum rate is suppressed compared to the semi-classical in the same way as recently observed for neutral radiation. For superradiant emission, a novel behavior is observed, the quantum rate is enhanced compared to the semi-classical. For large black holes, we argue that the quantum rate always reduces to the semi-classical. In the limit of very large black holes, from our semi-classical rate, we recover the Gibbons result of Schwinger-like suppression. This gives a unified story of near-extremal charged emission rates, both quantum and semi-classical, which covers all sizes of black hole and all energy regimes. We use these rates to discuss the evaporation history of each type of black hole, from when it starts very near extremality, until it has left this regime. Finally, for the near-extremal Kerr black hole, we argue that the quantum rate always reduces to the semi-classical with the superradiant modes dominating. This rate is computed for spin $0,1,2$. Our analysis emphasizes the AdS$_2$ structure of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m and Kerr near-horizon regions, which enables a completely parallel treatment of the two.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent advances in adaptive optics, wavefront shaping, and machine learning, driven by synergistic progress in fundamental theories, optoelectronic hardware, and computational algorithms, have demonstrated substantial potential in mitigating turbulence-induced distortions. Recently, active convolved illumination (ACI) was proposed as a versatile and physics-driven technique for transmitting structured light beams with minimal distortion through highly challenging turbulent regimes. While distinct in its formulation, ACI shares conceptual similarities with other physics-driven distortion correction approaches and stands to benefit from complementary integration with data-driven deep learning (DL) models. Inspired by recent work coupling deep learning with traditional turbulence mitigation strategies, the present work investigates the feasibility of integrating ACI with neural network-based methods. We outline a conceptual framework for coupling ACI with data-driven models and identify conditions under which learned representations can meaningfully support ACI's correlation-injection mechanism. As a representative example, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) together with a transfer-learning approach to examine how a learned model may operate in tandem with ACI.

Therefore, galactic dark matter may be in a form of a self-gravitating condensate, in the presence of self-interactions. We consider the possibility that the self-interacting potential of the condensate dark matter is of the logarithmic form. In order to describe the condensate dark matter we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity, and the Thomas-Fermi approximation. With the use of the hydrodynamic representation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we obtain the equation of state of the condensate, which has the form of the ideal gas equation of state, with the pressure proportional to the dark matter density. The basic equation describing the density distribution of the static condensate is derived, and its solution is obtained in the form of a series solution, constructed with the help of the Adomian Decomposition Method. To test the model we consider the properties of the galactic rotation curves in the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter scenario, by using a sample from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) data.

The CFT$_{d}$ lives on the asymptotic boundary of the bulk AdS$_{d+1}$. Hence a local operator in the bulk of the AdS$_{d+1}$ should be reconstructable using operators living on the asymptotic boundary at the same instant. The existence of such a reconstruction is highly nontrivial and is conceptually puzzling if we think in terms of physically detecting a local bulk particle from the boundary of the AdS$_{d+1}$, as this signals a non-local information encoding scheme. In this paper, we explore situations where such non-locally encoded information can be observed in semiclassical gravity. We study examples where it is more efficient to utilize such effects in quantum gravity to detect a bulk excitation than to wait for signals to reach the boundary. Furthermore, we provide exemplified situations for which the protocol fails, and the non-locality of information is suppressed. These exemplified scenarios can be taken as explicit examples of the emergence of a perturbatively localized observer.

Traditional methods often fall short, relying on static and largely qualitative models that do not scale with system complexity and fail to capture systemic interdependencies. In this work, we introduce a novel quantitative approach to cyber risk assessment based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), a formulation compatible with both classical computing and quantum annealing. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic 255-nodes layered infrastructure, showing how risk spreads in non-trivial patterns that are difficult to identify through visual inspection alone. To assess scalability, we further conduct extensive experiments on networks up to 1000 nodes comparing classical, quantum, and hybrid classical-quantum workflows. Our results reveal that although quantum annealing produces solutions comparable to classical heuristics, its potential advantages are significantly hindered by the embedding overhead required to map the densely connected cyber-risk QUBO onto the limited connectivity of current quantum hardware. By contrast, hybrid quantum-classical solvers avoid this bottleneck and therefore emerge as a promising option, combining competitive scaling with an improved ability to explore the solution space and identify more stable risk configurations. Overall, this work delivers two main advances. First, we present a rigorous, tunable, and generalizable mathematical model for cyber risk that can be adapted to diverse infrastructures and domains through flexible parameterization.

The 7vM is characterised by a temperature coupling and its continuum limit is characterised by a massive, dilute and dense phases similarly to the $O(n)$ loop model. We compute the sphere and disk partition functions of the 7vM from the spectral curve of the dual matrix model, abbreviated here as 7vMM. The disk partition function for fixed length is expressed in terms of an uncharted deformation of the K-Bessel functions. We argue that 7vMM and Matrix Quantum Mechanics (MQM) provide two complementary non-perturbative realisations of sine-Liouville gravity. Specifically, we find that the continuum limit of 7vMM and the MQM share the same classical spectral curve but describe two different types of branes in sine-Liouville gravity. The 7vMM precisely covers the range of parameters where the Minkowskian MQM lacks a simple interpretation in terms of multiple tachyon scattering. We investigate the flow relating the dilute and the dense phases and argue that this flow is the gravitational analogue of the massless flow in the sine-Gordon model with imaginary mass coupling. The two extremities of the flow are described by a free boson coupled to Liouville gravity and compactified at circles with two different radii.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u516d\u9876\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a7\u9876\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\uff087vM\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u6e29\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5176\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e$O(n)$Loop\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6e29\u548c\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u76f8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e867vM\u7684\u7403\u5f62\u548c\u76d8\u5f62\u5206\u5272\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u79f0\u4f5c7vMM\u3002\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u76d8\u5f62\u5206\u5272\u51fd\u6570\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u672a\u77e5\u7684K-\u8d1d\u585e\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u30027vMM\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\uff08MQM\uff09\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u975e\u6270urbation\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6b63\u5f26-\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u91cd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c7vMM\u548cMQM\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u5149\u8c31\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6b63\u5f26-\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u91cd\u529b\u4e2d\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f26\u30027vMM\u7cbe\u786e\u8986\u76d6\u4e86MQM\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u591a\u91cd\u70b9\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u5230\u5bc6\u96c6\u76f8\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u5f15\u529b\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u8d28\u91cfless\u6d41\u52a8\u3002\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u4e24\u7aef\u7531\u81ea\u7531boson\u548cLiouville\u5f15\u529b\u5206\u522b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u5706\u4e0a\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9876\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u91cd\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7403\u5f62\u548c\u76d8\u5f62\u7684\u5206\u5272\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u5272\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76f8\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\uff1b\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u91cd\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "7vMM\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u975e\u6270\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6b63\u5f26-\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u91cd\u529b\uff1b\u6d41\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u76f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff1b\u4e24\u7aef\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u5706\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc77\u9876\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6b63\u5f26-\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u91cd\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u975e\u6270\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u6a21\u578b flowed from\u7a00\u758f\u5230\u5bc6\u96c6\u76f8\uff0c\u4e24\u7aef\u88ab\u4e0d\u540c\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u5706\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

Furthermore, under conditions of equal channel loss per user, we achieve secure key rates of 6.97, 6.46, and 5.88 kbps for three-, four-, and five-user scenarios respectively.

As an alternative, modified teleparallel gravity theories such as $f(T)$ gravity offer a purely geometric mechanism to explain cosmic acceleration. In this work, we construct a plane-symmetric anisotropic cosmological model in the framework of exponential $f(T)$ gravity, adopting the functional form $f(T) = T + u e^{-vT}$. A key novelty of this study is that the Hubble function $H(z)$ is derived self-consistently from the field equations rather than being prescribed phenomenologically. Furthermore, we provide the first comprehensive observational test of an anisotropic $f(T)$ model using a combination of DESI, gravitational-wave (GW) data, and complementary datasets including OHD, CMB, and Pantheon+SH0ES. Our best-fit analysis yields $70 \\lesssim H_0 \\lesssim 73~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, $0.28 \\lesssim \u03a9_m \\lesssim 0.34$, and $-0.99 \\lesssim \u03c9\\lesssim -0.69$, all consistent with current late-time cosmological observations. The model accurately reproduces the distance modulus of Type Ia supernovae and the luminosity-distance relation from gravitational-wave standard sirens. These results demonstrate that the proposed anisotropic exponential $f(T)$ model can account for the observed cosmic acceleration without invoking a dark-energy component, thereby offering a novel and observationally consistent framework for studying anisotropic extensions of gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The inferred source masses of GW231123 lie in a mass range where stellar-progenitor black holes are rare to exist due to the pair instability supernovae mass gap, and hence alternative scenarios of origin of this inferred heavy mass black hole become important. One of such hypotheses of its origin is gravitational lensing that introduces modulations to the amplitude and phase of GWs and can make the inferred mass higher from the true value. In this work, we search for the lensing signatures from GW231123 and all other events in a model-independent approach using the technique \\texttt{$\u03bc$-GLANCE} which carries out tests on its residual strain to look for common features across the detector network through cross-correlation and infers the lensing signal in a Bayesian framework. Our analysis tests yield no strong evidence in support for lensing, though it detects presence of potential residual in the data, which can be a micro-lensing signature with a modulation amplitude less than 0.8 at 95\\% C.I. However, our study finds that current waveform systematics for such heavy mass binary systems are large enough to shadow the detection of lensing from such short-duration GWs such as GW231123, and hence no concluding claim of lensing could be made at this stage. We conclude that if this event is lensed, then in near future, detection of similar lensed events will take place with current detector sensitivity and hence can open a potential discovery space of lensed GW signal with the aid of more accurate waveform models.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses a high mass binary black hole merger detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.

We clarify that this coefficient is directly calculable from the structure of the equation obeyed by the field perturbation, and requires no knowledge of the full solution. The derived formula allows us to establish some general results on the existence of logarithmic running. In particular, we show that any static and spherically symmetric spacetime that modifies the Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m solutions in a perturbative way must have non-zero logarithmic Love numbers.

In particular, recent works have generalized this concept to microscopy setups, but the sensitivity to optical path differences constrains its application to samples with thickness variation typically below a few micrometers if tracking changes in the coincidences at a fixed delay. Extending the concept to polarization microscopy and circumventing this limitation, this manuscript explores the use of a narrowband photon pair source with coherence length >1 mm to broaden the HOM dip. Thus, realistic sample-thickness variations introduce negligible temporal distinguishability, and changes in coincidence rate at the dip centre are then dominated by sample-induced polarization effects. To compute the polarization rotation, we develop a statistical model for the interferometer, derive the Fisher information, and establish a maximum-likelihood estimator for the local fast-axis angle. Recording dip and baseline frames at each sample position via raster scanning, the experimental results validate the framework, agreeing with classical polarized-intensity images while demonstrating operation at a maximum-precision regime and insensitiveness to layer thickness.

Many such solutions were derived without a specified equation of state or under restrictive or non-physical assumptions, limiting their physical relevance. The aim of this thesis is to study the physical viability of spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions, with extensions to plane and hyperbolic symmetries.\n  The first part reviews the hydrodynamic approach, which interprets a perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor as a fluid in local thermal equilibrium. Interpretations as a generic ideal gas, a classical ideal gas, and fluids with transport coefficients are analysed. The framework is extended to the ultrarelativistic Synge gas, and methods to approximate its equation of state are developed.\n  These results are applied to three families of solutions: T-models, geodesic R-models with flat synchronisation, and thermodynamic Stephani universes. For each family, general expressions for the fluid flow, energy density, pressure, speed of sound, and admissible thermodynamic schemes are obtained. Physical viability is assessed using standard energy, positivity, and compressibility conditions, with emphasis on compatibility with a generic ideal gas. In all cases, wide spacetime regions are found where the solutions represent physically admissible perfect fluids.\n  The thesis concludes with xIdeal, a Mathematica package implementing IDEAL algorithms for the analysis of exact solutions, including spacetime characterisations, a metric database, and examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "This thesis investigates the physical properties of spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions, examining their compatibility with the hydrodynamic approach and expanding the understanding of their applicability in General Relativity.", "motivation": "Einstein's equations are complex, necessitating symmetry assumptions for exact solutions.

However, problems of practical relevance typically have more variables than current or foreseeable quantum computers have qubits. Here we introduce a divide and conquer approach that partitions the optimization problem into subgraphs that can be represented on smaller quantum processors. We then find all states of the subgraphs that can possibly be part of the solution to the entire problem by determining the cost or energy ranges in which the local subgraph energies of these states must be contained. This allows us to reduce the problem by only considering the subspace spanned by these states. We then recombine the system using a binary encoding for each subgraph with a local energy ordering. This process can be iterated until no further reduction is possible. We also find that the number of necessary qubits can be reduced further when only retaining states in a fraction of the relevant energy range at very little expense in terms of approximation ratio to the global ground state. In numerical simulations, we find that our approach allows us to solve combinatorial optimization problems on weighted random 3-regular graphs with $|\\mathcal{V}|=40$ discrete variables on $\\sim |\\mathcal{V}| / 4$ qubits while retaining a possible approximation ratio of $\\sim99.9\\%$.

In this framework, the Bethe-root distribution of the associated quantum field theory yields an Abelian differential of the second kind on the elliptic Riemann surface specified by the spectral endpoints, a structure central to the algebro-geometric theory of solitons. The semiclassical parameter is identified with the large-rank limit of the internal symmetry group ($O(2N)$) of the underlying quantum field theory (the Gross-Neveu model with a chemical potential).

Our analysis reveals the presence of a tidal gap between black holes, characterized by vanishing tidal deformability, and physically motivated ECOs. Prompted by this finding, we investigate the possibility that a population of maximally compact exotic objects, described by a linear equation of state (EoS), may simultaneously inhabit the lower mass gap and the sub-solar region, thus qualifying as (primordial) black hole mimickers while distinguishing themselves from the latter by their non-zero tidal deformability. Finally, considering the case of solitonic boson stars as proxies for ECOs described by a linear EoS, we discuss how it is possible to further reduce the lower limit on $\u039b$, provided that the strong energy condition is violated (but not the dominant energy condition, and therefore causality).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although Lorentz violation is introduced only through the kinetic sector, the renormalization structure is nontrivial: interactions generate additional couplings, including masses and linear terms, so a consistent renormalization--group analysis cannot be formulated in terms of modified kinetic terms alone and requires an RG--complete operator basis compatible with the reduced symmetry.\n  We perform a systematic one--loop renormalization and derive the complete set of beta functions for cubic and quartic couplings, masses, and linear terms. We identify and analyze the resulting fixed points and fixed manifolds, showing in particular how anisotropy restricts their existence and stability. In particular we obtain how anisotropy restricts existence of canonical Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Also we provide a transparent physical interpretation of the anisotropy--dependent coefficients appearing in the beta functions and clarify how kinetic mixing reshapes the interaction flow through the available ultraviolet phase space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86D=4-\u03b5\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b9e\u6807\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u573a\u8bba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u4e00\u73af\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e00\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684beta\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u53ca\u56fa\u5b9a\u6d41\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u5206\u6790\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u51cf\u5c0f\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53d1\u73b0\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5178\u578b\u5a01\u5c14\u900a-\u8d39\u5e0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u5982\u4f55\u9650\u5236\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u79cd\u7c7b\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

By applying advanced signal processing techniques, including the wavelet leader method and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, we uncover strong multifractal behavior in the output data. This finding indicates that the temporal fluctuations inherent to quantum circuit outputs are not purely random but exhibit complex scaling properties across multiple time scales. The multifractal nature of the signal suggests the possibility of tailoring filtering strategies that specifically target these scaling features to effectively mitigate noise in quantum computations.

To a large extent, progress has been restricted to the spherically symmetric sector, with the exception of the Kerr-de Sitter and Thakhurta solutions. In this work, we present two new results that advance the description of axisymmetric compact objects embedded in a cosmological background. We first introduce a new solution-generating technique allowing one to construct non-stationary and axisymmetric solutions of the self-interacting Einstein-Scalar system. Using this method, we present the first exact solution which describes a dynamical axisymmetric black (or white) hole embedded in an expanding or contracting cosmology. We provide a detailed investigation of its properties, and in particular its dynamical trapping (or anti-trapping) horizons.

We address this gap with a hybrid architecture that uses a compact multilayer perceptron to compress security data and then routes a few features to 2-4 qubit quantum heads implemented as quantum support vector machines and variational circuits. Under matched preprocessing and training budgets, we benchmark these hybrids against tuned classical baselines on two security tasks, network intrusion detection on NSL-KDD and spam filtering on Ling-Spam datasets, and then deploy the best 4-qubit quantum SVM to an IBM Quantum device with noise-aware execution (readout mitigation and dynamical decoupling). Across both datasets, shallow quantum heads consistently match, and on difficult near-boundary cases modestly reduce, missed attacks and false alarms relative to classical models using the same features.

In this work, we present a new exact rotating black hole solution within a specific scalar-tensor theory belonging to the Horndeski class. The solution is obtained via a disformal transformation acting on a Kerr stealth black hole. Crucially, unlike previous constructions, the disformal transformation of our chosen seed configuration preserves circularity, ensuring that many of the geometrical and physical properties that make the Kerr spacetime so compelling are retained. We refer to the resulting geometry as the Circular Disformal Kerr solution. Remarkably, key features such as the structure of Killing horizons, the ergosphere, and the absence of causality violations closely mirror those of the Kerr metric.

Recently, it was shown that quantum nonlocality can be certified even under a simultaneous arbitrary (but not full) relaxation of the assumptions of Measurement Independence (MI) and Parameter Independence (PI), using states of local dimension $d = poly((1-\u03b5)^{-1})$ for an $\u03b5\\in [0,1)$-relaxation. Here, we derive three results strengthening the state-of-art. Firstly, we show that states of constant local dimension $d$ are already sufficient to certify quantum nonlocality under arbitrary MI and PI relaxation, albeit in a non-robust manner. Secondly, and as a theoretical paradigm to derive the above, we introduce the notion of \\textit{measurement-dependent parameter-dependent locality} as the set of input-output behaviors under simultaneous relaxations of measurement and parameter independence. We provide a rigorous characterisation of the vertices of the polytope of joint input-output behaviors that obey a $\u03bc$-relaxation of MI and $\u03b5$-relaxation of PI. We highlight a relation between nonlocality certification under PI relaxation and that under detection inefficiencies by pointing out alternative extremal correlations to the Eberhard correlations that also allow to achieve detection efficiency of $\u03b7= 2/3$ in the two-input scenario. Finally, we study the implication of the relaxed assumptions for device-independent randomness certification.

Submitted to JHEAP", "summary": "In this work, two models of metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame are investigated as a dynamical description of the late-time cosmic expansion using binned Type~Ia Supernovae data. The aim is to provide an explanation for the effective running of the Hubble constant observed in both the binned Pantheon Sample and the Master Sample. To this end, the effective running Hubble constant $\\mathcal{H}(z)$ is defined as the ratio between the modified Hubble parameter and that of the standard cosmological model ($\u039b$CDM), multiplied by $H_0$. $\\mathcal{H}(z)$ serves as a diagnostic tool to capture deviations from the $\u039b$CDM model.\n  The first model used is a general representation of metric $f(R)$ gravity in which the gravitational Lagrangian is encoded in an effective redshift-dependent function that mimics the evolution of the Hubble parameter. Due to the limited redshift range covered by the available Supernovae Data, this function can be reliably approximated by a second-order Taylor expansion.\n  While this more general formulation yields a phenomenological fit that is compatible with that of the $\u039b$CDM for the binned Pantheon Sample, the model is not physically viable, as it generically leads to the emergence of an unphysical mass of the scalar field. This issue originates from an implicit restriction imposed on the Cauchy problem for the non-minimally coupled scalar field. To address this limitation, following previous studies, an additional condition on the modified Friedmann equation is introduced, enabling a fully consistent reformulation of the dynamics. The resulting framework not only preserves the agreement with Supernova~Ia data, but also provides a physical justification for the additional condition adopted in earlier analyses of late-time cosmological dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The distribution of non-classical and non-local correlations between the individual subsystems in an MDQN is of fundamental interest for many quantum protocols. Interestingly in an MDQN, the inseparability of two subsystems underlying entanglement can occur both between multiple distinct photons as well as between individual degrees of freedom associated with a single photon. In this work, we investigate the entanglement transfer enabled by the interplay of both entanglement between two distinct photons as well as inseparability between multiple degrees of freedom. For this purpose, we subject one photon of a polarization entangled two-photon pair to a discrete-time quantum walk introducing the position subsystem of the quantum walk as a third subsystem with qudit encoding. Here we study the resulting transfer of entanglement from the polarization degree of freedom, representing qubit encoding, towards the position degree of freedom, representing quidt encoding, via partial state tomography and correlation measurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u5b50\u5728\u591a\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4f20\u8f93\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4f20\u8f93\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u591a\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u6781\u5316\u7ea0\u7f20\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u91cf\u5b50\u6e38\u8d70\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c3\u4e2a\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u6001\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u6781\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u4f4d\u7f6e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Numerical solutions for static, spherically symmetric configurations reveal that a positive Lorentz-violating parameter $\\ell$ suppresses repulsive pressure, thereby enhancing gravitational binding and yielding more compact boson stars. Conversely, a negative $\\ell$ amplifies repulsive pressure and weakens gravitational binding, such that no static solutions exist beyond a critical negative value. These structural modifications imprint distinct features on EMRI dynamics, characterized by a monotonic decrease in both orbital eccentricity and radial range as $\\ell$ increases. Unlike the intermittent bursts from grazing orbits that resemble black-hole signals, penetrating orbits that enter the boson-star core exhibit sustained, amplitude-modulated gravitational-wave signatures without quiet intervals.

This work studies restricted-access inference: the memory register is persistent but inaccessible, while an experimenter may prepare and measure only accessible registers and may invoke the fixed read interaction.\n  Allowing the memory to be in an arbitrary quantum state (pure or mixed, possibly entangled with an inaccessible reference system, or a coherent superposition of truth tables), we establish a sharp, protocol-independent limitation of read-only access. For any finite-query protocol -- including arbitrary accessible ancillas, intermediate measurements, adaptivity, and general CPTP processing between queries -- the induced output state on the accessible registers depends on the memory state only through its diagonal in the truth-table basis. Equivalently, read-only access factors through dephasing (pinching) in that basis; coherences between distinct truth tables are operationally invisible.\n  Consequently, every memory-hypothesis testing task reduces to a standard state-discrimination problem on the accessible registers, and the minimum-error optimal measurement is characterized by Helstrom theory. We illustrate the framework with three explicit examples: (i) the phase-kickback reduction recovering the one-query Bernstein-Vazirani/Deutsch-Jozsa geometry, (ii) a minimal Helstrom instance with optimal success probability 3/4, and (iii) perfect indistinguishability of relative phases in entangled truth-table superpositions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53d7\u9650\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u8bfb\u53d6\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53d8\u5f97\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaU-QRAM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8bfb\u53d6\u53d7\u9650\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbf\u95ee\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89c4\u907f\u6b64\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

This is especially relevant in a dimensional reduction on such a manifold, which can then be compensated by using fermions that are appropriately charged under some Maxwell or Yang-Mills field defined on the internal manifold. A well known example in the physics literature is $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, which has four real dimensions and is the coset $SU(3)/U(2)$. In this paper we focus on a five-dimensional coset space, namely the Wu manifold $SU(3)/SO(3)_{\\rm max}$, where $SO(3)_{\\rm max}$ is maximal in $SU(3)$. Intriguingly, the Wu manifold does not admit a spin structure or spin$^c$ structure, it does admit a spin$^h$ structure. We provide a physical interpretation of the spin$^h$ structure by considering spinors that are coupled to an $SO(3)$ Yang-Mills field defined on the Wu manifold, but which carry half-integer \"isospin,\" thereby canceling the minus sign in the holonomy for uncharged spinors that provides the original obstruction to an ordinary spin structure. We also construct a gauge-covariantly constant spinor in the Wu manifold, and we show how this can be employed in order to construct spin$^h$ spinor harmonics from scalar harmonics. We provide a very explicit construction of all the scalar and spin$^h$ harmonics.

From a statistical point of view, the probabilistic description of particle motion provides a middle ground for transitioning from classical to quantum mechanics. An action functional obtained by coupling a Fisher information term produces a parametrically equivalent form of the de Broglie Bohm dBB equations. Next, we show that generalized Euler Lagrange equations can provide analytical solutions of dBB equations for certain simple stationary systems. One- and two-dimensional examples are provided to illustrate the similarities and differences between regular QM and the wave functions obtained from our generalization.

In this work, we apply QRC within a hybrid quantum classical framework for image denoising. The quantum reservoir is implemented using a Rydberg atom array, while a classical neural network serves as the readout layer. To prepare the input, images are first compressed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), reducing their dimensionality to match the size of the atom array. Each feature vector is encoded into local detuning parameters of a time-dependent Hamiltonian governing the Rydberg system. As the system evolves, it generates nonlinear embeddings through the measurement of observables across multiple time steps. These temporal embeddings capture complex correlations, which are fed into a classical neural network to reconstruct the denoised images. To evaluate performance, we compare this QRC-assisted model against a baseline architecture consisting of PCA followed by a dense neural network, trained under identical conditions. Our results show that the QRC-based approach achieves improved image sharpness and similar structural recovery compared to the PCA-based model. We demonstrate the practical viability of this framework through experiments on QuEra's Aquila neutral-atom processor, leveraging its programmable atom arrays to physically realize the reservoir dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By introducing a nonminimal coupling between the scalar prepotential and the extrinsic curvature of the static foliation, the flat-space first-order Bogomolny equation remains exactly valid for arbitrary static backgrounds. As a consequence, the kink profile is unchanged, while the effective potential and vacuum structure acquire a controlled geometric dependence. We show that these curved-space BPS kinks are always linearly stable. However, the existence of the translational zero mode is not guaranteed: its normalizability depends on the competition between the intrinsic length scale of the kink and the asymptotic curvature scale of the geometry. When the geometric scale dominates, the zero mode is removed and the soliton becomes geometrically pinned, despite remaining an exact BPS solution. Explicit realizations in AdS2 demonstrate how different static slicings of the same spacetime lead to qualitatively distinct physical outcomes, ranging from preserved translational invariance to its complete removal by horizons. These results establish geometry as a precise mechanism for controlling solitonic moduli without compromising linear stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6269\u5c55\u7684BPS\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u9759\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u66f2\u7387\u4e2d\u63cf\u8ff0\u6807\u91cf WRONG kinks\u7684(1+1)\u7ef4\u9759\u6001\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u9884\u8bbe\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u9759\u614b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5916\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e73\u76f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u9636Bogomolny\u65b9\u7a0b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b8c\u5168\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u5982\u4f55\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4kink\u8f6e\u5ed3\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u80fd\u548c\u96f6\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f2f\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684BPS-WRINKS\u603b\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u5426\u5e76\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff1a\u5176\u53ef\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8ekink\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u66f2\u7387\u6e10\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u5f53\u51e0\u4f55\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5360\u4f18\u65f6\uff0c\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u88ab\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u5b64\u5b50\u56e0\u6b64\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u88ab\u9489\u6b7b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b83\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684BPS-WRINKS\u3002\u4f7f\u7528AdS2\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9759\u6b62\u5207\u7247\u5bfc\u81f4 qualitatively\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ece\u4fdd\u7559\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u518d\u5230\u88ab\u89c6\u754c\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u5b64\u5b50\u6a21\u4f53\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bf9\u5b64\u7acb\u5b50\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u5728\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f2f\u66f2\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b64\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728(1+1)\u7ef4\u9759\u6001\u66f2\u7387\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u9884\u8bbe\u4e0e\u5916\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u76f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684BPS\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5f2f\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684kinks\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5f2f\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684BPS-WRINKS\u603b\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u5e73\u79fb\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u5426\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548ckink\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u9759\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u5207\u7247\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u5b64\u5b50\u6a21\u4f53\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

In the case of $V^{f \\natural}$, we fully classify the potential $N=1$ (and $N=4$)--preserving duality defects for cyclic Tambara--Yamagami categories TY$(\\mathbb{Z}_N)$, noting a curious relation to genus zero groups of monstrous moonshine. We use the correspondence with Leech lattice endomorphisms, discovered in [hep-th:2504.18619], to construct a number of non-trivial examples of TDLs in $V^{f \\natural}$, including examples of irrational quantum dimension. In particular, we fully classify and construct defects for the TY$(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ and TY$(\\mathbb{Z}_3)$ cases, and provide examples of duality defects for TY$(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ and Fibonacci fusion categories as well. In the case of K3 NLSMs, we describe a duality defect of irrational quantum dimension $\\sqrt{2}$ for the category TY$(\\mathbb{Z}_2, -1)$ in a particular torus orbifold, which exists on a 16-dimensional slice of the moduli space. We also provide a detailed analysis of spectral flow--preserving TDLs in Gepner models of K3, of independent interest, and use this to construct non-invertible defects for Fibonacci and $Rep(S_3)$ categories in particular examples. Finally we provide evidence for our conjecture in [hep-th:2504.18619] that special subcategories of such TDLs in $V^{f \\natural}$ correspond to $N=(4,4)$ and spectral flow--preserving defect lines in a corresponding K3 NLSM. In particular, we compute defect--twined elliptic genera for all non-invertible defects constructed in this article, demonstrating that for each defect found in a K3 NLSM, there is a corresponding defect in $V^{f \\natural}$ with coincident twining genus, and making a prediction for a number of TDLs in K3 NLSMs yet to be found.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Accurate noise fingerprints are essential, yet undocumented noise model differences between Quantum Ecosystems undermine core functionality, such as compilation, development and debugging, offering limited transferability and support for quantum software engineering (QSE) tasks. We propose a new research direction: live empirical noise fingerprinting as a lightweight QSE-oriented \"noise fingerprinting\". Though explored in physics as device-level diagnostics, we reposition them as a QSE paradigm: we propose leveraging classical shadow tomography to enable a new generation of techniques.

Here we present an end-to-end study of correlation spreading in a programmable Rydberg-atom chain realizing a longitudinal-field transverse-field Ising model, focusing on the joint impact of confinement and effective disorder. Experiments performed on QuEra's Aquila quantum processor are benchmarked against large-scale coherent emulations using the Juelich Quantum Annealing Simulator (JUQAS), enabling the controlled inclusion of realistic hardware imperfections. In the ideal coherent limit, a tunable longitudinal field induces confinement of domain-wall excitations into mesonic bound states, leading to a progressive truncation of the correlation light cone. When experimentally relevant inhomogeneities and fluctuations are included, correlations instead saturate at finite distance even in the nominally deconfined regime, revealing localization driven by emergent disorder. The close quantitative agreement between noisy emulations and experimental data allows us to attribute the observed saturation to specific hardware error channels and to identify the dominant contribution.

This tension has long obstructed the formulation of a relativistic master equation: standard Markovian approximations either break Lorentz covariance, trigger catastrophic vacuum heating, or depend arbitrarily on the observer's foliation. In this work, we derive a Lorentz-invariant description of irreversibility for quantum fields. We take an approach that explicitly models the measurements required to observe irreversible dynamics. Instead of evolving the system along an abstract geometric time parameter, we anchor the dynamics to a physical, relational scalar clock field. Using a relational Tomonaga-Schwinger framework, we derive a local, non-Markovian master equation that is manifestly covariant and completely positive. We show that the finite resolution of the physical clock acts as a covariant regulator, preventing the vacuum instability that plagues white-noise models. This framework demonstrates that a consistent relativistic theory of decay exists, provided the reference frame is treated as a dynamical quantum resource rather than a gauge choice. In a gravitating context, the resulting dynamics is described by a hybrid classical-quantum (CQ) evolution that remains completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here we show that chaos enables switchable eigenstate resources: avoided crossings in soft- versus strong- chaos windows selectively realize an entanglement-peak mode or a coherence-peak mode within the same system. Crucially, this chaos-controlled inversion is not tied to a particular notion of subsystems, appearing both in single-wave settings and in genuine many-body settings. From the quantum-chaos perspective, conventional diagnostics based on avoided-crossing phenomenology and eigenmode delocalization are insufficient; eigenfunction entanglement and basis coherence provide the missing discriminants. Using two wave-chaotic billiards and a tilted-field Ising chain, we track the information-theoretic response of eigenstates across localized hybridization windows. Even when avoided-crossing phenomenology and delocalization are comparable, the entanglement and coherence responses invert between soft- and strong-chaos regimes. In the Ising chain, a single microscopic knob, the global field tilt, toggles between the two operating modes and reveals a trade-off in which off-diagonal correlations grow as diagonal populations dip.

Our results establish a unified framework for characterizing optical quantum states from limited measurement data, enabling efficient certification of quantum states relevant to optical quantum information computation, communication and metrology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u70ed\u6d4b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4e2d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u7eaf\u5ea6\u548c\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3\u8d1f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5149\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u6d4b\u503c\u9886\u57df\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While the role of complex eigenvalues is well established, the nature of the corresponding eigenfunctions has remained a long-standing problem. Here we show that it arises from a fundamental entropic uncertainty trade-off between phase entropy and its Fourier representation. This trade-off enforces a correlated behavior of phase and Fourier entropies near avoided crossings and exceptional points, precisely where the Petermann factor diverges and phase rigidity collapses. Our results establish biorthogonality is not as an anomaly but an intrinsic property of eigenfunctions, arising universal manifestation of uncertainty relation in non-Hermitian systems. Beyond resolving this foundational question, our framework provides a unifying and testable principle that advances the fundamentals of non-Hermitian physics and can be directly verified with existing

On the one hand, we consider the quantum-classical dynamical distance $D_{\\mathrm{QC}}(t)$, which measures the departure of the time-evolved quantum state of a continuous-time quantum walk from the classical state of a random walk on the same graph. On the other, we analyse the joint probability distributions associated with sequential measurements of the walker's position, assessing their violation of the classical Kolmogorov consistency conditions via a dedicated quantifier $\\bar{K}(t)$. We demonstrate a quadratic short-time scaling of $\\bar{K}(t)$, which differs from the known linear scaling of $D_{\\mathrm{QC}}(t)$, but, as the latter, is fully determined by the degree of the initially occupied node and is independent of the global graph topology. At longer times, instead, $\\bar{K}(t)$ exhibits a pronounced topology-driven behavior: it is strongly suppressed on complete graphs while remaining finite and oscillatory on cycles, in contrast with the almost topology-independent asymptotics of $D_{\\mathrm{QC}}(t)$. We then extend the analysis to Markovian open-system dynamics, focusing on dephasing in the position basis (Haken-Strobl model) and in the energy basis (intrinsic decoherence). Site dephasing drives both quantifiers to zero, with the decay of $\\bar{K}(t)$ controlled by the spectral gap of the corresponding Lindblad generator. By contrast, energy-basis dephasing preserves a finite asymptotic value of $\\bar{K}(t)$, depending on the overlap structure of the Laplacian eigenspaces with the site basis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u91cf\u5b50\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5355\u4e00\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8ddd\u79bb\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8c\u6b21\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u800cK\u8fdd\u53cd\u91cf\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u62d3\u6251\u4e3b\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u91cf\u5b50\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ddd\u79bbD_QC(t)\u548c\u8fdd\u53cd\u91cfK\u0304(t)\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0K\u0304(t)\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4e0eD_QC(t)\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8c\u6b21\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u8005\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u3002\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0cK\u0304(t)\u53d7\u62d3\u6251\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u56fe\u4e2d\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u73af\u56fe\u4e2d\u632f\u8361\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u91cf\u5b50\u6e38\u8d70\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

By introducing frequency entanglement (discrete-color entangled states) into HOM interference, the characteristic HOM dip is modulated by sinusoidal fringes, which significantly enhance the sensitivity of HOM sensors. The frequency-entangled photon sources demonstrated to date rely on non-resonant parametric down-conversion (PDC), which limits the photon coherence length and, consequently, restricts the sensing dynamic range to the sub-millimeter scale. In this work, we demonstrate narrowband frequency-entangled photon source based on resonant PDC in a crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator.

The approach learns the parameters of a diagonal Hamiltonian through a classical training phase, while the quantum circuit itself performs only fixed-depth Hamiltonian evolution and mixing operations.

For structured datasets generated by an underlying function, oracle access can be avoided by expressing the Hamiltonian in the Walsh basis and retaining only a polynomial number of significant terms. In this regime, quantum state preparation is achieved in $\\text{poly}(n)$ time using $\\text{poly}(n)$ parameters, reaching infidelities on the order of $10^{-5}$.

This work introduces an alternative procedure for estimating spectral gaps on digital quantum devices using the Adiabatic Preparation technique to create a specific superposition state. The expectation values of observables measured on such a state exhibit time-dependent fluctuations which, through a fitting process, can be used to estimate the energy gap.

The robustness of the approach is corroborated by additional experiments on the real IonQ Aria device for the 1D Ising model up to 20 qubits, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method for currently available digital quantum devices and paving the way for more complex energy gap calculation requiring deeper circuits in the fault-tolerant era to come.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684adiabatic\u51c6\u5907\u6280\u672f\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u8c31\u95f4\u8ddd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5355\u72ec\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u6001\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u57fa\u6001\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528adiabatic\u51c6\u5907\u6280\u672f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u9699\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528adiabatic\u51c6\u5907\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u8be5\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u62df\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u9699\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57281D\u548c2D Ising\u6a21\u578b\u3001H2\u548cHe2\u5206\u5b50\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u8f83\u6d45\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e IonQ Aria \u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5bf91D Ising\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5904\u7406\u4e8620\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5373\u5c06\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684 fault-tolerant \u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u9699\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Motivated by the operational needs of the regional operator Silesian Railways in Poland, we formulate an acyclic mixed-integer linear program on a one-day horizon that incorporates depot balance constraints, demand-driven seat and bicycle capacity limits (which is a new aspect requested by the regional operator and local society of passengers), and simple crew availability constraints. The model is designed to support both baseline planning and disruption management under increased passenger demand. Using a graph-hypergraph representation of trips and single or coupled EMU movements, we first solve the problem with a classical ILP solver. We then derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) reformulation - which is frequently used as the input for quantum optimization - and evaluate its solution by quantum annealing on D-Wave Advantage systems and by the classical quantum-inspired VeloxQ solver. Computational experiments on real-world instances from the Silesian network, with up to 404 train trips and 11 EMU types, show that the ILP approach can obtain high-quality daily circulation plans within at most about 40 minutes, whereas current quantum and quantum-inspired solvers are restricted to substantially smaller sub-instances (up to 51 and 78 train trips, respectively) due to embedding and QUBO size limitations. These results quantify the present frontier of QUBO-based methods for rolling stock circulation and point towards hybrid decision-support architectures in which quantum or quantum-inspired optimizers address only local subproblems within a broader classical planning framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7535\u591a\u7528\uff08EMU\uff09\u6bcf\u65e5\u8f66

This framework thus enables scalable and fair cross-platform comparisons and tracks meaningful computational advancement.

Krylov subspace methods, such as Krylov Quantum Diagonalization and Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization, are promising approaches for this task on near-term quantum computers. However, both require repeated quantum circuit executions for each Krylov subspace and for every new Hamiltonian, posing a major bottleneck under noisy hardware constraints. We introduce Generative Krylov Subspace Representations (GenKSR), a framework that learns a classical generative representation of the entire Krylov diagonalization process. To enable effective modeling of quantum systems, GenKSR leverages a conditional generative model framework. We investigate two representative backbone architectures, the standard Transformer and the Mamba state-space model. By learning the distribution of measurement outcomes conditioned on Hamiltonian parameters and evolution time, GenKSR generates Krylov subspace samples for unseen Hamiltonians and for larger subspace dimensions than those used in training. This enables full energy reconstruction purely from the classical model, without additional quantum experiments. We validate our approach through simulations of 15-qubit 1D and 16-qubit 2D Heisenberg models, as well as a hardware experiment on a 20-qubit XXZ chain executed on an IBM quantum processor. Our model successfully learns the distribution from experimental data and generates a high-fidelity representation of the quantum process. This representation enables classical reproduction of experimental outcomes, supports reliable energy estimates for unseen Hamiltonians, and significantly reduces the need for further quantum computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This system to a large extent mimics -- outside of the Rydberg-blockade regime -- a circular array of neutral atoms interacting through van-der-Waals type interaction. We investigate the preparation of $W$ and Dicke states in this system starting from the default initial state $|00\\ldots 0\\rangle$ using two different optimal-control approaches: (i) NMR-like pulse sequence, which consists of instantaneous (delta-shaped) control- and Ising-interaction pulses, and (ii) time-dependent control scheme, which entails shaped control pulses in the presence of always-on Ising interaction between adjacent qubits. By making use of the underlying dihedral symmetry of this system -- which allows one to use a symmetry-adapted computational basis with $\\mathcal{O}(2^N / N)$ states in an $N$-qubit system -- and utilizing advanced global-optimization methods, we find optimal sequences of pulses for realizing $W$ and Dicke states within both approaches. In addition, we demonstrate robustness of these sequences against unavoidable control errors. Finally, using typical values of parameters in realistic Rydberg-atom systems, we show that our control schemes enable the preparation of the desired multiqubit states on time scales much shorter than the relevant coherence times of those systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u72b6\u9635\u5217\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5229\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u90bbIsing\u578b\u8026\u5408\u548c\u6a2a\u7eb5\u5411\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u573a\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u4e92\u76f8\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\uff0c\u8fdb\u884cW\u6001\u548c\u6234\u514b\u6001\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NMR\u7c7b\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5de5\u7a0b\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u5149\u954a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u73af\u72b6\u73af\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u90bbIsing\u578b\u8026\u5408\u548c\u6a2a\u7eb5\u5411\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u573a\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u4e92\u76f8\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6240\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u91c7\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6765\u5408\u6210W\u6001\u548c\u6234\u514b\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u76f8\u90bb\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u7684Ising\u578b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u72b6\u9635\u5217\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u90fd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5408\u6210W\u6001\u548c\u6234\u514b\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4NMR\u7c7b\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u5728\u5178\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5f53\u77ed\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5408\u6210\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u5149\u954a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u72b6\u9635\u5217\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u90bbIsing\u578b\u8026\u5408\u548c\u6a2a\u7eb5\u5411\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u6a21\u4eff\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u4e92\u76f8\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6240\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86W\u6001\u548c\u6234\u514b\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5408\u6210\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing continuous-variable gate constructions rely predominantly on polynomial functions of canonical quadratures. In this work, we introduce a complementary universality paradigm based on trigonometric continuous-variable gates, which enable a Fourier-like representation of bosonic operators and are particularly well suited for periodic and non-perturbative interactions. We present a deterministic ancilla-based method for implementing unitary and non-unitary trigonometric gates whose arguments are arbitrary Hermitian functions of qumode quadratures. As a concrete application, we develop a hybrid qubit-qumode quantum simulation of the lattice sine-Gordon model. Using these gates, we prepare ground states via quantum imaginary-time evolution, simulate real-time dynamics, compute time-dependent vertex two-point correlation functions, and extract quantum kink profiles under topological boundary conditions. Our results demonstrate that trigonometric continuous-variable gates provide a physically natural framework for simulating interacting field theories on near-term hybrid quantum hardware, while establishing a parallel route to universality beyond polynomial gate constructions. We expect that the trigonometric gates introduced here to find broader applications, including quantum simulations of condensed matter systems, quantum chemistry, and biological models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

As such, various noise sources have been investigated that degrade the operation of such devices. In this paper, we examine a situation with phase noise between different modes of the input state leading to dephasing of the system. This models the phase fluctuations which remain even when the mean phase is controlled. We aim to determine whether these phase-noisy input states still form a computationally difficult problem. To do this, we use Matrix Product Operators to model the system, a technique recently used to model boson sampling scenarios.

However, it typically incurs a measurement overhead exponential in the number of cut locations, and it remains open whether this scaling is fundamentally unavoidable. In conventional circuit-cutting approaches based on the quasiprobability decomposition (QPD), for example, rescaling factors lead to an exponential dependence on the number of cuts. In this work, we show that such an exponential scaling is not universal: it can be circumvented for tree-structured quantum circuits via concatenated quantum tomography protocols. We first consider estimating the expectation value of an observable within additive error $\u03b5$ for a tree-structured circuit with tree depth 1 (two layers), maximum branching factor $R$, and bond dimension at most $d$ on each edge. Our approach uses quantum tomography to construct, for each cut edge, a local decomposition that eliminates the rescaling factors in conventional QPD, instead introducing a controllable bias set by the tomography sample size. After cutting $R$ edges, we show that $\\mathcal{O}(d^3R^3\\ln(dR)/\u03b5^2)$ total measurements suffice, including tomography cost. Next, we extend the tree-depth-1 case to general trees of depth $L\\geq2$, and give an algorithm whose total measurement cost $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^3K^{5}/\u03b5^2)$ scales polynomially with the number of cuts for complete $R$-ary trees. Finally, we perform an information-theoretic analysis to show that, in a comparable tree-depth-1 setting, conventional QPD-based wire-cutting methods require at least $\u03a9((d+1)^R/\u03b5^2)$ measurements. This exponential separation highlights the significance of tomography-based construction for reducing measurement overhead in hybrid quantum-classical computations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Their non-stabilizerness provides the additional resource required to overcome the constraints of stabilizer codes, as formalized by the Eastin-Knill theorem, while still permitting fault-tolerant distillation. Although numerous measures of magic have been introduced, not every state with nonzero magic has been shown to be distillable by a stabilizer code, and all currently known distillable states arise as special cases of Clifford-stabilizer states, defined as pure states uniquely stabilized by finite subgroups of the Clifford group. In this work, we develop a general framework for group-covariant functionals on the real manifold of Hermitian operators. We formalize the notions of $G$-stabilizer spaces, states, and codes for arbitrary finite subgroups $G \\subset \\mathrm{U}(\\mathcal{H})$, and introduce analytic families of $G$-covariant functionals. Our main theorem shows that any $G$-invariant pure state is an extremal point of a broad class of derived functionals, including symmetric, max-type, and R\u00e9nyi-type functionals, provided the underlying family is $G$-covariant. This extremality holds for variations restricted to directions orthogonal to the stabilized subspace while preserving purity. Specializing to the Pauli and Clifford groups, our framework unifies the extremality structure of several canonical magic measures, including mana, stabilizer R\u00e9nyi entropies, and stabilizer fidelity. In particular, Clifford-stabilizer states extremize these measures. We classify such states for qubits, qutrits, ququints, and two-qubit systems, identifying new candidates for magic distillation protocols.

The density of states estimation technique involved sampling the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian to approximate the partition function, providing a basis for thermodynamic quantity computation at any temperature.", "result": "The study discovered parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that yield results comparable to standard classical Monte Carlo methods, specifically Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. On a 25-spin \u00b1J hardware graph, native Ising models were evaluated, and the quantum methods showed comparable accuracy. Particularly on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU, there was a significant achievement with a logarithmic relative error of 7.6\u00d710^-6, achieved from 171,000 samples generated in 0.2 seconds of QPU time with each sample taking 8 nanoseconds of anneal time. This achieved super fast speeds, even being comparable within the closed-system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits.", "conclusion": "The research conclusively demonstrates that quantum annealing methods can now achieve high accuracy in partition function approximation for Ising models, particularly with the Pegasus architecture. It opens new possibilities for applying quantum annealing in fields like sampling, low-temperature simulations, and partition function calculations, marking a significant step towards practical quantum computing applications for combinatorial optimization problems with quantum systems."}}
