This model fully accounts for the Coulomb singularity of each\nelectron with the core, as well as for the interaction of a recolliding\nelectron with a bound electron. The model avoids artificial autoionization by\nemploying effective Coulomb potentials to describe the interaction between\nbound electrons. Using the extended effective-Coulomb-potential for bound-bound\nelectrons (ECBB) model, we compute triple and double ionization spectra. For\ninstance, we compute the distributions of the sum of the final momenta along\nthe laser field of the escaping electrons. Taking focal volume averaging into\naccount, we find very good agreement with experimental results, particularly\nfor triple ionization.

The interplay of dynamical correlation\neffects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a\nwide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band\ndegeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent\nmaximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully\nreproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy\nresults alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy\nof local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy\nmeasurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the\nstronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the\nelectron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and\nstability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping.

Further, we perform spectral\nstatistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with\nperturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson\nstatistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\\langle r\n\\rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute\nthe ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\\langle S\n\\rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the\nlimit $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, which further confirms the QI.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Recently, a one-to-one correspondence between non-trivial non-Hermitian\ntopology and directional amplification has been demonstrated, theoretically and\nexperimentally, for the case of one complex band. Here, we extend our framework\nto multiple bands and higher spatial dimension. This proves to be far from\ntrivial. Building on the singular value decomposition, we introduce a new\nquantity that we dub generalised singular spectrum (GSS). The GSS allows us to\ndefine physically meaningful bands related to the system's scattering behaviour\nand to define invariants for novel notions of point gaps (non-Hermitian\ntopology) and line gaps (Hermitian-like topology), respectively. For both\ninvariants, we prove a bulk-boundary correspondence and show that they give\nrise to two different kinds of topological edge modes. We illustrate our\nresults with a 1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and a 2D\nnon-Hermitian model that features corner-to-corner amplification. Our work is\nrelevant for many state-of-the-art experimental platforms and it sets the stage\nfor applications such as novel directional amplifiers and non-reciprocal\nsensors."}

The interplay of dynamical correlation\neffects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a\nwide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band\ndegeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent\nmaximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully\nreproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy\nresults alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy\nof local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy\nmeasurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the\nstronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the\nelectron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and\nstability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping. Our\nresults show that even fine-level structures in the experimental data can now\nbe faithfully reproduced and understood."}

We study the dynamical process of\nscattering of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of Gaussian\nwavepackets from skyrmions with the aid of the non-relativistic time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. The scattering cross section shows a rich angular\ndependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the\nspin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial\noutcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities\nirrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts\nassociated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound\nstate at the scattering center. In addition to the rich and intriguing physics,\nthe numerical recipe developed here can be easily adopted for any arbitrary\nspin texture, which will prepare a playground to explore tunable spin\ntransport."}

In the study of fracton\nphases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by\nstarting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which\ncondenses a composite \"particle-string\" object. In a recent work\n[arXiv:2505.13604], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can\nbe viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper,\nwe study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging\nweb relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases\nprotected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry\nfractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of\ntopological symmetries by subsystem symmetries.

However, the stability\ndiagrams that allow the identification of the desired charge states are long to\nacquire. Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state\nincreases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability\ndiagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor.\nCurrently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach\nshows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in\nthe number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an\nautotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by\nharnessing the FPGA embedded in Keysight's Quantum Engineering Toolkit (QET),\nthe measurement time of stability diagrams has been reduced by a factor of 9.8.\nThis led to an acceleration factor of 2.2 for the total initialization time of\na SiGe quantum dot into the single-electron regime, which is limited by the\nPython code execution."}

Meanwhile, the\nconcept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an\nintrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time\ngeometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely\nrelated to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT,\nparticularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a\nholographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the\nouter edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its\nfixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's\nfunction in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter\nspace, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's\nfunction and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge\nof the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's\nfunction. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard\nmodel, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition\nin the deep interior."}

We\nfind that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength\nfor the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase\ntransition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics\nof the transition. Although the emergence of coherence during fast ramps from\nMI to the ($\\chi$-)SF regime is continuous in both cases, for ramps longer than\na few tunnelling times, significant differences emerge. In the \\frs case, no\nlong-range order emerges on the studied timescales, highlighting a\nsignificantly reduced rate or even saturation of the emerging coherence.
