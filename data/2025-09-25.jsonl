This model fully accounts for the Coulomb singularity of each\nelectron with the core, as well as for the interaction of a recolliding\nelectron with a bound electron. The model avoids artificial autoionization by\nemploying effective Coulomb potentials to describe the interaction between\nbound electrons. Using the extended effective-Coulomb-potential for bound-bound\nelectrons (ECBB) model, we compute triple and double ionization spectra. For\ninstance, we compute the distributions of the sum of the final momenta along\nthe laser field of the escaping electrons. Taking focal volume averaging into\naccount, we find very good agreement with experimental results, particularly\nfor triple ionization.

We address these questions by introducing a fully\nquantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media using\nhigh-harmonic generation as a nonlinear observable.

The interplay of dynamical correlation\neffects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a\nwide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band\ndegeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent\nmaximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully\nreproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy\nresults alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy\nof local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy\nmeasurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the\nstronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the\nelectron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and\nstability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping.

The first choice is,\nsomewhat surprisingly, the most involved, and in this paper we discuss it in\ndetail. In particular, we show that the choice of bulk $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry\ndetermines all boundary $F$-symbols with a single incoming $N$-ality defect,\nand that any theory with an $N$-ality symmetry is invariant under a certain\ntwisted gauging given in terms of these $F$-symbols. These $F$-symbols can\nfurthermore be input into the pentagon identities to obtain the other\n$F$-symbols, up to freedoms related to the choices appearing in the second and\nthird steps of bulk gauging.

It has a compensated $A$-type\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state where the in-plane ferromagnetic (FM)\nmoments in each layer are stacked antiferromagnetically along the $c$ axis, yet\nexhibits a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that breaks the $T$-symmetry\nwith a vanishingly small $c$-axis FM moment.

Further, we perform spectral\nstatistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with\nperturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson\nstatistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\\langle r\n\\rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics.

Here, we extend our framework\nto multiple bands and higher spatial dimension. This proves to be far from\ntrivial. Building on the singular value decomposition, we introduce a new\nquantity that we dub generalised singular spectrum (GSS). The GSS allows us to\ndefine physically meaningful bands related to the system's scattering behaviour\nand to define invariants for novel notions of point gaps (non-Hermitian\ntopology) and line gaps (Hermitian-like topology), respectively. For both\ninvariants, we prove a bulk-boundary correspondence and show that they give\nrise to two different kinds of topological edge modes. We illustrate our\nresults with a 1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and a 2D\nnon-Hermitian model that features corner-to-corner amplification. Our work is\nrelevant for many state-of-the-art experimental platforms and it sets the stage\nfor applications such as novel directional amplifiers and non-reciprocal\nsensors."}

The interplay of dynamical correlation\neffects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a\nwide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band\ndegeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent\nmaximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully\nreproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy\nresults alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy\nof local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy\nmeasurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the\nstronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the\nelectron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and\nstability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping. Our\nresults show that even fine-level structures in the experimental data can now\nbe faithfully reproduced and understood."}

The scattering cross section shows a rich angular\ndependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the\nspin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial\noutcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities\nirrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts\nassociated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound\nstate at the scattering center.

Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state\nincreases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability\ndiagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor.\nCurrently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach\nshows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in\nthe number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an\nautotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by\nharnessing the FPGA embedded in Keysight's Quantum Engineering Toolkit (QET),\nthe measurement time of stability diagrams has been reduced by a factor of 9.8.\nThis led to an acceleration factor of 2.2 for the total initialization time of\na SiGe quantum dot into the single-electron regime, which is limited by the\nPython code execution."}

In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely\nrelated to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT,\nparticularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a\nholographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the\nouter edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its\nfixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's\nfunction in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter\nspace, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's\nfunction and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge\nof the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's\nfunction.

We\nfind that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength\nfor the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase\ntransition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics\nof the transition.
