We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to\nband engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$\nin the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole\nfilling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model\nfor twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moir\\'e\nhoneycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost\nbands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent\nHartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent\nHubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad\nparameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich\nvariety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future\nexperiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar\nspin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial\nspin-density wave."}

We\nresolve this challenge by introducing families of generative quantum models\nthat are hard to simulate classically, are efficiently trainable, exhibit no\nbarren plateaus or proliferating local minima, and can learn to generate\ndistributions beyond the reach of classical computers.

For translation-invariant\nquadratic fermionic chains with interactions extending to $m$ neighbors and\nperiodic boundary conditions, the Loschmidt amplitude admits a unitary\nmatrix-model / Toeplitz representation, which yields a work variable of the\nform $W=\\sum_{r\\le m} a_r\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\,U^r$ (and in models with\npairing terms -- superconducting pairing -- additional\n$b_r\\,\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\,U^r$ terms appear). By invoking multivariate\ncentral limit theorems for vectors of traces of unitaries, we obtain a Gaussian\ndistribution for $P(W)$ with variance $\\mathrm{Var}(W)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_r\nr\\,(a_r^2+b_r^2)$ and asymptotic independence across different powers. We also\ncharacterise the conditions under which non-Gaussian tails arise, for example\nfrom many interaction terms or their slow decay, as well as the appearance of\nFisher--Hartwig singularities. We illustrate these mechanisms in the XY chain.\nVarious numerical diagnostics support the analytical results."}

Practically, to execute such quantum circuits, we need to pass\ncommands to a programmable quantum computer. Existing programming approaches,\ndedicated to generic unitary transformations, are inefficient in terms of the\ncomputational resources under the low-depth assumption and remain far from\nsatisfactory. As such, to realize NISQ algorithms, it is crucial to find an\nefficient way to program low-depth circuits as the qubit number $N$ increases.\nHere, we investigate the gate complexity and the size of quantum memory (known\nas the program cost) required to program low-depth brickwork circuits. We\nunveil a $\\sim N \\text{poly} \\log N$ worst-case program cost of universal\nprogramming of low-depth brickwork circuits in the large $N$ regime, which is a\ntight characterization. Moreover, we analyze the trade-off between the cost of\ndescribing the layout of local gates and the cost of programming them to the\ntargeted unitaries via the light-cone argument. Our findings suggest that\nfaithful gate-wise programming is optimal in the low-depth regime."}

In this paper, we\npropose a three-layer fat-tree network architecture for QDCs, designed to\naddress these challenges.

In this work, we\nsystematically investigate the interplay between eigenenergy braiding and Berry\nphase accumulation in two-level non-Hermitian systems hosting pairs of EPs. EP\npairs are classified into four distinct classes according to the vorticity of\neigenenergies, the Berry phase accumulated during encircling, and the\neigenstate projection onto a basis state. Their associated topological\nstructures are analyzed using effective two-level models. These classifications\nare further substantiated by numerical simulations in optical microcavities\nwith three scatterers, where EPs emerge in the complex frequency spectrum. By\nencircling different EP pairs in parameter space, we demonstrate that the\nresulting topological features such as trivial or non-trivial braiding and\nBerry phase accumulation are directly linked to the vorticity structure and\neigenmode evolution. In particular, we show that the eigenstate projection onto\na basis state near EPs manifests as chiral optical modes in microcavities,\nproviding an experimentally accessible signature of the underlying topological\nstructure.

In this work, we\ncomparatively study emission characteristics of colloidal PbS/CdS (core/shell)\nquantum dots at telecom wavelengths on different substrates, where two\ndifferent sets of quantum dots emitting within and outside the\nepsilon-near-zero region are deposited on both glass and indium tin oxide (ITO)\nsubstrates. Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the\nepsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence\nlifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a\nrelative emission cone narrowing from 17.6{\\deg} to 10.3{\\deg}. These results\nunderline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the\nspectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the\npotential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration\ninto next-generation quantum photonic devices.
