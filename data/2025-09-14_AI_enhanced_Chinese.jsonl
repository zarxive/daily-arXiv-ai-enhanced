Here, we show how isotope-induced inversion symmetry\nbreaking influences ultrafast photoisomerization processes in ethylene. Using\nextreme ultraviolet pump-near infrared probe time-of-flight mass spectrometry,\nwe find that replacing one of the carbon atoms in ethylene with a 13C isotope\nleads to twice-faster structural relaxation via ethylene-ethylidene\nisomerization in the photo-excited molecular cation. Advanced trajectory\nsurface hopping calculations incorporating the nuclear symmetry of the\nmolecular systems, reveal that it arises from the mixing of different normal\nmodes in the isotope-substituted species, interactions otherwise forbidden by\nsymmetry.

In this study, by combining\nhigh-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical\ncalculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the\ntrilayer nickelate superconductor $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ at ambient pressure. We\nreveal a dichotomy in the electronic band renormalizations of\n$La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ in comparison to cuprate superconductors. At a high energy\nscale of hundreds of meV, its band structure is strongly renormalized by\nelectron correlation effect enhanced by Hund coupling.

Taking into account the magnon dynamics\nvia the magnetic flux, we present an effective circuit model of gain-driven\nMPs, which allows to manipulate the coupling strength of MPs by tuning the size\nof a ferromagnet and incorporates the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons due to\nthe shape magnetic anisotropy. In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr\nnonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon\ncoupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent\nmagnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also\neffectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies,\nresulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one\nto widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic\nfield. These findings indicate that there is a trade-off relation between the\ncoupling strength of MPs and the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons.

It\ncan only correct up to half the code distance and must output a unique answer.\nQuantum list decoding offers a promising alternative. By allowing the decoder\nto output a short list of possible errors, it becomes possible to tolerate far\nmore errors, even under worst-case noise. But two fundamental questions remain:\nwhich quantum codes support list decoding, and can we design decoding schemes\nthat are secure against efficient, computationally bounded adversaries? In this\nwork, we answer both. To identify which codes are list-decodable, we provide a\ngeneralized version of the Knill-Laflamme conditions.

Their associated topological\nstructures are analyzed using effective two-level models. These classifications\nare further substantiated by numerical simulations in optical microcavities\nwith three scatterers, where EPs emerge in the complex frequency spectrum. By\nencircling different EP pairs in parameter space, we demonstrate that the\nresulting topological features such as trivial or non-trivial braiding and\nBerry phase accumulation are directly linked to the vorticity structure and\neigenmode evolution. In particular, we show that the eigenstate projection onto\na basis state near EPs manifests as chiral optical modes in microcavities,\nproviding an experimentally accessible signature of the underlying topological\nstructure. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding multi-EP\ntopology and offer practical pathways toward their realization and control in\nphotonic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Non-Hermitian systems with EPs exhibit unique topological phenomena, and this work classifies EP pairs into four types based on their braiding and Berry phases, with experiments confirming their significance in photonic systems.", "motivation": "Understanding topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems is crucial for advancing photonics and related fields.

In addition, signatures of\nvan Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir\\'e valence bands,\nsuggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states in\nthis moir\\'e semiconductor. Based on a Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum\nmodel, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the\nsystem's moir\\'e valence band structure, focusing on both, the evolution of the\nDirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions\nacross the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to\nband engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$\nin the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole\nfilling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model\nfor twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moir\\'e\nhoneycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost\nbands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent\nHartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent\nHubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad\nparameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich\nvariety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future\nexperiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar\nspin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial\nspin-density wave.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper discusses the tuning of a relativistic Mott transition in twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide through twist angle, revealing potential for strongly-correlated states and magnetic phases.", "motivation": "Understanding the electronic phases and phase transitions in moir\u00e9 semiconductors is crucial for exploring topological and correlated electronic states.", "method": "A Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum model was used to analyze the twist-angle dependence of the moir\u00e9 valence band structure, including Dirac excitations and Fermi-surface Lifshitz transitions.

We show that in $U(1)$ lattice gauge\ntheory, where finite action configurations are monopole loops, small loops at\nlarge separations also interact with the same type of $1/r^4$ interaction. If\none ignores the classical interactions between monopoles, following the same\nidea as in Yang-Mills theory, the one-monopole partition function is also\ninfrared divergent at strong coupling. However, $1/r^4$ interactions among\nsmall loops should be viewed as a consequence of multipole expansion, and\nemanate from $1/r^2$ interaction between current segments. Taking interactions\ninto account, one can prove that the strongly coupled $U(1)$ lattice gauge\ntheory is dual to a lattice abelian Higgs model, and more importantly, free of\ninfrared divergences. The model exhibits mass gap and confinement by monopole\ncondensation. We suggest that the structure of moduli space of instantons, ADHM\ndata, and the long ranged classical interactions in pure Yang-Mills theory\nshould be examined with this refined perspective. We conjecture that, in\ncontradistinction to the current views on the subject, internal structure of\ninstantons in Yang-Mills theory is responsible for confinement in $4d$ ,\nsimilar to sigma model in $d=2$ dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u7ef4\u6768-\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u77ac\u65f6\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u957f\u7a0b\u78c1\u5076\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u77ac\u65f6\u5b50\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728U(1)\u683c\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0f\u73af\u8def\u4e4b\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u7a0b1/r^4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u67d0\u79cd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u65e0\u7ea2\u5916\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u7c7b\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u8d77\u5230\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u7ef4\u6768-\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u5b50\u548c\u5b83\u4eec\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u7535\u8377\u675f\u7f1a\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790ADHM\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u76f8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0U(1)\u683c\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\uff0c\u7531\u5355\u6781\u675f\u7f1a\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u56db\u7ef4\u6768-\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u77ed\u7a0b\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u9a71\u52a84d\u4e2d\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u03c3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002"}}

Further, the three-stroke engine (without\nthe adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine.\nFor arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the\ntotal work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work\noutputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines.

To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we establish and validate\na hybrid quantum-classical comparison framework, benchmarking quantum\napproaches against classical Monte Carlo simulations and Black-Scholes methods.\nBeyond simply computing option prices, we emphasize the trade-off between\naccuracy and computational resources, offering insights into the potential\nadvantages and limitations of quantum approaches for different problem scales.\nOur results contribute to understanding the feasibility of quantum methods in\nfinance and guide the optimal allocation of quantum resources in hybrid\nquantum-classical workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e86ixed asset\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u591a\u8d44\u4ea7\u5173\u4e4e\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4f20\u7edfBS\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53ca\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u8d44\u4ea7\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6b32\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5b50\u5e45\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u548cBS\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u4ea7\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u91cf\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8d44\u4ea7\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9192\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u4e2d\u7684\u66f4\u5927\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

We\nderive the expressions for the electromagnetic field correlations with itself\nand with its spatial derivatives, still at the locations of the moving points.\nSince the points we consider are accelerating, both the zero-point fluctuations\nand the blackbody spectrum give non-trivial results, for two-point correlations\nas well as for self-correlations. In both cases, results are shown at any\nvacuum temperature. For practical uses, we provide the first-order\napproximations in the small parameter {\\Omega}r/c with c being the speed of\nlight.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Spacetime codes have emerged as a\nnatural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while\nleveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on\nchain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations\nbetween them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding\nproblems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence\nof two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain\ncomplexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits,\nfault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this\nframework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer\ncodes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be\ntransformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant\nproperties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the\nunderlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex\nconstructions.
