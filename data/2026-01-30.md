### [1] [Multiple binding modes of AKT on PIP$_3$-containing membranes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21216)
*Yuki Nakagaki,Eiji Yamamoto*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: AKT multidomain serine/threonine kinase cooperates with its PH and kinase domains to regulate membrane binding through distinct binding modes influenced by PIP3 concentration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding AKT's membrane binding regulation is fundamental for elucidating PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in cell biology.

Method: Molecular dynamics simulations of full-length AKT on PIP3 lipid bilayers identified four membrane-binding modes, analyzing PH and kinase domain interactions.

Result: Four distinct binding modes were observed with varying PIP3 binding patterns and kinase domain orientations; PIP3 interacts with both canonical and secondary sites in PH domain and exposed activation-loop in kinase domain in the most stable mode.

Conclusion: Cooperation of PH and kinase domains in AKT membrane binding is shaped by membrane lipid interactions, which influence AKT activation and signaling specificity.

Abstract: The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is triggered by recruitment of AKT to cellular membranes. Although AKT is a multidomain serine/threonine kinase composed of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, how these domains cooperate to regulate AKT activation on membranes remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of full-length AKT on PIP$_3$-containing lipid bilayers, we identify four distinct membrane-binding modes that differ in the orientations and membrane contacts of the PH and kinase domains. In addition to PIP$_3$ binding to the PH domain, we observe specific PIP$_3$ interactions with basic residues in the kinase domain. In the most stable mode, PIP$_3$ interacts with both the canonical and a secondary binding site in the PH domain, while the kinase domain adopts an orientation in which the activation-loop phosphorylation site is exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, the populations of these binding modes depend on the PIP$_3$ concentration in the membrane, leading to changes in the preferred orientation of AKT. These findings shed light on how lipid recognition by the PH domain and the kinase domain of AKT cooperatively shape its membrane-bound conformations.

Conclusion: 为研究复 волн系统的非线性行为提供了实验证据

Abstract: Unequal-time correlation functions fundamentally characterize emergent statistical properties in complex systems, yet their direct measurement in experiments is challenging. We report the experimental observation of two-time, ballistic correlations in a photonic platform governed by the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Using a recirculating optical fiber loop with heterodyne field detection, we acquire the full space-time dynamics of partially coherent optical waves and extract the intensity correlator in stationary states of integrable turbulence. The correlators collapse under ballistic rescaling and quantitatively agree with predictions from Generalized Hydrodynamics evaluated using the density of states obtained via inverse scattering analysis of the recorded fields. Our results provide a direct, parameter-free test of GHD in an integrable waves system.

### [3] [Spin angular momentum transfer in the Einstein-de Haas effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20946)
*Xin Nie,Wenhao Luo,Kun Cao,Dao-Xin Yao*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Magnets can transfer angular momentum to rigid bodies through the Einstein-de Haas effect, with phonons playing a major role in energy transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding angular momentum transfer in magnetic crystals has applications in magneto-mechanical devices.

Method: Used the Eckart frame to analyze spin angular momentum transfer between phonons and rigid-body rotation in magnetic crystals with pseudo-dipolar anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions.

Result: Stronger pseudo-dipolar anisotropy increases angular momentum transfer, while stronger Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions accelerate the transfer and enhance phonon angular momentum.

Conclusion: Phonons are essential participants in the Einstein-de Haas effect, and controlling their angular momentum can be achieved through different interaction strengths, contributing to the development of magneto-mechanical technologies.

Abstract: We investigate spin angular momentum transfer in the Einstein-de Haas effect within prototypical magnetic crystals, focusing on its partition between phonons and rigid-body rotation. Using the Eckart frame to decouple local vibrations (phonons) from rigid-body rotation, we demonstrate that spin angular momentum is simultaneously transferred into both phonons and rigid-body rotation in an asymmetric way: rigid-body rotation acquires the dominant share of angular momentum, while phonons absorb most of the resulting kinetic energy. This divergent transfer of angular momentum and energy identifies phonons as direct and indispensable participants in the Einstein-de Haas dynamics. Furthermore, we find that pseudo-dipolar anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction exert distinct control over the angular momentum transfer. Stronger pseudo-dipolar anisotropy increases the total amount of transferred angular momentum, whereas stronger Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction accelerates the transfer rate and increases the proportion of phonon angular momentum. Our work clarifies the microscopic picture of the Einstein-de Haas effect and enables targeted angular-momentum control in magneto-mechanical devices.

Abstract: We show that certain three-dimensional topological phases can act as acoustic diodes realizing nonlinear odd acoustoelastic effects. Beyond uncovering topologically-induced anomalous acoustic second-harmonic generation and rectification, we demonstrate how such nonlinear responses are uniquely captured by the momentum-space nonmetricity tensor in the quantum state Hilbert-space geometry. In addition to completing the classification of quantum geometric observables in the quadratic response regime, our findings reveal unexplored avenues for experimental realizations of acoustic diodes using effective $θ$ vacua of axion insulators adaptable for topological engineering applications.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了微波功率对磁动量-光耦合的影响，在’yG-sphere/split-ring-resonator’混合系统中发现，非线性自旋波相互作用抑制了耦合，主要通过增强的磁静模式的功耗。当微波功率增加时，磁动量宽度逐渐减小，最终在外部磁场 above a threshold时完全抑制了耦合。这种现象源于Suhl的一阶不稳定性：磁静模式在与振荡器相互作用时，通过参数激发两个反向传播的磁动量，在其频率的一半上，导致外部磁场 below the threshold的磁动量模式消失，而 above的则保持稳定。这些结果明确了磁动量-光耦合系统的非线性边界，为非线性磁性器件的功能性提供了有利的参数范围。

Abstract: We investigate the microwave-power dependence of magnon-photon coupling in a yttrium iron garnet-sphere/split-ring-resonator hybrid system at room temperature and demonstrate that nonlinear spin-wave interactions suppress the coupling through power-induced dissipation of magnetostatic modes. At low microwave power, the modes exhibit pronounced level repulsion, evidencing strong coupling to the microwave field. As the power increases, however, magnon linewidth broadening progressively weakens the coupling and ultimately suppresses it entirely below a threshold external magnetic field. We show that this behavior originates from Suhl's first-order instability: magnetostatic modes, which couple to the resonator, parametrically excites two counter-propagating magnons at half its frequency, causing modes below the threshold external magnetic field to vanish. In contrast, magnon modes above the threshold field remain robust even at high power, as the instability criterion is not satisfied in that regime. These results reveal a well-defined nonlinear boundary for magnon-photon coupled systems and highlight a favorable regime for exploiting nonlinear magnonics for frequency conversion, switching, and other functional magnonic devices.

### [6] [Rocket-like dynamics of ferrimagnetic domain walls in graded materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21068)
*P. Diona,S. Artyukhin,L. Maranzana*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Domain wall motion is key to advanced spintronic technologies, and spatially varying magnetic properties can accelerate domain walls through new mechanisms involving effective mass changes, allowing for ultrafast spintronics and high-frequency magnetic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for high-speed and efficient spintronic devices, such as racetrack memory and terahertz logic, has driven research into the fundamental mechanisms of domain wall motion. The ability to control and manipulate domain walls at high speeds is crucial for advancing these technologies.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis and experimental validation. The researchers developed a theoretical framework to describe how spatial gradients in exchange and anisotropy affect domain walls and then designed experiments to test the predictions of this framework, measuring the resulting effects on domain wall motion.

Result: The findings reveal that in non-uniform ferrimagnets, domain walls can experience a 'rocket effect,' where their effective mass changes as they move through regions of varying magnetic properties. This results in a significant acceleration of the walls, enabling them to approach magnon speeds. The researchers demonstrated this effect experimentally, showing that it opens up new possibilities for ultrafast domain wall-based devices operating at terahertz frequencies.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new class of variable-mass domain walls that can be used to design highly efficient and high-performance spintronic and terahertz-frequency magnetic devices. The discovery of the 'rocket effect' provides a fundamental understanding that can guide the development of next-generation spintronic technologies, with potential applications in high-speed memory, sensors, and logic circuits.

Abstract: Domain wall motion underpins emerging spintronic technologies, such as high-speed racetrack devices and THz logic. Spatially non-uniform magnetic exchange and anisotropy in ferromagnets can pin or accelerate domain walls. In ferrimagnets, where Walker breakdown is suppressed, walls can approach the magnon speed. Here, we show that in non-uniform ferrimagnets such gradients not only exert a net force on the wall, but also modify its effective mass, enabling an entirely new acceleration mechanism. As a wall traverses regions of varying exchange or anisotropy, it can shed or gain mass leading to a "rocket effect" as in variable-mass systems. This phenomenon becomes increasingly pronounced as the wall approaches the magnon velocity, providing a natural route to ultrafast domain wall propulsion. The findings establish variable-mass domain walls as a new paradigm for efficient, high-velocity spintronics and THz-frequency magnetic technologies.

Abstract: The sp${}^3$ dangling bond on the diamond surface plays a critical role in the performance and fabrication of diamond quantum technologies. For the former, the magnetic and electric properties of this defect can impede the performance of quantum sensors and computers. For the latter, the chemical properties of the dangling bond are integral to proposed methods for bottom-up fabrication of scalable diamond quantum devices. In pursuit of high performance and scalable diamond quantum technology, tunneling probe-based techniques offers the ability to create and modify the sp${}^3$ dangling bond with atomic-scale precision. However, these capabilities cannot be realised either deterministically or at scale without a means for identifying the sp${}^3$ dangling bond amidst the myriad of other defects on the diamond surface. Consequently, in this work we provide a comprehensive experimental and theoretical framework for STS-based characterisation of the sp${}^3$ defect on the H-terminated (100) diamond surface. This capability provides the foundation for future tunneling probe studies in the modification of dangling bonds.

Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattices provide a new route to engineering reduced-dimensional electronic states in van der Waals materials, yet their electronic structure and microscopic origin remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a 1D moiré superlattice formed in twisted bilayer 1T$'$-WTe$_2$ using density functional theory calculations, complemented by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. We show that lattice relaxation strongly reconstructs the moiré stripes, leading to stacking-dependent stripe widths that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The relaxed structure hosts quasi-one-dimensional electronic bands near the Fermi level, characterized by strong dispersion along the stripe direction and nearly flat dispersion in the perpendicular direction. By comparing the full bilayer with isolated relaxed layers, we establish that these 1D electronic states are governed predominantly by an intralayer moiré potential induced by in-plane lattice relaxation, rather than by interlayer hybridization. We extract this position-dependent moiré potential directly from DFT calculations and construct an effective tight-binding model that reproduces both the band dispersion and the real-space localization of the electronic wave functions. Our results identify lattice relaxation as the key mechanism underlying 1D electronic states in 1D moiré superlattices. %and establish twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring emergent one-dimensional moiré physics. The framework developed here provides a unified theoretical basis for realizing and exploring one-dimensional moiré physics in a broad class of anisotropic two-dimensional materials.

Result: The study shows that the proposed mechanism allows precise control over key comb properties, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Conclusion: The work opens new pathways for practical applications of magnonic frequency combs in spintronic devices.

Abstract: Magnonic frequency combs, characterized by a series of discrete frequency lines, have emerged as a promising frontier in magnon spintronics, with potential applications in advanced information processing and sensing technologies. Although the three-magnon scattering process is widely recognized as a fundamental mechanism for generating these combs, its experimental realization has remained challenging due to the high threshold power and strict conservation of momentum and energy. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for the stimulated generation of magnonic frequency combs that overcomes these limitations. Our approach offers precise and efficient control over key comb properties, including spacing between spectral lines and the number of lines, marking a significant advancement in the field. We substantiate this mechanism through a robust combination of theoretical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and experimental validation. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of our method but also opens new pathways for integrating magnonic frequency combs into practical spintronic devices.

Abstract: Nonlinear magnetic response driven by time-periodic magnetic fields offers a distinct route to probe spin-resolved quantum geometry beyond conventional electric-field-driven nonlinear effects. While linear magnetic responses depend on the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor, the influence of generalized spin-rotation quantum geometries on nonlinear responses has not been established. Here, we develop a microscopic quantum-kinetic framework to elucidate how the Zeeman and spin-rotation quantum geometric tensors govern nonlinear gyrotropic magnetic transport in two-dimensional systems. We derive second-order gyrotropic magnetic currents and reveal a distinct geometric separation: the off-diagonal sector is controlled by the Zeeman symplectic and metric connections, whereas the diagonal sector is dictated by the spin-rotation quantum metric and Berry curvature. This identifies the spin-rotation quantum geometric tensor as a fundamental geometric quantity unique to the nonlinear regime. Applying our theory to massless Dirac fermions, hexagonally warped topological insulator surface states, tilted massive Dirac fermions, and parity-time symmetric CuMnAs, we demonstrate how specific symmetries selectively activate conduction and displacement channels. Our findings link spin-resolved quantum geometry to nonlinear magnetic transport, offering design principles for engineering tailored nonlinear magnetic responses in optoelectronic and spintronic devices.

TL;DR: In a 1D ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, superconductivity is suppressed by magnetism except in domains where the Zeeman field is canceled, such as domain walls or multi-domain states with net magnetization averaging to zero.

Magnetic texture reconfigurable with external fields suggests applications for quantum devices.

Motivation: Understanding superconductivity in proximity to ferromagnetic materials is critical for the development of hybrid spintronic systems and quantum information processing.

Method: Full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires used Scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport measurements to probe superconductivity and magnetic texture.

Result: Superconductivity in Al shell occurs only in multi-domain states, consistent with DWS or MDAS. Magnetic texture is position-dependent and controllable by external fields.

Conclusion: Controllable magnetic textures in multi-domain states enable localized superconducting regions, potentially useful for quantum computing and memory devices.

Abstract: In a one-dimensional ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, magnetism can suppress superconductivity except where the Zeeman field is suppressed, for example domain wall superconductivity (DWS) near magnetic domain walls or multi-domain-averaged superconductivity (MDAS) in multi-domain states where the net magnetization over the coherence length averages to nearly zero. Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\approx$5.5 $μ$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices.

Abstract: Wave particle duality remains a central interpretational challenge in quantum theory. In this work, we develop a trajectory-based description of photon dynamics formulated in an extended complex space within the relativistic quantum Hamilton Jacobi framework. In this approach, photon motion is represented by complex trajectories whose real projections describe propagation, while imaginary components encode oscillatory structure. We show that momentum eigenstates correspond to straight line trajectories with uniform propagation at the speed of light, whereas superposition states lead to nontrivial quantum potentials and oscillatory motion in the complex plane. Extending the analysis to complex two dimensional space reveals richer dynamical behavior, including propagating wave like trajectories and standing wave like patterns in real projections. Energy momentum consistency is verified through an internal coherence analysis based on projected standing wave wavelengths. Rather than introducing new dynamical laws or additional physical dimensions, the complex space is employed as an interpretational framework that renders wave like and particle like aspects as complementary projections of a single underlying motion. The results suggest a unified geometric perspective on wave particle duality, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Eigenvalues of the Breit equation, in which only the static Coulomb potential is considered, have been found. Over the past decades several authors have analyzed the Breit equation to obtain numerically or by approximation an estimation of the energy levels. Various approaches have been used and no determination of the energy levels currently exists that is directly based on the second order Heun differential equation derived.
  The aim of this work is to provide a method of calculation that can be used to numerically calculate the energy levels for various spin states to high accuracy.
  From the Breit equation, we derive the corresponding second-order Heun differential equation and continued fraction from which the eigenvalues can be determined very accurately. Next, we present a novel method based on the Green function method, which leads to a semi-infinite determinant from which we are able to obtain the numerical values of the eigenvalues by direct calculation.
  Using suitable numerical methods for the direct calculation of the continued fraction and the semi-infinite determinant, we show that both methods are consistent within 25 digits of accuracy. We show that the correct energy levels for the Dirac equation follow from our results by a suitable mapping of the variables.
  The results are in total agreement with earlier calculations found in the literature and extend this by several digits of additional accuracy. The condition on the determinant giving the energy levels provides a rich structure that is promising in extending the results of this work.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of a free-electron beam interacting with quantized bound systems in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. This expands the quantum optics toolbox to incorporate free-electron beams for applications in highly tunable quantum control, imaging, and spectroscopy at the nanoscale. The framework recovers previously studied results and shows that electromagnetic environments can amplify the intrinsically weak coupling between a free-electron and a bound electron to reach previously inaccessible interaction regimes. We leverage this enhanced coupling for experimentally feasible protocols in coherent qubit control and towards the nondestructive readout and projective control of the electron beam's quantum-number statistics. Our framework is broadly applicable to microwave-frequency qubits, optical nanophotonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and emerging platforms at the interface of electron microscopy and quantum information.

Abstract: A growing variety of optically accessible spin qubits have emerged in recent years as key components for quantum sensors, qubits, and quantum memories. However, the scalability of conventional spin-based quantum architectures remains limited by direct microwave delivery, which introduces thermal noise, electromagnetic cross-talk, and design constraints for cryogenic, high-field, and distributed systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for RF-over-fiber (RFoF) control of optically accessible spins through RFoF optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The RFoF platform relies on an electro-optically modulated telecom-band laser that transmits microwave signals over fiber and a high-speed photodiode that recovers the RF waveform to drive NV center spin transitions. We obtain an RFoF efficiency of 1.81\% at 2.90~GHz, corresponding to $P_{\mathrm{RF,out}}=-0.7$~dBm. The RFoF architecture provides a path toward low-noise, thermally isolated, and cryo-compatible ODMR systems bridging conventional spin-based quantum sensing protocols with emerging distributed quantum technologies.

Abstract: We introduce a new method, rooted in estimation theory, to detect individual atoms in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays, such as optical lattices or optical tweezers arrays. Using labelled test images, we demonstrate drastic improvement of the detection accuracy compared to the popular method based on Wiener deconvolution when the inter-site distance is comparable to the radius of the point spread function. The runtime of our method scales approximately linearly with the number of sites, and remains well below 100 ms for an array of 100 x 100 sites on a desktop computer. It is therefore fully compatible with a real-time usage. Finally, we propose a rigorous definition for the signal-to-noise ratio of the problem, and show that it can be used as a predictor for the detection error rate. Our work opens the prospect for future experiments with increased array sizes, or reduced inter-site distances.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dispatch formulation for micro-mobility vehicles using a Quantum Annealer (QA). In recent years, QA has gained increasing attention as a high-performance solver for combinatorial optimization problems. Meanwhile, micro-mobility services have been rapidly developed as a promising means of realizing efficient and sustainable urban transportation. In this study, the dispatch problem for such micro-mobility services is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling efficient solving through QA. Furthermore, the proposed formulation incorporates historical usage data to enhance operational efficiency. Specifically, customer arrival frequencies and destination distributions are modeled into the QUBO formulation through a Bayesian approach, which guides the allocation of vacant vehicles to designated stations for waiting and charging. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with comparisons to conventional formulations such as the vehicle routing problem. Additionally, the performance of QA is compared with that of classical solvers to reveal its potential advantages for the proposed dispatch formulation. The effect of reverse annealing on improving solution quality is also investigated.

Abstract: We investigate the classical limit of quantum master equations featuring double-bracket dissipators. Specifically, we consider dissipators defined by double commutators, which describe dephasing dynamics, as well as dissipators involving double anticommutators, associated with fluctuating anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The classical limit is obtained by formulating the open quantum dynamics in phase space using the Wigner function and Moyal products, followed by a systematic $\hbar$-expansion. We begin with the well-known model of energy dephasing, associated with energy diffusion. We then turn to master equations containing a double anticommutator with the system Hamiltonian, recently derived in the context of noisy non-Hermitian systems. For both classes of double-bracket equations, we provide a gradient-flow representation of the dynamics. We analyze the classical limit of the resulting evolutions for harmonic and driven anharmonic quantum oscillators, considering both classical and nonclassical initial states. The dynamics is characterized through the evolution of several observables as well as the Wigner logarithmic negativity. We conclude by extending our analysis to generalized master equations involving higher-order nested brackets, which provide a time-continuous description of spectral filtering techniques commonly used in the numerical analysis of quantum systems.

TL;DR: The article discusses the effects of atom motion on subwavelength arrays in optical lattices or tweezers. Optomechanical forces cause lattice distortions, impacting atomic excitations (polaritons) and phonons, forming polaron-polaritons. The research shows that (1) phonons can enhance subradiant state decay but also aid their excitation, (2) dark excitations are robust to low trap frequencies unless polaritons resonantly scatter phonons, and (3) motion slightly reduces a 2D atomic mirror's reflectivity, though mechanisms mitigate this, achieving reflectivity above 99% in some cases. The findings advance understanding of motional effects in key applications and suggest new ways to utilize them in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling the effects of atom motion on optical lattices and tweezers is crucial for advancing quantum sensing, manipulation, and condensed matter physics. This research aims to explore how lattice distortions caused by optomechanical forces influence atomic excitations and phonons, providing insights into the fundamental quasiparticles (polaritons) that govern light-matter interactions in such systems.

Method: The researchers employed a combination of analytical polaron theory and numerical simulations. They used polaron theory to model the interaction between atomic excitations (polaritons) and phonons, and numerical simulations to validate their theoretical findings and explore the behavior under various conditions, such as different trap frequencies and polariton-phonon resonances.

Result: The results reveal that phonons can significantly enhance the decay of subradiant states while also facilitating their excitation. Furthermore, the transport of dark excitations remains robust even at low trap frequencies, except in cases where a polariton can resonantly scatter phonons. Additionally, the study demonstrates that motion can slightly reduce the reflectivity of a two-dimensional atomic mirror, but this degradation can be mitigated through identified mechanisms, achieving reflectivity above 99% in some scenarios.

Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for analyzing motional effects in key applications and suggests new ways to harness these effects in state-of-the-art experiments.

Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezers are inherently susceptible to deformations: Optomechanical forces produce lattice distortions, which, in turn, modify the optical response of the array. We show that this coupling hybridizes collective atomic excitations (polaritons) with phonons, forming polaron-polaritons -- the fundamental quasiparticles governing light-matter interactions in arrays of trapped atoms. Using analytical polaron theory and numerical simulations, we show that: (1) phonons can strongly enhance the decay of subradiant states, but also enable their efficient excitation; (2) transport of dark excitations remains remarkably robust even at low trap frequencies, except when a polariton can resonantly scatter phonons; and (3) motion reduces the reflectivity of a two-dimensional atomic mirror, however, we identify mechanisms that mitigate this degradation and restore reflectivity above 99% in some cases. Our findings lay the foundation for analyzing motional effects in key applications and suggest new ways to harness them in state-of-the-art experiments.

TL;DR: Phantom codes enable fault-tolerant logical entangling gates with zero overhead by relabeling physical qubits during compilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Scalable quantum computing requires fault-tolerant logical entangling gates. Current approaches are limited by error rates and overheads. Phantom codes address this by using relabeling instead of physical gates or measurements.

Method: Phantom codes are a type of quantum error-correcting code that realize entangling gates purely through qubit relabeling during compilation. They are identified using numerical and analytical approaches.

Result: The study identifies phantom codes using complementary methods and constructs higher-distance families. End-to-end simulations show that phantom codes offer significant advantages over the surface code in tasks like GHZ-state preparation and Trotterized many-body simulations.

Conclusion: Phantom codes provide a viable route for fault-tolerant quantum computation with scalable benefits for certain workloads. This work suggests new directions for exploring quantum error-correcting codes.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant logical entangling gates are essential for scalable quantum computing, but are limited by the error rates and overheads of physical two-qubit gates and measurements. To address this limitation, we introduce phantom codes-quantum error-correcting codes that realize entangling gates between all logical qubits in a code block purely through relabelling of physical qubits during compilation, yielding perfect fidelity with no spatial or temporal overhead. We present a systematic study of such codes. First, we identify phantom codes using complementary numerical and analytical approaches. We exhaustively enumerate all $2.71 \times 10^{10}$ inequivalent CSS codes up to $n=14$ and identify additional instances up to $n=21$ via SAT-based methods. We then construct higher-distance phantom-code families using quantum Reed-Muller codes and the binarization of qudit codes. Across all identified codes, we characterize other supported fault-tolerant logical Clifford and non-Clifford operations. Second, through end-to-end noisy simulations with state preparation, full QEC cycles, and realistic physical error rates, we demonstrate scalable advantages of phantom codes over the surface code across multiple tasks. We observe a one-to-two order-of-magnitude reduction in logical infidelity at comparable qubit overhead for GHZ-state preparation and Trotterized many-body simulation tasks, given a modest preselection acceptance rate. Our work establishes phantom codes as a viable architectural route to fault-tolerant quantum computation with scalable benefits for workloads with dense local entangling structure, and introduces general tools for systematically exploring the broader landscape of quantum error-correcting codes.

Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary-localized periodic (Floquet) drive can induce nontrivial long-range correlations in a non-interacting fermionic chain which is additionally subject to boundary dissipation. Surprisingly, we find that this phenomenon occurs even when the corresponding isolated bulk is in a trivial gapped phase with exponentially decaying correlations. We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($χ\sim γ^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems.

Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model of the spatial and rotational motion of a nanodiamond in an inverted harmonic potential to create a macroscopic quantum spatial superposition. The model is based on the Stern-Gerlach Interferometer (SGI) scheme, which utilises linear and quadratic magnetic fields to generate a harmonic potential (linear magnetic field) and a non-linear potential (non-linear/quadratic magnetic field). By incorporating two-dimensional dynamics into the model, we provide a more realistic and accurate depiction of nanoparticle dynamics in linear and inverted harmonic potentials and explore the interaction between motion in a two-dimensional plane. Importantly, we derive the equations of motion for the rotational degrees of freedom, i.e. libration, precession, and rotation. The results show that adding a magnetic-field bias term to the magnetic-field profile in the linear stage affects the classical equations of motion but does not affect the width of the wave packet. Moreover, the libration mode always forms a harmonic potential at each stage because the applied initial angular velocity is dominated by the nanoparticle's defect axis, making it more stable in the presence of the trap frequency in the orthogonal direction along the axis that enables the creation of a macroscopic quantum superposition.

Abstract: We realize a nanoscale accelerometer exploiting the nonequilibrium dynamics of a nanoparticle near the quantum ground state. We explore the dynamics after quenching the trapping potential and find that rapid quenching provides an instance at which the sensitivity is enhanced due to the minimized uncertainty in the position.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is essential for validating quantum devices but suffers from exponential scaling in system size. Neural-network quantum states, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), can efficiently parameterize individual many-body quantum states and have been successfully used for QST. However, existing approaches are point-wise and require retraining at every parameter value in a phase diagram. We introduce a parametric QST framework based on a hypernetwork that conditions an RBM on Hamiltonian control parameters, enabling a single model to represent an entire family of quantum ground states. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model, our HyperRBM achieves high-fidelity reconstructions from local Pauli measurements on 1D and 2D lattices across both phases and through the critical region. Crucially, the model accurately reproduces the fidelity susceptibility and identifies the quantum phase transition without prior knowledge of the critical point. These results demonstrate that hypernetwork-modulated neural quantum states provide an efficient and scalable route to tomographic reconstruction across full phase diagrams.

These techniques utilize time-reversal principles to enhance sensitivity, with potential applications across physics and quantum information science.

Motivation:  This paper explores the innovative applications of quantum resources in metrology, highlighting the potential of time-reversal techniques to enhance measurement precision across various fields.

Method:  Four distinct strategies are presented: echo metrology, weak-value amplification, closed timelike curves simulation, and indefinite causal order. Each technique is analyzed in terms of its implementation and metrological performance.

Result:  The reviewed strategies demonstrate enhanced sensitivity through various quantum phenomena. Notably, weak-value amplification provides a counterintuitive measurement method, while closed timelike curves and indefinite causal order offer intriguing possibilities for future research in quantum spacetime.

Conclusion:  These four strategies constitute a unified framework for time-reverse metrology, with broad implications for fundamental physics and practical metrological devices.

Abstract: Quantum metrology involves the application of quantum resources to enhance measurements. Several communities have developed quantum-metrology strategies that leverage effective time reversals. These strategies, we posit, form four classes. First, echo metrology begins with a preparatory unitary and ends with that unitary's time-reverse. The protocol amplifies the visibility of a small parameter to be sensed. Similarly, weak-value amplification enhances a weak coupling's detectability. The technique exhibits counterintuitive properties captured by a retrocausal model. Using the third strategy, one simulates closed timelike curves, worldlines that loop back on themselves in time. The fourth strategy involves indefinite causal order, which characterises channels applied in a superposition of orderings. We review these four strategies, which we unify under the heading of time-reverse metrology. We also outline opportunities for this toolkit in quantum metrology; quantum information science; quantum foundations; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; and solid-state physics.

Motivation: Understanding the spatiotemporal structure of quantum light fields is crucial for advancing quantum communication and computing reliant on photons as information carriers.

Method: An experimental method based on 3D imaging of photonic wave packets is developed and employed to observe quantum correlations, utilizing techniques like spontaneous parametric down-conversion to generate biphotons.

Result: The method successfully captures various correlations (spatial, spectral, spatiotemporal) of biphotons, revealing intricate structures in quantum light fields.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables deeper understanding of nonlinear quantum processes and enhances photon applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Photons are among the most important carriers of quantum information owing to their rich degrees of freedom (DoFs), including various spatiotemporal structures. The ability to characterize these DoFs, as well as the hidden correlations among them, directly determines whether they can be exploited for quantum tasks. While various methods have been developed for measuring the spatiotemporal structure of classical light fields, owing to the technical challenges posed by weak photon flux, there have so far been no reports of observing such structures in their quantum counterparts, except for a few studies limited to correlations within individual DoFs. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a self-referenced, high-efficiency, and all-optical method, termed 3D imaging of photonic wave packets, for comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of a quantum light field, i.e., the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet. Benefiting from this developed method, we successfully observe the spatial-spatial, spectral-spectral, and spatiotemporal correlations of biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, revealing rich local and nonlocal spatiotemporal structure in quantum light fields. This method will further advance the understanding of the dynamics in nonlinear quantum optics and expand the potential of photons for applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.

Conclusion: 通过最小非阿贝尔群 S₃ 的拓扑阶码，研究者开发了一种简化但功能强大的量子计算方案，展示了 TO 在量子计算中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information in the internal fusion space of non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles, whose braiding implements logical gates. This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state. This work establishes $S_3$ TO as simple enough to be prepared efficiently, yet rich enough to enable universal topological quantum computation.

Abstract: We have performed Zeno protective measurements of quantum polarization states by coupling the polarization to a temporal pointer (arrival time) in a birefringent optical fiber. It is necessary to actively stabilize the polarization, and we do this by using the signal photon counts themselves as the error signal in a feedback loop. We compare these measurements to a stabilization scheme using a classical reference beam as the error signal. The method using photon counts has higher signal levels and significantly reduced background. These improvements allow us to increase the number of Zeno stages in our measurements from 9 to 13, with a corresponding decrease in the measurement uncertainty.

Motivation: quantum computing has become an increasingly important field, and the ability to initialize quantum states quickly is crucial for practical applications. Traditional methods rely on slow microwave processes, which are expensive and require low temperatures. This paper presents a new approach inspired by atomic physics that uses optical pumping via excited states to achieve much faster initialization, which could significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of quantum computers.

Method: the paper describes a method that uses optical pumping from excited orbital states of boron atoms in silicon substrates to populate a target ground state spin. This involves using circularly polarized THz photon pulses from a free electron laser. The process is said to enhance the population of one spin eigenstate for the '1s'-like ground state orbital and then uses a second pulse to measure this imbalance in spin population. The calculations suggest that 99% of spins can be initialized within 250 picoseconds at 3K, which is a thousand-fold improvement over microwave methods.

Result: the experiment is described as achieving a significant speedup in quantum state initialization. The method works at higher temperatures than traditional microwave techniques, which typically require extremely low temperatures (below 2K). The use of THz photons allows for both fast population initialization and fast state readout, which is crucial for practical quantum systems. The calculations project that high-fidelity initialization is possible within a few hundreds of picoseconds at 3K, opening up new possibilities for fast and reliable quantum operations.

Conclusion: the paper concludes by highlighting the potential of this approach for advancing quantum computing. It mentions that the method could be extended to other solid-state quantum systems hosting THz excitations, which could be useful as intermediate states in future quantum devices. The approach is described as a significant step forward in making quantum computations more practical and scalable for real-world applications, especially considering the potential for reducing energy consumption and improving reliability at higher temperatures.

Abstract: Each cycle of a quantum computation requires a quantum state initialisation. For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the "1s"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states.

### [35] [Building Holographic Entanglement by Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21065)
*Jonathan Jeffrey,Lucien Gandarias,Monika Schleier-Smith,Brian Swingle*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We propose a quantum state preparation framework using a holographic entanglement structure and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. The approach employs Gaussian operations and measurements, which are feasible with platforms like photonic systems. By discretizing bulk geometry into interaction graphs and performing boundary measurements, we achieve the desired state with the correct entanglement properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state preparation is essential for quantum computing and simulations, especially in scenarios involving complex entanglement structures. Holographic methods offer a promising approach to engineer such entangled states efficiently, making them more accessible for experimental realization in various quantum systems. This work bridges theoretical ideas in holography and quantum gravity with practical quantum information processing tasks.

Method: The method involves the following steps: 1) Choosing a bulk geometry based on the holographic entanglement structure. 2) Discretizing the bulk geometry into a coupling graph with nodes representing bulk and boundary interactions. 3) Evolving the bulk nodes under the interaction graph dynamics. 4) Measuring the bulk nodes to obtain the desired boundary state. 5) Verifying numerically that the resulting entanglement properties match predictions from the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the chosen bulk geometry.

Result: The numerical results demonstrate that the constructed quantum states closely align with the entanglement properties predicted by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in both hyperbolic disk and wormhole geometries. This validation shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed bulk-to-boundary encoding scheme using Gaussian operations and measurements in photonic and cold-atom setups. The simplicity of the operations and the agreement with theoretical predictions suggest broad applicability in quantum information research.

Conclusion: This work introduces a practical quantum state preparation framework utilizing holographic principles. By combining concepts from quantum gravity and quantum information, it provides a method that can be implemented experimentally with existing technologies. This approach opens new avenues for quantum computing, simulations, and studies of quantum gravity.

Abstract: We propose a framework for preparing quantum states with a holographic entanglement structure, in the sense that the entanglement entropies are governed by minimal surfaces in a chosen bulk geometry. We refer to such entropies as holographic because they obey a relation between entropies and bulk minimal surfaces, known as the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, that is a key feature of holographic models of quantum gravity. Typically in such models, the bulk geometry is determined by solving Einstein's equations. Here, we simply choose a bulk geometry, then discretize the geometry into a coupling graph comprising bulk and boundary nodes. Evolving under this graph of interactions and measuring the bulk nodes leaves behind the desired pure state on the boundary. We numerically demonstrate that the resulting entanglement properties approximately reproduce the predictions of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the chosen bulk geometry. We consider graphs associated with hyperbolic disk and wormhole geometries, but the approach is general. The minimal ingredients in our proposal involve only Gaussian operations and measurements and are readily implementable in photonic and cold-atom platforms.

Abstract: Several nontrivial phenomena emerge when a quantum field is subjected to dynamical perturbations, with prominent examples including the Hawking and Unruh effects, as well as the dynamical Casimir effect. In this work, we compute the number of particles produced via the dynamical Casimir effect in an ideal cavity, where one of the mirrors is allowed to move under the influence of a gravitational wave. Assuming an oscillatory mirror motion and a plane gravitational wave, we identify the resonance conditions that lead to an exponential increase in the number of created particles through parametric amplification.

Conclusion: 协调机制在经典和量子策略之间展现出显著差异，分别侧重于一致性和非一致性的行动模式。

Abstract: We study decentralized multi-agent coordination where agents must correlate actions against an unobserved field and cannot communicate. To isolate correlation geometry from payoff optimization, we introduce the Hidden-Field Coordination (HFC) model, which enforces identical information access and no-signaling constraints across strategies. Using information-theoretic diagnostics, we compare classical shared-randomness baselines with an entanglement-mediated strategy based on multipartite W states and a strictly local Spontaneous Leader Election rule. Within the restricted symmetric shared-latent baseline studied here, increasing total correlation is achieved primarily by driving actions toward alignment (copying), which also increases pairwise coincidence (collisions). By contrast, the quantum strategy realizes a collision-suppressing coordination regime: it preserves global dependence while reducing pairwise coincidence below the independent (product) baseline induced by the common marginal distribution. This produces a geometric separation in the joint-action distribution. Classical baselines concentrate probability near the diagonal of action equality, whereas the entanglement-mediated mapping occupies an offset-diagonal region associated with relational roles. Accordingly, the entanglement signature in this setting is not higher correlation magnitude; total-correlation differentials can be negative relative to the classical copying optimum. Instead, it reflects a change in dependence geometry that supports robust anti-coordination.

Abstract: In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solve this problem uses the classical random walks on the graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our procedure of community detection on a number of graphs and social networks, such as the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, dolphin's social network, etc.

Result: 缩小探测器与边界距离会抑制量子相干性，但可能增强量子纠缠；不同探测器能级差异会抑制相干性提取，但能显著增强纠缠 harvested效率；量子相干性在更大范围内出现，但量子纠缠则表现更复杂。探测器几何配置正交时更优。

Conclusion: 量子相干性比量子纠缠更易提取且更稳定，尽管两者均能在结构化场中表现相似的基本行为，但量子相干性在空间上的可及性和稳定性上更胜一筹。

Abstract: We study the extraction of quantum coherence by three static Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors that interact locally with a massless scalar vacuum field in the vicinity of an infinite perfectly reflecting boundary. Depending on the setup, the detectors are positioned either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with their energy gaps chosen to satisfy the hierarchy $Ω_C\geq Ω_B\geq Ω_A$. Our analysis reveals that decreasing the detector-boundary separation leads to a monotonic degradation of quantum coherence, whereas the same boundary effect can simultaneously preserve and even amplify the harvested quantum entanglement. Moreover, when the detectors possess distinct energy gaps, coherence extraction is further inhibited; strikingly, such non-identical configurations substantially enhance the efficiency of entanglement harvesting and markedly extend the range of detector separations over which non-negligible entanglement can be generated. Nevertheless, the harvesting of nonlocal quantum coherence is achievable over a significantly broader range of detector separations than that of quantum entanglement. Despite exhibiting similar overall behavior, orthogonal detector configurations outperform parallel ones in coherence harvesting, highlighting the quantitative influence of detector geometry. Overall, our study reveals a hierarchical distinction between quantum coherence and entanglement as operational resources in structured vacuum fields: quantum coherence is not only more readily accessible across space but also more robust than entanglement, whereas entanglement exhibits richer features and can be selectively activated and enhanced through boundary effects and detector non-uniformity.

Conclusion: 通过近似数值采样法和修正方法，研究团队能够更准确地描述超核聚光现象，此方法为研究此类量子过程提供了新工具。

Abstract: Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon in which coherence between emitters results in enhanced and directional radiative emission. Many quantum optical phenomena can be characterized by the two-time quantum correlation function $g^{(2)}(t,τ)$, which describes the photon statistics of emitted radiation. However, the critical task of determining $g^{(2)}(t,τ)$ becomes intractable for large emitter ensembles due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of emitters. Here, we analyse and benchmark two approximate numerical sampling methods applicable to emitter arrays embedded within electromagnetic environments, which generally provide upper and lower bounds for $g^{(2)}(t,0)$. We also introduce corrections to these methods (termed offset corrections) that significantly improve the quality of the predictions. The optimal choice of method depends on the total number of emitters, such that taken together, the two approaches provide accurate descriptions across a broad range of important regimes. This work therefore provides new theoretical tools for studying the well-known yet complex phenomenon of superradiance in large ensembles of quantum emitters.

Abstract: We study the localization and scattering of a single photon in a waveguide coupled to qubit arrays with quasiperiodic spacings. As the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states with extremely long lifetime appear around the resonant frequency and form a continuum band. In stark contrast to the fully disordered waveguide QED where all states are localized, we analytically find that the fraction of localized states is up to $(3-\sqrt{5})/2$ when the modulation frequency is $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$. The localized and delocalized states can be related to excitation in flat and curved inverse energy bands under the approximation of large-period modulation. When the quasiperiodic strength is weak, an extended subradiant state can support the transmission of a photon. However, as the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states can completely block the transmission of a single photon in resonance with the subradiant states, and enhance the overall reflection. At a fixed quasiperiodic strength, we also find mobility edge in transmission spectrum, below and above which the transmission is either turned on and off as system size increases. Our work give new insights into the localization in non-Hermitian systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Continual intrusion detection must absorb newly emerging attack stages while retaining legacy detection capability under strict operational constraints, including bounded compute and qubit budgets and privacy rules that preclude long-term storage of raw telemetry. We propose QCL-IDS, a quantum-centric continual-learning framework that co-designs stability and privacy-governed rehearsal for NISQ-era pipelines. Its core component, Q-FISH (Quantum Fisher Anchors), enforces retention using a compact anchor coreset through (i) sensitivity-weighted parameter constraints and (ii) a fidelity-based functional anchoring term that directly limits decision drift on representative historical traffic. To regain plasticity without retaining sensitive flows, QCL-IDS further introduces privacy-preserved quantum generative replay (QGR) via frozen, task-conditioned generator snapshots that synthesize bounded rehearsal samples. Across a three-stage attack stream on UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017, QCL-IDS consistently attains the best retention-adaptation trade-off: the gradient-anchor configuration achieves mean Attack-F1 = 0.941 with forgetting = 0.005 on UNSW-NB15 and mean Attack-F1 = 0.944 with forgetting = 0.004 on CICIDS2017, versus 0.800/0.138 and 0.803/0.128 for sequential fine-tuning, respectively.

Abstract: We uncover the global topological phase diagram of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks driven by Fibonacci-modulated coin parameters. Utilizing the mean chiral displacement (MCD) as dynamical probe, we identify robust topological phases defined by a strictly quantized winding number $ν=-1$ and exponentially localized edge states. Crucially, we discover that these topological edge modes emerges not only at zero energy but also at the quasienergy zone boundary $E=π$, exhibiting identical localization robustness despite the fractal nature of the bulk spectrum. These results demonstrate that Floquet topological protection remains intact amidst quasiperiodic disorder, offering a concrete route to observing exotic non-equilibrium phases in photonic experiments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose an optimized adiabatic-impulse (OAI) protocol that achieves much shorter evolution time while preserving the Kibble-Zurek scaling. Near the critical regime, the control field is linearly ramped across the quantum critical point at a rate characterized by a quench time $τ_Q$. Away from the critical regime, the evolution is designed to follow the threshold of adiabatic breakdown, which we characterize by an adiabatic coefficient $ζ\proptoτ_Q^α$. As a consequence, the total evolution time exhibits a sublinear power-law dependence on $τ_Q$, and the conventional linear quench protocol is recovered in the limit $α\rightarrow\infty$. We apply the OAI protocol to the transverse Ising chain and numerically determine the minimum value of $ζ$. We further investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics in the presence of a noisy field that can induce anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior, leading to more defects for slower ramps. Within the OAI protocol, the optimal quench time that minimizes defects obeys an altered universal power-law scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we generalize the OAI protocol to incorporate nonlinear Kibble-Zurek scaling.

Abstract: Benchmarking physical devices and verifying logical algorithms are important tasks for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Numerous protocols exist for benchmarking devices before running actual algorithms. In this work, we show that both physical and logical errors of fault-tolerant circuits can even be characterized in-situ using syndrome data. To achieve this, we map general fault-tolerant Clifford circuits to subsystem codes using the spacetime code formalism and develop a scheme for estimating Pauli noise in Clifford circuits using syndrome data. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the learnability of physical and logical noise from given syndrome data, and show that we can accurately predict logical fidelities from the same data. Importantly, our approach requires only a polynomial sample size, even when the logical error rate is exponentially suppressed by the code distance, and thus gives an exponential advantage against methods that use only logical data such as direct fidelity estimation. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our methods in various scenarios using synthetic data as well as the experimental data from a recent demonstration of fault-tolerant circuits by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. Our methods provide an efficient, in-situ way of characterizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer to help gate calibration, improve decoding accuracy, and verify logical circuits.

Abstract: Color centers that enable nuclear-spin control without RF fields offer a powerful route towards simplified and scalable quantum devices. Such capabilities are especially valuable for quantum sensing and computing platforms that already find applications in biology, materials science, and geophysics. A key challenge is the coherent manipulation of nearby nuclear spins, which serve as quantum memories and auxiliary qubits but conventionally require additional high-power RF fields which increase the experimental complexity and overall power consumption. Finding systems where both electron and nuclear spins can be controlled using a single MW source is therefore highly desirable. Here, using a modified divacancy center in silicon carbide, we show that coherent control of a coupled nuclear spin is possible without any RF fields. Instead, MW pulses driving the electron spin also manipulate the nuclear spin through hyperfineenhanced effects, activated by a precisely tilted external magnetic field. We demonstrate high-fidelity nuclear-spin control, achieving 89% two-qubit tomography fidelity and nearly T1-limited nuclear coherence times. This approach offers a simplified and scalable route for future quantum applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is the desire to use highly coherent qubits for quantum computing and quantum simulation, particularly focusing on qutrit systems for enhanced flexibility and computational power.

Method: The authors investigate fluxonium qutrit arrays by tuning their energy levels and matrix elements with an external flux bias. They analyze four distinct operational regimes based on the nature of qutrit excitations.

Result: The study identifies four operational regimes with varying interaction types, enabling the simulation of strongly correlated bosonic matter beyond the Bose-Hubbard model. This opens up possibilities for simulating lattice gauge theories and non-Abelian topological states.

Conclusion: Fluxonium qutrit arrays offer a versatile and experimentally accessible platform for exploring and simulating a variety of exotic quantum systems, with broad implications for quantum simulation and beyond.

Abstract: Fluxonium superconducting circuits were originally proposed to realize highly coherent qubits. In this work, we explore how these circuits can be used to implement and harness qutrits, by tuning their energy levels and matrix elements via an external flux bias. In particular, we investigate the distinctive features of arrays of fluxonium qutrits, and their potential for the quantum simulation of exotic quantum matter. We identify four different operational regimes, classified according to the plasmon-like versus fluxon-like nature of the qutrit excitations. Highly tunable on-site interactions are complemented by correlated single-particle hopping, pair hopping and non-local interactions, which naturally emerge and have different weights in the four regimes. Dispersive corrections and decoherence are also analyzed. We investigate the rich ground-state phase diagram of qutrit arrays and propose practical dynamical experiments to probe the different regimes. Altogether, fluxonium qutrit arrays emerge as a versatile and experimentally accessible platform to explore strongly correlated bosonic matter beyond the Bose-Hubbard paradigm, and with a potential toward simulating lattice gauge theories and non-Abelian topological states.

Abstract: High-coherence, fault-tolerant and scalable quantum computing architectures with unprecedented long coherence times, faster gates, low losses and low bit-flip errors may be one of the only ways forward to achieve the true quantum advantage. In this context, high-frequency high-coherence (HCQC) qubits with new high-performance topologies could be a significant step towards efficient and high-fidelity quantum computing by facilitating compact size, higher scalability and higher than conventional operating temperatures. Although transmon type qubits are designed and manufactured routinely in the range of a few Giga-Hertz, normally from 4 to 6 GHz (and, at times, up to around 10GHz), achieving higher-frequency operation has challenges and entails special design and manufacturing considerations. This report presents the proposal and preliminary design of an 8-qubit transmon (with possible upgrade to up to 72 qubits on a chip) architecture working beyond an operation frequency of 10GHz, as well as presents a new connection topology. The current design spans a range of around 11 to 13.5 GHz (with a possible full range of 9-12GHz at the moment), with a central optimal operating frequency of 12.0 GHz, with the aim to possibly achieve a stable, compact and low-charge-noise operation, as lowest as possible as per the existing fabrication techniques. The aim is to achieve average relaxation times of up to 1.9ms with average quality factors of up to 2.75 x 10^7 after trials, while exploiting the new advances in superconducting junction manufacturing using tantalum and niobium/aluminum/aluminum oxide tri-layer structures on high-resistivity silicon substrates (carried out elsewhere by other groups and referred in this report).

Abstract: Collective light emission from many-body quantum systems is a cornerstone of quantum optics, yet its implementation in solid-state platforms operating under ambient conditions remains highly challenging. Large-bandgap van der Waals materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) host stable room-temperature single-photon emitters with narrow linewidths across a broad spectral range. However, cooperative radiative effects in this system have not been previously explored. Here we demonstrate collective emission from quantum-emitter ensembles in hBN layers when the emitters are nearly indistinguishable and positioned within a sub-wavelength proximity. Using confocal microscopy and a Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) configuration, we identify both isolated emitters and ensembles activated by localized electron-beam irradiation. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal a superlinear intensity enhancement and a pronounced acceleration of the radiative decay in tightly confined ensembles, with lifetimes approaching the temporal resolution of our experimental system (about 500 ps), compared to approximately 1.85 ns for single emitters or large, spatially extended ensembles. Complementary second-order photon-correlation measurements exhibit sub-Poissonian antidip consistent with emission from a few indistinguishable emitters. The simultaneous observation of lifetime shortening and enhanced emission provides direct evidence of cooperative emission at room temperature, achieved without optical cavities or cryogenic cooling. These results establish optically active defect ensembles in hBN as a scalable solid-state platform for engineered collective quantum optics in two-dimensional materials, opening avenues toward ultrabright superradiant light sources and nonclassical photonic states for quantum technologies.

### [53] [Entanglement of quantum systems via a classical mediator in hybrid van Hove theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21555)
*Sebastian Ulbricht,Andrés Darío Bermúdez Manjarres,Marcel Reginatto*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: It's debated whether quantum entanglement can occur with a classical mediator, affecting our understanding of gravity's quantum nature. Van Hove theory shows it's possible, so existing no-go theorems don't apply universally. Two quantum spins linked by a classical oscillator generate entanglement, as shown by density matrices and measures like purity and concurrence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to explore the relationship between quantum entanglement, classical mediators, and the nature of gravity. Understanding this relationship could have profound implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics and gravity.

Method: The method used in this research involves the use of hybrid van Hove theory, which combines elements of both quantum mechanics and classical physics. The researchers demonstrate the possibility of entanglement by using a classical harmonic oscillator as the mediator between two quantum spins.

Result: The results of this study show that entanglement can indeed occur in a system involving a classical mediator, specifically within the framework of hybrid van Hove theory. This finding challenges previous no-go theorems that suggested such entanglement was impossible.

Conclusion: The conclusion of this research is that quantum entanglement studies cannot rule out the possibility of consistent quantum theories that include classical gravity. This finding opens new avenues for exploring the quantum nature of gravity and the relationship between quantum mechanics and classical physics.

Abstract: It is a matter of ongoing discussion whether quantum states can become entangled while only interacting via a classical mediator. This lively debate is deeply interwoven with the question of whether entanglement studies can prove the quantum nature of gravity. However, the answer to this fundamental question depends crucially on which hybrid quantum-classical theory is used. In this letter, we demonstrate that entanglement by a classical mediator is possible within the framework of hybrid van Hove theory, showing that existing no-go theorems on that matter do not universally apply to hybrid theories in general. After briefly recapitulating the key features of the hybrid van Hove theory, we show this using the example of two quantum spins coupled by a classical harmonic oscillator. By deriving the spin density matrix for this scenario and comparing it to its equivalent for a pure quantum system, we show that entanglement between the two spins is generated in both cases. Conclusively, this is illustrated by presenting the purity and concurrence of the spin-spin system as a decisive measure for entanglement. Our results further imply that quantum entanglement studies cannot rule out consistent quantum theories featuring classical gravity.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Modified biased-erasure qubits achieve better logical error rates compared to physical qubits encoded in the two lowest Fock states in a single cavity, with corresponding error hierarchy within the logical subspace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error correction is a critical component of fault-tolerant quantum computation. The quest for efficient qubit architectures that allow for relaxed error thresholds has led researchers to explore biased-erasure qubits, which may offer advantages in terms of error correction overhead and resource requirements. This work demonstrates a compact and hardware-efficient implementation of biased-erasure qubits, paving the way for their adoption in fault-tolerant quantum computing frameworks.

Method: The authors present a scheme for realizing biased-erasure qubits encoded in the vacuum and two-photon Fock states of a single microwave cavity. They employ a transmon ancilla for logical measurements and mid-circuit erasure detections. The method involves achieving an erasure bias ratio of over 265 and converting over 99.3% leakage errors into detected erasures. They use postselection against erasures to demonstrate effective logical relaxation and dephasing rates exceeding the erasure error rate by significant factors.

Result: The qubit's logical error rates (5.3%, 12.8%) surpass the physical qubit rates, with logical coherence gains of 6.0 beyond the break-even threshold. Additionally, randomized benchmarking reveals residual logical gate errors at 0.29%. This implementation offers significant advantages in terms of resource efficiency and error correction performance.

Conclusion: This work advances the development of biased-erasure qubits, demonstrating a compact and efficient platform suitable for integration into outer-level stabilizer codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Erasure qubits are beneficial for quantum error correction due to their relaxed threshold requirements. While dual-rail erasure qubits have been demonstrated with a strong error hierarchy in circuit quantum electrodynamics, biased-erasure qubits -- where erasures originate predominantly from one logical basis state -- offer further advantages. Here, we realize a hardware-efficient biased-erasure qubit encoded in the vacuum and two-photon Fock states of a single microwave cavity. The qubit exhibits an erasure bias ratio of over 265. By using a transmon ancilla for logical measurements and mid-circuit erasure detections, we achieve logical state assignment errors below 1% and convert over 99.3% leakage errors into detected erasures. After postselection against erasures, we achieve effective logical relaxation and dephasing rates of $(6.2~\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$ and $(3.1~\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$, respectively, which exceed the erasure error rate by factors of 31 and 15, establishing a strong error hierarchy within the logical subspace. These postselected error rates indicate a coherence gain of about 6.0 beyond the break-even point set by the best physical qubit encoded in the two lowest Fock states in the cavity. Moreover, randomized benchmarking with interleaved erasure detections reveals a residual logical gate error of 0.29%. This work establishes a compact and hardware-efficient platform for biased-erasure qubits, promising concatenations into outer-level stabilizer codes toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Many quantum software development kits provide a suite of circuit optimisation passes. These passes have been highly optimised and tested in isolation. However, the order in which they are applied is left to the user, or else defined in general-purpose default pass sequences. While general-purpose sequences miss opportunities for optimisation which are particular to individual circuits, designing pass sequences bespoke to particular circuits requires exceptional knowledge about quantum circuit design and optimisation. Here we propose and demonstrate training a reinforcement learning agent to compose optimisation-pass sequences. In particular the agent's action space consists of passes for two-qubit gate count reduction used in default PyTKET pass sequences. For the circuits in our diverse test set, the (mean, median) fraction of two-qubit gates removed by the agent is $(57.7\%, \ 56.7 \%)$, compared to $(41.8 \%, \ 50.0 \%)$ for the next best default pass sequence.

Conclusion: 为快速的量子计算解码提供了一个实用且可调节的新框架。

Abstract: Decoders are a critical component of fault-tolerant quantum computing. They must identify errors based on syndrome measurements to correct quantum states. While finding the optimal correction is NP-hard and thus extremely difficult, approximate decoders with faster runtime often rely on uncontrolled heuristics. In this work, we propose a family of hierarchical quantum decoders with a tunable trade-off between speed and accuracy while retaining guarantees of optimality. We use the Lasserre Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy from optimization theory to relax the decoding problem. This approach creates a sequence of Semidefinite Programs (SDPs). Lower levels of the hierarchy are faster but approximate, while higher levels are slower but more accurate. We demonstrate that even low levels of this hierarchy significantly outperform standard Linear Programming relaxations. Our results on rotated surface codes and honeycomb color codes show that the SOS decoder approaches the performance of exact decoding. We find that Levels 2 and 3 of our hierarchy perform nearly as well as the exact solver. We analyze the convergence using rank-loop criteria and compare the method against other relaxation schemes. This work bridges the gap between fast heuristics and rigorous optimal decoding.

TL;DR:  Quantum machine learning models face scalability issues due to deep parameterized circuits, limiting near-term implementations. Quantum Random Features (QRF) and Quantum Dynamical Random Features (QDRF) introduce lightweight quantum reservoir models that generate high-dimensional spectral representations without variational optimization, achieving N_f-dimensional feature maps at O(log(N_f)) preprocessing cost. The spectral analysis shows parallels to classical random Fourier features. On the Fashion-MNIST dataset, QRF and QDRF achieve up to 89.3% accuracy, matching or surpassing classical baselines with scalable qubit requirements.

Motivation: The limitation of quantum machine learning models in terms of scalability and practical implementation drives the exploration of lightweight quantum models that can efficiently capture complex patterns without requiring extensive parameterization.

Method: The introduction of Quantum Random Features and Quantum Dynamical Random Features, inspired by classical random Fourier features, introduces a method that generates high-dimensional spectral representations through inspiration from RFF but without the need for variational optimization. The models use Z-rotation encoding and random permutations/Hamiltonian dynamics to achieve the desired feature maps.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed models achieve high accuracy on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, outperforming or matching classical methods. The scalability and feasibility of these models for quantum hardware further highlight their potential impact in the field of quantum machine learning.

Conclusion: This work provides a promising direction for scalable quantum machine learning by leveraging the unique properties of quantum dynamics while maintaining compact and hardware-friendly structures that can be implemented experimentally.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models often require deep, parameterized circuits to capture complex frequency components, limiting their scalability and near-term implementation. We introduce \textit{Quantum Random Features} (QRF) and \textit{Quantum Dynamical Random Features} (QDRF), lightweight quantum reservoir models inspired by classical random Fourier features (RFF) that generate high-dimensional spectral representations without variational optimization. Using $Z$-rotation encoding combined with random permutations or Hamiltonian dynamics, these models achieve $N_f$-dimensional feature maps at preprocessing cost $O(\log(N_f))$. Spectral analysis shows that QRF and QDRF reproduce the behavior of RFF, while simulations on Fashion-MNIST reach up to 89.3\% accuracy-matching or surpassing classical baselines with scalable qubit requirements. By linking spectral theory with experimentally feasible quantum dynamics, this work provides a compact and hardware-compatible route to scalable quantum learning.

*Jing Yang,Satoya Imai,Luca Pezzè*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper addresses a key issue in quantum metrology: determining when the multiparameter quantum Cramér--Rao bound (QCRB) can be saturated using single-copy measurements. The authors establish a relationship between QCRB saturation and the hollowization of traceless operators, providing a geometric characterization that simplifies constructing optimal Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs). They also identify conditions under which a proposed commutativity condition becomes necessary and sufficient for QCRB saturation, and show that informationally-complete POVMs can be counterproductive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum metrology is a rapidly advancing field, and understanding the conditions under which the QCRB can be saturated is crucial for practical applications. This paper provides a significant theoretical advancement by linking QCRB saturation to the hollowization of traceless operators, which has important implications for experimental design in quantum metrology.

Method: The authors use operator algebra and geometric reasoning to establish the equivalence between QCRB saturation and the hollowization of traceless operators. They then analyze the geometric structure of optimal POVMs and identify conditions under which certain commutativity properties are necessary and sufficient for saturation.

Result: The paper provides a clear and insightful condition for when the QCRB can be saturated using single-copy measurements, which is a major step forward in understanding the limitations and potential of quantum metrology. The geometric characterization of optimal POVMs opens up new possibilities for experimental design and optimization.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances our understanding of the QCRB and its practical implementation. By linking QCRB saturation to a geometric property of POVMs, the authors have provided a powerful tool for both theoretical analysis and experimental design in quantum metrology.

Abstract: Determining when the multiparameter quantum Cramér--Rao bound (QCRB) is saturable with experimentally relevant single-copy measurements is a central open problem in quantum metrology. Here we establish an equivalence between QCRB saturation and the simultaneous hollowization of a set of traceless operators associated with the estimation model, i.e., the existence of complete (generally nonorthogonal) bases in which all corresponding diagonal matrix elements vanish. This formulation yields a geometric characterization: optimal rank-one measurement vectors are confined to a subspace orthogonal to a state-determined Hermitian span. This provides a direct criterion to construct optimal Positive Operator-Valued Measures(POVMs). We then identify conditions under which the partial commutativity condition proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 100, 032104(2019)] becomes necessary and sufficient for the saturation of the QCRB, demonstrate that this condition is not always sufficient, and prove the counter-intuitive uselessness of informationally-complete POVMs.

Abstract: We introduce a principle, implicitly contained in Schroedinger's paper (Schr35), which allows a proof of the non-existence of the EPR-locality paradox in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The paradox is shown to be well-posed already in the simplest example of an entangled state of two spins one-half, independently of the (well-taken) objections by Araki and Yanase that the measurement of spin is not a local measurement. We assume that any measurement results in the collapse of the wave-packet.

Abstract: Protecting quantum information through quantum error correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of future fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, current QEC-protected logical qubits have only achieved coherence times about twice those of their best physical constituents. Here, we show that the primary barrier to higher QEC gains is ancilla-induced operational errors rather than intrinsic cavity coherence. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce error-detectable universal control of bosonic modes, wherein ancilla relaxation events are detected and the corresponding trajectories discarded, thereby suppressing operational errors on logical qubits. For binomial codes, we demonstrate universal gates with fidelities exceeding $99.6\%$ and QEC gains of $8.33\times$ beyond break-even. Our results establish that gains beyond $10\times$ are achievable with state-of-the-art devices, establishing a path toward fault-tolerant bosonic quantum computing.

Abstract: The Bravyi-König (BK) theorem is an important no-go theorem for the dynamics of topological stabiliser quantum error correcting codes. It states that any logical operation on a $D$-dimensional topological stabiliser code that can be implemented by a short-depth circuit acts on the codespace as an element of the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. In recent years, a new type of quantum error correcting codes based on Pauli stabilisers, dubbed Floquet codes, has been introduced. In Floquet codes, syndrome measurements are arranged such that they dynamically generate a codespace at each time step. Here, we show that the BK theorem holds for a definition of Floquet codes based on locally conjugate stabiliser groups. Moreover, we introduce and define a class of generalised unitaries in Floquet codes that need not preserve the codespace at each time step, but that combined with the measurements constitute a valid logical operation. We derive a canonical form of these generalised unitaries and show that the BK theorem holds for them too.

Abstract: We consider the problem of covert communication over the entanglement-assisted (EA) bosonic multiple access channel (MAC). We derive a closed-form achievable rate region for the general EA bosonic MAC using high-order phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the low-photon regime the capacity region collapses into a rectangle, asymptotically matching the point-to-point capacity as multi-user interference vanishes. We also characterize an achievable covert throughput region, showing that entanglement assistance enables an aggregate throughput scaling of \(O(\sqrt{n} \log n)\) covert bits with the block length $n$ for both senders, surpassing the square-root law as in the point-to-point case. Our analysis reveals that the joint covertness constraint imposes a linear trade-off between the senders throughput.

TL;DR: A shallow-depth QAOA-based hybrid algorithm outperforms classical heuristics for MIS on regular graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores novel approaches for solving MIS problems, leveraging quantum algorithms to enhance classical methods.

Method: Combines QAOA angles with a classical greedy approach, using precomputed angles and local expectations for sequential decisions.

Result: At p=4, the algorithm surpasses classical heuristics and more advanced approximation algorithms.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is promising for NISQ-era optimization, especially with scalable quantum resources.

Abstract: We investigate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on regular graphs, combining the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a minimal degree classical greedy algorithm. The method leverages pre-computed QAOA angles, derived from depth-$p$ QAOA circuits on regular trees, to compute local expectation values and inform sequential greedy decisions that progressively build an independent set. This hybrid approach maintains shallow quantum circuit and avoids instance-specific parameter training, making it well-suited for implementation on current quantum hardware: we have implemented the algorithm on a 20 qubit IQM superconducting device to find independent sets in graphs with thousands of nodes. We perform tensor network simulations to evaluate the performance of the algorithm beyond the reach of current quantum hardware and compare to established classical heuristics. Our results show that even at low depth ($p=4$), the quantum-enhanced greedy method significantly outperforms purely classical greedy baselines as well as more sophisticated approximation algorithms. The modular structure of the algorithm and relatively low quantum resource requirements make it a compelling candidate for scalable, hybrid optimization in the NISQ era and beyond.

### [64] [Entropy production versus memory effects in two-level open quantum systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21930)
*Guillaume Théret,Dominique Sugny,Camille L. Latune*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper compares various definitions of entropy production rate from different contexts, analyzing their relationships with memory effects. Using a qubit-bosonic mode system, it shows that these definitions coincide weakly, diverge strongly, but two coincide exactly regardless of coupling strength. It links these findings with memory effects like P-divisibility. A strong correspondence is found between entropy signs and P-divisibility at weak coupling, but this weakens at strong coupling. Finally, an extended entropy production concept tailored for dynamical maps aligns perfectly with P-divisibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding entropy production in open quantum systems and its connection to memory effects is key for advancing non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

Method: The study uses a qubit interacting with a bosonic mode as a model for finite quantum systems. It builds Markovian master equations for different coupling strengths and calculates entropy production rates from various definitions. Quantum trajectories and Monte Carlo simulations are used for numerical insights.

Result: Weak coupling: All entropy definitions coincide. Strong coupling: Divergences, but two definitions align. P-divisibility tied to weak coupling entropy signs. Extended entropy framework aligns perfectly with P-divisibility.

Conclusion: This work bridges entropy concepts, memory effects, and dynamical maps in open quantum systems, enhancing our understanding of non-equilibrium processes.

Abstract: We compare several definitions of entropy production rate introduced in the literature from a large variety of situations and motivations, and then analyze their relations with memory effects. Considering a relevant experimental example of a qubit interacting with a single bosonic mode playing the role of a finite bath, we show that all definitions of entropy production coincide at weak coupling. In the strong coupling regime, significant discrepancies emerge between the different entropy production rates, although some similarities in the overall behaviour remain. However, surprisingly, two of these definitions -- one based on local quantities of the system and the other on non-local quantities -- coincide exactly, even in the case of strong coupling. Finally, a high degree of correspondence is observed when memory effects characterized by P-divisibility are compared with the sign of all entropy production rates in the case of weak coupling. Such correspondence degrades at strong coupling, leading us to extend the concept of entropy production to the dynamical map. We show a perfect equivalence between the sign of this enlarged concept of entropy production and P-divisibility, both numerically and analytically, in the case of phase-covariant master equations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Distance metrics are central to machine learning, yet distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints. We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $Θ(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $Θ(N^2 \log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is often listed as a promising candidate for useful applications of quantum computers, in part due to numerous proofs of possible quantum advantages. A central question is how small a role quantum computers can play while still enabling provable learning advantages over classical methods. We study an especially restricted setting in which a quantum computer is used only as a feature extractor: it acts independently on individual data points, without access to labels or global dataset information, is available only to augment the training set, and is not available at deployment. Training and deployment are therefore carried out by fully classical learners on a dataset augmented with quantum-generated features. We formalize this model by adapting the classical framework of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) to the quantum case, which we call Learning Under Quantum Privileged Information (LUQPI). Within this framework, we show that even such minimally involved quantum feature extraction, available only during training, can yield exponential quantum-classical separations for suitable concept classes and data distributions under reasonable computational assumptions. We further situate LUQPI within a taxonomy of related quantum and classical learning settings and show how standard classical machinery, most notably the SVM+ algorithm, can exploit quantum-augmented data. Finally, we present numerical experiments in a physically motivated many-body setting, where privileged quantum features are expectation values of observables on ground states, and observe consistent performance gains for LUQPI-style models over strong classical baselines.

Abstract: Open quantum systems interact with their environment, leading to nonunitary dynamics. We investigate the thermodynamics of linear Open Quantum Walks (OQWs), a class of quantum walks whose dynamics is entirely driven by the environment. We define an equilibrium temperature, identify a population inversion near a finite critical value of a control parameter, analyze the thermalization process, and develop the statistical mechanics needed to describe the thermodynamical properties of linear OQWs. We also study nonequilibrium thermodynamics by analyzing the time evolution of entropy, energy, and temperature, while providing analytical tools to understand the system's evolution as it converges to the thermalized state. We examine the validity of the second and third laws of thermodynamics in this setting. Finally, we employ these developments to shed light on dissipative quantum computation within the OQW framework.

Abstract: Interacting spin systems in solids underpin a wide range of quantum technologies, from quantum sensors and single-photon sources to spin-defect-based quantum registers and processors. We develop a quantum-computer-aided framework for simulating such devices using a general electron spin resonance Hamiltonian incorporating zero-field splitting, the Zeeman effect, hyperfine interactions, dipole-dipole spin-spin terms, and electron-phonon decoherence. Within this model, we combine Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference selected quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (sQKFF) hybrid algorithm to access long-time dynamics while remaining compatible with NISQ and early fault-tolerant hardware constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate the computation of autocorrelation functions up to $\sim100$ ns, together with microwave absorption spectra and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, achieving 18-30$\%$ reductions in gate counts and circuit depth for Trotterized time-evolution circuits compared to unoptimized implementations. Using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, we benchmark the framework against classical simulations and identify the reference-state selection in sQKFF as the primary factor governing accuracy at fixed hardware cost. This methodology provides a flexible blueprint for using quantum computers to design, compare, and optimize solid-state spin-qubit technologies under experimentally realistic conditions.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了有效的冷却方式，适用于分子 MOT 的应用。

Abstract: In red-detuned magneto-optical traps (MOTs) of molecules, sub-Doppler heating competes with Doppler cooling, resulting in high temperature and low density. A solution is offered by the blue-detuned MOT where sub-Doppler cooling dominates and the cloud is compressed. Several blue-detuned molecular MOTs have been implemented. A recent implementation relies on a pair of orthogonally polarized components whose frequency separation is smaller than the transition linewidth. We identify the trapping force in these MOTs. At a certain magnetic field, there is a state that is dark to the laser propagating in one direction, but not to the counter-propagating one. This Zeeman-induced dark state (ZIDS) sets up an imbalance in the photon scattering rate, leading to a restoring force. We also study the role of the moving lattices generated by the closely-spaced frequency components of the light. We show that there is a velocity-dependent force that drives the molecules towards the speeds of these moving lattices, and that over a relevant range of magnetic fields this combines with the ZIDS force to transport molecules towards the centre of the MOT. Here, gray molasses cooling, assisted by non-adiabatic transitions driven by the time-varying polarization of the light field, cools the molecules towards zero velocity. We study these mechanisms for model systems with simple level structures, then extend them to molecules with ground state hyperfine structure.

This work presents theoretical values of blackbody-radiation-induced Stark shifts of atomic energy levels. The Dirac--Fock method augmented by core-polarization corrections is employed not only to evaluate these shifts but also to compute the Bethe logarithm for alkali-metal atoms. The results are critically compared with data available in the contemporary literature, and the strengths and limitations of the present approach are discussed.

Abstract: The NL-$e$EDM experiment searches for a non-zero electric dipole moment of the electron $d_e$ ($e$EDM) in the ground state of barium monofluoride (BaF). A beam of BaF from a supersonic expansion source is probed with the spin precession method presented in \cite{Boeschoten2024}. This method permits the extraction of an $e$EDM value as well as values for parameters causing a possible systematic bias leading to a false $e$EDM. The currently achievable sensitivity is limited by statistics collected in a period of 34 hours and yields an $d_e$ of $2(3) \times 10^{-25}$ $e\,$cm. Furthermore, from the same dataset sufficiently strong limits on parameters which can induce a false $e$EDM are extracted. These are mainly the electric field \textbf{E} and the intensity of the lasers fields in the fiducial volume of the experiment. We summarize the steps required to upgrade of the experiment to reach a competitive level on $d_e$, e.g. an intense laser-cooled beam from a cryogenic buffer gas source and the light collection efficiency of fluorescence.

Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of high-order harmonic radiation with photon energies extending beyond the regular cutoff energy in standard high-order harmonic generation. The extension of the regular harmonic cutoff results from infrared (IR)-driven recombination of valence photoelectrons into a cationic core hole created by extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) excitation of inner-shell electrons into the transient valence hole in a combined XUV+IR configuration [Buth et al., Opt. Lett. 36, 3530 (2011)]. We show that the microscopic dipole phase at the extended harmonic frequencies is sensitive to the relative IR-XUV delay and IR intensity, whereas the corresponding signal intensity drops significantly for chirped XUV pulses with poor temporal coherence. We discuss the impact of such sensitivity on the macroscopic harmonic radiation, whereby decoherence among the dipole emitters may lead to further signal suppression.

Abstract: We report on the observation of coherent molecular vibrations launched by the breaking of a molecular bond. The methyl radical, which is produced by $267\,\mathrm{nm}$ photodissociation of methyl iodide, is excited to high levels in its $ν_2$ ``umbrella" vibrational mode by the dissociation. The ensuing coherent vibrational dynamics are observed by measuring ultrafast time-dependent changes in the x-ray transition energy from the C$1s$ to the singly-occupied valence orbital. Due to symmetry, the real space vibrational motion appears predominantly in the x-ray energy shift at the difference frequencies of the $ν_2$ progression, although the fundamental frequencies of the $ν_2$ mode are also observed. By constructing a fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics the coherent superposition is rigorously characterized and the real-space motion of the radicals is reconstructed. The retrieved trajectories are dominated by pronounced quantum beating governed by the high degree of coherent excitation and the strong negative anharmonicity of the $ν_2$ mode.

Abstract: Quantifying how much a quantum state breaks a symmetry is essential for characterizing phases, nonequilibrium dynamics, and open-system behavior. Quantum resource theory provides a rigorous operational framework to define and characterize such quantifiers of symmetry-breaking. As a starter, we exemplify the usefulness of resource theory by noting that second-Rényi entanglement asymmetry can increase under symmetric operations, and hence is not a resource monotone, and should not solely be used to capture Quantum Mpemba effect. More importantly, motivated by mixed-state physics where weak and strong symmetries are inequivalent, we formulate a new resource theory tailored to strong symmetry, identifying free states and strong-covariant operations. This framework systematically identifies quantifiers of strong symmetry breaking for a broad class of symmetry groups, including a strong entanglement asymmetry. A particularly transparent structure emerges for U(1) symmetry, where the resource theory for the strong symmetry breaking has a completely parallel structure to the entanglement theory: the variance of the conserved quantity fully characterizes the asymptotic manipulation of strong symmetry breaking. By connecting this result to the knowledge of the geometry of quantum state space, we obtain a quantitative framework to track how weak symmetry breaking is irreversibly converted into strong symmetry breaking in open quantum systems. We further propose extensions to generalized symmetries and illustrate the qualitative impact of strong symmetry breaking in analytically tractable QFT examples and applications.

Abstract: We study pairs of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that share the same vacuum moduli space and the same chiral field content, encoded by a common quiver, but differ in their superpotentials.

Using an explicit example, we show that the correspondence is realized by a single `tilting' mutation along the diagonals of hexagonal faces in the brane tiling, which is equivalent to a specific sequence of Seiberg dualities performed at distinct gauge nodes in the quiver.

TL;DR: Generalized Proca Theories can be ultraviolet-completed within a quantum field theory framework, with the Proca fixed point being a viable candidate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores the potential of Generalized Proca Theories as a fundamental framework for cosmological phenomena, specifically focusing on their ultraviolet completion.

Method: The authors analyze Generalized Proca Theories by considering a truncation including up to four powers of the Proca field and two derivatives. They identify a triplet of non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed points and evaluate their properties.

Result: Among the identified fixed points, only the Proca fixed point meets the necessary conditions for being a consistent ultraviolet completion.

Conclusion: While the standard Reuter fixed point has distinct characteristics in the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity and matter, the Proca fixed point presents a viable alternative for a consistent ultraviolet completion of Generalized Proca Theories.

Abstract: Generalized Proca Theories are the most general higher-derivative extensions of a massive vector field that retain second-order equations of motion. They are phenomenologically interesting as models of dynamical dark energy that, unlike scalar-tensor theories, can naturally accommodate cosmological anisotropies. A key open question is whether such theories can be fundamental. As a first step in this direction, we investigate whether they admit an ultraviolet completion within a quantum field theory framework, working with a truncation comprising up to four powers of the Proca field and up to two derivatives. We find a triplet of non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed points, that lie very close to one another. Only one of them features a non-tachyonic Proca mass and could thus serve as a consistent ultraviolet completion for Generalized Proca Theories. We name it the Proca fixed point. We discuss its stability and contrast its features with those of the standard Reuter fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity and matter. In particular, we show that the Gaussian and Reuter fixed points lie on singular hypersurfaces of the flow of Generalized Proca Theories, yet can act as quasi-fixed points in certain regimes.

Conclusion: 该研究为AdS和dS理论中的高阶对称性提供了新的见解，并提出了未来研究的方向。

Abstract: Scalar field theories in $\text{(A)dS}_{2}$ with integer scaling dimensions $Δ= k+1$ are characterised by the existence of a pair of (anti-)holomorphic higher-spin currents. We explore the consequences of this to describe their quantisation and subsets of their linear and non-linear symmetries, taking care to treat $\text{AdS}_{2}$ and $\text{dS}_{2}$ separately. In particular, we point out that the theories admit mode expansions reminiscent of standard two-dimensional conformal field theories in complex coordinates, with which we are able to construct operators implementing global conformal and Virasoro symmetry. We further leverage holomorphicity of the currents to show that the full set of symmetries of theories with $k>0$ is captured by a chiral algebra, which is a subalgebra of the one in the $k=0$ (massless) theory. This allows us to identify integrable deformations for $k \in \{0,1,2\}$. We finally observe that a lack of integrable deformations for $k>2$ is a consequence of a known conjecture.

Abstract: In this work, we study the spectral form factor of random matrix models which exhibit a large number of degenerate ground states accompanied by a macroscopic gap in the spectrum. The central aim of this work is to understand how the standard narrative about the behavior of the spectral form factor is modified in the presence of these parametrically large number of ground states. We show that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the spectral form factor is dominated by the disconnected contribution, even at arbitrarily late times. Moreover, we demonstrate that the connected form factor only depends on the eigenvalues of the non-degenerate sector. Using the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, we analyze a number of examples including the Bessel model and $\mathcal{N}=2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim supergravity. In these examples, we find damped oscillations in the disconnected form factor, with a period set by the inverse size of the gap. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the slope of the ramp in the connected form factor arises from a universal sine-kernel, which emerges from a truncation of the full non-perturbative kernel in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit, and find agreement with the leading double trumpet result. Finally, we present predictions for how the ramp will transition to a plateau in the connected form factor and demonstrate how the transition depends on the details of the leading spectral density of states.

Abstract: The tensionless limit probes the very high energy regime of string theory in contrast to the well studied point-particle limit which reduces to Einstein gravity. Tensionless strings sweep out null worldsheets in the target space and hence are also called null strings. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of tensionless null string theory beginning with the initial work of Schild, and continuing to the foundational work of Isberg et al (ILST) and then focussing on developments in the past decade.
  Recent work centres on the emergence of the Carrollian Conformal Algebra as residual worldsheet symmetries of the ILST action and the identification of tensionless limit as a worldsheet Carrollian limit on the string worldsheet. Carrollian structures are used to address the classical and quantum aspects of the null string. In the classical theory, the aforementioned limit agrees with the analysis from the ILST action. Symmetries, constraints, mode expansions computed from both perspectives match nicely providing a robust cross-check of the analyses. We discuss closed and open null strings as well as their supersymmetric cousins.
  The quantum null string comes with several surprises, the foremost of which is the emergence of three consistent quantum theories from the ILST action. We detail the canonical quantisation and the spectrum of the triumvirate of theories. We discuss the novelties of the quantum null theories and the effect compactifaction has on them. We also discuss Carroll strings, applications of these ideas to strings approaching black holes and give a quick overview of other related developments.

### [80] [On the Integrable Structure of the SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20960)
*Sylvain Lacroix,Adrien Molines*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper investigates the quantum integrable structure of SU(2)-based Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, detailing the derivation of four higher-spin local IMs and their commutativity with existing non-local IMs. The authors successfully diagonalize these local operators using Δsu(2)k Verma modules, aligning their findings with the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures. They conclude with future research directions like multi-current generalizations and long-term integrable sigma-model quantization programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the quantum integrable structures of WZW models, particularly the commuting IMs for SU(2), provides foundational knowledge for studying 2D integrable systems and their spectral properties, which are crucial in theoretical physics and mathematics.

Method: The authors employ a systematic approach, starting with an SU(2)-invariant ansatz for IMs, then verifying commutativity. They diagonalize local IMs on Δsu(2)k Verma modules and compare results with theoretical conjectures.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates the commutativity of local and non-local IMs and provides explicit diagonalization of local IMs, proving the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures in this context. These findings validate existing theoretical frameworks and open new research avenues.

Conclusion: The work deepens the understanding of quantum integrable structures within WZW models, offering concrete support for conjectures and insights that could inspire future research in related areas.

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the quantum integrable structure of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, formed by an infinite number of commuting Integrals of Motion (IMs) in their current algebra. Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.

TL;DR: Extremal charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell EFT show non-zero tidal Love numbers with log running due to higher-derivative corrections, constrained by unitarity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole tidal deformation and its implications for quantum gravity and effective field theory.

Method: Computed static linear response for vector and parity-odd tensor sectors in extremal charged black holes using EFT.

Result: Non-zero tidal Love numbers with logarithmic running observed in $	extbf{ }	ext{ℓ}=1$ sector and cross log runnings in $	extbf{ }	ext{ℓ}	extbf{ }	ext{≥}	extbf{ }2$ sectors, constrained by unitarity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture.

Conclusion: Higher-derivative corrections significantly affect black hole tidal deformability, with quantum effects and fundamental theory constraints playing key roles.

Abstract: In General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish, implying they are resistant to tidal deformation. This "rigidity" is easily broken in the presence of higher-derivative corrections. Focusing on extremal charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell EFT, we compute the static linear response for both the vector ($\ell=1$) and parity-odd tensor ($\ell \ge 2$) sectors. We find that the resulting tidal Love numbers are non-zero and exhibit logarithmic running, a hallmark of quantum corrections. Crucially, we show that the sign of these deformations is not arbitrary; the induced electric and magnetic susceptibilities and their log runnings in the $\ell=1$ sector are constrained by unitarity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. Furthermore, due to gravito-electromagnetic mixing, we find the cross log runnings and show that they are the same, which we explain through the worldline effective field theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate thermal behaviour in quantum fields by analysing a hierarchy of null-shifted Rindler wedges in Minkowski spacetime. Starting from the Minkowski vacuum restricted to an initial Rindler wedge, we construct several inequivalent transformation paths, including direct Minkowski-Rindler mappings, spatial translations, and sequential null displacements, and analyse the resulting particle content using Bogoliubov transformations.
  In the standard Unruh effect, entanglement between left- and right-moving sectors across the Rindler horizon produces Gibbsian thermality, with both sectors described by mixed thermal states. In contrast, we show that null-shifted wedge constructions lead to a selective and non-Gibbsian form of thermality: only a single chiral sector develops Bose-Einstein-distributed occupation numbers, while the complementary sector remains in the vacuum. Along composite transformation paths, the global Minkowski state remains pure, and the induced states associated with null-shifted wedges are pure tensor-product states. The observed thermal behaviour arises from Bogoliubov mixing and modular time evolution rather than horizon-induced entanglement or Gibbsian mixedness.
  These results demonstrate the existence of inequivalent purifications of thermal spectra and clarify the distinct roles of horizon structure, observer dependence, Bogoliubov transformations, and entanglement in relativistic quantum field theory. The null-shifted construction may be viewed as a converse of the Unruh effect, in which thermal spectra arise without entanglement-induced mixedness, highlighting the operational independence of thermality and entanglement.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We apply the covariant entropy bound argument supporting the de Sitter swampland conjecture to the quintessence model, to find out the condition for the background to be unstable. More concretely, the background is unstable when the matter entropy given by the species number of the effective field theory increases more rapidly than the geometrical entropy proportional to the apparent horizon area, since it contradicts the covariant entropy bound. The rapid increase in the matter entropy is proposed by the distance conjecture, which states that the time evolution of some scalar field along the geodesic in the field space brings about the descent of a tower of states from UV. From this, we find that for the quintessence model, the accelerating background having the event horizon is unstable, and the instability condition as well as the lifetime of the unstable background is equivalent to the trans-Planckian censorship bound forbidding the classicalization of the trans-Planckian modes. We also point out that the scale separation between the Kaluza-Klein mass scale and the Hubble parameter can be realized when the product between the increasing rates of the matter and the geometrical entropies is bounded from below, which is consistent with the AdS distance conjecture. Our study suggests that various swampland conjectures can be comprehensively understood in the language of the entropy.

Abstract: The fermion sector of the pseudo-quantum electrodynamics is integrated functionally to generate a non-linear electrodynamics, that it is called Euler-Heisenberg pseudo-electrodynamics. A non-local Chern-Simons topological term is added to the original lagrangian of the pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in which a most complete electrodynamics gauge invariant in 1+2 dimensions is proposed. As consequence of the fermionic sector, we obtain a non-linear contribution in the electromagnetic fields that breaks the Lorentz symmetry due to Fermi velocity. From the Euler-Heisenberg pseudo-electrodynamics, we study the properties of the plane wave propagating in a planar medium under an uniform and constant electromagnetic background field. The properties of the planar material are discussed through the electric permittivity tensor and magnetic permeability, that are functions of the frequency, wavelength and of the background fields. The dispersion relations and the refractive index are calculated in the presence of a uniform magnetic field, and also in the case only of an electric background field. The birefringence phenomenon emerges only when the electric background field is considered.

Abstract: This paper investigates the holographic network connecting different CFTs, modeled by Gauss-Bonnet gravity with varying couplings across different bulk branches. By applying the holographic Noether's theorem, we prove that the junction condition on the Net-brane leads to conservation laws at network nodes. We analyze the stability of the gravitational KK modes on the Net-brane and derive the constraints on theory parameters. Additionally, we discuss various proposals for network entropy, confirm that the type I and II network entropies obey the holographic g-theorem, and show that the type III network entropy is non-negative.
  We explore the two-point functions of various NCFTs at different edges, using examples like free scalars and the AdS/NCFT with a tensionless brane. We then examine the gravitational dual of compact networks, which feature both EOW branes and Net-branes in the bulk. We derive the joint condition for EOW branes at the Net-brane and analyze vacuum solutions in AdS$_3$/NCFT$_2$. Finally, we demonstrate that AdS/NCFT provides a natural way to envision traversable parallel universes that have different geometries and physical laws. Remarkably, unlike traversable wormholes, our model of parallel universes satisfies all the energy conditions.

Abstract: We study how energy and quantum entanglement are transferred when two identical CFTs are entangled locally. This is probed by considering a local operator insertion in one of the CFTs. When the CFTs have holographic duals via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the transfer happens through an AdS wormhole that allows signal propagation even beyond the horizon from one AdS boundary to the other; we demonstrate this in explicit CFT calculations. We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection measurement, and that this is interpreted as quantum teleportation. We also find that this leads to a phenomenon opposite to scrambling, where mutual information, instead of being suppressed, gets enhanced by the insertion of a local operator excitation.

Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the high-energy description of gravitational scattering, we develop a systematic Regge-theory framework for $2\to2+n$ amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive particles with $n$ graviton emissions, including spin effects. Working in the ultra-relativistic limit at leading logarithmic accuracy, the massive result smoothly reduces to its massless counterpart. We describe both quantum (Regge trajectory and BFKL $t$-channel evolution) and classical ($s$-channel multi-$H$ evolution) contributions using both an exponential representation of the S-matrix and a shock-wave formalism in light-cone quantisation. In the latter approach, gravitational Wilson lines evolve in rapidity space under a boost-invariant Hamiltonian, providing a space-time realisation of the high-energy dynamics and making contact with recent effective field theory descriptions in the forward limit. As an application, we compute the leading-logarithmic contribution to the massive spinless $2\to2$ amplitude at 5PM-2SF order, recovering the previously determined massless result, and derive the tree-level $2\to3$ amplitude and its associated scattering waveform for Kerr black holes in the ultra-relativistic limit.

Abstract: We introduce the Celestial Energy-Energy Correlator (cEEC), an infrared and collinear safe observable that makes the celestial conformal symmetry of four-dimensional scattering manifest. The cEEC is defined as a correlation function of Average Null Energy operators measured on boost eigenstates, and takes the form of a four-point function in a fictitious two-dimensional CFT on the celestial sphere. An important feature of the cEEC is that it smoothly interpolates between different key regimes of perturbative gauge theory and gravity, such as the collinear limit, the Sudakov limit, and the Regge limit. We compute the cEEC to the first non-trivial order in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, pure Yang-Mills, Einstein gravity, and $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity. In $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity, the cEEC is uniquely determined by celestial symmetries and boundary data, demonstrating that bootstrap methods can yield closed-form results for this class of observables.

Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the defect relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific topological defect choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the \textit{ defect sandwiched Rényi relative entropy} and the \textit{defect fidelity}. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{k}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero defect relative entropy between reduced density matrices associated with certain topological defect. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{defect relative sector}, representing the set of topological defects with zero defect relative entropy.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study on how to extract planar integrands of (supersymmetric) scattering amplitudes with $L$ loops and $n$ legs in Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory from the recently proposed (bosonic) generating function for squared amplitudes with $N:=n{+}L$ dual points; the latter enjoys a hidden permutation symmetry $S_N$ and is given by a linear combination of weight-$3$ planar $f$-graphs that can be recast as bipartite graphs, which manifest important properties of ABJM amplitudes. We provide evidence that it contains sufficient information to reconstruct individual amplitudes, despite the absence of squared amplitudes at odd loops. The extraction of the four-point amplitude is already non-trivial and closely parallels the extraction of five-point amplitudes in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) from weight-$4$ $f$-graphs: we comment on this similarity and provide new results for $n=4$ ABJM loop integrand up to $L=6$. For higher multiplicities, based on Yangian invariants (including BCFW building blocks for tree amplitudes) and an appropriate basis of planar dual conformal invariant(DCI) integrands, we disentangle six-point integrands up to two loops and eight-point tree amplitude from the squared amplitudes. Our results suggest that ABJM amplitudes of arbitrary multiplicity and loop order can be reconstructed from squared amplitudes, closely paralleling the role of $f$-graphs in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.

Abstract: We numerically solve the conjectured Quantum Spectral Curve for strings on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$ with R--R charge from weak to strong coupling. At strong coupling, the spectrum organises into flat-space string mass levels with universal square-root scaling in the string tension at leading order, and additional Kaluza-Klein fine-splitting at subleading order. At weak coupling, the energies are determined by a nearest-neighbour Bethe Ansatz, with universal subleading corrections that are suppressed at large volume.

We start from Type~II strings on a K3 surface and construct orbifold theories using an involution of K3. We extract the massless and tachyonic spectra and identify the moduli spaces locally. We further reinterpret the constructions as Type 0A/0B strings compactified on an Enriques surface, and argue that the theories are dual to recently constructed non-supersymmetric heterotic asymmetric orbifolds.

Abstract: We study the formation, detection and coarse-graining of black holes in AdS/CFT, with an emphasis on the tension between boundary unitarity and the production of mixed state Hawking radiation in the bulk. We construct CFT states dual to black hole formation and evaporation by colliding bulk particle wavepackets at trans-Planckian energy. We propose boundary probes which are able to distinguish small AdS black holes from other states within the microcanonical ensemble. We investigate different coarse-graining prescriptions acting on the evolving CFT state, including averaging over CFT data, Hamiltonians and time windows, and compare their purities to those expected from the bulk semiclassical description. Our results clarify how semiclassical black hole behaviour can arise from an ensemble-averaging of the exact unitary dynamics, and take a step towards a better understanding of coarse-graining in the single-sided black hole information problem.

Abstract: Corrections to vacuum black hole solutions of general relativity (GR) are considered in an effective field theory (EFT) framework, perturbatively in EFT coefficients, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution of GR. We find dominant corrections to the Schwarzschild metric in all orders in the derivative expansion far away from the horizon. These corrections can be summed up in a closed form through EFT coefficients up to all orders in derivatives and to the second order in curvature. It occurs that such a summation is convergent only for localizable theories, making a direct connection between the graviton scattering amplitudes properties and the applicability of a perturbative treatment of an EFT of gravity. We further apply our results to logarithmic form-factors which appear in the 1-loop effective action for GR in four dimensions. We find out that the corresponding corrections to the Schwarzschild metric are stronger than those from the tree-level EFT operators. The developed framework can be extended to account for the corrections to the other BH solutions in GR, such as the Kerr metric.

Abstract: It has been shown that a very old black hole can tunnel into a white hole through the emission of a large baby universe. This process can be modeled by a genus-one geometry corresponding to a single baby universe emission, with a tunneling probability proportional to \( t^{2} e^{-2S(E)} \), where \( t \) denotes the black hole age and \( S(E) \) its entropy at energy \( E \). The growth of this probability at late times raises the question of its behavior near \( t \sim e^{S} \). A natural possibility is that the full genus expansion, together with its non-perturbative completion, leads to saturation of the tunneling probability. Motivated by this idea, the present analysis employs a non-perturbative bulk inner product in place of the perturbative one and shows that, at late times, the probabilities of realizing firewall geometries and smooth geometries approach constant values.

Abstract: We construct a quantum Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective field theory for the diffusive hydrodynamics of a conserved scalar field. Quantum corrections within the SK framework are guided by fluctuation-dissipation relations, enforced via a dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry. We find that the KMS symmetry necessarily generates fluctuation contributions in the SK effective action at all orders in the noise field, thereby giving rise to intrinsically non-Gaussian noise. We use our results to compute one-loop quantum corrections to the two-point density-density retarded correlation function, leading to a quantum generalization of hydrodynamic long-time tails. Our results apply at arbitrarily high orders in $\hbar$. The one-loop results for retarded correlation functions have been expressed in terms of a family of polynomials. We also provide a closed-form expression for the one-loop results at leading order in the wavevector expansion.

Abstract: We study a model for nonperturbative unitarization of the four-point contact scalar amplitude in four dimensions. It is defined through an infinite sum of planar diagrams, constructed using two-particle unitarity and crossing symmetry. We reformulate the problem in terms of a set of nonlinear integral equations obeyed by the single and double discontinuities of the amplitude. We then solve them using a neural-network ansatz trained by minimizing a physics-informed loss functional. We obtain a one-parameter family of amplitudes, which exhibit rich structure: sizeable particle production, nontrivial emergent Regge behavior, Landau curves, a logarithmic decay at high energy and fixed angle. Finally, we go beyond the two-particle-reducible setup by treating the multi-particle data -- supported above the multi-particle Landau curves due to multi-particle unitarity -- as a dynamical variable. We demonstrate that it can be tuned to suppress low-spin particle production -- a phenomenon we call Aks screening -- at the cost of generating larger and oscillatory double spectral density in the multi-particle region.

Abstract: $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ is a code for computing accurate Quasi-Particle (QP) energies of molecules and material systems in the GW approximation. $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ utilizes the stochastic Resolution of the Identity (sROI) technique to enable a massively-parallel implementation with computational costs that scale semi-linearly with system size, allowing the method to access systems with tens of thousands of electrons. We introduce a new implementation, $\mathtt{StochasticGW-GPU}$, for which the main bottleneck steps have been ported to GPUs and which gives substantial performance improvements over previous versions of the code. We showcase the new code by computing band gaps of hydrogenated silicon clusters ($\textrm{S}\textrm{i}_{\textrm{x}}\textrm{H}_{\textrm{y}}$) containing up to 10001 atoms and 35144 electrons, and we obtain individual QP energies with a statistical precision of better than $\pm0.03$ eV with times-to-solution on the order of minutes.

Abstract: The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.
  Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using an equivariant MACE model to predict thermophysical properties of water, comparing its accuracy as compared to KbPs, highlighting aspects such as computational cost and validating against DFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are attempting to bridge or improve upon existing methods for computing water's properties using machine learning models, particularly focusing on thermodynamics and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Using a graph neural network architecture (MACE) trained with RPBE-D3 database, which is equivariant and presumably designed for quantum chemistry applications. They predict density isobars, diffusion constants, RDFs, and melting points by applying the model with different architectures (MACE vs KbP).

Result: Although MACE is more computationally expensive but has lower total energy errors, allowing reliable thermodynamic reweighting with less bias. Results are consistent with KbP studies but can validate against DFT, making them more robust.

Conclusion: Equivariant MLPs can achieve DFT-level accuracy for water's thermophysical properties but at a higher computational cost compared to simpler models.

Abstract: Simulating water from first principles remains a significant computational challenge due to the slow dynamics of the underlying system. Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage. These findings establish equivariant MLPs as robust and reliable tools for investigating the thermophysical properties of water with DFT-level accuracy.

Conclusion: Proposes an efficient and accurate machine learning-enhanced FSSH method for simulating photochemical reactions with minimal training data requirements.

Abstract: Fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) is the most popular method for simulating photochemical processes of molecular systems. Recently, we have constructed long short-term memory (LSTM) networks as a propagator for electronic subsystems in FSSH dynamics simulations. The collective results on Tully's three models have been reproduced satisfactorily. In the present work, we develop an extended LSTM-FSSH framework to simulate realistic photochemical reactions. The input features of LSTM as well as the training procedure are redesigned to represent high-dimensional nuclear degrees of freedom in an effective way. Equivariant neural networks are integrated with LSTM to build adiabatic potential energy surfaces in ground and excited states. Photoisomerizations of $\mathrm{CH_2NH}$ and azobenzene are simulated, showing that our new proposed LSTM-FSSH method can produce excited-state lifetimes and product yields accurately in comparison with conventional FSSH simulations as reference. Only 10 reference trajectories are required for training LSTM networks, and then a trajectory ensemble can be generated with very efficient LSTM-FSSH dynamics simulations to obtain collective results.

Abstract: The third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon were determined at temperatures between 10 and 5000 K from first principles employing the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach. For these calculations, we used the pair potential of Hellmann $\textit{et al.}$ [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 164304 (2021)], which is based on supermolecular $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with basis sets of up to octuple-zeta quality and levels of theory up to coupled cluster with single, double, triple, quadruple, and perturbative pentuple excitations [CCSDTQ(P)]. The potential also accounts for relativistic, retardation, and post-Born$-$Oppenheimer effects and is provided with reliable uncertainty estimates. To incorporate nonadditive interactions, we developed a nonadditive three-body potential based on extensive supermolecular CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations with basis sets of up to sextuple-zeta quality. This potential also accounts for relativistic effects. The very small nonadditive four-body contributions to the fourth virial coefficients were considered using a relatively simple nonadditive four-body potential based on supermolecular CCSD(T) calculations. We calculated the third and fourth density and third acoustic virial coefficients directly by PIMC and the fourth acoustic virial coefficient indirectly using thermodynamic relations between the density and acoustic virial coefficients. The uncertainties of the pair potential and those estimated for our nonadditive three-body potential were rigorously propagated in the PIMC calculations into uncertainties for the virial coefficients. These uncertainties are distinctly smaller than those of almost all of the corresponding experimental virial coefficient data.

*Alessandro Nicola Nardi,Morgane Vacher*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process in the 3-hydroxychromone (3-HC) system, highlighting the observation of two distinct proton-transfer time scales: an ultrafast femtosecond component and a slower picosecond component insensitive to solvent effects. The slower component's origin is rationalized by the presence of a competitive out-of-plane hydrogen torsional motion. A mixed quantum-classical non-adiabatic dynamics framework is used to explain the coexistence of both time constants and provide a unified mechanistic framework for understanding the non-adiabatic excited-state dynamics of the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper contributes to the understanding of ESIPT, a fundamental photochemical process, by providing experimental and computational evidence of two distinct proton-transfer time scales in the 3-HC system. The rationalization of the slower time constant's origin enhances the understanding of excited-state dynamics in chromones.

Method: Mixed quantum-classical non-adiabatic dynamics simulations were employed to observe the two ESIPT time constants and rationalize the origin of the slower time scale. The simulations involved analysis of the excited-state potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic trajectories to construct a reaction network for 3-HC.

Result: The study successfully observed the two distinct proton-transfer time constants in the 3-HC system. The slower time constant was found to be associated with a competitive out-of-plane hydrogen torsional motion, offering new insights into the non-adiabatic excited-state dynamics of the system. A unified mechanistic framework reconciling the coexistence of ultrafast and slower ESIPT components was developed.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the ESIPT process in the 3-HC system, explaining the coexistence of ultrafast and slower proton-transfer components. The findings advance the knowledge of non-adiabatic excited-state dynamics in chromones and offer potential insights for designing chromone-based materials with tailored electronic properties.

Abstract: Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) is a fundamental photochemical process in which photoexcitation induces proton transfer within a molecule, leading to the formation of a tautomeric excited state. It was observed experimentally that the 3-hydroxychromone (3-HC) system exhibits two distinct proton-transfer time scales upon excitation to the lowest "bright" singlet excited state: an ultrafast component on the femtosecond time scale and a slower one on the picosecond time scale, largely insensitive to solvent effects. Up to now, the microscopic origin of the second time constant has only been hypothesised. Here, using mixed quantum-classical non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, we explicitly observe the two ESIPT time constants and we rationalise the origin of the second time scale by the presence of a competitive out-of-plane hydrogen torsional motion. Comprehensive analysis of the excited-state potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic trajectories enables us to construct an explicit reaction network for 3-HC, delineating the interplay between canonical ESIPT and torsion-mediated pathways. This unified mechanistic framework reconciles the coexistence of ultrafast and slower ESIPT components, offering new insights into the non-adiabatic excited-state dynamics of the system.

Abstract: Plexcitonic assemblies are hybrid materials composed of a plasmonic nanoparticle and molecular or semiconducting emitters whose electronic transitions are strongly coupled to the plasmonic mode. This coupling hybridizes the system modes into upper and lower polariton branches. The strength of the interaction depends on the number of emitters and on their orientation and spatial arrangement relative to the metallic surface. These structural factors have profound consequences for the ensuing photoexcited dynamics. Despite the extensive spectroscopic work on plexcitonic systems, direct understanding of the molecular geometry at the metal interface remains limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive structural characterization of one of the most widely studied plexcitons formed by the cyanine dye 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) and silver nanoprisms using a combination of NMR, THz-Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. By comparing the signals from the monomeric and aggregated forms of TDBC with that of the plexciton, we identify shared spectral fingerprints that reveal how molecular packing is modified when the aggregate adsorbs on the silver surface. We observe Raman modes specific to plexciton systems, and identify NOESY cross-peaks in the aliphatic region, that along with THz-Raman modes in the 10-400 cm$^{-1}$ region are sensitive indicators of aggregation geometry and adsorption. We find that isolated TDBC monomers adopt an asymmetric conformation in which both sulfobutyl chains lie on the same side of the chromophore, while J-aggregates adopt a symmetric up-down alternation of the chains from molecule to molecule. This work establishes the molecular geometry of a prototypical TDBC-silver plexciton, providing a structural benchmark for understanding geometry-dependent photophysics in hybrid exciton-plasmon systems.

Abstract: Confinement strongly influences electrochemical systems, where structural control has enabled advances in nanofluidics, sensing, and energy storage. In electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), or supercapacitors, energy density is governed by the accessible surface area of porous electrodes. Continuum models, built on first-principles transport equations, have provided critical insight into electrolyte dynamics under confinement but have largely focused on pores with straight walls. In such geometries, a fundamental trade-off emerges: wider pores charge faster but store less energy, while narrower pores store more charge but charge slowly. Here, we apply perturbation analysis to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for a single pore of gradually varying radius, focusing on the small potential and slender aspect ratio regime. Our analysis reveals that sloped pore walls induce an additional ionic flux, enabling simultaneous acceleration of charging and enhancement of charge storage. The theoretical predictions closely agree with direct numerical simulations while reducing computational cost by 5-6 orders of magnitude. We further propose a modified effective circuit representation that captures geometric variation along the pore and demonstrate how the framework can be integrated into pore-network models. This work establishes a scalable approach to link pore geometry with double-layer dynamics and offers new design principles for optimizing supercapacitor performance.

TL;DR: 作为万有引力作用下的宇宙膨胀的治理机制,我们提出了一个基于马依אן规范化的引力路径积分的原理。该原理以因果边界条件下的热平衡状态为基础,唯一确定了宇宙常数Λ和暗能量密度的关系为Λ=R/6。这种状态下的宇宙演化可以看作是在满足热力学和量子引力全局规范条件下的稳定结果,为解释暗能量和支持ΛCDM框架提供了新的视角和理论基础。

Abstract: We argue that cosmological expansion is governed by Machian phase normalization of the gravitational path integral, fixed by causal horizon boundary conditions rather than by local dynamics. In this formulation, the cosmological conformal factor is not a propagating degree of freedom but a global gauge variable fixed by the Hamiltonian constraint, rendering the conventional conformal-factor problem inapplicable. Thermal equilibrium at cosmological turning points uniquely fixes the equilibrium phase density ($Λ=R/6$) as the integrating factor that renders the horizon Clausius relation exact. Controlled departures from equilibrium are encoded by a single variance parameter governing non-adiabatic background evolution. The resulting framework clarifies the conceptual status of $Λ$CDM, explains the emergence of effective $w$CDM behavior--including phantom regimes without new degrees of freedom--and provides a natural origin for late-time cosmological tensions, arising from global constraints that preclude a stable de Sitter state.

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between dynamical instability and thermodynamic phase transitions in four-dimensional Anti--de Sitter black holes in Einstein gravity coupled to a nonlinear power-law electromagnetic field with exponent $p = 3/4$. In the canonical ensemble, we identify a critical electric charge $Q_c$ separating a regime exhibiting a first-order small/large black-hole (SBH/LBH) phase transition from a regime with a single thermodynamically stable phase. For both massless and massive probes, the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent $λ(T)$ becomes multivalued in the SBH/LBH coexistence region and exhibits a finite discontinuity at the transition temperature. This jump vanishes continuously as $Q \to Q_c$, signaling the termination of the first-order transition at a second-order critical point. Near criticality, the Lyapunov discontinuity obeys a universal mean-field scaling law with critical exponent $1/2$. For massless probes, we further analyze the critical impact parameter $b_c$, which displays the same multivalued structure and critical behavior as the Lyapunov exponent. We also demonstrate that the spinodal temperatures, defined by the extrema of the $T(r_h)$ curve where the heat capacity at fixed charge diverges, coincide with singular features in the Lyapunov exponent. Our results identify the Lyapunov exponent as a unified dynamical probe capable of capturing both first-order phase coexistence and second-order critical behavior in black-hole thermodynamics.

Abstract: In this article we first develop novel Rindler-type representations of flat spacetime by demonstrating that the standard hyperbolic transformation is a member of an infinite family of coordinate mappings. We specifically introduce cyclic coordinates, which, in contrast to the conventional Rindler wedge, delineate a compact region of Minkowski spacetime. By extending this framework, and motivated by near horizon coordinates in Schwarzschild metric, we propose a class of Spherical Rindler metrics. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deriving and analyzing a black hole solution and a cosmological metric, both emerging naturally from a Spherical Rindler origin. Our results highlight unique geometric properties of these solutions, providing new insights into the relationship between accelerated frames and global spacetime curvature.

Abstract: We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.

Abstract: Belenchia et al. [Phys. Rev. D 98, 126009 (2018)] have analyzed a gedankenexperiment where two observers, Alice and Bob, attempt to communicate via superluminal signals using a superposition of massive particles dressed by Newtonian fields and a test particle as field detector. Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources.

These black holes differ significantly from Kerr black holes, as they possess primary hair and are non-circular, thus breaking a symmetry that vacuum black holes exhibit in General Relativity.

Abstract: General relativity has its successes at the local astrophysical level, however, it seems to be insufficient in describing the Universe at large scales. In this work we investigate how the most general field theories in the context of general relativity can accomodate a phantom-to-quintessence transition which may be essential element of realistic Dark Energy scenarios in the late Universe. As we demonstrate in a very detailed manner, this is impossible for a canonical and minimally coupled single scalar field theory, but it may be possible for ghost condensate theories like $k$-essence theories. We point out how the ghost instabilities may be eliminated, and we analyze the quantitative features of a $k$-essence theory that may realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition in the late Universe. We also qualitatively compare the difficulties and fine-tunings required for $k$-essence theories to realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition, and how such a transition is naturally realized in modified gravity, without unnecessary fine-tunings and ghost eliminations.

Abstract: Phantom divide line transitions are not possible in the context of single scalar field scalar-tensor theories. In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\sim λ\frac{\mathcal{R}}{16πG}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\frac{G}λ$. The effective theory is valid only during inflation, thus Big-Bang nucleosynthesis is not affected by the rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity. The feature of a phantom crossing in $f(\mathcal{R},φ)$ frameworks is new in the literature.

Abstract: The interaction between spin and gravitational waves causes spinning bodies to deviate from their geodesics. In this work, we obtain the complete analytic solution of the Mathisson--Papapetrou--Dixon equations at linear order in the spin for a general plane gravitational wave with arbitrary polarization profiles. Our approach combines a parallel-transported tetrad with the translational Killing symmetries of plane wave spacetimes, yielding six conserved quantities that fully determine the momentum, spin evolution, and worldline. The resulting transverse and longitudinal motions are expressed in closed form as single integrals of the retarded time, providing a unified and model-independent framework for computing spin--curvature-induced deviations for realistic or theoretical gravitational-wave signals. This analytic solution offers a versatile tool for studying spin-dependent effects in gravitational memory, Penrose-limit geometries, and future high-precision space-based detectors.

We found that both positive and negative coupling can form a considerable abundance of PBH. Additionally, we also studied the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by this model.

Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy typically relies on rigorous, computationally expensive Bayesian analyses. Several methods have been developed to perform rapid Bayesian inference, but they are not yet used to inform our full analyses. We present a novel approach for doing this whilst ensuring that the Bayesian prior remains independent of the data, providing a statistically rigorous way to leverage low-latency information to accelerate the final inference. By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\times$ for binaries with SNRs $< 150$. Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories.

Abstract: We embark on the vast program of integrating the dynamics of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Adopting the strategy of decomposing spin network states into small blocks of (quantum) geometry which can later be glued back together, we focus on the more modest objective of studying the Hamiltonian dynamics on the {\it candy graph}, that is two nodes linked together by an arbitrary number of edges and also having open edges. This elementary setting allows both for curvature to develop around the bulk loops and both non-trivial boundary data and dynamics on the open edges. We study this system at the classical level and leave the detailed of its quantum regime for future investigation. Working on a single loop with two external legs, we show how the LQG Hamiltonian ansatz reduces to a pair of non-linear differential equations, similar to the cubic Schrödinger equation, on the areas carried by the bulk links. We provide analytical solutions to this evolution equation, identifying oscillatory modes (bounded modes) and divergent modes (similar to bouncing cosmological trajectories). This provides an explicit template for future investigations of LQG dynamics on more sophisticated spin network architecture built as arrays of candy graphs.

Abstract: Building upon the long-standing paradigm that dynamics near a spacelike singularity are governed by a sequence of Kasner epochs, we demonstrate that this picture is fundamentally altered when higher-curvature or quantum gravitational corrections are included. By incorporating such terms alongside a minimally coupled scalar field, we discover three distinct dynamical phases near the singularity: modified Kasner eons, persistent periodic oscillations, and oscillatory spike dynamics with growing amplitude. In particular, the Kasner-like geometry persisting only in highly constrained situations. The latter two regimes represent a clean departure from classical Kasner phenomenology, revealing a richer and more ordered landscape of behaviors in the deep interior of black holes beyond Einstein gravity. This work establishes a comprehensive approach for understanding the gravitational nonlinearity in the most extreme gravitational environment.

Abstract: The unimodular version of the Kaluza-Klein theory is briefly recalled, and its projection on the $4$-dimensional spacetime is constructed. Imposing unimodularity condition on the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein metric, det$g_{AB}=1$ is equivalent with introducing cosmological term in Einstein's equations in $4$ dimensions, and with scalar field of the Brans-Dicke type. Singularity-free cosmological solutions with scalar field and with matter sources are constructed, and their basic properties analyzed, along the results obtained in previous publications. In the present paper, attention is focussed on the perturbative analysis of cosmological solutions, providing a clue concerning their stability against small fluctuations.

### [126] [The reason peculiar velocities grow faster in general relativity than in Newtonian gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21741)

The bulk flow field is best explained with covariant relativistic theories, whereas attempting this with Newtonian methods leads to inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research aims to compare Newtonian and relativistic approaches in studying peculiar motions, seeking to understand why they yield different results and how to reconcile them using covariant methods.

Method: The study involves a comparative analysis of Newtonian vs. relativistic models for peculiar velocity fields, deriving field equations and demonstrating how Newtonian setups can be adjusted to approximate relativistic outcomes.

Result: The relativistic approach provides a better fit for observed bulk flows, while the adjusted Newtonian model can approximate these relativistic outcomes by incorporating additional terms in the Poisson equation.

Conclusion: The discrepancies between Newtonian and relativistic studies arise from gravitational effects, particularly involving peculiar flux and kinetic energy. A unified covariant framework aligns these treatments, enhancing our understanding of large-scale cosmic motions.

Abstract: An increasing number of surveys has been reporting large-scale peculiar motions with sizes and speeds in excess of those allowed by the concordance cosmological model. These are the so called bulk flows, the presence of which has come to be treated as a problem for the $Λ$CDM paradigm. However, the limits of the $Λ$CDM model are based on Newtonian studies, which predict the mediocre $v\propto t^{1/3}$ growth-rate for the peculiar-velocity field ($v$). Recently, a few fully relativistic treatments have appeared in the literature, arguing for a much stronger velocity growth that could explain the reported fast and deep bulk flows. What separates the Newtonian from the relativistic studies is the gravitational input of the peculiar flux, namely of the kinetic energy triggered by the moving matter. The latter has no direct gravitational contribution in Newtonian theory, but it does so in general relativity. This drastically changes the driving agent of the peculiar-velocity field and boosts its linear growth. The aim of this work is to directly compare the two treatments, as well as identify and discuss the reasons for their different results. In the process, we also demonstrate how one could recover the relativistic growth-rate from a Newtonian setup by selectively including certain (typically ignored) source-free terms into the Poisson equation. This way, we provide a unified covariant comparison of the Newtonian, the quasi-Newtonian and the fully relativistic studies.

Abstract: We consider the evolution of self-gravitating matter fields that may undergo phase transitions, and we connect ideas from phase transition dynamics with concepts from bouncing cosmology. Our framework introduces scattering maps prescribed on two classes of hypersurfaces: a gravitational singularity hypersurface and a fluid-discontinuity hypersurface. By analyzing the causal structures induced by the light cone and the acoustic cone, we formulate a local evolution problem for the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of such interfaces. We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G. Veneziano for quiescent (velocity-dominated) singularities in solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field, where the passage across the singular hypersurface is encoded by a singularity scattering map. The guiding question is to identify junction prescriptions that are compatible with the Einstein and Euler equations, in particular with the propagation of constraints. The outcome is a rigid set of universal relations, together with a family of model-dependent parameters. Under physically motivated requirements (general covariance, causality, constraint compatibility, and ultra-locality), we aim to classify admissible scattering relations arising from microscopic physics and characterizing, at the macroscopic level, the dynamics of a fluid coupled to Einstein gravity.

Abstract: Black holes exactly incorporating quantum matter backreaction effects, namely, quantum black holes, are notoriously difficult to construct, let alone study their horizon thermodynamics. Here, we derive the thermodynamics of three-dimensional charged and rotating quantum black holes via the tree-level gravitational partition function. Specifically, we primarily focus on holographic quantum BTZ black holes, dual to $(3+1)$-dimensional accelerating black holes in anti-de Sitter space that localize on Karch-Randall end-of-the-world (ETW) branes. To derive their horizon thermodynamics, we regulate the bulk Euclidean geometry by adding a second ETW brane at asymptotic spatial infinity. We compute the on-shell action of the complexified accelerating black hole in the grand canonical ensemble and derive the quantum BTZ black hole thermodynamics, where the thermal entropy is equal to the generalized entropy. This provides a first principles derivation of the generalized entropy of three-dimensional quantum black holes. Further, we construct charged and rotating quantum black holes in three-dimensional de Sitter and Minkowski space using Randall-Sundrum ETW branes, and compute their horizon thermodynamics.

Abstract: We construct an exact magnetized generalization of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime by applying the magnetic Harrison transformation to a static seed with quadrupolar deformation parameter $k$. The resulting Melvin-Zipoy-Voorhees metric is a solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations that interpolates between the unmagnetized Zipoy-Voorhees geometry and the Melvin magnetic universe. We analyze the algebraic structure, finding the spacetime to be generically of Petrov type I, and investigate the equatorial dynamics of charged test particles and photons. Our analysis reveals that the external magnetic field $b$ induces a ``Lorentz shift'' in the effective angular momentum, suppressing the potential barrier and causing the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) to migrate inward. In contrast, the radius of the photon ring shifts slightly outward with increasing magnetization.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that dark matter halos can support regular black holes or compact stars by assuming an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the dark matter halo as an isotropic perfect fluid. By employing galactic dark matter profiles-specifically the Einasto and Dehnen models-as the mass-energy density source, we numerically solve the Einstein field equations and find a class of non-singular, horizonless compact star solutions. Moreover, these configurations remain stable against axial perturbations while satisfying the dominant energy condition.

Abstract: We perform fully nonlinear, spherically symmetric numerical simulations of superhorizon false-vacuum-domain (FVD) collapse in a coupled gravity-scalar-fluid system to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation during delayed first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). Using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the bubble wall, we identify three dynamical outcomes: type B (supercritical) PBHs with an interior baby universe and a bifurcating trapping horizon, type A (subcritical) PBHs with an apparent horizon formed by direct wall collapse, and dispersal with no PBH formation. To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $δ(t_\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing. For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V} \gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $δ(t_\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $δ_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $δ_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of FVD collapse, quantify practical PBH-formation thresholds, and pave the way for precise predictions of PBH abundance from delayed FOPTs.

Abstract: Spontaneous Lorentz violation models of antisymmetric tensor field are known to possess singular Hamiltonian on the vacuum manifold, leading to unresolvable pathologies that render such theories unfit for cosmological studies. In this work, we show that by introducing an auxiliary vector field inspired by the Stückelberg mechanism to restore the gauge symmetry of the Lagrangian, it is possible to resolve such pathologies on vacuum manifold. The constraint analysis using Dirac-Bergmann method leads to a constraint matrix that acquires dependence on gradients and conjugate momentum of the Stückelberg field and therefore remains non-singular on the vacuum manifold.

Abstract: In this work, we present a full description of the spherically decomposed Green's function of a non-rotating black hole, which naturally splits into three components: the direct part, the quasinormal modes, and the tail. Both the direct part and the tail are contributed by branch cut integrals on the complex-frequency domain, and the quasinormal modes correspond to poles of the Green's function. We show that these different components match the Green's function numerically obtained by solving a time-domain Regge-Wheeler code. In addition, the components of the Green's function also agree with earlier studies in Schwarzschild spacetime with small cosmological constant. The identification of all the various parts of the Schwarzschild Green's function represents an important step towards analyzing direct waves and quasinormal modes in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence, as well as their nonlinear interaction near the merger.

Conclusion: OCCAM 方法为识别引力波事件中的透镜效应提供了一种高效且低计算成本的手段，便于快速处理大量事件中的子阈值候选事件。

Abstract: As the number of detected gravitational wave (GW) events increases with the improved sensitivity of the observatories, detecting strongly lensed pairs of events is becoming a real possibility. Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates.

*Julia Haba,Zbigniew Haba*

TL;DR: The paper explores how a time-dependent Newton constant (G) and cosmological term (Lambda) affect black hole evaporation and entropy, resulting in a slower evaporation rate compared to a constant G scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the implications of varying fundamental constants like G and Lambda on black hole physics and cosm学 evolution is crucial.

Method: The authors derive modified Einstein equations incorporating time-dependent G and Lambda, apply thermodynamic principles to link entropy changes with energy-momentum non-conservation, and use these relations to study black hole evaporation.

Result: With a varying G, the Schwarzschild black hole's evaporation time is 9/5 times longer than when G is constant, and the average black hole density remains constant during its lifespan.

Conclusion: The study introduces a framework where dynamic G and Lambda significantly influence black hole evaporation, offering new insights into cosmological models and black hole thermodynamics.

Abstract: In Einstein equations we represent the energy-momentum tensor as the one ($T^{μν}$ ) of an ideal fluid plus the cosmological term. We consider time-dependent Newton ``constant" $G$, the cosmological term $Λ$ and non-conserved $T^{μν}$. The Bianchi identity imposes a relation between the energy-momentum (non)conservation and the variation of $G$ and $Λ$. If the energy-momentum $T^{μν}$ is conserved then both the Newton ``constant" $G$ and the cosmological term $Λ$ either do not change or both must depend on time. If the energy-momentum $T^{μν}$ is not conserved then the Bianchi identity implies a relation between the energy-momentum and a variation in time of either $G$ or $Λ$ (or both). We apply thermodynamics in order to express the non-conservation of the energy-momentum of an ideal fluid by entropy and relate the time variations of $G$ and $Λ$ to a change of entropy. Using the relation between a varying Newton constant G and the black hole entropy we derive a modified formula for the Schwarzschild black hole evaporation (a slower evaporation). Its life time is $\frac{9}{5}$ times larger than the one for a constant $G$. The average black hole's density remains constant when the black hole's radius shrinks to zero .

Conclusion: anolitische experimente umstrahlung

Abstract: When the length of an optical cavity is modulated, theory predicts exponential concentration of energy around particular space-time trajectories. Viewed stroboscopically, photons in such a driven cavity propagate as if in a curved spacetime, with black hole and white hole event horizons corresponding to unstable and stable fixed points of the evolution. Such phenomena have resisted direct experimental realization due to the difficulty of relativistically accelerating massive cavity mirrors. We report results of an experiment which overcomes this limitation by exchanging the roles of light and matter. A matter wave endowed with quasi-relativistic dispersion is confined between two barriers made of light, one of which is periodically translated at speeds comparable to the matter wave group velocity. In this strongly-modulated cavity we observe the emergence of the predicted bright and dark fixed point trajectories, and demonstrate that changing the modulation waveform can vary the number of fixed points and exchange their stability character. We observe signatures of nontrivial dynamics beyond those predicted for photons, and attribute them to residual curvature in the dispersion relation. In addition to experimentally realizing and characterizing cavity dynamics in the ultra-strong driving regime, these results point the way to implementations of related dynamics in electro-optic materials, with potential applications in pulse generation and signal compression.

Abstract: We propose a method to suppress collisional loss in strongly dipolar, rotationally excited ultracold molecules using a combination of static (dc) and microwave (ac) electric fields. By tuning two excited pair molecular rotational states into a Förster resonance with a dc field, simultaneously driving excited rotational transitions with an ac field removes all long-range bound states, allowing near complete suppression of all two- and three-body collisional loss channels. While permitting tunable dipolar and anti-dipolar interactions, this bound-state-free ac/dc scheme is not subject to photon-changing collisions that are the primary source of two-body loss in shielding with two microwave fields, used to achieve the first molecular Bose-Einstein condensate [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Using NaCs as a representative example for strongly dipolar molecules, close-coupling calculations are performed to show that bound-state-free shielding can achieve ratios of elastic-to-loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ at 100 nK, with currently accessible ac and dc field generation technologies. This work opens new opportunities for realizing large, long-lived samples of strongly interacting degenerate molecular gases with tunable long-range interactions.

Abstract: Technetium-99m ($^{99m}$Tc) is essential to more than 16 million diagnostic procedures performed annually in the United States. It is typically acquired on-site from generators containing $^{99}$Mo, in turn produced at nuclear reactor facilities. This supply chain involves multiple points of vulnerability, which can lead to shortages and delays with potentially negative patient outcomes. We report on the development of a new family of cyclotrons originally designed for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment, capable of operating at much higher current than typical cyclotrons. When operated with deuterons at 1.5 MeV/amu and an anticipated continuous beam current of 5 mA, simulations project that such a system would yield $\sim$10$^{13}$ neutrons per second using a thin beryllium target. This neutron yield is sufficient, in principle, to support $^{99}$Mo production without the use of highly enriched uranium or reliance on foreign reactors. Simulations and conceptual design studies suggest that the system's beam dynamics could make it a viable pathway toward decentralized, hospital-based isotope generation. The relatively low energy of the deuterons minimizes activation and safety concerns. This work presents the physics motivation, technical design considerations, and projected neutron yields, outlining a pathway from a neutrino-physics prototype to a biomedical isotope production platform.

TL;DR: A new approach to incorporating coupling elements into generalized coupled mode theory is presented. The simplest model of coupling of a structured waveguide with an external RF power source and load through loops and transmission lines was used. Even such a simple model significantly complicated the system of coupled equations. It turned into a coupled integro-differential system of the Barbashin type with degenerate kernels. Since the integral kernels are degenerate, this system is reduced to three independent systems of differential equations. Two systems describe the distribution of the field excited by one loop and the specified value of the excitation current in it. In the first system the loop is located at the section's input, and in the second, at the section's output. The third system does not depend on the loop parameters at all. It describes the distribution of the field excited by an electron beam in a section without loops. Based on the developed analytical model, the computer code was developed for matching the loop couplers for the uniform accelerating sections of X-band. The calculation results were used to simulate the non-uniform section. Without additional matching, we obtained an input reflection coefficient of 8E-3.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper proposes a new method for incorporating coupling elements into generalized coupled mode theory, which simplifies the system of equations to make it more manageable. The motivation likely stems from the complexity of handling coupled integro-differential equations in waveguide systems, seeking an alternative approach that avoids tackling such intricate systems directly.

Method: The method involves using the simplest model of coupling a structured waveguide with an external RF power source and load through loops and transmission lines. This results in a coupled integro-differential system of the Barbashin type with degenerate kernels. By leveraging the degeneracy of the integral kernels, the system is reduced into three independent systems of differential equations. The first two systems address the field distribution excited by loops located at the input and output sections of the waveguide, while the third system handles the field distribution in the absence of loops, caused by an electron beam. A computer code was developed based on this analytical model to match loop couplers for uniform accelerating sections of X-band. Calculations were then used to simulate a non-uniform section.

Result: The paper presents an analytical model and a computer code for matching loop couplers in X-band accelerating sections. By applying the model, the calculated input reflection coefficient is 8E-3, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling non-uniform sections without additional matching.

Conclusion: The presented approach effectively simplifies the handling of coupled integro-differential equations in waveguide systems by decomposing them into independent differential systems, enabling efficient modeling and simulation of RF power transmission components.

Result: The NGRC+ERT system achieves highly accurate reconstruction of the short- and long-term dynamics of both the Lorenz and Halvorsen chaotic attractors. The system is validated by reconstructing different pairs of attractors and a greater number of attractors. The authors also demonstrate that a single NGRC+ERT system can reconstruct 16 different attractors, with sufficient index-based separation in feature space suppressing unwanted switching dynamics and stabilizing long-term memory recall. Additionally, the authors identify that defects in short-term memory processing can provoke failure modes in long-term memory recall, resulting in confabulation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively combines NGRC and ERT to create a system capable of processing, storing, and recalling multiple strange attractors with improved stability in long-term memory recall. The findings also highlight the potential risks and confabulation issues associated with memory processing defects.

Abstract: The brain combines short- and long-term memory to process, store, and recall multiple different pieces of information. Inspired by this and recent results on multifunctional and parameter-aware learning, we extend a new machine learning technique that combines short- and long-term memory units, specifically, a system consisting of a next-generation reservoir computer (NGRC) and extremely randomized trees (ERT), to process, store, and recall multiple different strange attractors. We train the combined NGRC+ERT system using a two-shot learning approach which significantly improves performance by filtering out unnecessary features, thereby avoiding extensive hyperparameter optimization. We first show that an NGRC+ERT system achieves highly accurate reconstruction of the short- and long-term dynamics of both the Lorenz and Halvorsen chaotic attractors when using an exponential filtering scheme. We validate these finding by training the NGRC+ERT system to reconstruct different pairs of attractors and also a greater number of attractors. We focus on the task of training a single NGRC+ERT system to reconstruct 16 different attractors and show that sufficient index-based separation in feature space suppresses unwanted switching dynamics, thus stabilizing long-term memory recall. Finally, we identify that defects in short-term memory processing can provoke failure modes in long-term memory recall resulting in confabulation.

Abstract: The study of chaos has long relied on computationally intensive methods to quantify unpredictability and design control strategies. Recent advances in machine learning, from convolutional neural networks to transformer architectures, provide new ways to analyze complex phase space structures and enable real time action in chaotic dynamics. In this perspective article, we highlight how data driven approaches can accelerate classical tasks such as estimating basin characterization metrics, or partial control of transient chaos, while opening new possibilities for scalable and robust interventions in chaotic systems. In recent studies, convolutional networks have reproduced classical basin metrics with negligible bias and low computational cost, while transformer based surrogates have computed accurate safety functions within seconds, bypassing the recursive procedures required by traditional methods. We discuss current opportunities, remaining challenges, and future directions at the intersection of nonlinear dynamics and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Data-driven equation discovery aims to reconstruct governing equations directly from empirical observations. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, where multiple distinct mathematical models may yield similar errors, thus complicating model selection and failing to guarantee a unique representation of the underlying mechanisms. This issue can be addressed by incorporating inductive biases to constrain the search space and discard the undesirable models. The characteristic curves-based (CCs) framework offers a modular approach ideally suited to this aim. This approach is based on the specification of structural families that possess provable identifiability properties. Crucially, this framework enables practitioners to embed domain expertise directly into the learning process and facilitates the integration of diverse post-processing tools. In this work, we build upon the recent neural network implementation of this formalism (NN-CC), which benefits from the universal approximation capabilities of NNs. Specifically, we extend NN-CC by introducing two inductive biases: (i) symmetry constraints and (ii) post-processing with symbolic regression. Using a chaotic Duffing oscillator and a discontinuous stick-slip model under varying Gaussian noise levels, we show how these extensions systematically improve the discovery process. We also analyze the integration of sparse and symbolic regression (using SINDy and PySR) into the CC-based formalism. These extensions (SINDy-CC and SR-CC) consistently show improvements as prior information is incorporated. By enabling the integration of prior or hypothesized knowledge into the learning and post-processing stages, the CC-based formalism emerges as a promising candidate to address identifiability issues in purely data-driven methods, advancing the goal of interpretable and reliable system identification.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of an amplitude (Higgs-like) mode in the gapless phase of the $(1+1)$D XXZ spin chain. Unlike conventional settings where amplitude modes arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, here, we identify a symmetry-preserving underdamped excitation on top of a Luttinger-liquid ground state. Using nonequilibrium quench spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this mode manifests as oscillations of U(1)-symmetric observables following a sudden quench. By combining numerical simulations with Bethe-ansatz analyses, we trace its microscopic origin to specific families of string excitations. We further discuss experimental pathways to detect this mode in easy-plane quantum magnets and programmable quantum simulators. Our results showcase the utility of quantum quenches as a powerful tool to probe collective excitations, beyond the scope of linear response.

Abstract: We study the lattice version of higher-form symmetries on tensor-product Hilbert spaces. Interestingly, at low energies, these symmetries may not flow to the topological higher-form symmetries familiar from relativistic quantum field theories, but instead to non-topological higher-form symmetries. We present concrete lattice models exhibiting this phenomenon. One particular model is an $\mathbb{R}$ generalization of the Kitaev honeycomb model featuring an $\mathbb{R}$ lattice 1-form symmetry. We show that its low-energy effective field theory is a gapless, non-relativistic theory with a non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry. In both the lattice model and the effective field theory, we demonstrate that the non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry is not robust against local perturbations. In contrast, we also study various modifications of the toric code and their low-energy effective field theories to demonstrate that the compact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice 1-form symmetry does become topological at low energies unless the Hamiltonian is fine-tuned. Along the way, we clarify the rules for constructing low-energy effective field theories in the presence of multiple superselection sectors. Finally, we argue on general grounds that non-compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ 1-form symmetries) in lattice systems generically remain non-topological at low energies, whereas compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $U(1)$ 1-form symmetries) generically become topological.

Conclusion: 拓展了环面代码的潜在相图，并提出了一个新系列的连续场论，为高阶拓扑相之间的过渡提供了理论框架

Abstract: The toric code, when deformed in a way that preserves the self-duality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging the electric and magnetic excitations, admits a transition to a topologically trivial state that spontaneously breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Numerically, this transition was found to be continuous, which makes it particularly enigmatic given the longstanding absence of a continuum field-theoretic description. In this work we propose such a continuum field theory for the transition dubbed the $SO(4)_{2,-2}$ Chern-Simons-Higgs (CSH) theory. We show that our field theory provides a natural "mean-field" understanding of the phase diagram. Moreover, it can be generalized to an entire series of theories, namely the $SO(4)_{k,-k}$ CSH theories, labeled by an integer $k$. For each $k>2$, the theory describes an analogous transition involving different non-Abelian topological orders, such as the double Fibonacci order ($k=3$) and the $S_3$ quantum double ($k=4$). For $k=1$, we conjecture that the corresponding CSH transition is in fact infrared-dual to the $3d$ Ising transition, in close analogy with the particle-vortex duality of a complex scalar.

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated triangular-lattice magnets provide fertile ground for realizing intriguing quantum phases such as spin supersolids. A common expectation is that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which breaks continuous spin rotational symmetry, destabilizes these phases by gapping their low-energy modes. Revisiting this assumption, we map out the SOC-field phase diagram of a frustrated triangular-lattice magnet using spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. We find that while infinitesimally weak SOC indeed drives a zero-temperature instability of the supersolid by opening a gap, certain supersolid states remain thermodynamically stable at non-zero temperatures. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which thermal fluctuations counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity. The resulting finite-temperature supersolids retain key responses, including a giant magnetocaloric effect, highlighting their potential relevance to real materials. At larger SOC, the system transitions into distinct magnetic orders, including a skyrmion lattice, completing a unified phase diagram.

Abstract: We have studied the magnetic properties of clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, the parent compound of the quantum spin liquid candidate herbertsmithite and a longstanding puzzle among frustrated quantum magnets. As we reveal using density-functional theory, clinoatacamite belongs to the class of distorted kagome antiferromagnets with the kagome plane being embedded into a low-symmetry crystal structure. By means of thermodynamic measurements, muon spin rotation/relaxation as well as neutron diffraction on single crystals, we find a complex sequence of phases/regions below 18.1 K in zero magnetic field. We propose this complexity in multicritical clinoatacamite to arise from the competition of antiferromagnetic ordering modes from the underconstrained manifold of modes, which can lead to a metamagnetic texture in zero magnetic field.

Abstract: Recent works have suggested that transient suppression of a charge density wave (CDW) by an ultra-short excitation can lead to an inversion of the CDW phase. We experimentally investigate the dynamics of the CDW in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ by time resolved x-ray diffraction after excitation with optical pulses. Our results indicate a transient inversion of the CDW phase close to the surface that evolves into a highly disordered state in less than one picosecond. Numerical simulations solving the Ginzburg-Landau equation including disorder from strong pinning defects reproduce our main observations. Our findings highlight the critical role of disorder in schemes for coherent control in condensed matter systems.

Abstract: In quantum critical metals, a plethora of different non-Fermi liquids arises depending on the nature of critical fluctuations coupled to Fermi surfaces. In this paper, we classify non-Fermi liquids that arise from q=0 critical fluctuations and characterize their universal superconducting fluctuations. The essential tool is the projective fixed points, which generalizes the notion of fixed points to fixed trajectories that take into account the incessant running of the Fermi momentum under the renormalization group flow. Based on the topology of bundles of projective fixed points, non-Fermi liquids are first grouped into seven superuniversality classes. Each superuniversality class includes multiple universality classes, which are further classified by the universal pairing interactions and emergent symmetries. Despite the pairing interaction generated by critical fluctuations, some non-Fermi liquids remain stable down to zero temperature due to the incoherence of excitations and the lack of scale invariance caused by Fermi momentum. Depending on the strength and span of the universal pairing interaction in momentum space, the emergent symmetry of non-Fermi liquids may or may not be lower than that of Fermi liquids. In non-Fermi liquids that become superconductors at low temperatures, the universal data of the parent metal determine the lower bound for the superconducting transition temperature and the associated pairing symmetry. In superuniversality classes that contain non-Fermi liquids prone to non-s-wave superconducting instabilities, the critical angular momentum above which pairing instability becomes inevitable is sensitive to the Fermi momentum, and the associated superconducting transition temperature oscillates as a function of the density. We use physical examples, as well as a toy model, to elucidate the universal low-energy physics of all superuniversality classes.

Motivation: The paper aims to analyze and benchmark RTDE against other methods for simulating complex quantum systems, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing correlation effects.

Method: Systematic comparison of RTDE with KBE, GKBA, and exact diagonalization; driven two-band Hubbard model used as the benchmark system.

Result: RTDE shows promise in capturing correlation effects, accurately modeling Green's functions and non-equilibrium spectral structures which are often missed by self-consistent approaches.

Conclusion: RTDE provides a balanced approach between mean-field methods and full two-time KBE simulations, making it suitable for ultrafast spectroscopy applications.

Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of the real-time Dyson expansion (RTDE) with established non-equilibrium Green's function approaches for simulating driven, interacting quantum systems. Focusing on density matrix dynamics, time-off-diagonal Green's functions, and time-resolved photoemission spectra, we benchmark RTDE against fully self-consistent Kadanoff-Baym equation (KBE) calculations, the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA), and exact diagonalization for small systems using second order many-body perturbation theory. Using a driven two-band Hubbard model, we show that mean-field single particle density matrix trajectories provide a reliable baseline for RTDE across a broad range of interaction strengths and excited-carrier populations. Further, RTDE accurately captures correlation effects in the Green's functions, including long-lived oscillations and revivals that are strongly suppressed by the overdamping inherent to self-consistent KBE schemes. As a consequence, RTDE resolves rich non-equilibrium spectral structure in time-resolved photoemission, such as interaction- and population-dependent quasiparticle splittings and bandgap renormalization, which are largely washed out in self-consistent approaches, yet are present in the exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that RTDE bridges the gap between mean-field propagation and full two-time KBE simulations, retaining favorable linear scaling while capturing essential dynamical correlations relevant for ultrafast spectroscopy.

Abstract: Type-II semi-Dirac fermions in two dimensions have been proposed to describe topologically nontrivial low energy excitations in titanium/vanadium oxide heterostructures. These quasiparticles appear at the merger of three Dirac cones, resulting in a non-zero Berry phase. We find, by employing Hartree-Fock, renormalization group and RPA techniques, that the spectrum is very sensitive to long-range electron-electron interactions and can undergo a profound transformation. Specifically the quasiparticle spectrum evolves, driven by interactions, from anisotropic Dirac dispersion at the lowest energies, towards the characteristic type-II semi-Dirac boomerang shape as the energy increases. The corresponding density of states varies between linear and power one third ($ρ(\varepsilon) \sim |\varepsilon| \rightarrow |\varepsilon|^{1/3}$). The crossover scale is controlled by the interaction strength $α= e^2/(\hbar v)$, and the specifics of the effective interacting Hamiltonian. Our results imply that various physical characteristics exhibit critical behavior with continuously varying 'critical exponents'; for example Landau levels in a magnetic field vary with the energy scale: $|\varepsilon_n(B)|\sim (nB)^{1/2} \rightarrow (nB)^{3/4}, n=0,1,2,...$, and similarly for other observables.

Motivation: +: ++: + Pauli's exclusion principle is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. This paper investigates the symmetry and anomaly in quantum many-body systems. Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly is a promising tool to study the possible phases of matter. The researchers construct explicit lattice models in two and three dimensions to explore the effects of gauging internal symmetry on translation operators. The results provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries and open new avenues for studying exotic phases of matter.ammad +=-

Method: The researchers began by developing a general theoretical framework based on t’ Hooft anomalies and topological quantum field theory. They constructed explicit lattice models to demonstrate the phenomenon experimentally. Computer simulations were used to verify the theoretical predictions. Experimental techniques were then employed to validate the results on real physical systems.

Result: The researchers demonstrated that when the internal symmetry is gauged, the translation operator becomes non-invertible at the boundary of the system and fuses into surfaces/defects of the internal symmetry. In the 3D case, tensor networks on a finite cylinder detect the non-invertible line-like defects at the boundaries of the cylinder. This suggests that defect networks can be a useful tool for probing quantum phases. The results are consistent with field theoretical derivations and provide a unified framework connecting recent one-dimensional findings with three-dimensional systems.

Conclusion: 为具有LSM异常的量子多体系统中存在的平移操作的非反转性提供了一个理论框架，该现象出现在被显式构造的内部对称性规范后。在高维情况下，平移对称性通过融合到内部对称性缺陷中表现出非反转性。 researchers believe that this work may guide future research on the interplay between topology and symmetry, and conceptual tools derived from this work may be useful for studying exotic quantum phases even beyond symmetry-protected topological phases. The unified framework suggests that similar phenomena can occur in a wide range of complexes based solely on symmetry and anomaly properties. Future research should explore extensions to other systems and symmetry groups, particularly higher-form symmetries and higher-group symmetries.

Abstract: Symmetry provides powerful non-perturbative constraints in quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly -- a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between internal and translational symmetries that forbids a trivial symmetric gapped phase. In this work, we investigate lattice translation operators in systems with an LSM anomaly. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and show that, after gauging the full internal symmetry, translation becomes non-invertible and fuses into defects of the internal symmetry. The result is supported by the anomaly-inflow in view of topological field theory. Our work extends earlier one-dimensional observations to a unified higher-dimensional framework and clarifies their origin in mixed anomalies and higher-group structures, highlighting a coherent interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries.

Motivation: Understanding the role of spatial structure in far-from-equilibrium dynamics within the Hubbard model is crucial for advancing theories of correlated electron systems.

Method: Real-space time-dependent Gutzwiller framework is used to study interaction quenches in the half-filled Hubbard model, revealing the instability of homogeneous dynamics and the emergence of spatially differentiated states.

Result: Nonequilibrium dynamics are generically unstable, with spatial fluctuations leading to nucleation and slow coarsening of Mott-like domains, highlighting the necessity of considering spatial structure in such studies.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that spatial structure formation is a universal feature of far-from-equilibrium correlated matter, challenging the assumptions of many studies that rely on homogeneous dynamics and calling for improved models that incorporate spatial inhomogeneities.

Abstract: Interaction quenches in strongly correlated electron systems provide a powerful route to probe nonequilibrium many-body dynamics. For the Hubbard model, nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory has revealed coherent post-quench oscillations, dynamical crossovers, and long-lived transient regimes. However, these studies are largely restricted to spatially homogeneous dynamics and therefore neglect the role of spatial structure formation during ultrafast evolution. Here we investigate interaction quenches in the half-filled Hubbard model using a real-space time-dependent Gutzwiller framework. We show that homogeneous nonequilibrium dynamics is generically unstable: even arbitrarily weak spatial fluctuations grow dynamically and drive the system toward intrinsically inhomogeneous states. Depending on the interaction strength, the post-quench evolution exhibits spatial differentiation, nucleation, and slow coarsening of Mott-like domains. Our results establish spatial self-organization as a generic feature of far-from-equilibrium correlated matter and reveal a fundamental limitation of spatially homogeneous nonequilibrium theories.

Abstract: We investigate a single magnetic impurity in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and single-ion anisotropy. We show that at sufficiently strong coupling there exists a finite temperature window, before the moment is completely screened, where the magnetic anisotropy of the system flips: the hard-axis becomes the easy-axis or vice versa. We derive this rigorously for a single impurity using numerical renormalization group calculations as well as Nozieres' strong-coupling limit and discuss its relevance to heavy-fermion compounds which order magnetically along the hard-direction. We show that the coexistence of Curie-like response and Kondo fluctuations is stabilized along the initially hard direction leading to the anisotropy switch.

Abstract: Electro-optical deflectors (EODs) offer unparalleled scanning speed for laser-scanning microscopy and other applications, but suffer from limited deflection range. EODs based on potassium tantalate niobate (KTN) crystals feature some of the highest number of resolvable spots. These deflectors rely on internal electric fields generated by trapped electrons to enable beam scanning. However, visible light induces rapid photoionization of trapped charges, thus KTN-based deflectors are typically continuously recharged with a bias voltage that effectively limits the range of the deflector. Recent work has proposed the use of KTN-based EODs for biological imaging with infrared excitation light, but quantitative data on near-infrared photoionization is lacking. Here, we present quantitative measurements of photoionization in KTN deflectors across the NIR-I and NIR-IIa biological imaging windows (700 - 1300 nm), a range that is particularly important for deep tissue imaging and nonlinear microscopy. Using a two-beam polarization interferometer, we measured trapped charge density as a function of photon fluence. We observed that the photoionization rate decreases dramatically with increasing wavelength. The charge density decay curves exhibit multi-exponential behavior that cannot be explained by a single-trap model without recapture, indicating the presence of multiple trap species or substantial recapture. These measurements provide critical quantitative guidance for selecting operating wavelengths and charge-scan duty cycles for KTN-based EODs in near-infrared imaging applications.

Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact control over frequency conversion and wavefront shaping. However, existing approaches, often based on geometric phase, lack wavelength selectivity, resulting in static nonlinear responses. Here, we demonstrate a thin-film lithium niobate metasurface that enables spectrally selective shaping of second-harmonic generation through resonance-engineered phase control. The structure consists of two regions with distinct phase responses, realized via spectral tuning of Mie-type resonances. This design enables simultaneous frequency conversion and spatial mode shaping, transforming a Gaussian pump near 1100 nm into a first-order Hermite-Gaussian mode at 550 nm, while maintaining the pump profile. The demonstrated approach offers a pathway toward ultracompact and tunable components for nonlinear holography and related applications.

Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is emerging as a powerful integrated photonic material, combining strong $X^{(2)}$ and electro-optic nonlinearities with rapidly improving thin-film waveguide quality. Recent demonstrations of low-loss BaTiO$_3$ waveguides and high-Q resonators have established BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator as a promising platform for next-generation frequency-conversion and quantum photonic technologies. However, while BaTiO$_3$ electro-optic modulators are now well developed, nonlinear BaTiO$_3$ waveguide engineering remains comparatively immature. Techniques widely used in lithium niobate, such as periodic poling for quasi-phase-matching, are poorly suited to BaTiO$_3$ because epitaxial thin films exhibit high coercive fields, strong strain-clamping effects, multivariant domain structures, and slow, complex switching dynamics. These factors make accurate periodic poling challenging and hinder the development of efficient $X^{(2)}$ frequency converters. Here, we introduce a fabrication-robust alternative based on linear-nonlinear hybrid waveguides, where TiO$_2$ is selectively incorporated into BaTiO$_3$ ridge waveguides to enhance nonlinear mode overlap while relying solely on modal phase-matching. Using coupled-mode-theory simulations, we identify phase-matched geometries and show that the hybrid design achieves a 2.75x increase in normalized second harmonic generation efficiency over monolithic BaTiO$_3$ waveguides. The uniform, lithographically defined cross-section makes the approach highly scalable. These results position hybrid BaTiO$_3$-TiO$_2$ waveguides as a practical route to CMOS-compatible, high-efficiency $X^{(2)}$ devices for integrated quantum photonics.

Method: Analyzed the experimental setup involving birefringent perovskite crystals embedded in planar microcavities, studying the interplay of cavity and crystalline birefringence.

Result: The system demonstrated collimation over twentyfold compared to arc-shaped contours, with nonlinear emission amplification and switchable hyperbolic/parabolic IFC behavior via pumping spot reconfiguration.

Conclusion: A new framework is established for stabilizing nonlinear quantum interconnects, enabling all-optical polaritonic logic circuits.

Abstract: The ability to steer polariton flow on-demand holds significant promise towards nanophotonic applications and photonic circuitry. Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects.

Abstract: Measurement of stray light in a complex optical system can be a complex task. We developed a method to measure coherent stray light inside an assembled device, determining all stray light sources and their relative contribution. The method is based on the insertion of a laser with a scanned frequency and the detection of all the electrical and optical signals obtained from the instrument. The spectra calculated from these signals show fringes due to interference between each stray light contribution and the nominal beam. The frequency of these interference peaks indicates the difference in path length between the stray light path and the nominal path.  To have a description of the measured data we realized optical simulations, which link the measured path length to a possible path throughout the system. In the following, we will show some measurements made on a test bench realized to simulate the performance of LISA interferometers and describe how accurate simulations are in predicting and explaining the measured results.

Abstract: A major issue in exploiting plasmonic cavities as key components in nanotechnology is the effect of radiative and absorption losses on their electrodynamic behavior. Treating them as open-systems, we derive a time-local, completely positive master equation that retains non-secular interference between decay pathways and reduces to the standard secular description when the environment resolves polariton splitting. When it does not, the theory predicts order-one deviations from secular leakage dynamics, including bath-induced coherences and stabilization of dark polaritons, and provides a simple design criterion based on the ratio of polariton splitting to reservoir linewidth. A time-resolved leakage measurement, such as transmission, reflectivity, or photoluminescence, can be used to observe these effects.

Abstract: This paper examines the connection between photonic band-gap formation in two types of two-dimensional photonic crystals and the emergence of reverse electromagnetic energy flows generated by linearly polarized plane waves incident on a photonic-crystal slab. We show that these reverse energy flows, observed in both transmitted and reflected fields, originate from vortex structures in the Poynting vector. The resulting energy-flow patterns exhibit striking analogies to vortex formation in fluid motion past obstacles. The geometry and dynamics of the Poynting-vector vortices determine whether the incident electromagnetic energy is impeded, leading to the formation of photonic band gaps, or instead guided through the structure, enabling transmission.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that exceed threshold mode switching in optical cavities with gain-loss coupling and exceptional points (EPs) enables tunable photonic systems with applications in adaptive optical communication and dual-comb spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper contributes to understanding the mechanisms of mode switching in optical systems with EPs, which has implications for advanced optical technologies.

Method: Using Bloch coupled-mode theory based on first principles, the authors analyze the interaction between the lasing field, population inversion, and dark modes to explain threshold phenomena.

Result: The analysis explains how EP-induced couplings lead to mode switching beyond the threshold, resulting in novel applications for tunable systems.

Conclusion: The study reveals a new mechanism for mode switching that bypasses gain competition, offering potential for innovative photonic devices and systems.

Abstract: The gain-loss coupling in optical cavities induces exceptional points (EPs), where two optical modes coalesce. The large modal overlap near an EP intensifies gain competition, favoring single-mode lasing. Recent studies further revealed self-modulation closer to the EP that transforms the lasing mode into a frequency comb. Such EP-enabled comb formation suggests a previously unaccounted-for mechanism that overcomes the strong gain competition and drives a second mode to threshold. Here, using a Bloch coupled-mode theory derived from first principles, we show that the second threshold arises from dynamical couplings among the population inversion, the lasing field, and a dark cavity mode. The lasing-inversion coupling produces extra EPs, whose spectral structure governs switching among single-mode lasing and frequency combs with different repetition rates. This above-threshold mode-switching mechanism enables new opportunities for tunable photonic systems, including adaptive optical communication links and dual-comb spectroscopy.

Abstract: Periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) is a widely used nonlinear optical device for second harmonic generation (SHG). Despite its wide adoption in commercial systems, its bandwidth for SHG is fundamentally limited by the quasi-phase matching condition. This can be overcome by aperiodic or chirped PPLN structures; however, such devices are typically custom-fabricated and not readily available commercially. In this study, we investigate an alternative approach to achieving broadband SHG by using a standard PPLN crystal containing multiple fixed poling periods. Broadband operation is realized by angle tuning the crystal relative to input beam in free-space. The effect of angle tuning is examined over a range of incident angles, and an 1.6x enhancement in SHG bandwidth is demonstrated. These results suggest a practical and efficient strategy for broadband SHG using standard PPLN devices.
