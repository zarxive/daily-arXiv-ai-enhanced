We address the Channel Ordering Problem (COP) by reformulating it as a Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP), where interference among channels is represented as edge weights in a graph structure. To tackle this challenge efficiently, we develop a scalable approach that integrates statistical exploration with guidance from large language models (LLMs). Extensive simulations using both the Gaussian Noise (GN) model and the split-step Fourier method demonstrate that our method achieves near-optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance and offers robust scalability across diverse network settings, making it well-suited for practical deployment in large-scale optical communication systems."}

Its realization in a compact footprint, however, is limited by intrinsically weak optical nonlinearities and the enlarged free spectral range that raises the multistability threshold. Here, we overcome this constraint by engineering a pair of spectrally close, ultra-high-Q resonances in a photonic crystal microcavity. Leveraging structural perturbations that deliberately introduce non-Hermitian coupling through a shared radiation channel, we drive the resonances toward an exceptional point with nearly degenerate wavelengths and balanced quality factors approaching $10^6$. This configuration substantially enhances thermo-optical nonlinearity and produces pronounced tristability and hysteresis loops within a footprint of 20 μm at input powers below 240 μW. We further demonstrate proof-of-concept optical random-access memory through controlled switching among multistable states. These results establish a general strategy for nonlinear microcavities to achieve energy-efficient multistability for reconfigurable all-optical memories, logic, and neuromorphic processors."}

While the effect of this strong coupling on light has been extensively studied, its impact on matter remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate photothermal energy harvesting using strong light-matter interactions in high-quality-factor metasurfaces. First, we show that maximum metasurface temperatures can differ by $90^\\circ C$ based on the spectral excitation pathway: direct excitation of the metasurface from its nominal equilibrium by a single wavelength results in lower metasurface temperatures compared to continuous spectral scans. Investigating the temporal dynamics of this thermo-optic nonlinearity, we show an initial linear rise to a critical temperature over $~10s$ of seconds, followed by a rapid rise to the high temperature steady state in $~33ms$ around the bistable transition point. This linear rise time increases sharply around the bistable transition point. Most significantly, we show emergence of a Q-factor-dependent temperature band splitting and energy gap of around $60^\\circ C$ between the critical temperature and the high temperature steady state of the metasurface under single wavelength illumination. This forbidden equilibrium temperature band signifies that the high temperature steady state of the metasurface resonance after transitioning across the laser wavelength is further away from its nominal resonance than its linewidth. Interestingly, hyperspectrally accumulated nonlinearities from prior wavelengths effectively dope the metasurface with optical states within this bandgap. These thermal nonlinearities are tunable using the geometry and material of the metasurface. Collectively, these results show how high-Q metasurfaces enable strongly localized, path-dependent photothermal heating to drive site-selective on-chip catalytic and biochemical transformations."}

Time-resolved RIXS extends this capability through a stroboscopic optical pump-probe scheme to characterize the time evolution of the photoexcitation and subsequent relaxation dynamics of a sample. This technique is, however, extremely photon-hungry, requiring high-repetition-rate and intense X-ray facilities. The Heisenberg RIXS (hRIXS) spectrometer at the Spectroscopy and Coherent Scattering (SCS) instrument of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) is designed to exploit high-repetition-rates, while maintaining optimal time and energy resolution.

We demonstrate a reduction of the direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction due to competing symmetry effects for low-symmetry growth directions.

We then show their usefulness in the framework of the nonlinear Nobre--Reigo-Monteiro--Tsallis (NRT) nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

Moreover, an explicit expression for the Lorentzian solitary wave solutions is given, for any real value of the non-linearity parameter q, in terms of a transformation depending on q applied to the classical Lorentzian solution with q = 1, i.e., we succeed in encapsulating the whole nonlinear behavior in the new transformations. In addition, the composition of this transformation with its inverse (with different parameters) allows us to perform a shift in the nonlinearity parameter q. Moreover, a certain subfamily of our generalized transformations, which perform a shift on the non-linearity parameter q of the Lorentzian solutions, is found to have a group structure. The same subfamily of transformations allows us, again, to perform a shift in the non-linearity parameter q, but in this case in the traveling wave solution for a free particle."}

This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components."}

In this work, a hyperelastic approach initially proposed for unidirectional NCFs is adopted for a tricot stitched 0{\\textdegree}/90{\\textdegree} Biax-NCF based on a pure-shear assumption. The shear behavior is experimentally characterized through 45{\\textdegree} off-axis-tension tests, and the parameterization is derived from energetic approaches originally developed for woven fabrics. This approach efficiently and adequately describes the general behavior in forming simulations of different geometries. Fiber orientation and location of areas with high shear angles are predicted well, but the peak shear angles are overestimated due to the neglected roving slippage."}

The WVA protocol, employing real weak values, amplifies the minute delay induced by sample perturbation, thereby translating it into a measurable shift of interference fringes. However, this amplification introduces significant fringe distortion. To address this, we deploy deep learning architectures as high-precision parameter estimators: a convolutional neural network regressor (CNN-Regressor) for direct delay estimation and a classifier (CNN-Classifier) for discrete delay categorization. These are systematically benchmarked against traditional Fourier-transform-based analysis. Two key conclusions are drawn: (i) The WVA technique consistently enhances measurement precision across all estimators by effectively increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). (ii) Both deep learning models surpass the traditional FFT approach; the CNN-Regressor achieves a higher SNR at small weak values, while the CNN-Classifier enables accurate estimation even under a challenging \"$π$ phase shift\" condition where conventional analysis fails. This synergistic combination of WVA and deep learning establishes a powerful framework for attosecond metrology, paving the way for enhanced precision in ultrafast spectroscopy."}

In this work, we examine the validity of this law for static, spherically symmetric charged black holes in the pure Lovelock theory of gravity. By studying infinitesimal variations in mass and charge, we derive a set of inequalities that constrain these variations. Our analysis shows that as the surface gravity approaches zero ($κ\\to 0$), the range of admissible perturbations gradually diminishes, thereby forbidding the attainment of extremality through any finite classical process. The saturation of the inequality is interpreted as the emergence of a dynamical barrier near extremality, which prevents further evolution toward the extremal configuration."}

The calculated photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) show two different offset angles corresponding to ionization events occurring in the first and the second half cycles of one laser cycle. When the larger angle is greater than the angle of a model symmetric molecule with a similar ionization potential to the polar molecule, the smaller angle is smaller than the symmetric molecule. Using a developed strong-field model that consider effects of both the permanent dipole (PD) and the asymmetric Coulomb potential, we are able to quantitatively reproduce these phenomena. We show that the PD effect can increase (decrease) the response time of electrons within polar molecules to light in photoemission, thereby increasing (decreasing) the offset angle related to the first (second) half cycle of a laser cycle. The laser-dressed asymmetric Coulomb potential near the atomic nuclei also plays an important role in the sub-cycle-related response time and offset angle. This model may be useful for quantitatively studying attosecond ionization dynamics of polar molecules in strong laser fields."}

The EFT interactions are calibrated to reproduce low-energy observables obtained from the realistic LM2M2 potential, enabling a direct and systematic comparison between the two approaches. We demonstrate that, for suitably chosen finite cutoffs, the empirical effective range is accurately reproduced already at leading order, achieving next-to-leading-order precision without explicit higher-order corrections. Using these interactions, we solve the Schrödinger equation for systems of a few atoms, obtaining binding energies and scattering observables in excellent agreement with results derived from realistic interatomic potentials. In particular, we compute atom--tetramer scattering parameters and binding energies of clusters up to eight atoms, thereby extending the EFT description to larger helium systems. Our findings establish a quantitative bridge between realistic helium potentials and finite-cutoff EFT, showing that the latter provides an efficient and predictive framework for describing few-body universality in weakly bound quantum systems."}

As a direct consequence of causality, the retarded Green's function and absorption amplitude are analytic in the upper-half plane. We show, however, that Stokes phenomena can obstruct this analyticity domain from carrying over to the elastic amplitude, which instead develops a branch-cut in the upper-half plane.

For the wave functions in the adelic Grassmannian $Gr^{ad}$, the bispectral involution which exchanges the role of $x$ and $z$ implies also the existence of an ``$x$-adjoint wave function'' $ψ^{\\star}(x,z)$ so that the product of the wave function, the $x$-adjoint, and the Hermite weight $e^{-x^2/2}$ has no residue. Utilizing this, we show that the sequences of coefficient functions in the power series expansion of any KP wave function in $Gr^{ad}$ and its image under the bispectral involution at $t_2=-1/2$ are always ``almost bi-orthogonal'' with respect to the Hermite product. Whether the sequences have the stronger properties of being (almost) orthogonal can be determined easily in terms of KP flows and the bispectral involution. As a special case, the Exceptional Hermite Orthogonal Polynomials can be recovered in this way. This provides both a generalization of and an explanation of the fact that the generating functions of the Exceptional Hermites are certain special wave functions of the KP Hierarchy. In addition, one new surprise is that the same KP Wave Function which generates the sequences of functions is also a generating function for the norms when evaluated at $t_1=1$ and $t_2=0$. The main results are proved using Calogero-Moser matrices satisfying a rank one condition. The same results also apply in the case of ``spin-generalized'' Calogero-Moser matrices, which produce instances of matrix orthogonality."}

Electrochemical modeling has had advanced across empirical, analytical, numerical, and data-driven paradigms. Data-driven machine learning and physics based electrochemical modeling, however, have not been explicitly linked. Here we introduce Differentiable Electrochemistry, a mew paradigm in electrochemical modeling that integrates thermodynamics, kinetics and mass transport with differentiable programming enabled by automatic differentiation. By making the entire electrochemical simulation end-to-end differentiable, this framework enables gradient-based optimization for mechanistic discovery from experimental and simulation data, achieving approximately one to two orders of improvement over gradient-free methods. We develop a rich repository of differentiable simulators across diverse mechanisms, and apply Differentiable Electrochemistry to bottleneck problems in kinetic analysis. Specifically, Differentiable Electrochemistry advances beyond Tafel and Nicholson method by removing several limitations including Tafel region selection, and identifies the electron transfer mechanism in Li metal electrodeposition/stripping by parameterizing the full Marcus-Hush-Chidsey formalism. In addition, Differentiable Electrochemistry interprets Operando X-ray measurements in concentrated electrolyte by coupling concentration and velocity theories. This framework resolves ambiguity when multiple electrochemical theories intertwine, and establishes a physics-consistent and data-efficient foundation for predictive electrochemical modeling."}

Therefore, one can attribute the origin of wings in the phase space due to energy like Nambu surfaces, giving a geometrical interpretation. In this article, we have carried out, both numerical analysis of bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponents(LEs) to characterise chaos and geometric approach by applying the Nambu generalized Hamiltonian mechanics to explain the fundamental reason for the appearance of wings like geometry in the phase space.

Our experiments in various configurations of coupled multicore nonlinear waveguide arrangements illustrate how light undergoing expansion-induced cooling can be channelled from arbitrary input states into the fundamental mode with near-unity efficiency.

This paper presents a feasibility study for the use of CE$ν$NS superconducting detectors to find trafficked radiological materials. To do this, we calculated the minimal activity required for situational detection under ideal conditions, without background, at 95% confidence level. This analysis was performed for four commonly smuggled radioisotopes: $^{137}$Cs, $^{109}$Cd, $^{192}$Ir, and $^{57}$Co. Using these results, we conclude that CE$ν$NS could be used to discover trafficked $^{137}$Cs sources with an activity above the PBq level, but that it is not applicable for finding other radioactive sources.

Recently, a composite force sensor based on UCNPs embedded in a polystyrene microbead enabled the first real time measurement of feeding forces in living nematodes. However, the comparatively large stiffness of polystyrene only makes it relevant to biomedical application in a small subset of biological tissue. To facilitate deployment of UCNPs into biological tissues with a range of mechanical properties, we expand upon polymer UCNP composite systems by embedding UCNPs in three polymer matrices with varying stiffnesses (epoxy resin, polydimethylsiloxane, and alginate hydrogels). Furthermore, to enhance these composites mechanosensitivity, we methodically investigate using two different core-shell architectures of SrLuF based UCNPs doped with ytterbium, erbium, and varying manganese concentrations. We calibrate polymer UCNP composite optical force sensitivity with colocalized atomic force and confocal microscopy. Using the red to green emission ratio (Delta Percent IRed:IGreen) as the force read-out, we determine that SrLuF:Yb0.28Er0.025Mn0.013 with SrYF inert shell dispersed in epoxy resin exhibits the greatest emission color change (12 Delta Percent IRed:IGreen per microNewton). Finally, we map forces in the epoxy UCNP composite on the macroscale between the joint of a chicken wing bone using a commercially available wide field microscope, thereby demonstrating its ability to optically measure pressures in situ.

We introduce a training framework that extends the principle of contrastive divergence to quantum models. By deriving the circuit structure and providing a general recipe for constructing it, we obtain quantum circuits that generate the samples required for parameter updates, yielding constant scaling with respect to the cost of a forward pass, analogous to backpropagation in classical neural networks. Numerical results demonstrate that it attains comparable accuracy to likelihood-based optimization while requiring substantially fewer samples. The framework thereby establishes a scalable route to training expressive quantum generative models directly on quantum hardware."}

This drives matter-wave optics into a nonlinear regime: diffraction and momentum distributions become interaction-dependent, interference contrast degrades or collapses, and revival dynamics appear.

Remarkably, the E-string theory \"knows\" about various subtle aspects of the world of smooth 4-manifolds, as the (topological) modularity of the partition function is contingent on a collection of properties of 4-manifolds and their Seiberg-Witten invariants, including, notably, the simple-type conjecture.

To achieve this goal, mapping the spatial variation of nanoscale dynamic individual steps at the electrocatalytic interfaces is vital, as it further enables a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the process. Here, we combined tapping mode AFM imaging with a Pt ultramicroelectrode to investigate oxygen bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment. Our AFM feedback error signal and topography data reveal that bubbles of O2 gas nucleate at the step edge sites and interact with the catalytically active sites. This interaction between primary catalytic sites and bubble nucleation sites is the primary reason for a decrease in the current density at a given high overpotential of the OER. Our findings advance the understanding of the complexity of phenomena involved in gas evolution on catalytic surfaces."}

This study develops and demonstrates a cubic photoelastic model that enables accurate fringe-order estimation from three orthogonal views, providing a foundation for reconstructing full three-dimensional stress states. A transparent, low-elasticity epoxy cube, free of prestress, was fabricated and examined using combined transmission and reflection photoelastic imaging. Three mutually orthogonal isochromatic fringe fields were recorded simultaneously under a single applied load. Image analysis employed a peak-valley intensity method to extract sub-fringe orders and to resolve low-stress cases with minimal noise. The cubic block produced high-quality fringe patterns in all directions, enabling separation of tangential and normal stress components. Independent orthogonal views confirmed directional sensitivity and yielded consistent fringe-order estimates under low loading, with response times on the order of tens of microseconds. These results establish a practical approach for three-dimensional photoelastic stress measurement from orthogonal views and create a pathway toward full vector force reconstruction with strong potential for biomedical applications and studies of dynamic loading."}

A modified form of the ET was proposed for this case, which includes an effective force originating from the interaction of the 1D quantum particle with the box edges. In this work, we derive an amended ET for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which includes the cubic nonlinear term, as well as for the 2D square-shaped potential box. In the latter case, we derive an amended COM equation of motion with an effective force exerted by the edges of the rectangular box, while the nonlinear term makes no direct contribution to the 1D and 2D versions of the ET. Nonetheless, the nonlinearity affects the amended ET through the edge-generated force. As a result, the nonlinearity of the underlying GPE can make the COM motion in the potential box irregular. The validity of the amended ET for the 1D and 2D GPEs with the respective potential boxes is confirmed by the comparison of numerical simulations of the underlying GPE and the corresponding amended COM equation of motion. The reported findings are relevant to the ongoing experiments carried out for atomic Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in the box potentials."}

Starting from the spherical reduction of four-dimensional Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant, we construct an exactly solvable 2D model that captures the full causal and thermodynamic structure of the SdS static patch, including both black-hole and cosmological horizons. Incorporating the trace anomaly of $N$ conformal matter fields via the Polyakov action, we determine the evolution of the black-hole mass and geometry in the Unruh--de Sitter state, track the steady nonequilibrium Hawking flux, and compute local thermodynamic observables for static observers. The conserved Killing energy flux drives an irreversible heat current from the black hole to the cosmological horizon whenever their surface gravities differ, ensuring monotonic entropy growth and satisfaction of the generalized second law. We prove that $κ_b > κ_c$ throughout the physical static patch, so the only zero-flux configuration is the Nariai limit where the horizons coincide. Extending the framework to the quantum-information regime, we construct a thermally controlled estimate of the Page curve and show how quantum extremal surfaces and entanglement islands emerge naturally within the anomaly-induced steady state. These results constitute a fully analytic, backreacted solution for SdS evaporation that unifies semiclassical thermodynamics and information flow in a cosmological setting, thereby elucidating the ultimate fate of evaporating black holes in de Sitter space."}

MXenes, such as Ti3C2Tx, are prime examples of 2D crystals often employed as thin networks of interconnected flakes deposited on substrates to realize functional devices. While a significant number of studies focused on transport in individual MXene flakes, inter-flake transport remains scarcely explored. Here, we demonstrate that charge transport in multi-flake conductive paths of Ti3C2Tx is dominated by interflake junctions and provide quantitative estimates of junction resistances. Scanning probe measurements reveal that in a MXene multi-flake conductive path, individual flakes behave as isopotential domains, since the voltage drop is localized precisely at the inter-flake junctions. We further investigate the chemiresistive response to humidity at the single flake, multi-flake and flake network scale, evidencing the leading impact of junctions on sensing kinetics. These findings underline the crucial role of junctions in charge transport and sensing capabilities of MXenes."}

Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures.

These interactions exert a pivotal influence on the optical response of a weak probe field and pave the way for novel applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of π/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift. These findings establish a direct correspondence between the PSHE and the underlying non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectrum."}

In the non-interacting limit, these profoundly alter the electronic structure, leading to the emergence of flat bands, van Hove singularities, and, most notably, Dirac cones within a single Kondo-Dirac semimetal order. The strongly interacting regime is explored via the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, in the absence of the sign problem, where we unveil a complete ground-state phase diagram revealing two distinct phases, the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase and a novel antiferromagnetic semimetal phase. Their characterization by the spectral functions establishes an orbital-selective Mott transition in the antiferromagnetic semimetal phase, marked by the opening of a gap exclusively in the $f$-orbital while Dirac cones persist in the $c$-orbital.

Remarkably, StoL assembles molecules in a LEGO-style fashion from scratch, without seeing the target molecules or any structures of comparable size during training. Given a SMILES input, it decomposes the molecule into chemically valid fragments, generates their 3D structures with a diffusion model trained on small molecules, and assembles them into diverse conformations.

Here, we report a calibration method that enables the simultaneous determination of the backend noise temperature and effective-noise-ratio at the input plane of the DUT. The method is based on measuring the S-parameters and noise power of a series of attenuators at two or more distinct physical temperatures. We validate our method by measuring the noise temperature of InP HEMTs in 4-8 GHz. The calibration method can be generalized to measure the microwave noise temperature of any two-port device so long as a series of attenuators can be measured at two or more distinct physical temperatures."}

A fundamental challenge is the seamless and efficient integration of memory with information processing in a physically interpretable way that enables cognitive learning and decision-making under uncertainty. Prevailing paradigms, from intricate logic cascades to black-box morphological computing or physical neural networks, are seriously limited by trade-offs among efficiency, scalability, interpretability, transparency, and reliance on additional electronics. Here, we introduce in-memory phononic learning, a paradigm-shifting framework that unifies nonvolatile mechanical memory with wave-based perception within a phononic metastructure. Our system encodes spatial information into stable structural states as mechanical memory that directly programs its elastic wave-propagation landscape. This memory/wave-dynamics coupling enables effective sensory perception, decomposing complex patterns into informative geometric features through frequency-selective wave localization. Learning is created by optimizing input waveforms to selectively probe these features for memory-pattern classification, with decisions inferred directly from the output wave energy, thereby completing the entire information loop mechanically through an efficient and physically transparent mechanism without hidden architectures or electronics. This work transcends the paradigm of 'materials that compute' to cognitive matter capable of interpreting dynamic environments, paving the way for future intelligent structural-material systems with low power consumption, more direct interaction with surroundings, and enhanced cybersecurity and resilience in harsh conditions."}

The relaxation dynamics among the four ground-state hyperfine levels were simultaneously investigated by optically perturbing the spin population distribution and monitoring its return to thermal equilibrium through optical absorption spectroscopy. By applying different types of perturbations, we were also able to distinguish between two types of relaxation processes, induced by spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions.\n  Below 1 K, we observed that the re-thermalization of the Yb$^{3+}$ ion population takes several hours, driven solely by direct phonon absorption or emission. However, the effective lifetime of individual spin states is much shorter - on the order of several seconds in low-doped (2 ppm) samples and of milliseconds in 10 ppm samples - due to spin-spin interactions. These findings provide valuable guidelines for optimizing doping levels and operating temperatures in rare-earth-doped crystals for quantum applications.

These calculations are made on the basis of a wave-vector cut-off that is usually set at the Planck scale. Further, Weinberg's no-go theorem indicates that in the presence of translational invariance, local quantum field theories cannot produce a zero cosmological constant without fine-tuning. Various non-local theories have been constructed, starting from modifications to Einstein's equations, in order to `cancel' away the cosmological constant term. There is also a well-known theory, due to Coleman, that assumes one can compute a probability distribution function for baby universes connected by wormholes that has the most probable value of the constant to be zero under some assumptions. The current paper starts from a QFT in 4-dimensions, breaks translational invariance by confining the fields to a box and adds a marginal (in power-counting terms) non-linear, momentum-dependent term that dominates the dynamics produced by the quadratic terms in the high-energy limit. It immediately produces an equation for the wave-vector cutoff applicable to the theory - the equation is reminiscent of that from UV/IR mixing and it effectively lowers the cutoff massively for a box the size of the Universe. However, as will be shown, the wave-vector cutoff for a box relevant for regular particle physics experiments is much larger, in fact, the Planck scale, so there is no conflict with current experiments, including the Casimir effect. We consider several possibilities for these additional terms and conclude that only one is relevant to a low cut-off. We also make a connection to the recent DESI results."}

Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a platform, we observe two FCIs joined by a continuous transition controlled by continuum model parameter $κ$, arising from a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions. For $κ$ below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable and effectively decomposes into two independent $C=1$ color sectors. Although the flat band is non-ideal, the resulting fractional phase is naturally accounted for by the non-chiral Halperin-(112) state with counterpropagating edge modes. Above the transition, the system enters a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this robustness, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: when the Bloch wave function is geometrically unstable, interactions dynamically split a non-ideal flat band into an ideal subcomponent that hosts the FCI and non-ideal remnants. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a \"color separator,\" explicitly visualizing the ideal subcomponent at the single-particle level. Together, these results establish two different routes by which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, expanding their viable parameter space and clarifying the interplay between geometry and topological order."}

Using a comprehensive parameter-estimation campaign, we benchmark the test against Gaussian noise fluctuations, waveform modeling systematics, and physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. When applied to numerical-relativity simulations, the SMA test performs reliably for aligned-spin and mildly precessing systems but exhibits measurable biases for strongly precessing or eccentric binaries. Although designed to detect amplitude deviations, the test also responds coherently to phase perturbations, yielding apparent GR violations when applied to phase-modified waveforms. Applied to recent GW detections, we report the strongest constraint on the hexadecapolar (4,4) mode amplitude deviation, $δA_{44} = -0.30^{+1.16}_{-3.45}$, consistent with GR.

Using time- and phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy and time-resolved scanning transmission microscopy, we show that magnon-polaritons can propagate faster than 100 km/s, nearly three orders of magnitude more than conventional spin waves, and can be observed at distances exceeding 40 micrometers in 20 nm thick films. Analytical modeling based on retarded Maxwell equations and Polder tensor formalism confirms the hybridized nature of the excitations and captures the nontrivial dispersion and attenuation profiles. Notably, the magnon-polaritons maintain high initial magnetization amplitudes and long decay lengths, enabling ultrafast manipulation of the magnetization far away from the excitation source. We show, that they can move domain walls or stabilize nonlinear magnetization processes. The unprecedentedly high propagation velocities make magnon-polaritons promising candidates for high-speed information transfer in future spin-based computing architectures, potentially overcoming long-standing group delay bottlenecks in magnonic logic circuits."}

For two bosons, the odd-parity sector remains integrable, whereas the even-parity sector displays clear signatures of chaos at low energy and a crossover back to quasi-integrable behavior at higher energies.

An elegant way to capture the effects of the latter on the conductivity is through a field-dependent effective electronic temperature T_eff that can significantly exceed that of the lattice. Despite its elegance, its actual use has been limited, which, at least in part, can be attributed to the concept originating from computer simulations; experimental confirmations have largely been indirect (through scaling of conductivity) and did not establish that T_eff equals the real temperature of the electron distribution. Moreover, it has hardly been tested for important classes of disordered materials, including quantum dot solids. Here, we investigate whether the effective temperature concept is applicable to quantum dot solids, using zinc oxide as relevant model system. To verify that field-driven conductivity increases indeed reflect an actual increase of the electronic temperature, we combine direct and indirect measurements of T_eff: we convert conductivity changes at high fields to an effective temperature that we show to be consistent with a direct measurement of the electronic temperature using the Seebeck effect. These results not only confirm the relevance of the effective temperature concept to quantum dot solids but also confirm its general physical reality and open the way to systematic investigations into charge carrier (de)localization in disordered media."}

Microscopic insights into these systems are often inferred from our understanding of the air-water interface, which is assumed to exhibit similar behavior. Here, we challenge this paradigm by combining heterodyne-detected vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy with machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at first-principles accuracy to investigate the graphene-NaCl(aq) interface as a prototypical hydrophobic solid-water system. Spectroscopic results suggest that ions have a minimal effect on the structure of the interfacial water, while simulations reveal that Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ accumulate densely at the surface. Together, these findings reveal a new adsorption mechanism that departs from the established air-water interface paradigm, where interfacial ion adsorption is typically associated with, and often detected through, pronounced alteration of the interfacial water alignment and orientation. This difference arises because ions cannot penetrate the solid boundary and reside at a similar depth as the interfacial water molecules. As a consequence, large ion populations can be accommodated within the extended two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network at the interface, causing only minor local distortions but significant changes to its longer-range connectivity. These results reveal a distinct mechanism of electrolyte organization at aqueous-carbon interfaces, relevant to energy applications, where performance is highly sensitive to the local organization of interfacial water."}

Heterodyne BM combines single-ended access with high spectral resolution, yet its demand for high optical power (276 mW) and long pixel dwell time (100 ms) limits biological applications.

Within the bias area, several heavy-metal wires carrying dc charge current are periodically attached to the waveguide and exert so spatially periodic spin-orbit torques, producing current-controllable modulated magnon gain and loss. It is demonstrated that this decorated waveguide can emit a strong, single frequency magnon mode at the Bragg point (lasing) and also absorb at the same frequency phase-matched incoming coherent magnons (anti-lasing). The underlying physics is captured by an analytical model and validated with full material and device-specific numerical simulations. The magnonic laser absorber response is tunable via the current density in the wires, the extent of the biased region, and the intrinsic damping, enabling the control of lasing frequency and emission power. The structure is shown to amplify thermal magnons, offering a route to low-noise on-chip microwave sources. The concept is compatible with planar waveguides, ring geometries, and antiferromagnets.

We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation.

Here we show that deterministic switching can instead be achieved through higher-order (in magnetization angles) spin-orbit torques, even in systems that preserve in-plane mirror symmetry. Using a vector spherical harmonics expansion, we demonstrate that higher-order torque terms naturally give rise to additional out-of-equator fixed points, enabling reliable magnetization reversal when their magnitude is comparable to conventional lowest-order torques. We illustrate this mechanism with first-principles calculations on the noncentrosymmetric Weyl ferromagnet PrAlGe, where the combination of Weyl-node band topology and strong spin-orbit coupling produces sizable higher-order torque components. Because the Fermi surface is small, the conventional lowest-order torques are relatively weak, allowing the higher-order harmonics to compete on equal footing and strongly reshape the magnetization dynamics. The resulting spin dynamics confirm deterministic switching without additional symmetry breaking. Our results establish higher-order spin-orbit torque as a key ingredient for understanding and controlling magnetization dynamics in topological and spintronic materials."}

Battery electrolytes feature a large design space composed of different solvents, additives, and salts, which is difficult to explore experimentally. High-fidelity molecular simulation can accurately predict the bulk properties of electrolytes by employing accurate potential energy surfaces, thus guiding the molecule and formula engineering. At present, the overly simplified classic force fields rely heavily on experimental data for fine-tuning, thus its predictive power on microscopic level is under question. In contrast, the newly emerged machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) can accurately reproduce the ab initio data, demonstrating excellent fitting ability. However, it is still haunted by problems such as low transferrability, insufficient stability in the prediction of bulk properties, and poor training cost scaling. Therefore, it cannot yet be used as a robust and universal tool for the exploration of electrolyte design space. In this work, we introduce a highly scalable and fully bottom-up force field construction strategy called PhyNEO-Electrolyte. It adopts a hybrid physics-driven and data-driven method that relies only on monomer and dimer EDA (energy deomposition analysis) data. With a careful separation of long/short-range and non-bonding/bonding interactions, we rigorously restore the long-range asymptotic behavior, which is critical in the description of electrolyte systems.

We present a photochemical metal-organic decomposition technique for the scalable patterning of lithium niobate at ambient conditions, eliminating the need for harsh etching conditions and cleanroom protocols. The method utilizes a solution of a custom-prepared photosensitive organometallic precursor as a negative photoresist. The UV light exposure of the thin films of the precursor through a photomask, followed by rinsing with ethanol, yields amorphous patterns, which transform into crystalline lithium niobate after a calcination step. This method enables a scalable fabrication of a range of complex geometric shapes with a feature resolution down to $30\\,μ\\mathrm{m}$.

We introduce a new confidence metric based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient to quantify the photon-number-resolving capabilities of a detector system and show that this metric can be used to compare different systems. Our analysis and interpretation of the principal components imply that photon-number resolution in SNSPDs can be achieved with moderate hardware requirements in terms of both sample rate (5 GSample/sec) and analog bandwidth (3 GHz) and could be implemented in an FPGA, giving a highly scalable solution for real-time photon counting."}

While eccentric binaries with aligned spins are well studied, closed form post Newtonian (PN) expressions that simultaneously include eccentricity and precessing spin effects have remained unavailable. Eccentricity complicates orbital evolution because solving the coupled differential equations typically requires numerical integration, which slows down the generation of waveforms. We exploit the separation of timescales between orbital motion, spin precession, and radiation reaction, applying the precession averaging method of Morras et al. (2025) to remove explicit time dependence from the spin orbit and spin spin dynamics through the second PN order. Using this framework, we derive analytic phasing formulae from the evolution equations for orbital frequency and eccentricity, treating eccentricity as a small parameter. Closed form solutions for the eccentricity evolution and GW phase are obtained up to eighth order in the initial eccentricity. We also generalize the TaylorT2 approximant to include spin precession effects and compute the orbital phase in both time and frequency domains. To improve accuracy for moderate to high initial eccentricities, we perform a resummation of the TaylorT2 phasing. These results offer efficient, closed form phasing expressions that capture the coupled dynamics of eccentricity and precession, enabling more accurate and computationally tractable GW waveform modeling for data analysis."}

Most near-term approaches are cast as variational energy minimization and thus inherit the challenges of problem-specific energy landscapes. We develop the quantum amplitude-amplification eigensolver (QAAE), which departs from the variational paradigm and instead coherently drives a trial state toward the ground state via quantum amplitude amplification. Each amplitude-amplification round interleaves a reflection about the learned trial state with a controlled short-time evolution under a normalized Hamiltonian; an ancilla readout yields an amplitude-amplified pure target state that a state-learning step then re-encodes into an ansatz circuit for the next round -- without evaluating the energy gradients. Under standard assumptions (normalized $\\hat{H}$, a nondegenerate ground-state, and a learning update), the ground-state overlap increases monotonically per round and the procedure converges; here, a per-round depth bound in terms of the ansatz depth and Hamiltonian-simulation cost establishes hardware compatibility. Cloud experiments on IBMQ processor verify our amplification mechanism on a two-level Hamiltonian and a two-qubit Ising model, and numerical benchmarks on $\\mathrm{H}_2$, $\\mathrm{LiH}$, and a $10$-qubit longitudinal-and-transverse-field Ising model show that QAAE integrates with chemistry-inspired and hardware-efficient circuits and can surpass gradient-based VQE in accuracy and stability.

Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \\sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $ξ_R^2 \\sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids."}

PCA of the corresponding correlation matrices captures these crossovers directly from the data, without assuming predefined order parameters by identifying charge-dominated, spin-dominated and pairing-dominated regimes through variance condensation into leading components.

The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-Pérot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 Ω, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR.

Electrons in 1D are generally described by Luttinger liquid theory, with universal scaling relations depending only on the Luttinger parameter g. In particular, at half-filling, Umklapp scattering plays a crucial role, as it can significantly change the conductance-temperature scaling relation and lead to Mott insulators. However, this prediction has never been observed since doping an empty band to half-filling was extremely difficult. Here, we show that the marriage of moiré superlattices and 1D electrons makes it possible to study the Luttinger liquid in an exceptionally wide filling region simply by electrical gating. We perform transport measurements on 1D moiré superlattices of carbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, and observe correlated insulating states at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings of the superlattice mini-band, where Umklapp scattering becomes dominant. We also observe a T-linear conductance at these commensurate fillings over a range of temperatures. Strikingly, the T-linear conductance leads to a strongly suppressed Luttinger parameter, suggesting a state of extreme correlation."}

These calibration techniques are well documented for standalone FTIR instruments but not for microscope coupled-FTIRs, even though such an architecture greatly simplifies collection of light from micro and nano scale structures. We propose and demonstrate a calibration method for microsope-FTIRs based on the well-known emissivity of doped silicon at high temperature.

This makes the mode's resonant frequency sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment.\n  In this work, we explore the quantum sensitivity limits of this type of sensors. We demonstrate that by preparing the probe light in a squeezed quantum state, it is possible to surpass the shot-noise limit. The resulting sensitivity is constrained only by optical losses and the available degree of squeezing. The influence of the losses can be reduced using additional squeezing of the light inside the microresonator."}

The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-André-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the quantum inverse problem provides a robust diagnostic tool for quantum materials, particularly effective for systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions."}

The approach is based on constructing a Hamiltonian as the square root of a supersymmetric partner energy-shifted by a constant. This formulation naturally leads to bipartite dynamics with balanced gain and loss and can incorporate non-reciprocal couplings. The resulting systems exhibit entirely real spectra over a finite parameter range precisely when the corresponding passive Hamiltonian lacks a zero mode. As the non-Hermitian parameter representing gain and loss increases, the spectrum undergoes controlled real-to-complex transitions at second-order exceptional points. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through several examples, including well-known models such as the Hatano--Nelson (HN) and complex Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (cSSH) lattices. Extending the formalism to $q$-commuting matrices further enables the systematic realization of higher-order exceptional points in systems with unidirectional couplings.

Our construction generalizes standard form factor techniques to deal with the deformed two-body scattering amplitudes, which are typical in this setting. The results are minimal form factors which are the product of the undeformed solution and a new function. This function can be fixed by requiring constant asymptotics for large rapidities, smoothness in the limit when the perturbation parameters go to zero, and agreement with standard MFF formulae for particular choices of the perturbation couplings. We observe that, for a certain range of parameters, the new MFF develops a pole at $θ=0$. By considering several UV-complete theories, we argue that such poles can emerge naturally from the MFF integral representation and suggest how they may be eliminated."}

GUED reveals information about the nuclear motions that is complementary to the information on the electronic states provided by spectroscopic measurements. GUED experiments so far have utilized a single laser pulse to excite the molecules and an electron pulse to probe the dynamics. This limits the excited states which can be studied to only those that can be reached by absorption of a photon from the ground state or in some cases simultaneous absorption of multiple photons. A broader class of experiments and dynamics can be accessed using two time-delayed laser pulses to access unexplored regions of the potential energy surfaces. As a proof-of-principle experiment using a double excitation, we studied the photodissociation of trifluoroiodomethane molecules that are pre-excited with an infrared (800 nm) femtosecond laser pulse before photo-dissociation is triggered with an ultraviolet (266 nm) femtosecond laser pulse. We have observed significant differences in the dissociation dynamics, with pre-excitation resulting in a slower dissociation process.

Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\\tildeζ$, the mode frequency $\\tildeω$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\\tildeζ$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\\tildeζ$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information."}

Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \\sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $ξ_R^2 \\sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids."}

We systematically compare policies across four observability regimes, from full-state access to experimentally accessible observables (energies of individual two-level systems (TLSs), first-order averages, and second-order correlations). Simulation results demonstrate that full observability yields near-optimal ergotropy with low variability, while under partial observability, access to only single-TLS energies or energies plus first-order averages lags behind the fully observed baseline. However, augmenting partial observations with second-order correlations recovers most of the gap, reaching 94%-98% of the full-state baseline. The learned schedules are nonmyopic, trading temporary plateaus or declines for superior terminal outcomes.

The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity.

Inverse-designed photonics, empowered by optimization and learning algorithms, have emerged as a powerful paradigm for realizing compact and multifunctional integrated photonic components. In this work, we develop a staged-annealing topological optimization (SATO) framework tailored for the design of integrated terahertz (THz) beam-shaping devices. Employing this inverse-designed framework, we experimentally demonstrate a class of compact THz vortex beam emitters on an all-silicon on-chip platform. These devices efficiently convert the in-plane fundamental transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode into free-space vortex beams with mode purity up to 87% and energy conversion efficiency up to 74% across the target wavelength range (680 μm to 720 μm). The inverse-designed emitters exhibit ultracompact footprints (lateral size < 4λ) and a free-standing configuration, enabling the generation of dual-directional vortex beams carrying opposite topological charges. The proposed SATO framework provides a generalizable and fabrication-compatible approach for THz photonic device engineering, offering a scalable pathway toward complex structured beam manipulation in next-generation wireless communication systems and on-chip integrated THz photonic systems."}

Using the sixth- and seventh-order WKB methods with Pade approximants, supported by time-domain integration and Prony analysis, we compute the fundamental quasinormal frequencies and transmission coefficients. The results show that the real part of the frequency slightly increases while the damping rate decreases with growing field mass $μ$, leading to longer-lived oscillations.

Two types of external-field setups are considered: One is a circularly polarized electromagnetic field and the other is a combination of a circularly polarized electric field and a static magnetic field. The system is modeled by a classical frustrated Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice, whose ground state is a single-$Q$ spiral spin configuration. The effects of irradiated electric and magnetic fields are taken into account by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the Zeeman coupling, respectively, without heating effects. By numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that the two field configurations lead to distinct skyrmion crystal (SkX) phases and their associated topological phase transitions: in the former setup, SkXs composed of skyrmions with skyrmion numbers of one and two with opposite signs emerge, whereas in the latter setup, SkXs with the same sign appear. The stabilization mechanisms of these SkXs are accounted for by the competition among electromagnetic-field-induced chiral DM interactions, electric-field-induced three-spin interactions, and the Zeeman coupling based on the high-frequency expansion within the Floquet formalism. Furthermore, for the latter setup, we find that the stability region of the SkX phase varies significantly depending on the timing of the application of the circularly polarized electric field and the static magnetic field. Our findings would broaden the possible routes to generate and control SkXs by time-dependent electromagnetic fields, advancing both the theoretical comprehension and experimental control of topological spin crystals."}

Our core innovation is a comprehensive channel-constrained framework: we model the diffusion and denoising steps as quantum channels defined by Kraus operators, ensure their physical validity through optimization on the Stiefel manifold, and introduce tailored training strategies and loss functions that leverage this constrained structure for high-fidelity state reconstruction. Experimental validation on systems ranging from single qubits to entangled states $7$ -qubits demonstrates high-fidelity state generation, achieving fidelities exceeding $0.998$ under both random and depolarizing noise conditions.

We prove the Confinement Theorem by showing that the effective string tension sigma_eff[C] (ratio of our Hodge dual area to a Euclidean one bounded by the same loop) is bounded as sigma_eff[C]>= sqrt(2) , remaining finite and positive for all regular loops. Consequently, the Wilson loop decays exponentially with the Euclidean area, providing a purely geometric proof of confinement. Quantization of the quadratic holomorphic action yields a quantum string, with a universal constant correction for each of the two chiral strings. The worldsheet theory is one-loop exact. This construction defines a solvable quantum Hodge-dual string theory reproducing the QCD area law with explicit tension dependence on the loop shape."}

Here, we report the observation on signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-Pérot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 Ω, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. The findings on zGNR embedded in h-BN provide an effective platform for the future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices."}

A single parameter multiplying the exchange integral, is determined from the exact thermodynamic energy of a few reference molecules. The value of the parameter depends on the basis and level of configuration interaction but is the same for all molecules. Calculated energies are compared with experimental thermodynamic data for a set of forty mainly organic molecules representing a wide range of bonding environments.

This results in the fact that when x-polarized light is incident, only M2 exists; when y-polarized light is incident, both M1 and M2 exist. Besides, both modes yield the maximum isolation ratio of more than 10 dB. The electric field distributions further indicate that M2 exhibits strong confinement and efficient tunneling through the metallic film, while M1 shows weaker but more polarization-sensitive hybridization.

Dynamical decoupling is a widely used, powerful technique for decoherence error suppression. However, it is susceptible to control errors, making non-robust sequences like UDD impractical to implement and robust ones like CPMG to significantly overestimate decoherence times. This overestimation issue remains largely unexplored in the past few decades, leading to many reports of exceptionally long yet plausible decoherence times across various qubit platforms. Here, we construct Hadamard phase cycling as a non-Markovian quantum error mitigation method for dynamical decoupling. This method exploits group structure to design phase configurations of equivalent ensemble quantum circuits, effectively eliminates circuit outputs generated from erroneous dynamics, and scales linearly with circuit depth. Harnessing its error mitigation capability for ensemble solid-state electron spin qubits embedded in paramagnetic molecules and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond enables accurate acquisition of decoherence times. Applying Hadamard phase cycling on single trapped ion and superconducting transmon qubits effectively preserves their state fidelity during dynamical decoupling. The integration of scalable quantum error mitigation and suppression would facilitate the development of quantum technologies with noisy qubits and control hardware."}

We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver.

We further identify realistic material candidates, including octagraphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, synthetic $\\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and magnetic $α$-MnO$_2$, as potential candidates for realizing tunable topological phases intertwined with flat-band physics, opening new opportunities for correlated topological matter."}

Within the Einstein cluster framework, we derive the complete tensor, explicitly incorporating the kinetic contribution to the energy density and the anisotropic pressure arising from noncircular particle orbits. Adopting the Hernquist profile as an illustrative model of DM halo and employing parameters appropriate to the Milky Way, we find that near the spike, the kinetic term enhances the total energy density by approximately $50\\%$ relative to the rest-mass component, while the nonzero radial pressure induces a mild anisotropy in the stress tensor. The derived tensor satisfies all standard energy conditions. By treating it as a fixed source in Einstein' s equations, we numerically obtain a static, spherically symmetric metric that deviates from the Schwarzschild solution by an amount more than twice that found when only the mass density is considered. These results demonstrate that including the full dynamical structure of the DM spike is essential for accurately modeling the backreaction of DM on black hole spacetimes."}

We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations."}

In this work, we present a spin-accumulation based magneto-optical Kerr effect (SA-MOKE) microscopy technique that enables imaging of a magnetic thin-films covered by thick and opaque metallic layers. The technique is based on the generation and detection of transient spin-accumulations that propagate through the thick metallic layer. These spin-accumulation signals are directly triggered and detected optically on the same side, lifting any substrate transparency requirements. The spin-accumulation signals detected on a Cu layer decay with a characteristic length of 60 nm, much longer than the 12 nm optical penetration depth, allowing for detection of magnetic contrast with Cu capping layers up to hundreds of nm.

The quantum point contacts can tune electrically the number of conduction channels. We theoretically investigate an effect of the increase of channels on the emergence of Weyl points. The increase of channels causes the increase of Andreev bound states in the system, which increase the emergence probability of Weyl points. When all terminals have two channels, the emergence probability is up to 17\\%, which is about four times larger than that for all single channel junctions. We consider the balance of the number of conduction channels in the four terminals. When the number of channels is unbalanced, the increase of emergence probability is suppressed."}

However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy."}

Quantum Augmented Networks (QuANets) address this by integrating quantum components in classical network infrastructure to improve robustness and end-to-end security. To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises. In this work, we propose an improved quantum anonymous notification (QAN) protocol that utilizes rotation operations on shared GHZ states to produce an anonymous notification in an n-user quantum-augmented network. We study the behavior of this modified QAN protocol under the dephasing noise model and observe stronger resilience to false notifications than earlier QAN approaches. The QAN framework is also proposed to be integrated with a machine-learning classifier, enhanced quantum-augmented network.

Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) such as CRYSTALS-Kyber provide efficient quantum-resistant primitives but rely solely on computational hardness assumptions that are susceptible to hybrid classical-quantum attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)-certified Kyber protocol, which embeds quantum non-locality verification directly within the key exchange phase. The proposed design integrates CHSH entanglement tests using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs to yield measurable quantum advantage values exceeding classical correlation limits, thereby coupling information--theoretic quantum guarantees with lattice-based computational security. Formal reductions demonstrate that any polynomial-time adversary breaking the proposed KEM must either solve the Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem or a Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA)-complete instance of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem, under the standard complexity assumption QMA $\\subset$ NP. The construction remains fully compatible with the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, preserving chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security and Kyber's efficiency profile.

Using tunnelling spectroscopy, we observe signatures of vibron-assisted tunnelling on an Fe impurity in Bi$_2$Se$_3$.

Estimation of source parameters for a wider parameter space that these detectable signals will lie in, will be a computational challenge. Thus, it is imperative to have methods to speed-up the likelihood calculations with theoretical waveform predictions, which can ultimately make the parameter estimation faster and aid in rapid multi-messenger follow-ups. Towards this end, we present a conditional variational auto-encoder model, based on the best performing architecture of Liao+2021, for faster generation of aligned-spin SEOBNRv4 inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms.

Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a platform, we observe two FCIs joined by a continuous transition controlled by continuum model parameter $κ$, arising from a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions. For $κ$ below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable and effectively decomposes into two independent $C=1$ color sectors. Although the flat band is non-ideal, the resulting fractional phase is naturally accounted for by the non-chiral Halperin-(112) state with counterpropagating edge modes. Above the transition, the system enters a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this robustness, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: when the Bloch wave function is geometrically unstable, interactions dynamically split a non-ideal flat band into an ideal subcomponent that hosts the FCI and non-ideal remnants. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a \"color separator,\" explicitly visualizing the ideal subcomponent at the single-particle level. Together, these results establish two different routes by which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, expanding their viable parameter space and clarifying the interplay between geometry and topological order."}

By analytically and numerically examining the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $c_1$ and the cosmological parameter $Λ$, we reveal how these modified gravity parameters alter the underlying physical processes. Using geodesic analysis, we compute the specific energy, angular momentum, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius, and radiation flux of test particles, providing insight into how the modified gravity framework affects orbital stability and the organization of the accretion flow. Subsequently, through numerical solutions of the general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) equations, we describe the morphology of the shock cone formed via the BHL accretion mechanism around the BH. The numerical results demonstrate that increasing the values of $c_1$ and negative $Λ$ reduce gravitational focusing. Consequently, depending on the parameter choices, the opening angle of the shock cone either widens or narrows compared to the Schwarzschild case. However, because of weakened gravitational focusing, both the amount of accreted matter and the density of material trapped inside the cone decrease significantly. These results indicate that scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet corrections act as an effective gravitational damping term, transferring turbulence and transforming shock-dominated accretion into more stable configurations. The consistency between theoretical and numerical results suggests that the observable properties of accretion disks and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) can serve as probes to constrain the parameters of scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet gravity in strong-field regimes."}

To support this, we compute the quantum Fisher information matrices (QFIMs) based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). Our results show that the quantum Cramér Rao bound (QCRB) associated with the RLD is consistently lower than that of the SLD, indicating superior estimation precision. From a physical standpoint, this improvement reflects the system's enhanced capacity to encode, transfer, and extract quantum information while allowing optimal control of fundamental interactions. We show that increasing the Rabi frequency, cavity loss rate, and the average number of photons and phonons, combined with reduced mechanical damping and temperature, enhances the system's sensitivity to the coupling parameters. These mechanisms act on the available quantum resources, such as entanglement, squeezing, and state purity, leading to more precise estimations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that under certain conditions, heterodyne detection can closely approach the ultimate precision set by the QFIM. This suggests that a measurement strategy based on heterodyne detection can offer an efficient and practical route for estimating the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, paving the way for high precision hybrid quantum sensors."}

When applied to numerical-relativity simulations, the SMA test performs reliably for aligned-spin and mildly precessing systems but exhibits measurable biases for strongly precessing or eccentric binaries.

We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations."}

Four derivatives incorporating modifications designed to increase molecular hyperpolarizability ($β$) or promote favorable orientation were synthesized and characterized. The most successful modification, intramolecular bridge-locking, simultaneously increases hyperpolarizability and enhances spontaneous orientation by reducing detrimental electrostatic interactions during deposition. It leads to a significant enhancement of the second-order nonlinear response, achieving off-resonance $χ^{(2)}_{31} \\approx 16$ pm V$^{-1}$ and $χ^{(2)}_{33} \\approx 18$ pm V$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm, a twofold improvement over the parent TPA-QCN.

However, their lower-dimensional counterpart, one-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattices, remain largely unexplored. Electrons in 1D are generally described by Luttinger liquid theory, with universal scaling relations depending only on the Luttinger parameter g. In particular, at half-filling, Umklapp scattering plays a crucial role, as it can significantly change the conductance-temperature scaling relation and lead to Mott insulators. However, this prediction has never been observed since doping an empty band to half-filling was extremely difficult. Here, we show that the marriage of moiré superlattices and 1D electrons makes it possible to study the Luttinger liquid in an exceptionally wide filling region simply by electrical gating. We perform transport measurements on 1D moiré superlattices of carbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, and observe correlated insulating states at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings of the superlattice mini-band, where Umklapp scattering becomes dominant. We also observe a T-linear conductance at these commensurate fillings over a range of temperatures. Strikingly, the T-linear conductance leads to a strongly suppressed Luttinger parameter, suggesting a state of extreme correlation."}

Although some efforts have been made to integrate perovskite nanomaterials with optical fibers, technological challenges have hindered reliable in-situ preparation methods. Herein, we propose an area-selective wetting strategy for optical fibers, which utilizes hydrophobic sidewalls and hydrophilic end facets to reliably hold small precursor droplets. By introducing a space confinement strategy to suppress the kinetics of solvent evaporation, Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals were successfully grown in-situ on the fiber end facet. The versatility of this in-situ growth method for single crystals on fiber end facets of various sizes has also been verified. In a separate approach, the controllable in-situ preparation of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline thin films was achieved through vacuum-assisted rapid crystallization.

Unlike collapse theories, EQM does not allow an action on one system to change the reduced density matrix (RDM) of a remote entangled system - a clear case of nonlocal action. However, EQM does allow an action on one system to change the global state of the system and its remote entangled partners. We argue that such changes should also count as nonlocal actions, meaning EQM is not local after all. First, we consider an argument to the contrary, which deems such global changes to be mere extrinsic changes, whereas nonlocal action requires intrinsic changes to the remote system. We respond that the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction is problematic and cannot hold the weight of this argument. We then try to clarify when actions that change global states count as nonlocal actions. We argue that it is when the global states are essential explanatory mechanisms of the theory. In EQM, the global state is needed to explain why, in an anti-correlated Bell state, Alice's measuring spin-up ensures that she encounters only the branch where Bob measures spin-down."}

Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\\tildeζ$, the mode frequency $\\tildeω$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\\tildeζ$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\\tildeζ$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information."}

This study develops and demonstrates a cubic photoelastic model that enables accurate fringe-order estimation from three orthogonal views, providing a foundation for reconstructing full three-dimensional stress states. A transparent, low-elasticity epoxy cube, free of prestress, was fabricated and examined using combined transmission and reflection photoelastic imaging. Three mutually orthogonal isochromatic fringe fields were recorded simultaneously under a single applied load. Image analysis employed a peak-valley intensity method to extract sub-fringe orders and to resolve low-stress cases with minimal noise. The cubic block produced high-quality fringe patterns in all directions, enabling separation of tangential and normal stress components. Independent orthogonal views confirmed directional sensitivity and yielded consistent fringe-order estimates under low loading, with response times on the order of tens of microseconds. These results establish a practical approach for three-dimensional photoelastic stress measurement from orthogonal views and create a pathway toward full vector force reconstruction with strong potential for biomedical applications and studies of dynamic loading."}

The metric is asymptotically flat and characterized by a simple lapse function $f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass and $a$ represents the characteristic scale of the surrounding dark-matter halo that regularizes the central region. The effective potentials for all perturbing fields possess the standard single-barrier form, ensuring linear stability and the applicability of the WKB formalism. The quasinormal frequencies are computed using the sixth- and ninth-order WKB methods with Padé corrections and verified by time-domain integration, both approaches showing excellent agreement. The parameter $a$ leads to a moderate increase in the real oscillation frequency, while the damping rate remains almost unchanged, producing only small corrections to the Schwarzschild spectrum.

The approach exploits the smooth frequency-domain behavior of ratios between neighboring waveform templates. The matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time series of a data segment is first computed for a reference template, and the SNRs of nearby templates are then reconstructed by convolving this reference SNR time series with the ratio waveforms, defined as the frequency-domain ratios between the reference and neighboring templates. The computational speedup arises because the ratio waveforms can be safely truncated: they are significant only over a short interval approximately equal to the duration difference between the templates. Storing these truncated ratio waveforms is practical and enables additional efficiency gains, in contrast to storing full templates, which is generally infeasible for long-duration, low-mass signals. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method with mock non-spinning CBC injections in the $1-3~M_\\odot$ range.

However, standard methods relying on active measurements may introduce additional errors. Autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) circumvents this by utilizing engineered dissipation and drives in bosonic systems, but identifying practical encoding remains challenging due to stringent Knill-Laflamme conditions. In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover Bosonic codes under approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of solving the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning. The agent first identifies an encoded subspace surpassing the breakeven point through rapid exploration within a constrained evolutionary time-frame, then strategically fine-tunes its policy to sustain this performance advantage over extended temporal horizons. We find that the two-phase trained agent can discover the optimal set of codewords, i.e., the Fock states $\\ket{4}$ and $\\ket{7}$ considering the effect of both single-photon and double-photon loss. We identify that the discovered code surpasses the breakeven threshold over a longer evolution time and achieve the state-of-art performance. We also analyze the robustness of the code against the phase damping and amplitude damping noise.

By studying the refraction law for null geodesics at the spherical shell, and taking account of the light travel time delay, the images are obtained by ray tracing a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk. For a static shell we identify three signatures: a redshift cusp at the shell, a V-shaped profile of the transfer function $r(b)$, and a loss of the one-to-one correspondence between photon spheres and photon rings on the observer's screen. During the collapse of the shell, the spacetime evolves from a stage with a single photon sphere inside the shell, through an intermediate stage with double photon spheres, and finally to a spacetime with a single photon sphere outside the shell. However, when the shell is released from a large distance, the corresponding images never show two separate photon rings, even in the stage with two photon spheres. In addition, the motion of the shell leads to a discontinuity in the redshift factor. These signatures provide a practical basis for testing the Israel junction in black hole spacetimes."}

While the implementation of a global-scale quantum network requires quantum storage times on the order of seconds to minutes, existing photonic quantum memories have so far been limited to subsecond lifetimes. Although $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals exhibit substantially extended spin coherence times at the `magic' magnetic field, the concomitant weak optical absorption has until now prevented single-photon storage. Here, we overcome this challenge by integrating a noiseless photon echo protocol -- which makes full use of the crystal's natural absorption for photonic storage -- with a universally robust dynamical decoupling sequence incorporating adiabatic pulses to protect nuclear spin coherence, enabling long-lived quantum storage at the `magic' magnetic field. At a storage time of 5.6 s, we achieve a time-bin qubit storage fidelity of 88.0 $\\pm$ 2.1%, surpassing the maximum fidelity attainable via classical strategies.

Finite-size scaling shows a clear growth of ds with system size, while dh increases more mildly. At the largest volumes explored the data are compatible with ds ~ 4 and dh ~ 3, implying ds > dh and a nontrivial hierarchy between spectral and volumetric notions of dimension. We also map the dependence on the curvature coupling gamma and the locality coupling beta, and we find a slow power-law growth of typical distances with a small exponent eta. The CCM therefore provides a controlled numerical laboratory in which the interplay of coherence, curvature, and locality yields finite-dimensional, fractal-like geometries."}

In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merely assuming that the number of photons and excited electrons only takes discrete values. The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded."}

Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\\simeq 20\\,M_\\odot$.

In BUG the relative volume element $ν=\\sqrt{1-2BX}$ is fixed, enforcing a kinematic constraint on the biscalar and we derive the \"bimodular cosmological constant\" $Λ=λ_1+νλ_2$. In BHT/BDUG, $λ_{1,2}$ are individually constant but $ν$ (hence $BX$) remains dynamical.

At the background level, BUG admits constant-roll solutions governed by first-order flow, whereas BHT supports solutions with time-dependent roll. These structural differences yield distinct, in-principle testable predictions for the expansion history, the dark-energy equation of state, and the propagation of biscalar perturbations.

Using connected simulated annealing we generate low-energy graph configurations and characterize their emergent geometry through the spectral dimension (ds), the Hausdorff dimension (dh), and the average distance. Finite-size scaling shows a clear growth of ds with system size, while dh increases more mildly. At the largest volumes explored the data are compatible with ds ~ 4 and dh ~ 3, implying ds > dh and a nontrivial hierarchy between spectral and volumetric notions of dimension. We also map the dependence on the curvature coupling gamma and the locality coupling beta, and we find a slow power-law growth of typical distances with a small exponent eta. The CCM therefore provides a controlled numerical laboratory in which the interplay of coherence, curvature, and locality yields finite-dimensional, fractal-like geometries."}

We analyze key phenomenological features, demonstrating significant deviations from Schwarzschild in the radii of the photon sphere and the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO).

We demonstrate that the core operations of its classical counterpart, Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a brain-inspired model, map with remarkable elegance and direct correspondence onto the native operations of a QC. This suggests HDC is exceptionally well-suited for a quantum-native implementation. We establish a direct, resource-efficient mapping: (i) hypervectors are mapped to quantum states, (ii) the bundling operation is implemented as a quantum-native averaging process using a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and Oblivious Amplitude Amplification (OAA), (iii) the binding operation is realized via quantum phase oracles, (iv) the permutation operation is implemented using the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), and (v) vector similarity is calculated using quantum state fidelity measurements based on the Hadamard Test. We present the first-ever implementation of this framework, validated through symbolic analogical reasoning and supervised classification tasks. The viability of QHDC is rigorously assessed via a comparative analysis of results from classical computation, ideal quantum simulation, and execution of a 156-qubit IBM Heron r3 quantum processor. Our results validate the proposed mappings and demonstrate the versatility of the framework, establishing QHDC as a physically realizable technology.

Part II constructs a gauge gravitational theory based on the Projective General Linear Group, wherein the newly found projective symmetric teleparallel (PST) connections are defined. Generalizing to non-inertial frames, and using nonlinear gauge symmetry realizations to implement local Lorentz symmetry, we construct a general geometric framework that unifies TW and Metric-Affine gravity with projectively invariant spacetime torsion. We introduce projective generalized Higgs fields and show how certain gauge choices reduce these to fundamental projective fields, and how they may be used to define fundamental geometric objects such as the projective 2-frame and spacetime connection. A Lovelock-inspired action is shown to support only curvature (metric) dynamics, implying a topologically constrained Schouten field via the Pontrjagin density. The projective Pontrjagin density is shown to contain a new topological invariant, not present in the literature. Part III formulates projective spinors by defining gamma matrices via the projective linear group metric, then employing nonlinear gauge symmetry realizations to ensure local Lorentz covariance. A general spinor metric introduces a complex phase of redundancy. Requiring a real, Hermitian action leads to a projective Einstein-Cartan-type theory. An induced chiral mass emerges without CP violation."}

At the background level, BUG admits constant-roll solutions governed by first-order flow, whereas BHT supports solutions with time-dependent roll. These structural differences yield distinct, in-principle testable predictions for the expansion history, the dark-energy equation of state, and the propagation of biscalar perturbations.

Despite the importance of moment operators, their properties have not been as explored for quantum channels. In this work we develop a theoretical framework to compute moment operators for ensembles of quantum channels, for all moment orders $t$, with a special focus on determining ensembles that can be used as points of reference. By deriving hierarchies between ensembles, via inequalities of their moment operator norms, we give them operational meaning, and define useful concepts such as that of channel $t$-designs.

Incorporating the trace anomaly of $N$ conformal matter fields via the Polyakov action, we determine the evolution of the black-hole mass and geometry in the Unruh--de Sitter state, track the steady nonequilibrium Hawking flux, and compute local thermodynamic observables for static observers. The conserved Killing energy flux drives an irreversible heat current from the black hole to the cosmological horizon whenever their surface gravities differ, ensuring monotonic entropy growth and satisfaction of the generalized second law. We prove that $κ_b > κ_c$ throughout the physical static patch, so the only zero-flux configuration is the Nariai limit where the horizons coincide. Extending the framework to the quantum-information regime, we construct a thermally controlled estimate of the Page curve and show how quantum extremal surfaces and entanglement islands emerge naturally within the anomaly-induced steady state.

There is also a well-known theory, due to Coleman, that assumes one can compute a probability distribution function for baby universes connected by wormholes that has the most probable value of the constant to be zero under some assumptions. The current paper starts from a QFT in 4-dimensions, breaks translational invariance by confining the fields to a box and adds a marginal (in power-counting terms) non-linear, momentum-dependent term that dominates the dynamics produced by the quadratic terms in the high-energy limit. It immediately produces an equation for the wave-vector cutoff applicable to the theory - the equation is reminiscent of that from UV/IR mixing and it effectively lowers the cutoff massively for a box the size of the Universe. However, as will be shown, the wave-vector cutoff for a box relevant for regular particle physics experiments is much larger, in fact, the Planck scale, so there is no conflict with current experiments, including the Casimir effect. We consider several possibilities for these additional terms and conclude that only one is relevant to a low cut-off. We also make a connection to the recent DESI results."}

However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy."}

The Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) equation uniquely characterizes Markovian dynamics that are completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP), yet many physical systems display non-Markovian features such as algebraic relaxation and coherence backflow beyond the reach of semigroup evolution. Fractional calculus provides a natural framework for describing such long-memory behavior through power-law temporal kernels introduced by fractional time derivatives. Here we establish a unified hierarchy that embeds fractional quantum master equations within the broader landscape of open system dynamics. The fractional master equation forms a structured subclass of memory-kernel models, reducing to the GKSL form at unit fractional order. Through Bochner--Phillips subordination, fractional evolution is expressed as an average over Lindblad semigroups weighted by a power-law waiting-time distribution. This construction ensures physical consistency, explains the algebraic origin of long-time decay, and bridges unitary, Markovian, and structured non-Markovian regimes. The resulting framework positions fractional calculus as a rigorous and unifying language for quantum dynamics with intrinsic memory, enabling new directions for theoretical analysis and quantum simulation."}

In the topological regime, an edge-state EP emerges at an exponentially small non-Hermitian strength, resulting in early PT-symmetry breaking and rapid energy accumulation. This topological enhancement originates from the PT-symmetric non-Hermitian dynamics, in which the broken-symmetry edge mode with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue dominates the time evolution. Consequently, the topological phase consistently yields higher stored energy and faster saturation than the trivial configuration across all parameter regimes and system sizes.

Inspired by the global decoding insight of the unified decoder (Benhemou et al., 2023), this paper introduces a correlated decoder for the 4.8.8 color code, which improves upon the conventional restricted decoder by leveraging correlations between restricted lattices, and is derived by mapping the correlated matching decoder for the surface code onto the color code lattice. Analytical and numerical results show that the correlated decoder achieves higher thresholds than the restricted and unified decoders, while matching the performance of the unified decoder at very low physical error rates. Under the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, the estimated thresholds for the color code against bit-flip error are 10.38% and 3.13%, respectively. Furthermore, by applying the surface-color code mapping, the thresholds of 16.62% and 3.52% are obtained for the surface code against depolarizing noise."}

The first is the N-version programming method, which compares probability distributions obtained via different QEM strategies and excludes the outlier distribution, certifying the feasibility of the error-mitigated distributions.

This system exhibits quantum bistability and supports a logical manifold for a bosonic qubit. Using Kramer's theory together with the $P$-representation, we derive an analytical expression for the bit-flip error rate within the potential-barrier approximation. The agreement is demonstrated between analytical calculations and numerical simulations obtained by diagonalization of the Liouvillian superoperator. In the purely dissipative limit, the switching rate increases monotonically with detuning, as the two metastable states approach each other in phase space. However, the exponential contribution to the bit-flip rate exhibits a nontrivial dependence on system parameters, extending beyond the naive scaling with the average photon number. In the presence of large Kerr nonlinearity, the switching rate becomes a nonmonotonic function of the detuning and reaches a minimum at a finite detuning. This effect arises because detuning lowers the activation barrier for weak nonlinearity but increases it for large ones, ensuring a minimum of the switching-rate at nonzero detuning. These results establish key conditions for optimizing the performance of critical cat qubits and are directly relevant for the design of scalable superconducting bosonic quantum architectures."}

Recent pioneering experiments showing Purcell enhancement of SnV centers in PCCs underscore this potential.

However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus\" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing."}

The great advantage is that Gaussian states are experimentally accessible via their first and second statistical moments. In this work, we investigate parameter estimation for Gaussian states, in which the probe-state preparation stage involves two noncommutative Gaussian measurements on the position and momentum observables, introducing tunable parameters. The influence of these noncommutative Gaussian measurements is investigated through the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We showed that the QFI for characterizing Gaussian channels can be increased by adjusting the uncertainty parameters in the preparation of the probe state. Furthermore, if the probe is initially in a thermal state, probe-state preparation may generate quantum coherence in its energy basis. We showed that not only does the amount of coherence affect the improvement of the QFI, but also the rate of change of the coherence with respect to the parameter to be estimated. The proposed probe-state protocol is applied to two paradigmatic single-mode Gaussian channels, the attenuator and amplification channels, which are building blocks of Gaussian quantum information. Our results contribute to the use of coherence in quantum metrology and are experimentally feasible in quantum-optical devices."}

When a BB code has a Tanner graph that is a $h$-fold covering of the base BB code's Tanner graph, we refer to it as a $h$-cover code. We show that for a BB code to be a $h$-cover code, its lattice parameters and defining polynomials must satisfy simple algebraic conditions relative to those of the base code. By extending the graph covering map to a chain map, we show there are induced projection and lifting maps on (co)homology that enable the projection and lifting of logical operators and, in certain cases, automorphisms between the base and the cover code. The search space of cover codes is considerably reduced compared to the full space of possible polynomials and we find that many interesting examples of BB codes, such as the $[[144,12,12]]$ gross code, can be viewed as cover codes. We also apply our method to search for BB codes with weight 8 checks and find many codes, including a $[[64,14,8]]$ and $[[144,14,14]]$ code.

The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded."}

As quantum hardware advances toward modular and networked architectures, various fault tolerant DQC schemes have been proposed, which can be broadly categorized into three architectural types. Type 1 architectures consist of small quantum nodes connected via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, enabling nonlocal stabilizer measurements. Type 2 architectures distribute a large error correcting code block across multiple modules, with most stabilizer measurements remaining local, except for a small subset at patch boundaries that are performed using nonlocal CNOT gates. Type 3 architectures assign code blocks to distinct modules and can perform fault tolerant operations such as transversal gates, lattice surgery, and teleportation to implement logical operations between code blocks. Using the planar surface code and toric code as representative examples, we analyze how the resource requirements, particularly the number of Bell pairs and the average number of generation attempts, scale with increasing code distance across different architectural designs. This analysis provides valuable insights for identifying architectures well suited to fault tolerant distributed quantum computation under near term hardware and resource constraints."}

A key component of such architectures is a scheduler that coordinates operations over a short-range quantum network required to enable the necessary non-local entangling gates between quantum processing units (QPUs). It is desirable to determine schedules of minimum make span, which in the case of networks with constrained resources hinges on their efficient usage. Here we compare and contrast two approaches to solving the make span minimization problem, an approach based on the resource constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) framework, and another based on a greedy heuristic algorithm. The workflow considered is as follows. Firstly, the computational circuit is partitioned and assigned to different QPUs such that the number of nonlocal entangling gates acting across partitions is minimized while the qubit load is nearly uniform on the individual QPUs, which can be accomplished using, e.g., the METIS solver. Secondly, the nonlocal entangling gate requirements with respect to the partitions are identified, and mapped to network operation sequences that deliver the necessary entanglement between the QPUs. Finally, the network operations are scheduled such that the make span is minimized. As illustrative examples, we analyze the implementation of a small instance of the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm over instances of a simple hub and spoke (star) network architecture comprised of a quantum switch as the hub and QPUs as spokes, each with a finite qubit resource budget. In one instance, our results show the RCPSP approach outperforming the greedy heuristic. In another instance, we find the two performing equally well. Our results thus illustrate the effectiveness of the RCPSP framework, while also underlining the relevance and usefulness of greedy heuristics."}

In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of π/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift. These findings establish a direct correspondence between the PSHE and the underlying non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectrum."}

Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\\tildeζ$, the mode frequency $\\tildeω$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\\tildeζ$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\\tildeζ$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information."}

By applying photoexcitation or bias voltage, we observe remarkable thermal conductance increases in operando, opening a new channel for efficient interfacial heat dissipation. The electron quantum tunneling pathway is parallel to conventional phonon-mediated interfacial thermal transport, and violates the Wiedemann-Franz law since this pathway deviates from the paradigm of diffusive transport. Moreover, we develop a tunneling mismatch model to describe the enhanced thermal conductance, originating from tunneling heat flux.

Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \\sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $ξ_R^2 \\sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids."}

Barnett", "Ramy El-Ganainy"], "title": "$\\mathcal{PT}$-like phase transitions from square roots of supersymmetric Hamiltonians", "comment": "14 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "We introduce a general framework for realizing $\\mathcal{PT}$-like phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems without imposing explicit parity--time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. The approach is based on constructing a Hamiltonian as the square root of a supersymmetric partner energy-shifted by a constant. This formulation naturally leads to bipartite dynamics with balanced gain and loss and can incorporate non-reciprocal couplings. The resulting systems exhibit entirely real spectra over a finite parameter range precisely when the corresponding passive Hamiltonian lacks a zero mode. As the non-Hermitian parameter representing gain and loss increases, the spectrum undergoes controlled real-to-complex transitions at second-order exceptional points. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through several examples, including well-known models such as the Hatano--Nelson (HN) and complex Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (cSSH) lattices. Extending the formalism to $q$-commuting matrices further enables the systematic realization of higher-order exceptional points in systems with unidirectional couplings. Overall, this work uncovers new links between non-Hermitian physics and supersymmetry, offering a practical route to engineer photonic arrays with tunable spectral properties beyond what is achievable with explicit $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry."}

The intricate dynamical behavior of these systems is a result of the dramatically reduced connectivity between many-body configurations. This truncation of transition pathways often leads to a fragmentation of the Hilbert space, yielding highly collective and therefore often slow dynamics. Moreover, this mechanism supports the formation of characteristic elementary excitations, which we investigate here theoretically in a two-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas. We explore their properties as a function of interaction strength and range, and illustrate how they can be experimentally probed via sideband spectroscopy. Here, we show that the transition rate to certain delocalized superposition states of elementary excitations displays collective many-body enhancement."}

While the Lieb--Liniger gas is integrable, the impurity breaks integrability and induces a transition towards quantum chaos. We show that the low-energy spectrum exhibits random-matrix statistics, in striking contrast to the Bohigas--Giannoni--Schmit conjecture, where chaotic behavior typically emerges at high energy. For two bosons, the odd-parity sector remains integrable, whereas the even-parity sector displays clear signatures of chaos at low energy and a crossover back to quasi-integrable behavior at higher energies. For three bosons, both parity sectors exhibit spectral statistics close to chaos at low energy. We argue that this unconventional form of many-body quantum chaos originates from diffractive processes induced by the impurity."}

Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications."}
