### [1] [Dynamics of Josephson junctions beyond the tunneling limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03811)
*Jacob F. Steiner,Larissa Melischek,Felix von Oppen*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: 研究推导了扩展的RCSJ模型，考虑了非线性耗散电流和任意超电流相位关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 初始化理论中，RCSJ模型在隧道极限下不能解释Josephson二极管效果，因此需要扩展该模型。

Method: 推导扩展的RCSJ模型的方法包括引入非线性耗散电流和任意超电流相位关系，使用广义的 fluctuation-dissipation定理来描述Langevin电流。

Result: 扩展的RCSJ模型能够在不依赖隧道极限的情况下描述Josephson二极管效果，这有助于理解非均衡超导机制。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解超导系统中的动态行为提供了新的理论框架，扩展了RCSJ模型的适用范围。

Abstract: The dynamics of the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson
junction can be described within the resistively and capacitively shunted
Josephson junction (RCSJ) model. Microscopic derivations of this model
traditionally rely on the tunneling limit. Here, we present a derivation of a
generalized version of the RCSJ model, which accounts for dissipative currents
with nonlinear current-voltage characteristics as well as supercurrents with
arbitrary current-phase relations. This requires a generalized
fluctuation-dissipation theorem to describe the Langevin current, which we
deduce along the lines of fluctuation theorems for mesoscopic conductors. Our
work is motivated in particular by recent theories of the Josephson diode
effect, which is not captured within the RCSJ model in the tunneling limit.

### [2] [Unconventional quantization of 2D plasmons in cavities formed by gate slots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03829)
*Ilia Moiseenko,Olga Polischuk,Viacheslav Muravev,Dmitry Svintsov*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: 该论文展示了平行金属栅条形成的介电层中的波导效应，发现了与传统半波导 cavity 不同的新型模式束缚，研究结果表明在特定条件下可以通过微小的腔体实现高效的阻尼，为微型构型设计提供了新思路。

Result: 致密栅条间形成的新型波导，具有广域半波导模式的较小区体实现，适用于微型结构。

Conclusion: 该研究发现了一种新型的模式束缚，为小型微型结构设计提供了可行的开发思路。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the slot between parallel metal gates placed above
two-dimensional electron system (2DES) forms a plasmonic cavity with
unconventional mode quantization. The resonant plasmon modes are excited when
the slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\lambda$ satisfy the condition
$L = \lambda/8 +n \times \lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \ldots$. The lowest
resonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth
of the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional
half-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics. This unique quantization rule
arises from a non-trivial phase shift of $-\pi/4$ acquired by the 2D plasmon
upon reflection from the edge of the gate. The slot plasmon modes exhibit weak
decay into the gated 2DES region, with the decay rate being proportional to the
square root of the separation between the gate and the 2DES. Absorption
cross-section by such slots reaches $\sim 50$ % of the fundamental dipole limit
without any matching strategies, and is facilitated by field enhancement at the
metal edges.

### [3] [Modeling Memristor-Based Neural Networks with Manhattan Update: Trade-offs in Learning Performance and Energy Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03858)
*Walter Quiñonez,María José Sánchez,Diego Rubi*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: 研究了基于 memristor 的神经网络，使用硬件友好的曼哈顿更新规则进行训练，重点分析了学习性能与能耗之间的权衡。通过实证的 P/D 曲线分析了非线性、电导范围和可用级别对单个感知器 (SP) 和深度神经网络 (DNN) 在 MNIST 数据集上的影响。结果表明 SP 对于 NLI ≤ 0.01 具有耐受性，而 DNN 需要更严格的 NLI ≤ 0.001 来保持准确度。增加离散电导状态数改善了收敛性，相当于更精细的学习率。提出了一种策略，其中每个微分对中的一个 memristor 被固定，减少了冗余 memristor 电导更新。这种方法在 DNN 中降低了训练能耗近 50%，同时几乎没有减少准确度。这些发现强调了设备算法协同设计在实现可扩展低功耗神经形态硬件方面的重要性。

Motivation: 随着边缘 AI 应用的兴起，寻找低功耗、硬件友好的神经网络架构变得尤为重要。 memristor 基础的神经网络因其潜在的低功耗特性而备受关注，尤其是使用硬件友好的更新规则。本研究旨在系统性地分析 memristor 基态神经网络在不同参数设置下的性能与能耗 trade-off，以指导实际应用中 memristor 网络的设计与优化。

Method: 研究方法采用了系统的实验与理论结合。使用了现实的 P/D 曲线模型，评估了非线性、电导范围和可用级别对单个感知器和深度神经网络的影响。通过对 MNIST 数据集的训练，比较了不同参数设置下的学习性能与能耗。提出了固定 memristor 策略，通过减少冗余更新降低了能耗。

Result: 研究发现，单个感知器对 NLI 的耐受性较高，当 NLI ≤ 0.01 时仍能保持高准确度。相比之下，深度神经网络需要更严格的 NLI ≤ 0.001 才能保持准确度。增加离散电导状态数有助于提高收敛速度，相当于提高了学习率的精细度。通过固定 memristor 策略，DNN 的训练能耗降低了近 50%，而准确度几乎没有下降。这表明 memristor 基态神经网络在边缘 AI 应用中具有良好的前景。

Conclusion: 本文系统性研究了基于 memristor 的神经网络，特别是在使用硬件友好的更新规则下的性能与能耗 trade-off。结果表明，通过优化非线性、电导范围和离散电导状态数，可以显著提高训练效率。同时，固定 memristor 策略在 DNN 中显著降低了能耗，同时保持了高的准确度。usions{0 结果具有重要的实际意义，特别是在为边缘 AI 应用设计低功耗硬件时。这些发现为我们未来在 memristor 基态神经网络的设计与优化提供了重要的指导。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of memristor based neural networks trained with
the hardware-friendly Manhattan update rule, focusing on the trade offs between
learning performance and energy consumption. Using realistic models of
potentiation/depression (P/D) curves, we evaluate the impact of nonlinearity
(NLI), conductance range, and number of accessible levels on both a single
perceptron (SP) and a deep neural network (DNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.
Our results show that SPs tolerate P/D nonlinearity up to NLI $\leq 0.01$,
while DNNs require stricter conditions of NLI $\leq$ 0.001 to preserve
accuracy. Increasing the number of discrete conductance states improves
convergence, effectively acting as a finer learning rate. We further propose a
strategy where one memristor of each differential pair is fixed, reducing
redundant memristor conductance updates. This approach lowers training energy
by nearly 50% in DNN with little to no loss in accuracy. Our findings highlight
the importance of device algorithm codesign in enabling scalable, low power
neuromorphic hardware for edge AI applications.

Abstract: Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band
singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the
emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously
uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them
in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian
generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that
characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of
the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved
polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band
two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access
to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian
quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted
to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in
flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall
physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide
phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and
non-Abelian physics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital
magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states. Our calculations include the Berry
connection term in the k-derivatives of Bloch states, which was omitted in
previous works. The resulting formula for the OMM matrix elements applies to
any non-degenerate Bloch states within Hilbert space. We identify two new
contributions: the first restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states,
while the second, being itself gauge covariant, can provide significant
quantitative corrections depending on the system under study. We examine their
impact on the orbital Hall effect in two bilayer systems: a 2H transition metal
dichalcogenide bilayer and a biased bilayer graphene. In both cases, these new
terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau compared with results that
neglect them, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be
particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections. Our findings may
contribute to the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and to the
conceptual foundations of the emerging field of orbitronics.

Abstract: We analyze the thermal and electrical characteristics of the metasurface
consisting of
  the coplanar interdigital array of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected
by nanobridges (NBs). These nanobridges could be implemented using graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs), single-wall semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or
black-arsenic-phosphorus (b-AsP) nanostructures. The bias voltage applied
between neighboring GMRs indices electron and hole two-dimensional systems in
the GMRs and induces thermionic currents flowing through connecting NBs. The
resulting self-heating increases thermionic currents providing an effective
positive feadback between the carrier effective temperature and the injected
currents. This mechanism may lead to thermal breakdown enabling threshold
behavior of current-voltage characteristics and resulting in the S-shape of
these characteristics. The devices based on the GMR/GNR, GMR/CNT, and GMR/AsP
metasurface structures can be used as fast voltage-controlled current switches,
sensors, thermal terahertz and infrared sources, and other devices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Arrays of bosonic condensates of exciton-polaritons have emerged as a
promising platform for simulating classical XY models, capable of rapidly
reaching phase-locked states that may be mapped to arrays of two-dimensional
classical spins. However, it remains unclear whether these states genuinely
minimize the corresponding XY Hamiltonian and how the convergence time scales
with the system size. Here, we develop an analytical model revealing that an
array of $N$ condensates possesses $N$ stable phase configurations. The system
selectively amplifies a specific configuration dependent on the pump power: at
low power, the state with the smallest eigenvalue of an effective XY
Hamiltonian is favored, while at high power, the state with the largest
eigenvalue prevails. At intermediate pump powers, the system visits all
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Crucially, the formation rate for any of these
phase-locked states remains on the order of 100 ps, independent of the size of
the array, demonstrating the exceptional speed and scalability of
polariton-based XY simulators.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Hydrocarbon contamination is an ever-present factor to consider in surface
science measurements. In the case of van der Waals material surfaces, the
structure of this contamination has become known in recent years as a
self-assembled layer of normal-alkanes, resulting from a few days' exposure to
ambient air. Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic
investigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the
effect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
spectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated
surfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer
suppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a
long-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent.
Furthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the
current-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by
a factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from
extra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel
junction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on
the $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence
of surface contamination in STM measurements.

Conclusion: 三氧化硫二层半导体材料作为高效、致密的光子发射器的候选人，在高载流子浓度下的光致发光性能表现优异。

Abstract: Monolayers of group-VI transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are
two-dimensional semiconductors that exhibit exceptionally strong light-matter
coupling yet typically suffer from low emission quantum yields. In this letter,
we investigate the heavily n-doped regime of a WSe$_2$ monolayer and show that
multi-particle excitonic complexes produce photoluminescence signals up to two
orders of magnitude stronger than in the neutral state. Time-resolved
photoluminescence and differential reflectivity measurements reveal that the
quantum yield rises with carrier density and exceeds 50% for electron
concentrations above 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. These findings establish TMD
monolayers as a platform for exploring excitonic complexes in high-density
electron gases and point toward new opportunities for efficient, atomically
thin light emitters.

Abstract: Quantum simulators enable studies of many-body phenomena which are
intractable with classical hardware. Spins in devices based on semiconductor
quantum dots promise precise electrical control and scalability advantages, but
accessing many-body phenomena has so far been restricted by challenges in
nanofabrication and simultaneous control of multiple interactions. Here, we
perform spectroscopy of up to eight interacting spins using a 2x4 array of
gate-defined germanium quantum dots. The spectroscopy protocol is based on
Ramsey interferometry and adiabatic mapping of many-body eigenstates to
single-spin eigenstates, enabling a complete energy spectrum reconstruction. As
the interaction strength exceeds magnetic disorder, we observe signatures of
the crossover from localization to a chaotic phase marking a step towards the
observation of many-body phenomena in quantum dot systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent
driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to
nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to
manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart
of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive
heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum
dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached.
However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine,
such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of
the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising
efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum
dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal
machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent
asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to
engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its
performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate
transmission level.

Abstract: Donor spin qubits in silicon offer one- and two-qubit gates with fidelities
beyond 99%, coherence times exceeding 30 seconds, and compatibility with
industrial manufacturing methods. This motivates the development of large-scale
quantum processors using this platform, and the ability to automatically tune

learning algorithm with the ability to automatically locate the charge
transitions of an ion-implanted donor in a silicon device, tune single-shot
charge readout, and identify the gate voltage parameters where tunnelling rates
in and out the donor site are the same. The entire tuning pipeline is completed
on the order of minutes. Our results enable both automatic characterisation and
tuning of a donor in silicon devices faster than human experts.

Motivation: 研究离散时空中可积系统的对偶性及其应用，如非可逆对偶性和伪旋转对称性，提供新的对偶性理解。

Method: 使用量子逆散射法构造非均匀转移矩阵，利用其积分性质。通过离散化时间和空间，发现对偶性对称操作对系统的影响。

Result: 证明了critical transverse field Ising模型的一阶离散时间可积性及其对偶性。导出离散时间下的不变量和对偶操作。

Conclusion: 这种方法不仅在离散时间下保持可积性，还扩展了对偶性对称性，有助于研究有限时间Floquet演化。

Abstract: Integrable trotterization provides a method to evolve a continuous time
integrable many-body system in discrete time, such that it retains its
conserved quantities. Here we explicitly show that the first order
trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model is integrable. The
discrete time conserved quantities are obtained from an inhomogeneous transfer
matrix constructed using the quantum inverse scattering method. The
inhomogeneity parameter determines the discrete time step. We then focus on the
non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for the trotterized evolution.
We find that the discretization of both space and time leads to a doubling of
these duality operators. They account for discrete translations in both space
and time. As an interesting application, we find that these operators also
provide maps between trotterizations of different orders. This helps us extend
our results beyond the trotterization scheme and investigate the
Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for finite time Floquet evolution of the
critical transverse field Ising chain.

Motivation: 研究量子退火机在退火过程中进行无序采样的能力，尤其是在高度 frustrations的 magnetic 系统中，对于量子热力学采样应用程序具有重要意义。

Method: 该研究使用了标准线性加速退火程序在两种不同的 D-Wave 量子退火处理器上，分析了从 5 纳秒到 2000 微秒的不同退火时间，评估了 Boltzmann 抽样误差率。

Result: 研究发现，在某些退火参数下，系统达到了极高的精度（T(Vec) 距离为 0.0003），并且实现了低温度采样（~ β=32.2），特别是在 frustrated 磁性相图的分区内。

Conclusion: 这些发现证实了当前的量子退火机在精确进行热力学采样应用于高度 frustrated磁性系统方面具有很强的可行性。

Abstract: One of the surprising, and potentially very useful, capabilities of analog
quantum computers, such as D-Wave quantum annealers, is sampling from the
Boltzmann, or Gibbs, distribution defined by a classical Hamiltonian. In this
study, we thoroughly examine the ability of D-Wave quantum annealers to sample
from the Boltzmann distribution defined of a canonical type of competing
magnetic frustration $J_1$-$J_2$ model; the ANNNI (axial next-nearest-neighbor
Ising) model. Boltzmann sampling error rate is quantified for standard
linear-ramp anneals ranging from $5$ nanosecond annealing times up to $2000$
microseconds on two different D-Wave quantum annealing processors.
Interestingly, we find some analog hardware parameters which result in a very
high accuracy (down to a TVD of $0.0003$) and low temperature sampling (down to
$\beta=32.2$) in a frustrated region of the ANNNI model magnetic phase diagram.
This bolsters the viability of current analog quantum computers for
thermodynamic sampling applications of highly frustrated magnetic spin systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现，时空纠缠(TE)作为影响矩阵(I.M.)的复杂度度量，在1d量子环路中，TE随时间呈体积级增长。通过求解随机幺正模型和界定未来与过去度分的量子纠缠，研究发现，对于较低的环境生长率，TE呈强度扩展，这反映出真正的非Markov性。然而，这种记忆仅存在于高度复杂的时间依赖性中，对简短时间间隔内的 brief temporal相关性几乎没有影响。通过精简过程改进影响矩阵，研究小组提出了测试其表现的新方案。没有潜在的错误外因干预，且研究团队从多个方向验证了其结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂量子系统中的时空纠缠及其在模拟动力学中的作用是一个重要的研究方向。通过研究TE的体积扩展性质，可以深入了解复杂量子系统的行为模式，以及改进因果模型的精度。

Method: 研究者通过精确求解随机幺正模型，界定未来与过去度分的量子纠缠，并进行多点优化计算，如拆解MPS结构，评估不同条件下的TE行为。他们还通过数值模拟，如拆解双态量子点和非双态模型，验证了结论的广泛适用性。

Result: 主要发现包括：TE在短时间区间表现出强度扩展；高阶纠缠存储了长期记忆信息；过度拆解MPS可能导致精度下降；在数值模拟中，TE的扩展性与系统复杂性相关，并且可以通过适当设计的MPS方法有效地捕捉到主动力 evolution。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解复杂量子动力学本质提供了新的视角，为开发更精确的因果模型和纠缠度量方法提供了理论依据。该结论在短时间动力学和量子纠缠复杂性研究中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a
measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a
many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently
argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law)
scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM
with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation
between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic
quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding
distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue
that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine
non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex
temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is
negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of
measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to
area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d
circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary
points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that
dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide
evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms
accurately describes local evolution.

parametrized quantum circuits for near-term applications of quantum computing.
We show that the problem of simulating some major classes of the HEA is

be efficiently represented as an HEA circuit of those classes.

*Fariba Hosseinynejad,Pavithran Iyer,Guillaume Dauphinais,David L. Feder*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: GKP states can be used to implement non-Clifford gates with linear optics and homodyne measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original work expected GKP states to be too noisy to implement non-Clifford gates, but this research shows that with the right methods, it's possible.

Method: Used Gaussian operations on normalizable GKP states and homodyne measurements to implement Clifford gates and probabilistic non-Clifford gates.

Result: A practical framework for universal quantum computing using measurement-based models with continuous variables.

Conclusion: Overcomes the noise limitation of GKP states to create a robust quantum computing method.

Abstract: Physical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are inherently noisy as ideal
ones would require infinite energy. While this is typically considered as a
deficiency to be actively corrected, this work demonstrates that imperfect GKP
stabilizer states can be leveraged in order to apply non-Clifford gates using
only linear optical elements. In particular, Gaussian operations on
normalizable GKP states, combined with homodyne measurements, permit two key
primitives: clean projection onto Pauli eigenstates in the normalizable GKP
codespace, thereby implementing Clifford gates with high fidelity; and
probabilistic projection of unmeasured modes onto non-Pauli eigenstates. These
results demonstrate that normalizable GKP stabilizer states combined with
Gaussian operations provide a practical framework for computational
universality within the measurement-based model of quantum computation in a
realistic continuous-variable setting.

Conclusion: 这个研究提供了一个基于微可控两层体系且相互作用较为简单的平台，成功构造了能够实现任意有限群双模型的Hamiltonian，Great success 的结论。

Abstract: Exactly solvable models of topologically ordered phases with non-abelian
anyons typically require complicated many-body interactions which do not
naturally appear in nature. This motivates the "inverse problem" of quantum
many-body physics: given microscopic systems with experimentally realistic
two-body interactions, how to design a Hamiltonian that realizes a desired
topological phase? Here we solve this problem on a platform motivated by
Rydberg atoms, where elementary two-level systems couple via simple blockade
interactions. Within this framework, we construct Hamiltonians that realize
topological orders described by non-abelian quantum double models. We
analytically prove the existence of topological order in the ground state, and
present efficient schemes to prepare these states. We also introduce protocols
for the controlled adiabatic braiding of anyonic excitations to probe their
non-abelian statistics. Our construction is generic and applies to quantum
doubles $\mathcal{D}(G)$ for arbitrary finite groups $G$. We illustrate
braiding for the simplest non-abelian quantum double $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$.

Motivation:  Quantum photonic networks require bright single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor quantum dots and rare-earth ions are promising candidates, but their direct combination is challenging. This research focuses on integrating Er³⁺-doped TiO₂ thin films into GaAs and GaSb substrates for quantum memories and photon sources.

Method: Low-temperature pulsed laser deposition, controlled surface preparation with arsenic and oxygen buffer layers, epitaxial TiO₂ growth at 390°C, minimal coincident interface area modeling, surface structure probing techniques like transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy.

Result: 成功的实现了Er³⁺-doped TiO₂薄膜的均匀生长，并通过靶向生长在GaAs和GaSb上。利用低表面粗糙度和单 crystals TiO₂得以保持III-V量子点的活性，促进量子记忆与光子源的集成。为可扩展的混合量子光子芯片奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 通过靶向生长策略，成功实现了III-V量子点和量子记忆的集成。

Abstract: Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright
single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor
quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while
rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer
exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these
systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to
lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate
low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films
directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an
arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of
epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface
roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature
oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough,
polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.
Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the
orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic
photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical
activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps
preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable
for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials
platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with
semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum
photonic chips.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining quantum dynamics in coupled systems is challenging and has important applications in fields like chemistry and materials science.

Method: The authors use concepts from decoherence theory, specifically pointer and preferred states, to analyze mixed quantum-classical methods like MQC.

Result: The paper shows that MQC methods can be better understood and improved by viewing them through the lens of preferred basis states, and it provides a systematic way to enhance these methods.

Conclusion: This work bridges gaps between different theories and provides a clearer understanding of when and how MQC methods work, which is valuable for both theoretical and practical advancements in quantum dynamics.

Abstract: Beyond the adiabatic regime, our understanding of quantum dynamics in coupled
systems remains limited, and the choice of representation continues to obscure
physical interpretation and simulation accuracy. Here we propose a natural and
efficient basis for electron nuclear dynamics by drawing on the concepts of
pointer and preferred states from decoherence theory, adapted to systems where
electrons and nuclei interact strongly. Within this framework, we show that 1)
the independent dynamics exploited by mixed quantum classical (MQC) methods is
best understood as a manifestation of entanglement viewed in a preferred basis,
rather than a consequence of decoherence, and 2) the adiabatic Born Oppenheimer
states satisfy the conditions of an approximate preferred basis. This
perspective reconciles widely used approximations with a more fundamental
structure of the theory and provides a systematic route to more reliable MQC
strategies. In effect, we revisit MQC methods through the lens of preferred
states, clarifying when they succeed and how they can be improved.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses the Mpemba effect in open quantum systems and introduces a method to realize both the quantum Mpemba effect and its opposite (anti-Mpemba effect) by selectively modifying system relaxation pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling relaxation processes in quantum systems is important for various applications in quantum physics and technology.

Method: The authors employ a temporary bond-dissipation quench to selectively suppress or enhance slow relaxation modes, reshaping relaxation pathways without dependence on specific system properties or initial states.

Result: The proposed method is demonstrated to be effective in systems with dephasing and boundary dissipation, and feasible cold-atom implementations are outlined.

Conclusion: This work establishes controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for quantum control, accelerated relaxation, and efficient nonequilibrium protocols.

Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a state farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than
one closer to it, is a striking phenomenon in both classical and quantum
systems. In open quantum systems, however, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME)
typically occurs only for specifically chosen initial states, which limits its
universality. Here we present a general and experimentally feasible strategy to
realize both QME and anti-QME. By applying a temporary bond-dissipation quench,
we selectively suppresses or enhances slow relaxation modes, thereby reshaping
relaxation pathways independently of both the system and the initial state. We
demonstrate this mechanism in systems with dephasing and boundary dissipation,
and outline feasible cold-atom implementations. Our results establish
controllable dissipation as a versatile tool for quantum control, accelerated
relaxation, and efficient nonequilibrium protocols.

Abstract: Topological quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) encode a variety of
topological invariants in their code space. A classic structure that has not
been encoded directly is that of obstruction classes of a fiber bundle, such as
the Chern or Euler class. Here, we construct and analyze extensions of toric
codes. We then analyze the topological structure of their errors and finally
construct a novel code using these errors to encode the obstruction class to a
fiber bundle. In so doing, we construct an encoding of characteristic classes
such as the Chern and Pontryagin class in topological QECC. An example of the
Euler class of $S^2$ is constructed explicitly.

Abstract: Accurately determining ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems
remains one of the major challenges of quantum simulation. In this work, we
present a protocol for estimating the ground-state energy using only global
time evolution under a target Hamiltonian. This avoids the need for controlled
operations that are typically required in conventional quantum phase estimation
and extends the algorithm applicability to analog simulators. Our method
extracts energy differences from measurements of the Loschmidt echo over an
initial ground-state approximation, combines them with direct energy
measurements, and solves a set of equations to infer the individual
eigenenergies. We benchmark this protocol on free-fermion systems, showing
orders-of-magnitude precision gains over direct energy measurements on the
initial state, with accuracy improving rapidly with initial-state fidelity and
persisting for hundreds of modes. We further demonstrate applicability to the
2D Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models and show that the approach extends naturally
to other observables such as order parameters. Finally, we analyze the effect
of experimental imperfections and propose error-mitigation strategies. These
results establish a practical route to compute physically relevant quantities
with high precision using globally controlled quantum simulators.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce an exact expression for the response of a
semi-classical two-level quantum system subject to arbitrary periodic driving.
Determining the transition probabilities of a two-level system driven by an
arbitrary periodic waveform necessitates numerical calculations through methods
such as Floquet theory, requiring the truncation of an infinite matrix.
However, such truncation can lead to a loss of significant interference
information, hindering quantum sensors or introducing artifacts in quantum
control. To alleviate this issue, we use the $\star$-resolvent formalism with
the path-sum theorem to determine the exact series solution to Schr\"odinger's
equation, therefore providing the exact transition probability. The resulting
series solution is generated from a compact kernel expression containing all of
the information of the periodic drive and then expanded in a non-harmonic
Fourier series basis given by the divided difference of complex exponentials
with coefficients corresponding to products of generalized Bessel functions.
The present method provides an analytical formulation for quantum sensors and
control applications.

Conclusion: 多参数量子传感器的设计方法，利用 GHZ 构架实现最优精度，同时保持测量简单和固定。

Abstract: For single-parameter sensing, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) probes
achieve optimal quantum-enhanced precision across the unknown parameter range,
solely relying on parameter-independent separable measurement strategies for
all values of the unknown parameter. However, in the multiparameter setting, a
single GHZ probe not only fails to achieve quantum advantage but also the
corresponding optimal measurement becomes complex and dependent on the unknown
parameters. Here, we provide a recipe for multiparameter sensing with GHZ
probes using quantum error correction techniques by treating all but one
unknown parameters as noise, whose effects can be corrected. This strategy
restores the core advantage of single parameter GHZ-based quantum sensing,
namely reaching optimally quantum-enhanced precision for all unknown parameter
values while keeping the measurements separable and fixed. Specifically, given
one shielded ancilla qubit per GHZ probe, our protocol extracts optimal
possible precision for any probe size. While this optimal precision is
shot-noise limited for a single GHZ probe, we recover the Heisenberg scaling
through use of multiple complementary GHZ probes. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the protocol with Bayesian estimation.

Motivation: Understanding non-Markovian processes and quantum thermodynamics, especially in systems with indefinite causal order, is key to advancing quantum technologies like quantum cooling and engines.

Method: The researchers modeled a photonic quantum setup and used numerical simulations to demonstrate the anomalous heat flow and the functioning of the Otto cycle.

Result: The system exhibits enhanced refrigeration and work generation, demonstrating the potential of indefinite causal order in quantum thermodynamics.

Conclusion: This experiment paves the way for new quantum devices leveraging indefinite causal order for enhanced thermodynamic performance.

Abstract: The principle that heat spontaneously flows from higher temperature to lower
temperature is a cornerstone of classical thermodynamics, often assumed to be
independent of the sequence of interactions. While this holds true for
macroscopic systems at equilibrium, here we show that, when the order of
interactions between two identical thermalization channels is indefinite, an
anomalous heat flow emerges, whereby heat can sometime flow from a colder
entity to a hotter one. Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design
a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves
refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum
Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which
provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.

Abstract: Quantum state discrimination, alongside its other applications, has recently
found use as a tool for witnessing generalised contextuality. In this article,
we derive noncontextuality inequalities for both conclusive and inconclusive
outcomes across various guessing strategies. For minimum- error discrimination,
the advantage is in terms of the confidences of individual outcomes, while for
unambiguous state discrimination, it is in terms of the average guessing
probability. For maximum- confidence discrimination, we show that contextual
advantages occur not only for the confidence but also their average, the
guessing probability, as well as the inconclusive outcome rate. Our results
unify the contextual advantages across all state discrimination schemes and
figures of merit. We envisage that various quantum information applications
based on state discrimination may offer advantages over non-contextual
theories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of photonic cat qubits and their potential for non-Hermitian physics applications motivates this research.

Method: The authors analyze the dephasing mechanism in cat qubits, identify asymmetric leakage, and demonstrate control over non-Hermitian dynamics by adjusting qubit amplitude and coupling two qubits.

Result: Asymmetric leakage allows the qubit to function as a controllable non-Hermitian system, enabling parity-time symmetry phase transitions and exploring entanglement through exceptional points.

Conclusion: This work challenges the traditional view of dephasing as a source of noise, opening new possibilities for controlling quantum systems through non-Hermitian effects.

Abstract: Pure dephasing is the dominant leak mechanism in photonic cat qubits because
its phase errors disrupt the parity protection, rendering the qubit vulnerable
to energy relaxation. In this manuscript, we reveal that this dephasing
mechanism conceals an interesting physical phenomenon: it induces
\textit{asymmetric leakage} from the cat-state subspace, where even- and
odd-parity cat states decay at different rates. This leak asymmetry enables the
dynamics of the system to be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, thereby
transforming the cat qubit into a platform with controllable gain and loss for
probing non-Hermitian physics. Within this platform, we demonstrate the
possibility to control the parity-time symmetry phase transition in a single
cat qubit by adjusting its amplitude. Moreover, we couple two cat qubits to
realize an entanglement phase transition induced by the exceptional point. Our
work constructs a controllable non-Hermitian system simulator, overturning the
conventional paradigm that treats dephasing as harmful noise.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes an expectation-realization interpretation of quantum superposition, where a quantum system randomly realizes into one of its possible eigenstates. It also explains that collapse, many worlds, and decoherence are unnecessary for understanding quantum superposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a clearer understanding of quantum superposition by interpreting it as an expectation over possible eigenstates.

Method: The paper compares Schrödinger's cat with its classical counterpart and uses probability theory to explain the random nature of quantum states.

Result: The paper argues that concepts such as wavefunction collapse, many worlds, and decoherence are unnecessary for understanding quantum superposition as it can be explained through the expectation-realization interpretation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the expectation-realization interpretation provides a simple and intuitive understanding of quantum superposition without relying on complex or mysterious concepts like quantum non-locality or decoherence.

Abstract: By comparing Schr\"odinger's cat with its classical counterpart, I show that
a quantum superposition should be understood as an expectation over possible
eigenstates weighted by wave-like probabilities. Upon the occurrence of a
certain event, the quantum system is randomly realized into one of the possible
eigenstates due to its intrinsic stochasticity. While the randomness of a
single realization cannot be controlled or predicted, the overall distribution
can be regulated via experimental setup and converges as the number of events
increases. A measurement is indeed an activity employing a certain event to
convert a quantum effect into a macroscopic outcome. Consequently, the puzzling
concepts of wavefunction collapse, many worlds, and decoherence become
unnecessary for understanding quantum superposition. This
expectation-realization interpretation, which integrates probability theory
with wave mechanics, can also be extended to quantum pathways. Moreover, it
reframes tests of Bell's inequalities as validating the wave-like probability
nature of quantum mechanics, with no need to invoke the mysterious notions of
quantum non-locality and "spooky action at a distance".

Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a
new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this
work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as
a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven
criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective
measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and
decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits,
MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed
states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay
gives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical
simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the
two-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we provide a
diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables
efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body
numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase
transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional Hamiltonians. Our results
highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics
and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.

Conclusion: The absence of deviation from exponential decay confirms the reliability of the experimental setup and allows precise determination of the sample lifetimes.

Abstract: In this work, we experimentally study the fluorescence decay of Acridine
Orange at late times, in order to test whether a late-time power-law behaviour
emerges, a feature expected to be very small but consistent with quantum

deviation from the exponential decay law is observed, this study serves as a
reliable test for the experimental setup and enables a precise determination of

TL;DR: A QKD protocol based on charge teleportation using LOCC on many-body ground states shows promise for practical, low-rate implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop a practical QKD protocol that can be implemented on near-term quantum computing platforms.

Method: They use charge teleportation via LOCC on entangled many-body ground states in transverse-field Ising models, both star-coupled and one-dimensional chains. The protocol is instantiated with theoretical analyses, numerical simulations, and a hardware demonstration.

Result: The protocol shows resilience to noise and quantum imperfections, performing well in simulations and hardware tests.

Conclusion: This marks a significant step in adapting quantum communication protocols for practical, error-prone environments.

Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge
teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an
entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a
local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to
energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a
single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model
imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models,
star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two
qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization,
circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify
resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes
where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results
position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible
with near-term platforms.

### [34] [Continuous matrix product operators for quantum fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04545)
*Erickson Tjoa,J. Ignacio Cirac*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We propose an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators (cMPOs) in quantum field theory, which has three key features: closed-form expression, continuum limit compatibility, and preservation of entanglement area laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop efficient representations of quantum many-body systems that capture relevant correlations without excessive computational cost. The study of matrix product operators (MPOs) in the context of quantum field theory offers a promising frameworks for these goals. The aim is to adapt successful techniques from one-dimensional lattice models to the continuum.

Method: We introduce continuous matrix product operators (cMPOs) by constructing them as limits of discrete matrix product operators. The approach involves taking a continuum limit for the matrix product operators by assuming periodic boundary conditions and imposing translation invariance. Key mathematical tools include the transfer matrix method and functional calculus.

Result: Our results include the derivation of closed-form expressions for cMPOs in terms of finite matrix-valued functions. In addition, we prove that the cMPOs preserve the entanglement area law directly in the continuum and that they preserve the structure of continuous matrix product states (cMPS) under time evolution. As a direct application, we construct families of continuous matrix product unitaries that go beyond quantum cellular automata, such as reversible gates for quantum field theories.

Conclusion: cMPOs represent an efficient way to describe and simulate quantum many-body systems described by quantum field theories. Our results demonstrate how efficient numerical techniques can be extended beyond discrete lattice models to the continuum, maintaining the favorable properties of matrix product states and operators.

Abstract: In this work we introduce an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators
for quantum field theory. We show that (i) they admit a closed-form expression
in terms of finite number of matrix-valued functions without reference to any
lattice parameter; (ii) they are obtained as a suitable continuum limit of
matrix product operators; (iii) they preserve the entanglement area law
directly in the continuum, and in particular they map continuous matrix product
states (cMPS) to another cMPS. As an application, we use this ansatz to
construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond
quantum cellular automata.

Abstract: This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to
simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of
the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In
conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances
entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced
measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit
configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and
exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of
distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an
entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime
under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be
dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit
and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant
coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among
interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through
interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside
the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing
evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by
creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity
around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that
entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single,
reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward
high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.

Conclusion: 几何变形不会影响本征能级，但对散射概率有显著影响，为基于控制曲率和扭转变换的量子体系设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Twisted cylindrical tubes are important model systems for nanostructures,
heterostructures, and curved quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the
quantum behavior of an electron confined to a twisted cylindrical surface. By
first calculating the strain tensor to obtain the induced surface metric, we
employ da Costa's formalism to derive the geometry-induced quantum potential.
This potential modifies the Schr\"odinger equation even in the absence of
external forces, allowing us to determine the bound states and energy
eigenvalues. This was made in the linear and non-linear torsion regime.
Furthermore, we analyze two distinct scattering problems: (i) scattering within
an infinite cylinder containing a twisted section, and (ii) scattering of a
free particle incident upon a finite twisted cylinder. Our goal is to
understand how geometry and strain influence the properties of analogous
untwisted systems. It turns out that both the linear and non-linear twists
yield to a geometric phase into the wave function, while the da Costa potential
is kept unchanged. Consequently, the system supports bound states whose energie
spectrum is twist independent. For both scattering problems, we find that the
transmission probability is insensitive to torsion, whereas it is significantly
affected by the particle angular momentum and the cylinder's radius, exhibiting
distinct oscillatory behavior. These findings suggest relevant implications for
engineering quantum devices based on materials with controlled curvature and
twist.

### [37] [Engineered Robustness for Nonadiabatic Geometric Quantum Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04225)
*Xuan Zhang,XIao-le Li,Jingjing Niu,Tongxing Yan,Yuanzhen Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) is proposed to enhance robustness against dynamical errors. The framework suppresses dynamical errors and achieves higher infidelity scaling of O(e⁴) compared to conventional gates. Two-qubit gates under parametric driving show limitations requiring phase compensation and waveform calibration for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies on robust gate operations, and geometric quantum gates offer potential for inherent resilience to control errors. However, practical implementations have faced challenges in achieving such resilience. This work aims to address these challenges by developing a more robust framework for geometric quantum gates.

Method: The study introduces a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) by incorporating auxiliary constraints to suppress dynamical contamination. The framework is implemented on superconducting transmon qubits, demonstrating high-fidelity single-qubit gates with infidelity scaling as O(e⁴). The research also explores two-qubit NGQGs under parametric driving and identifies limitations in their performance.

Result: The proposed NGQG framework significantly outperforms conventional dynamical gates by achieving a lower infidelity scaling of O(e⁴). However, the study reveals that two-qubit gates are more sensitive to specific parameters, such as phase differences and waveform calibration, which may limit their performance in practical applications.

Conclusion: The research advances our understanding of geometric quantum gates and provides a promising framework for constructing more robust gates. The findings emphasize the need for careful design and calibration, particularly in multi-qubit scenarios, to fully harness the potential of geometric quantum computation.

Abstract: While geometric quantum gates are often theorized to possess intrinsic
resilience to control errors by exploiting the global properties of evolution
paths, this promise has not consistently translated into practical robustness.
We present a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates
(NGQGs) that incorporates additional auxiliary constraints to suppress
dynamical contamination and achieve super-robust performance. Within this
framework, we also design NGQGs using noncyclic paths, offering enhanced design
flexibility. Implemented on superconducting transmon qubits, our scheme
realizes high-fidelity single-qubit gates that are robust against Rabi
amplitude error $\epsilon$, with infidelity scaling as
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^4)$, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$
behavior of conventional dynamical gates. We further analyze two-qubit NGQGs
under parametric driving. Our results identify subtle limitations that
compromise performance in two-qubit scenarios, underscoring the importance of
phase compensation and waveform calibration. The demonstrated simplicity and
generality of our super-robust NGQG scheme make it applicable across diverse
quantum platforms.

Result: 量子相干性随环境温度变化呈现量子相变特征，相互作用增强。

Conclusion: 温环境下的量子相干性可自主生成，且相互作用有提升作用。

Abstract: Local quantum coherence in a two-level system (TLS) is typically generated
via time-dependent driving. However, it can also emerge autonomously from
symmetry-breaking interactions between the TLS and its surrounding environment
at a low temperature. Although such environments often consist of interacting
atoms or spins, the role of interactions within the environment in generating
the autonomous local coherence has remained unexplored. Here, we address this
gap by analyzing an exactly solvable model, which comprises a target TLS
coupled to $N$ interacting source TLSs that represent the environment, with the
whole system being in thermal equilibrium. We show that the local coherence not
only persists but can be enhanced at finite temperatures of the environment
compared to the case of no inter-source interactions. The temperature
dependence of the coherence bears signatures of a quantum phase transition, and
our analytical results suggest strategies for its optimization. Our findings
reveal generic properties of the autonomously generated quantum coherence and
point to viable routes for observing the coherence at nonzero temperatures.

*Valter Uotila,Väinö Mehtola,Ilmo Salmenperä,Bo Zhao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the relationship between symmetry in quantum machine learning ansatzes and their expressibility and gate overhead. It finds that increased symmetry can reduce expressibility but may boost entanglement capability, guiding the selection of suitable ansatzes for geometric quantum machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of symmetry on quantum machine learning models is crucial for optimizing their performance, especially in geometric deep learning contexts.

Method: An automated pipeline was developed to measure symmetry-related characteristics in quantum machine learning ansatzes for various subgroup sizes. This involved comparing symmetry behavior across 19 common ansatzes and computing metrics related to symmetry, circuit depth, expressibility, and entangling capability.

Result: The study reveals that symmetry can reduce expressibility but may enhance entanglement. Practical overhead like gate count is variable across ansatzes. Selecting the right ansatz depends on the specific application requirements balancing symmetry and expressibility.

Conclusion: This work provides valuable insights for selecting quantum machine learning ansatzes with desired symmetry properties, aiding in optimizing geometric deep learning applications.

Abstract: Leveraging data symmetries has been a key driver of performance gains in
geometric deep learning and geometric and equivariant quantum machine learning.
While symmetrization appears to be a promising method, its practical overhead,
such as additional gates, reduced expressibility, and other factors, is not
well understood in quantum machine learning. In this work, we develop an
automated pipeline to measure various characteristics of quantum machine
learning ansatzes with respect to symmetries that can appear in the learning
task. We define the degree of symmetry in the learning problem as the size of
the subgroup it admits. Subgroups define partial symmetries, which have not
been extensively studied in previous research, which has focused on symmetries
defined by whole groups. Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to
these varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of
metrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying
amounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference
between the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts
depth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third
class of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results
demonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that
increased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits. In most cases,
increased symmetry increases entanglement capability. These results help select
sufficiently expressible and computationally efficient ansatze patterns for
geometric quantum machine learning applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study space-bounded communication complexity for unitary implementation in
distributed quantum processors, where we restrict the number of qubits per
processor to ensure practical relevance and technical non-triviality. We model
distributed quantum processors using distributed quantum circuits with nonlocal
two-qubit gates, defining the communication complexity of a unitary as the
minimum number of such nonlocal gates required for its realization.
  Our contributions are twofold. First, for general $n$-qubit unitaries, we
improve upon the trivial $O(4^n)$ communication bound. Considering $k$
pairwise-connected processors (each with $n/k$ data qubits and $m$ ancillas),
we prove the communication complexity satisfies $O\left(\max\{4^{(1-1/k)n - m},
n\}\right)$--for example, $O(2^n)$ when $m=0$ and $k=2$--and establish the
tightness of this upper bound. We further extend the analysis to approximation
models and general network topologies. Second, for special unitaries, we show
that both the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Clifford circuits admit
linear upper bounds on communication complexity in the exact model,
outperforming the trivial quadratic bounds applicable to these cases. In the
approximation model, QFT's communication complexity reduces drastically from
linear to logarithmic, while Clifford circuits retain a linear lower bound.
These results offer fundamental insights for optimizing communication in
distributed quantum unitary implementation, advancing the feasibility of
large-scale distributed quantum computing (DQC) systems.

Abstract: This article presents the first complete application of a quantum
time-marching algorithm for simulating multidimensional linear transport
phenomena with arbitrary boundaries, whereby the success probabilities are
problem intrinsic. The method adapts the linear combination of unitaries
algorithm to block encode the diffusive dynamics, while arbitrary boundary
conditions are enforced by the method of images only at the cost of one
additional qubit per spatial dimension. As an alternative to the non-periodic
reflection, the direct encoding of Neumann conditions by the unitary
decomposition of the discrete time-marching operator is proposed. All presented
algorithms indicate optimal success probabilities while maintaining linear time
complexity, thereby securing the practical applicability of the quantum
algorithm on fault-tolerant quantum computers. The proposed time-marching
method is demonstrated through state-vector simulations of the heat equation in
combination with Neumann, Dirichlet, and mixed boundary conditions.

Abstract: Preserving quantum correlations such as Bell nonlocality in noisy
environments remains a fundamental challenge for quantum technologies. We
introduce the Random Access Bell Game (RABG), a task where an entangled
particle propagates through a sequence of identical noisy blocks, and the
ability to violate a Bell inequality is tested at a randomly chosen point
(access node). We consider a scenario where each noisy block is composed of two
complete erasure channels, an extreme entanglement-breaking channel with
vanishing quantum and classical capacities. We investigate the performance of
the Random Access Bell Game in this configuration and attempt to mitigate the
effect of noise by coherently controlling the order of each channel in the
noise using the quantum {\tt SWITCH}. However, the quantum {\tt SWITCH} in its
canonical setup with a coherent state in the control fails to provide any
advantage in the Random Access Bell Game. Our main contribution is a protocol
that leverages initial entanglement between the target and control of the
quantum {\tt SWITCH} and employs sequential, unsharp measurements on the
control system, showing that it is possible to guarantee a Bell violation after
an arbitrarily large number of channel applications. Furthermore, our protocol
allows for a near-maximal (Tsirelson bound) Bell violation to be achieved at
any desired round, while still ensuring violations in all preceding rounds. We
prove that this advantage is specific to generalized
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, as the protocol fails for W-class
states, thus providing an operational way to distinguish between these two
fundamental classes of multipartite entanglement.

study, quasiprobabilities and the associated concept of nonclassicality are

significantly alter the assessment of which states are deemed classical.
Notions, such as Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and s-parametrized
quasiprobabilities in quantum optics, are generalized by our approach.

schemes, together with the resulting quasiprobabilities and set of nonclassical

Abstract: We investigate the implementation of photonic cluster state generation
protocols using quantum metasurfaces comprising sub-wavelength atomic arrays
which enables quantum-controlled reflectivity. These cluster states are
generated using fundamental quantum logic gates and enable wide-ranging
applications in quantum computation and communication. In the past few years,
certain protocols have been developed, but their physical realizations induces
natural losses on the system mainly originated from coupling the photonic
structures, setting a limit on the efficiency and maximal qubit number. In this
paper, we examine a physical implementation of two specific protocols for
generating distinct cluster states: a two-dimensional cluster state and a tree
cluster state. Our approach leverages the unique properties of a quantum
metasurface and its free space settings to implement two-qubit quantum-logic
gates, namely CNOT, CZ, and E gates, with practical fidelities exceeding 0.9,
and potential speed-up due to parallelism. In addition, we analyze these
protocols fidelities for practical conditions of potential implementation
experiments, such as thermal fluctuation of trapped atoms.

Abstract: We study phase-synchronization in a driven two-level system coupled to a
non-Markovian bosonic reservoir. The dynamics is described by treating the
system-bath coupling and the coherent drive without invoking the rotating-wave
approximation, and simulated using the numerically exact hierarchical equations
of motion. We observe that a robust phase-locking develops and that the
corresponding synchronization measure rapidly acquires a finite value when the
system is tuned to what we identify as a resonant-ratio condition, namely when
the ratio between the drive amplitude and its frequency coincides with a zero
of the Bessel function $J_0$. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon by
means of a static approximation derived from a Fourier analysis of the
periodically driven Hamiltonian.

rely on dynamical phase accumulation. We theoretically demonstrate two- and
multi-qubit phase gates in a neutral atom architecture, relying on a double
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (double-STIRAP) pulse sequence that imprints
a controllable geometric phase on the qubit systems. The system is designed in
such a way that every atom is individually addressable, and moreover, no extra
laser is required to be applied on the target atom while scaling up the system
from two- to multi-qubit quantum gates. The gate fidelity has been numerically
analyzed by changing the gate operation time, and we find that 98% to 99%
fidelity can be achieved for gate time $\simeq$ 0.6 $\mu$s. We perform a
systematic error analysis, which re- veals that our proposed gates can exhibit
strong resilience against fluctuations in Rabi frequencies, finite blockade
strength, and atomic position variations. These results establish our approach
as a physically feasible and scalable pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum
computation with neutral atoms. We simulate Grover's search algorithm for two-,
three-, and four-qubit systems with high success probability and thereby
demonstrate the utility and scalability of our proposed gates for quantum
computation.

Conclusion: 该论文的成功展示了通过利用对称性设计高效测量协议的可能性，为量子计算未来的发展提供了有价值的思路。

Abstract: Protocols for quantum measurement are an essential part of quantum computing.
Measurements are no longer confined to the final step of computation but are
increasingly embedded within quantum circuits as integral components of
noise-resilient algorithms. However, each observable typically requires a
distinct measurement basis, often demanding a different circuit configuration.
As the number of such configurations typically grows with the number of qubits,
different measurement configurations constitute a major bottleneck. Focusing on
electronic structure calculations in crystalline systems, we propose a
measurement protocol that maximally reduces the number of measurement settings
to just three, independent of the number of qubits. This makes it one of the
few known protocols that do not scale with qubit number. In particular, we
derive the measurement protocol from the symmetries of tight-binding (TB)
Hamiltonians and implement it within the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD)
algorithm. We demonstrate its performance on two systems, namely a
two-dimensional CuO$_2$ square lattice (3 qubits) and bilayer graphene (4
qubits). The protocol can be generalized to more complex many-body Hamiltonians
with high symmetry, providing a potential path toward future demonstrations of
quantum advantage.

Motivation: Improving qubit control reliability for better quantum computing performance.

Method: Innovated active thermal stabilization of critical analog circuits, implemented 15 microwave channels for stability monitoring.

Result: Amplitude and phase stability with low standard deviations; quantum gate infidelity below fault-tolerance thresholds.

Conclusion: QuEL-1 SE provides reliable long-duration qubit operations, scalable for future quantum applications.

Abstract: We present the design and performance of QuEL-1 SE, which is a multichannel
qubit controller developed for superconducting qubits. The system incorporates
the active thermal stabilization of critical analog integrated circuits, such
as phase-locked loops, amplifiers, and mixers, to suppress the long-term
amplitude and phase drift. To evaluate the amplitude and phase stability, we
simultaneously monitor 15 microwave output channels over 24 h using a common
analog-to-digital converter. Across the channels, the normalized amplitude
exhibits standard deviations of 0.09\%--0.22\% (mean: 0.15\%), and the phase
deviations are 0.35$^\circ$--0.44$^\circ$ (mean: 0.39$^\circ$). We further
assess the impact of these deviations on quantum gate operations by estimating
the average fidelity of an $X_{\pi/2}$ gate under the coherent errors
corresponding to the deviations. The resulting gate infidelities are $2\times
10^{-6}$ for amplitude errors and $2\times 10^{-5}$ for phase errors, which are
significantly lower than typical fault-tolerance thresholds such as those of
the surface code. These results demonstrate that the amplitude and phase
stability of QuEL-1 SE enables reliable long-duration quantum operations, thus
highlighting its utility as a scalable control platform for superconducting and
other qubit modalities.

### [50] [Tight Analysis of a Grover-based Quantum Secret Sharing Scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04399)
*Santanu Majhi,Debajyoti Bera*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum secret-sharing framework designed to operate over public channels without multiple rounds for eavesdropping detection. The original protocol is improved for enhanced eavesdropping resistance, but full security against eavesdropping is not achievable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of designing quantum secret-sharing protocols that can function over public channels without the need for multiple rounds to detect eavesdropping. Ensuring security against eavesdropping is critical in quantum communication, as traditional methods often rely on secure channels which may not always be feasible.

Method: The paper focuses on analyzing and enhancing a quantum secret-sharing framework proposed by Hsu (2003). It characterizes the correctness and security properties of the framework, identifies vulnerabilities, and improves the protocol to mitigate eavesdropping risks. The analysis likely involves quantum information theory and security proofs in a quantum communication setting.

Result: The key findings include the successful characterization of the framework's properties, the enhancement of the protocol to better resist eavesdropping, and the demonstration that complete security against eavesdropping is not achievable within the framework. These results contribute to advancing quantum communication security protocols.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while significant progress has been made in enhancing quantum secret-sharing protocols over public channels, achieving full security against all potential eavesdropped attacks remains an open challenge. Future research may need to explore alternative approaches or relax certain assumptions to overcome these limitations.

Abstract: Secret-sharing schemes allow a dealer to split a secret into multiple
"shares" and distribute them individually among many parties while mandating
certain constraints on its reconstruction. Such protocols are usually executed
over a secure communication channel since an eavesdropper, after intercepting
all the shares, is expected to be able to reconstruct the secret. Leveraging
the unique properties of quantum channels, several quantum protocols have been
designed for secret sharing. However, almost all of them detect the presence of
an eavesdropper by statistical analysis of the outcome of multiple rounds, or
simply require a secure channel of communication.
  We present a complete characterisation of the correctness and security
properties of a quantum-search based secret-sharing framework proposed by Hsu
(2003). The scheme was designed to work over public channels without requiring
multiple rounds to detect eavesdropping. Our characterisation allowed us to
improve the original protocol to be more resistant towards eavesdropping.
However, we prove that complete security against an eavesdropper is not
possible in this framework.

Conclusion: 量化数据隐藏的潜在能力依赖于资源类型与可用数量。可分态编码方案具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Quantum data hiding stores classical information in bipartite quantum states
that are, in principle, perfectly distinguishable, yet remain almost
indistinguishable without access to a quantum communication channel. Here, we
investigate whether this limitation can be overcome when the communicating
parties are assisted by additional quantum resources. We develop a general
framework for state discrimination that unifies catalytic and memory-assisted
local discrimination protocols and analyze their power to reveal hidden
information. We prove that when the hiding states are separable, neither
entangled catalysts nor quantum memory can increase the optimal discrimination
probability, establishing the robustness of separable data-hiding schemes. In
contrast, for some entangled states, a reusable quantum memory turns locally
indistinguishable states into ones that can be discriminated almost perfectly.
Our results delineate the fundamental limits of catalytic and memory-assisted
state discrimination and identify separable encodings as a robust strategy for
quantum data hiding.

Abstract: The notions of privacy tests and $k$-extendible states have both been
instrumental in quantum information theory, particularly in understanding the
limits of secure communication. In this paper, we determine the maximum
probability with which an arbitrary $k$-extendible state can pass a privacy
test, and we prove that it is equal to the maximum fidelity between an
arbitrary $k$-extendible state and the standard maximally entangled state. Our
findings, coupled with the resource theory of $k$-unextendibility, lead to an
efficiently computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable key of
a bipartite state, and we prove that it is equal to the best-known efficiently
computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable entanglement. We
also establish efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot,
forward-assisted private capacity of channels. Extending our formalism to the
independent and identically distributed setting, we obtain single-letter
efficiently computable bounds on the $n$-shot, one-way distillable key of a
state and the $n$-shot, forward-assisted private capacity of a channel. For
some key examples of interest, our bounds are significantly tighter than other
known efficiently computable bounds.

Abstract: Determining the conditions under which positive operator-valued measures
(POVMs), the most general class of quantum measurements, outperform projective
measurements remains a challenging and largely unresolved problem. Of
particular interest are projectively simulable POVMs, which can be realized
through probabilistic mixtures of projective measurements, and therefore offer
no advantage over projective schemes. Characterizing the boundary between
simulable and non-simulable POVMs is, however, a difficult task, and existing
tools either fail to scale efficiently, provide limited experimental
feasibility or work only for specific POVMs. Here, we introduce and demonstrate
a general method to certify non-simulability of a POVM by introducing a
hierarchy of semidefinite programs. It provides upper bounds on the
non-simulability measure of critical visibility of arbitrary POVMs which are
tight in many cases and outperform previously known criteria. We experimentally
certify the non-simulability of two- and three-dimensional POVMs using a
trapped-ion qudit quantum processor by constructing non-simulability witnesses
and introduce a modification of our framework that makes them robust against
state preparation errors. Finally, we extend our results to the setting where
an additional ancilla system is available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid generation of long-range entanglement is a key challenge in quantum networking, and this work presents a hybrid architecture to address this issue.

Method: The hybrid architecture combines trapped-ion systems with parametric down-conversion sources. It matches the bandwidth mismatch between photons to enable parallel probabilistic tasks and speed up entanglement creation.

Result: The approach achieves a significant speed-up, particularly for creating ion-ion entanglement over hundreds of kilometers.

Conclusion: This hybrid design effectively leverages the strengths of trapped-ion systems and parametric down-conversion sources to overcome the bottleneck of slow entanglement generation, paving the way for more efficient quantum networks.

Abstract: Different quantum systems possess different favorable qualities. On the one
hand, ensemble-based quantum memories are suited for fast multiplexed
long-range entanglement generation. On the other hand, single-atomic systems
provide access to gates for processing of information. Both of those can
provide advantages for high-rate entanglement generation within quantum
networks. We develop a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of these
properties by combining trapped-ion nodes and nodes comprised of spontaneous
parametric down conversion photon pair sources and absorptive memories based on
rare-earth ion ensembles. To this end, we solve the central challenge of
matching the different bandwidths of photons emitted by those systems in an
initial entanglement-generation step. This enables the parallel execution of
multiple probabilistic tasks in the initial stage. We show that our approach
can lead to a significant speed-up for the fundamental task of creating ion-ion
entanglement over hundreds of kilometers in a quantum network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency of solving complex optimization problems like LABS is crucial, especially with emerging quantum computing technologies.

Method: QE-MTS combines classical memetic tabu search with quantum digitized counterdiabatic optimization to generate high-quality initial states.

Result: QE-MTS achieves O(1.24^N) scaling, surpassing classical O(1.34^N) and quantum O(1.46^N) algorithms with reduced circuit depth, and shows superiority at N >= 47.

Conclusion: This is evidence that quantum enhancement can directly improve classical algorithm scaling for significant problems.

Abstract: We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational
hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the
low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical
MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum
optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution
scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \in [27,37]$. This
scaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and
improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\times$ reduction in circuit
depth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and
projects a crossover point at $N \gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms
its classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum
enhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization
algorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing availability of NISQ devices has made experimenting with quantum-classical hybrid algorithms feasible, but current tools often lack flexibility or require extensive scripting. There is a need for a framework that simplifies and streamlines this process while enabling systematic exploration and evaluation.

Method: QEF is designed to support iterative, exploratory analysis by focusing on evolving experimental strategies rather than fixed algorithm evaluation. It captures key quantum software parameters through a concise specification that allows for large-scale parameter sweeps, automatically handles job partitioning across simulators or cloud hardware, and supports parameter reuse and comprehensive traceability. The framework's design is informed by comprehensive literature review, focusing on principal parameters and measurement practices in the field.

Result: QEF enables systematic and efficient evaluation of quantum algorithms by addressing the shortcomings of current tools, thereby lowering the barriers for empirical research on quantum systems, both for NISQ devices and future systems.

Conclusion: QEF represents a significant advancement in the practical implementation of quantum algorithm research, offering a flexible and scalable solution that enhances reproducibility and efficiency without the complexity of full workflow engines.

Abstract: Commercially available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices now
make small hybrid quantum-classical experiments practical, but many tools hide
configuration or demand ad-hoc scripting.
  We introduce the Quantum Experiment Framework (QEF): A lightweight framework
designed to support the systematic, hypothesis-driven study of quantum

exploratory analysis of evolving experimental strategies rather than exhaustive
empirical evaluation of fixed algorithms using predefined quality metrics. The
framework's design is informed by a comprehensive review of the literature,
identifying principal parameters and measurement practices currently reported
in the field.
  QEF captures all key aspects of quantum software and algorithm experiments
through a concise specification that expands into a Cartesian product of
variants for controlled large-scale parameter sweeps. This design enables
rigorous and systematic evaluation, as well as precise reproducibility. Large
sweeps are automatically partitioned into asynchronous jobs across simulators
or cloud hardware, and ascertain full hyper-parameter traceability. QEF
supports parameter reuse to improve overall experiment runtimes, and collects
all metrics and metadata into a form that can be conveniently explored with
standard statistical and visualisation software.
  By combining reproducibility and scalability while avoiding the complexities
of full workflow engines, QEF seeks to lower the practical barriers to
empirical research on quantum algorithms, whether these are designed for
current NISQ devices or future error-corrected quantum systems.

TL;DR: Homodyne检测是一种相位敏感的测量技术，用于量子态的连续变量（CV）编码。它可以用于实现CV量子信息协议，并且通常在室温下工作。然而，进行高速量子信息处理仍是一个主要挑战，因为基于芯片的同相 detectors通常难以耐受高频脉冲操作。我们设计了覆盖近红外（NIR）和 telecom波段的宽频同相检测器，最高可处理150 MHz的脉冲率。我们实现了本地探测器的高性能，并通过 telecom波长的压缩态光脉冲的脉冲状结构和多模式光谱特征的维持，展示了其性能。

Abstract: Homodyne detection is a phase-sensitive measurement technique, essential for
the characterization of continuous-variable (CV)-encoded quantum states of
light. It is a key component to the implementation of CV quantum-information
protocols and benefits from operating, by design, at room temperature. However,
performing high-speed quantum information processing remains a major challenge,
as conventional homodyne detectors often fail to sustain pulsed operation at
high repetition rates due to electronic limitations. We present wideband
homodyne detectors operating at near-infrared (NIR) and telecom wavelengths,
with optimized performance at repetition rates up to 150 MHz. We demonstrate
their performance by resolving the pulse-by-pulse structure of squeezed states

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The research examines the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) bunching and antibunching effects, analyzing how the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ determines these quantum phenomena. The study demonstrates that by modulating biphoton states using spectral phase modulation, one can switch between bunching and antibunching. The relationship between $D_S$ and the modulated states is linked to the Schmidt number and exhibits peaks and dips corresponding to these quantum states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work delves into quantum optics phenomena, specifically examining how symmetry and entanglement in biphoton states can be manipulated to observe and switch between HOM bunching and antibunching effects. The motivation stems from the potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum state engineering.

Method: The researchers employed theoretically derived expressions to calculate the symmetry degree $D_S$ for modulated biphoton states. They utilized the Schmidt number as a function of the modulation parameter to analyze the transitions between bunching and antibunching states. Experimental adjustments in path length allowed for fine-tuned spectral phase modulation, enabling the observation of these transitions.

Result: The findings reveal that the Schmidt number exhibits a dependence on the modulation parameter, showing characteristic peaks and dips. These features are directly correlated with the symmetry degree $D_S$, which governs the HOM antibunching and bunching effects. The modulation technique effectively controls the quantum state transitions between bunching and antibunching, providing a practical means for their experimental observation.

Conclusion: By utilizing spectral phase modulation on biphoton states, the researchers successfully demonstrated the switchability between HOM bunching and antibunching. This advancement offers a promising approach for quantum communication and information processing, particularly in the manipulation of entangled photon pairs.

Abstract: We investigate into experimentally detectable effects such as the
Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) bunching and antibunching. These regimes can be
characterized using the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ that enters the
two-photon coincidence probability $P_{2c}=(1-D_S)/2$. In the case of HOM
bunching (antibunching), $D_S$ is positive (negative). Though the symmetry
degree can generally be expressed in terms of the difference between the
contributions coming from the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the biphoton
joint spectral amplitude (JSA), $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$, for a certain
physically realizable class of the JSA, where $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ is
proportional to the product of amplitudes
$\varphi_1(\omega_1)\varphi_2(\omega_2)$ multiplied by a Gaussian shaped
entangling factor, we find the sign of $D_S$ is primarily governed by the
parity properties of the spectral function,
$\varphi_{12}(\omega)=\varphi_1(\omega)\varphi_2^*(\omega)$. It is the even
(odd) part of $\varphi_{12}=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}+\varphi_{12}^{(-)}$ that meets
the parity condition
$\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\omega-\Omega)=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\Omega-\omega)$
($\varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\omega-\Omega)=- \varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\Omega-\omega)$) to
yield the positive (negative) contribution, $D_S^{(+)}$ ($-D_S^{(-)}$), to the
symmetry degree parameter: $D_S=D_S^{(+)}-D_S^{(-)}$. We have shown that
switching between the bunching and antibunching regimes can be realized using
the experimentally accessible family of modulated biphoton states produced
using the spectral phase modulation fine-tuned via the sub-nanometer scale
variation of the path length. For this class of modulated states, the Schmidt
number has been computed as a function of the modulation parameter. This
dependence reveals the structure of narrow resonance peaks strongly correlated
with the corresponding narrow dips of the symmetry degree where the HOM
antibunching occurs.

TL;DR: Canopus reduces routing overhead by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art methods for various ISAs and topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving qubit mapping and routing in quantum compilation to reduce circuit overhead is crucial as quantum supremacy advances, necessitating more efficient methods.

Method: Propose a unified framework, Canopus, leveraging two-qubit canonical representations and monodromy polytope for optimized SWAP insertion, combined with formalized commutation relations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Canopus reduces routing overhead by 15-35% across diverse ISAs and topologies.

Conclusion: Canopus represents a scalable, efficient solution for quantum circuit compilation, particularly beneficial for future quantum hardware with advanced ISAs.

Abstract: Qubit mapping/routing is a critical stage in compilation for both near-term
and fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet existing scalable methods typically
impose several times the routing overhead in terms of circuit depth or
duration. This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely
on an abstract routing model (e.g., three-$ \mathrm{CX} $-unrolled SWAP
insertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported
by physical devices.
  Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of
diverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard
$\mathrm{CX}$-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as
$\mathrm{\sqrt{iSWAP}}$ and $\mathrm{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates offer superior circuit
synthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However,
systematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are
lacking.
  To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing
framework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical
representation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform
deep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit
canonical representation and the monodromy polytope to model the synthesis cost
for more intelligent $ \mathrm{SWAP} $ insertion during the routing stage. We
also formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the
canonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based
optimizations. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing
overhead by 15\%-35\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across different
ISAs and topologies. Our work also presents a coherent method for
co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.

Method: The authors propose using Coset states, a method primarily employed in Unclonable Cryptography, to prove the security of their cryptosystems. They also build upon a Quantum oracle model and standard model constructions, adapting these to minimize Quantum secret key sizes while ensuring robust security.

Result: The paper presents a significant improvement in Quantum cryptography by achieving smaller Quantum secret keys for one-shot signatures. Specifically, they reach asymptotically optimal key sizes in certain scenarios, demonstrating the practicality of their approach in reducing storage requirements while maintaining cryptographic security.

Conclusion: This work advances Quantum cryptography by offering efficient solutions to the challenge of minimizing Quantum memory usage in signing primitives. By leveraging Coset states and novel security proofs, the authors pave the way for more practical and secure Quantum cryptographic systems that can be implemented with reduced Quantum memory demands. Their findings open new avenues for future research in developing Quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols.

Abstract: Quantum cryptography is a rapidly-developing area which leverages quantum
information to accomplish classically-impossible tasks. In many of these
protocols, quantum states are used as long-term cryptographic keys. Typically,
this is to ensure the keys cannot be copied by an adversary, owing to the
quantum no-cloning theorem. Unfortunately, due to quantum state's tendency to
decohere, persistent quantum memory will likely be one of the most challenging
resources for quantum computers. As such, it will be important to minimize
persistent memory in quantum protocols.
  In this work, we consider the case of one-shot signatures (OSS), and more
general quantum signing tokens. These are important unclonable primitives,
where quantum signing keys allow for signing a single message but not two.
Naturally, these quantum signing keys would require storage in long-term
quantum memory. Very recently, the first OSS was constructed in a classical
oracle model and also in the standard model, but we observe that the quantum
memory required for these protocols is quite large. In this work, we
significantly decrease the quantum secret key size, in some cases achieving
asymptotically optimal size. To do so, we develop novel techniques for proving
the security of cryptosystems using coset states, which are one of the main
tools used in unclonable cryptography.

Abstract: We propose a method for modifying orthogonal sparse matrix pairs used in CSS
codes while preserving their matrix row and column weight distributions, which
play a crucial role in determining the performance of belief-propagation
decoding. Unlike simple row or column permutations that merely reorder existing
elements, the proposed local modification introduces genuine structural
randomness through small $2\times2$ cross-swap operations followed by
integer-linear-program-based local repairs that restore orthogonality. By
applying this procedure repeatedly in a random manner, ensembles of randomized
quantum LDPC codes can be constructed. The computational complexity of each
repair depends only on the maximum row and column weights and is independent of
the overall matrix size, ensuring scalability to large code blocks.

Abstract: Interactions between quantum systems enable quantum gates, the building
blocks of quantum information processing. In photonics, direct photon-photon
interactions are too weak to be practically useful, so effective interactions
are engineered with linear optics and measurement. A central challenge is to
realize such interactions non-locally, i.e., between photons that remain
spatially separated. We present experimental proposals for several essential
non-local multiphoton quantum gates that act on spatially separated photons, in
both qubit and high-dimensional qudit systems. All solutions were discovered by
the AI-driven discovery system called PyTheus. Rather than using pre-shared
entanglement or Bell state measurements, our gates use as a resource quantum
indistinguishability by path identity - a technique that exploits coherent
superpositions of the photon pair origins. While analyzing these solutions, we
uncovered a new mechanism that mimics much of the properties of quantum
teleportation, without shared entanglement or Bell state measurements.
Technically, our results establish path indistinguishability as a practical
resource for distributed quantum information processing; conceptually, they
demonstrate how automated discovery systems can contribute new ideas and
techniques in physics.

Abstract: The Whittaker-Shannon decomposition provides a temporally localized
description of squeezed light, making it applicable in the CW limit and leading
to a definition of squeezing strength based on the number of photon pairs at a
time. We show examples of its usefulness by calculating quadrature variance in
a homodyne detection scheme, coincidence detection probabilities in the
continuous-wave limit, and analyzing the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect for strongly
squeezed light. Quadrature uncertainty falls farther below the shot noise limit
when squeezing is strong, but effects due to correlations between photon pairs
are most significant with weak squeezing. Our analysis extends previous results
to more general scenarios, and we leverage the Whittaker-Shannon formalism to
interpret them based on the temporal properties of photon pairs.

Abstract: In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum
Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in
\{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the
hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a
quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight
$O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound.
  We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a
subset $\cal{Q} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S =
b$ for an arbitrary $S \in \cal{Q}$ and $b \in \{-1,1\}^S$ of its choice, at
unit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\cal{Q}$ is any of the following
collections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full
set.
  All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using
symmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of
learning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization
program, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd
functions $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$
to the maximum (over $T \in \cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube
whose free variables are exactly $T$.'
  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal
version of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program
typically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds
without explicitly resorting to SDP duality.

Abstract: Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state
in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a
Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the
Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity
and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence
between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify
dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To
illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group
manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and
integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses
to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice
model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded
lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example
illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of
complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.

Abstract: We discuss a new formula for the symplectic structure on the phase space of
open string field theory. Revisiting the setup of Cho, Mazel, and Yin, we use
the formula to compute the energy of rolling tachyon solutions on unstable
D-branes. An important aspect of the analysis is dealing with the singular
ultraviolet behavior of string vertices in Lorentzian signature, a feature we
refer to as transgressive locality. This forces us to carry out computations in
momentum space, where time and causality are somewhat obscure. Nevertheless the
symplectic structure appears to be sensible, giving results in agreement with
boundary state computations. As further confirmation of our methods, we study
the symplectic structure for rolling tachyons in scalar effective field theory,
where vertices show similar high energy behavior to string field theory but the
physics is that of local field theory. This model gives interesting insight
into the runaway oscillations of the rolling tachyon.

Conclusion: 通过双倍SYK模型研究了dS₂空间中的 holographic 熵，并验证了 Ryu-Takayanagi 公式的适用性，同时揭示了Krylov复杂性与熵之间的联系。

Abstract: We investigate entanglement entropy in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model,
its holographic interpretation in terms of edge modes (acting as quantum
reference frames); particularly its de Sitter (dS) space limit; and its
connection with Krylov complexity. We define subsystems relative to a particle
insertion in the boundary theory. This leads to a natural notion of partial
trace and reduced density matrices. The corresponding entanglement entropy
takes the form of a generalized horizon entropy in the bulk dual; revealing the
emergence of edge modes in the entangling surfaces. We match the entanglement
entropy of the DSSYK in an appropriate limit to an area computed through a
\emph{Ryu-Takayanagi formula} in dS$_2$ space with entangling surfaces at
$\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$; providing a first principles example of holographic
entanglement entropy for dS$_2$ space. This formula reproduces the
Gibbons-Hawking entropy for specific entangling regions points; while it
decreases for others. This construction does not display some of the puzzling
features in dS holography. The entanglement entropy remains real-valued (since
the boundary theory is unitary), and it depends on Krylov state complexity in
this limit.

Abstract: We consider a de Sitter observer in his rest frame at late times who observes
a particle slightly displaced from unstable equilibrium. Initially, the
observer notices an axisymmetric and parity-violating deformation along the
trajectory of the displaced particle of his cosmological horizon. On a time
scale of order $\ell$, the de Sitter radius, the particle is nearly absorbed by
the cosmological horizon and has been accelerated to an ultra-relativistic
speed and thus is well approximated as a shock wave. In the shock wave limit,
the observer sees an axisymmetric deformation of his horizon with parity
restored, which we interpret as arising due to a particle from the
complementary static patch. We comment on the holographic implications of this
result and note that there is no need to extend the holographic screen of de
Sitter spacetime beyond the empty static patch to account for this signal.

Abstract: We describe a holographic mechanism for black hole formation via the
collision of two shockwaves in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In
the dual conformal field theory (CFT), a two-shockwave state corresponds to the
insertion of two boosted precursor operators in complementary Rindler patches.
Their operator product expansion is initially described by a universal mean
field spectrum of exchanged states, which is dominated by operator dimensions
that grow exponentially in the boost parameter. We propose their mean value as
diagnosing the mass of the collision product in the bulk. It crosses the CFT
heavy state threshold after two scrambling times, in accordance with
expectations about black hole formation in general relativity. Our analysis
also allows us to identify the scrambling characteristics usually associated
with out-of-time-order correlation functions, using only the internal
composition of thermal in-time-order correlators.

Abstract: We introduce and study a class of two-dimensional integrable quantum field
theories that carry an internal $\mathbb{Z}_n$ structure. These models extend
factorised scattering beyond the conventional framework, featuring both the
usual hierarchy of integer-spin conserved charges and an additional tower of
fractional-spin ones. Our construction relies on a reparametrisation of
rapidity space that lifts standard scattering amplitudes to a multiplet related
by an internal cyclic symmetry. This construction is naturally embedded within
a generalised Gibbs ensemble, which provides the natural framework for a
consistent graded Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. This leads to new Y-systems
encoding the graded spectrum. In a special case, these functional relations
match those obtained via the ODE/IM correspondence from the monodromy analysis
of the quantum cubic oscillator. Even in the simplest models, for one sign of
the auxiliary temperature, the finite-volume ground-state energy spectrum
undergoes an infinite sequence of level-crossing phenomena as the coupling
strength increases. A preliminary analysis also suggests that these theories
exhibit structural connections with cyclic orbifolds. Within this setup, one
can consistently include extra CDD factors that realise fractional-spin
analogues of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. In analytically tractable cases, a
Hagedorn-like behaviour is observed for a sign of the flow parameter, and the
deformed spectrum develops a finite limiting temperature.

TL;DR: This paper addresses a long-standing problem in string theory by proposing novel dynamical duality-sequences that naturally construct de Sitter and quasi de Sitter configurations, avoiding late-time singularities. The positive dark energy arises from Borel resummation of Gevrey series in path-integral formulations, with precise methods given for handling equations of motion, Bianchi identities, flux quantizations, and anomaly cancellations within the SO(32) and E_8 x E_8 theories. The approach incorporates both perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. Notably, the temporally varying dark energy simplifies computations, offering a consistent framework for embedding four-dimensional Standard Model physics at late times in a realistic gravitational background with positive dark energy from string theory. This provides a promising starting point for understanding dark energy in the context of string theory solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark energy has been a major unsolved problem in theoretical physics, and this paper attempts to reconcile it with string theory, offering a framework for constructing realistic cosmological models that avoid singularities and provide a consistent embedding of the Standard Model.

Method: The authors propose dynamical duality-sequences within both E_8 x E_8 and SO(32) heterotic string theories. They use Borel resummation of Gevrey series from path-integral representations to derive solutions with positive, possibly slowly varying dark energy. They also detail systematic methods for handling equations of motion, Bianchi identities, flux quantizations, and anomaly cancellations, incorporating both perturbative and non-perturbative corrections in the far infrared.

Result: The paper successfully constructs de Sitter and quasi de Sitter configurations free of late-time singularities. Dark energy emerges naturally from the formalism, and the framework provides a consistent way to embed four-dimensional Standard Model physics in a realistic gravitational background. The temporally varying dark energy simplifies key computations, marking a significant step forward in string theory's role in cosmology.

Conclusion: This work represents a substantial advancement in string theory applications to cosmology, particularly in addressing dark energy within a consistent framework. The proposed models and methods offer a promising avenue for future research in string-phenomenology and cosmology.

Abstract: One of the long-standing puzzles in string theory has been on the existence
of a four-dimensional de Sitter and quasi de Sitter configurations, the latter
being defined with a temporally varying dark energy, in E_8 x E_8 and SO(32)
heterotic theories. In this work, novel dynamical duality-sequences are devised
that provide natural constructions of de Sitter and quasi de Sitter excited
states in the aforementioned theories allowing no late-time singularities. The
emergent positive dark energies -- including the intriguing possibility of
their slow temporal variations -- appear from Borel resumming Gevrey series
from the path-integral representations of such states. Additionally, precise
ways to handle the equations of motion, Bianchi identities, flux quantizations
and anomaly cancellations -- consistent with the underlying axionic cosmology
and with the probability of forming wormholes that connect baby universes --
are presented for the SO(32) and the E_8 x E_8 theories within a framework that
systematically incorporates perturbative and non-perturbative corrections in
the far infrared. The temporally varying dark energy, which is much more
natural in our set-up because of its emergent nature, surprisingly simplifies
many of the aforementioned computations. Interestingly, our analysis also
provides, probably for the first time, a set-up to consistently embed
four-dimensional standard model degrees of freedom at late time in a realistic
gravitational background with positive dark energy from string theory.

Abstract: The thermodynamics of de Sitter black holes is complicated by the presence of
two horizons and the absence of a globally defined timelike Killing vector. The
standard choice of the Gibbons-Hawking Killing vector is at odds with the
interpretation of the surface gravity as an acceleration measured by a physical
observer at rest. Focusing on four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter
black holes we show that this issue can be resolved by adopting a normalization
originally proposed by Bousso and Hawking, which defines thermodynamic
quantities relative to the unique freely-falling observer at a fixed radial
coordinate. Within this framework, we derive new first laws for the black hole
and cosmological horizon and re-examine the black hole's heat capacity. We find
that the heat capacity remains finite in the near-extremal Nariai limit, thus
averting a breakdown of the semi-classical thermodynamic description. However,
the heat capacity does vanish in the cold limit, as expected, and for Nariai
black holes in the ultracold limit, indicating that fundamental limitations on
the statistical description persist in these regimes. We discuss the
implications of our results for log-$T$ corrections to near-extremal de Sitter
black holes.

Abstract: Just as linearized perturbations of time-independent configurations can be
decomposed into normal modes, those of periodic systems can be decomposed into
Floquet modes, which each evolve by a fixed phase over one period. We show that
in the case of a (1+1)-dimensional relativistic field theory with a single
scalar of mass $m$, all breathers, quasi-breathers and oscillons of length
$1/\epsilon$ have identical nonrelativistic Floquet modes at leading order in
an $\epsilon/m$ expansion. More precisely, these Floquet modes depend only on
$\epsilon$ and $m$, and are independent of the potential of the theory. In
particular, there is a continuum of Floquet modes corresponding to each real
momentum plus four discrete modes corresponding to space translations, time
translations, boosts and amplitude changes. There are no discrete shape modes.
We provide simple, explicit formulas for these universal leading-order,
nonrelativistic Floquet modes.

Abstract: Recently, a potential for string backgrounds is obtained from string geometry
theory, which is a candidate for the non-perturbative formulation of string
theory. By substituting a string phenomenological model with free parameters to
the potential, one obtains a potential for the free parameters, whose minimum
determines the free parameters. The model with the determined parameters is the
ground state in the model. This will be the local minimum in a partial region
of the model in the string theory landscape. By comparing it with the other
local minimum, one can determine which model is near the minimum of the
potential for string backgrounds, that will be the true vacuum in string
theory, in the sense of the values of the potential. We will be able to find
the true vacuum in string theory through a series of such researches. In this
paper, we perform this analysis of a certain simple heterotic
non-supersymmetric model explicitly, where the six-dimensional internal spaces
are products of two-dimensional spaces of constant curvatures, and the
generation number of massless fermions is given by the flux quantization
numbers. As a result, we obtain a constraint between the compactification scale
and the flux quanta.

Abstract: The principle of self-consistency of the quantum vacuum postulates that the
classical backgrounds we observe -- spacetime, gauge fields, and the Higgs
condensate -- are macroscopic order parameters of a single quantum state
sustained by its own fluctuations. Building on this postulate, a
background-field, heat-kernel based derivation is developed that yields the
coupled low-energy effective field equations for the metric, gauge, and Higgs
fields as vacuum "equations of state." The framework rigorously recovers the
Einstein, Yang-Mills, and Higgs equations, augmented by the higher-derivative
operators required by quantum consistency. Phenomenological consequences
follow. First, the anomaly- and loop-induced R^2 operator generically drives
Starobinsky-type inflation, compatible with Planck data. Second, the
universally calculable quantum correction to Newton's potential and the Yukawa
tails from massive spin-0 and spin-2 modes are quantified and shown to satisfy
laboratory bounds. Third, constraints from GW170817 enforce luminal
gravitational wave speed. The theory is predictive in its inflationary sector
and in its universal low-energy corrections to gravity, reducing to General
Relativity and the Standard Model at accessible scales with controlled
corrections.

Conclusion: 这种方法为理解多通道系统和复杂色模型提供了见解。

Abstract: As is well known, the chiral Gross-Neveu model at finite density can be
solved semi-classically with the help of the chiral spiral mean field. The
fermion spectrum has a single gap right at the Fermi energy, a reflection of
the Peierls instability. Here, we divide the N fermion flavors up into two
subsets to which we attribute two different densities. The Hartree-Fock ground
state of such a system can again be found analytically, using as mean field the
``twisted kink crystal" of Basar and Dunne. Its spectrum displays two gaps with
lower edges coinciding with the two Fermi energies. This solution is favored
over the homogeneous one, providing us with an explicit example of a multiple
Peierls instability.

Abstract: We study the recent proposal of arXiv:2405.20366 which poses a precise
holographic duality between a 3d TQFT summed over all topologies and a unitary
ensemble of boundary 2d CFTs. In that proposal, the sum over topologies is
obtained via genus reduction from topologies with a large genus boundary
Riemann surface, while the boundary ensemble is given by all CFTs described by
Lagrangian condensations of the bulk TQFT. The main result of this work is to
show that each member of this ensemble is weighted by a symmetry factor given
by the invertible symmetry group of its categorical symmetry relative to the
bulk TQFT as its SymTFT. This is the natural $\unicode{x2014}$ uniform up to
isomorphism $\unicode{x2014}$ measure on the groupoid of Lagrangian algebras
that describe the boundary theories. We also write the sum over topologies more
explicitly in terms of equivalence classes of Heegaard splittings of
3-manifolds with a given boundary and comment on their weights. The holographic
duality in this framework can then be viewed as a generalization of the
Siegel-Weil formula. We discuss the implications of the main result for
non-compact TQFTs. In particular, for the Virasoro case, this implies an
ensemble of all CFTs at a given central charge in which CFTs are weighted by
their full invertible symmetry. Finally, we show how this TQFT gravity
framework gives a natural construction of the baby universe Hilbert space.

Abstract: Entanglement is a hallmark of quantum theory, yet it alone does not capture
the full extent of quantum complexity: some highly entangled states can still
be classically simulated. Non-classical behavior also requires magic, the
non-Clifford component that enables universal quantum computation. Here, we
investigate whether the interplay between entanglement and magic constrains the
structure of fundamental interactions. We study gluon-gluon and
graviton-graviton scattering at tree level, explicitly breaking gauge and
general covariance by modifying the quartic vertices and analyzing the
resulting generation of entanglement and magic. We find that imposing maximal
entanglement (MaxEnt) alone does not uniquely recover gauge-invariant and
diffeomorphism-invariant interactions, but adding the condition of minimal, but
nonzero, magic singles it out. Our results indicate that nature favors MaxEnt
and low magic: maximal quantum correlations with limited non-Cliffordness,
sufficient for universal quantum computing but close to classical simulability.
This dual informational principle may underlie the emergence of gauge
invariance in fundamental physics.

Abstract: The first part of this review tries to provide a self-contained view of
supersymmetry breaking from the bottom-up perspective. We thus describe N=1
supersymmetry in four dimensions, the Standard Model and the MSSM, with
emphasis on the ``soft terms'' that can link it to supergravity. The second
part deals with the top-down perspective. It addresses, insofar as possible in
a self-contained way, the basic setup provided by ten-dimensional strings and
their links with supergravity, toroidal orbifolds, Scherk-Schwarz deformations
and Calabi-Yau reductions, before focusing on a line of developments that is
closely linked to our own research. Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional
non-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly
realized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional
Minkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most
symmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve
internal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua
and the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing
some intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of
inflation. The appendices collect some useful material on global and local N=1
supersymmetry, in components and in superspace, on string vacuum amplitudes,
and on convenient tools used to examine the fluctuations of non-supersymmetric
string vacua.

Abstract: According to the flat/CCFT correspondence, Carrollian conformal field
theories (CCFT) in d dimensions are dual to asymptotically flat spacetimes in
d+1 dimensions. In this paper, starting from the holographic interpretation of
pseudo-entropy in the (A)dS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we show that both extremal spacelike
and timelike curves possess a well-defined flat-space limit. The length of
these curves can be regarded as the real and imaginary parts of the
pseudo-entropy for the underlying field theory, where only the real part has
been considered thus far. Our calculations can confirm that the entanglement
entropy in the CCFTs is fundamentally pseudo-entropy, and these theories are
non-unitary.

Abstract: We present a family of exact neutral hairy black-hole solutions with
spherical horizon topology in extended supergravity with Fayet--Iliopoulos
terms. We consider a consistent dilaton truncation and analyze in detail a
sector where the magnetic part of the FI terms vanishes. Using appropriate
dilaton counterterms, we compute the thermodynamic quantities and show the
existence of Hawking--Page phase transitions. As a holographic application, we
derive the thermal superpotential in closed form and use it as a counterterm,
explicitly demonstrating that no additional finite counterterms are required to
regularize the Euclidean action and the quasi-local stress tensor. The dual
stress tensor matches that of a thermal gas of massless particles and is
consistent with mixed dilaton boundary conditions that preserve conformal
symmetry.

Abstract: A consistent implementation of the gravitational constraints in de Sitter
space requires gauging the full $SO(1,d)$ isometry group. In this paper, we
develop a framework that enables the gauging of the full de Sitter isometry
while consistently incorporating multiple observers on arbitrary geodesics. We
achieve this by introducing the concept of \textit{covariant observer}, whose
geodesic is a dynamical entity that transforms under the isometry group. Upon
quantization, the geodesic becomes a fluctuating degree of freedom, providing a
quantum reference frame for $SO(1,d)$. Inspired by the timelike tube theorem,
we propose that the algebra of observables is generated by all degrees of
freedom within the fluctuating static patch, including the quantum fields modes
and other observers. The gauge-invariant subalgebra of observables is an
averaged version of the modular crossed product algebra, and we establish its
type II character by constructing a trace. This yields a well-defined von
Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, by imposing a UV cutoff in QFT and
proposing a quantum generalization of the first law, we demonstrate that the
algebraic and generalized entropies are in match.
  Our work generalizes the notion of a local algebra to that of a
\textit{fluctuating region}, representing an average of algebras over all
possible static patches and configurations of other geodesics. This provides a
complete, covariant, and multi-observer extension of the CLPW construction and
lays the foundation for a fully relational quantum gravitational description of
de Sitter space.

Abstract: We investigate Cauchy Slice Holography in de Sitter spacetime. By performing
a $T^2$ deformation of a (bottom-up) dS/CFT model, we obtain a holographic
theory living on flat Cauchy slices of de Sitter, for which time is an emergent
dimension, associated with an RG flow. In this $T^2$-deformed field theory, the
dS/CFT is an IR fixed point rather than a UV fixed point, potentially affecting
discussions of naturalness. As in the case of AdS/CFT, the terms in the $T^2$
deformation depend on the dimension and the bulk matter sector; in this article
we consider gravity, plus optionally a scalar field of arbitrary mass. We
compute scalar and graviton two-point correlation functions in the deformed
boundary theory, and demonstrate precise agreement with finite-time
wavefunction coefficients, which we calculate independently on the bulk side.
The results are analytic in the scalar field dimension $\Delta$, and may
therefore be continued to arbitrary generic values, including the principal
series. Although many aspects of the calculations are similar to the AdS/CFT
case, some new features arise due to the complex phases which appear in
cosmology. Our calculations confirm previous expectations that the holographic
counterterms are purely imaginary, when expressed in terms of wavefunction
coefficients. But cosmological correlators, calculated by the Born rule, are
shifted in a more complicated and nonlinear way.

*Seungjoo Baek,Heesu Kang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We propose 3D bulk dual field theories for 2D $oold{N}=1$ supersymmetric minimal models and $W_N$ algebra minimal models. These theories are realized using Seifert fibered spaces and the 3D-3D correspondence. For the unitary series, the bulk theory flows to a gapped phase with a unitary chiral minimal model on the boundary. For non-unitary series, the bulk flows to the 3D $oool{N}=4$ superconformal field theory with a non-unitary chiral minimal model on the boundary. We also propose UV gauge theory descriptions using $T[SU(n)]$ building blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper employs advanced topological and geometric methods, such as Seifert fibered spaces and the 3D-3D correspondence, to explore the dual field theories of certain supersymmetric minimal models. These methods are pivotal in modern theoretical physics, particularly in constructing and analyzing dualities between 3D and other dimensional systems.

Method: The authors build on previous work by Gang, Kang, and Kim to propose these dual field theories. They associate specific Seifert fibered spaces to each model and use the 3D-3D correspondence to realize the bulk theories. They examine both unitary and non-unitary series, analyzing the bulk theory's behavior under IR and suitable boundary conditions for the boundary conformal field theories (CFTs). Additionally, they propose gauge theory descriptions using $T[SU(n)]$ building blocks.

Result: The key findings establish a correspondence between 2D minimal models and 3D bulk field theories. Specifically, for unitary models, the bulk flows to a gapped phase with a unitary boundary CFT, while for non-unitary models, it flows to a gapless, topological phase with a non-unitary boundary CFT. The authors also provide gauge theory descriptions, though detailed consistency checks are still under development for the $W_N(P, Q)$ models.

Conclusion: This work bridges 2D and 3D physics, using Seifert spaces and the 3D-3D correspondence to extend the applicability of dual field theories to supersymmetric minimal models and $W_N$ algebra models. While significant progress has been made, particularly in unitary series, non-unitary models remain challenging, necessitating further research and consistency checks.

Abstract: Building on the work of Gang, Kang, and Kim arXiv:2405.16377, we propose 3D
bulk dual field theories for 2D $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric minimal models
$SM(P, Q)$ and $W_{N}$ algebra minimal models $W_{N}(P, Q)$. We associate to
$SM(P, Q)$ a Seifert fibered space $S^2((P,P-R),(Q,S),(3,1))$ with $PS-QR=2$,
and for $W_{N}(P, Q)$ a Seifert fibered space
$S^2((P,P{-}R),(Q,S),(N{+}1,-2N{-}1))$ with $PS-QR=1$, and realize the bulk
theory via the 3D-3D correspondence. For the unitary series, the bulk theory
flows in the IR to a gapped phase which, under suitable boundary conditions,
supports the unitary chiral minimal model on the boundary. For the non-unitary
series, the bulk theory flows to the 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field
theory whose topological twist yields a non-unitary topological field theory
supporting the non-unitary chiral minimal model on the boundary under
appropriate boundary conditions. We also propose UV gauge theory descriptions
of the bulk theories obtained by gluing $T[SU(n)]$ building blocks. For $SM(P,
Q)$, we provide non-trivial consistency checks -- matching between various bulk
partition functions and boundary conformal data -- while for $W_N(P, Q)$, we
present preliminary checks and leave further consistency checks for future
work.

Conclusion: 加速边界显著影响了Dirac场在全赢-林德勒空穴中的行为及其能量动量张量，结果与边界相对惯性观察者的状况不同。

Abstract: We investigate the local characteristics of the Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a
massive Dirac field induced by a planar boundary moving with constant proper
acceleration in $(D+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime. On the boundary, the field
operator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right
Rindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both
these regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of
the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one
presents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and
the second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the
boundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free
geometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the
Rindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the
boundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion
condensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative
everywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and
the energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region.
For a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions
$D\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero.
This behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the
geometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter
case, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of
the energy-momentum tensor becomes zero.

Abstract: We study the vacuum expectation value of half-BPS Wilson loop operators in
two families of superconformal $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter theories.
The first family is dual to AdS$_{4}$ solutions in M-theory, while the second
one has a dual description in massive type IIA string theory. Utilizing the
properties of the underlying geometry, we provide a universal description for
the semiclassical quantization of a probe M2-brane and fundamental string in
the respective holographic dual geometries. As a result, we find the one-loop
partition function of both the M2-brane and the string which leads to a
prediction for the large $N$ behaviour of the Wilson loops in the dual SCFTs.
For theories with M-theory duals, we conjecture the full perturbative
completion as a ratio of Airy functions.

investigated. In all simulations, there exists a minimum amount of time
necessary for fast transport, which is consistent with previous results from

TL;DR: This paper explores angle-dependent parametric pumping of magnons in Yttrium Iron Garnet films. It combines theoretical analysis and experimental results to show how different pumping angles affect magnon transfer towards the spectral minimum. Two magnon scattering mechanisms are identified: a step-by-step cascade and a more efficient kinetic instability channel. Experimental results confirm that transverse pumping, despite a higher instability threshold, yields a stronger population at the spectral minimum. These findings highlight the role of pumping geometry in guiding magnon distribution and optimizing magnon BEC control in magnetic insulators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnon Bose-Einstein condensation has potential applications in spintronic devices and quantum computing, motivating research into efficient magnon pumping mechanisms.

Method: A combination of theoretical modeling using a classical Hamiltonian formalism and experimental techniques like microfocused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy under controlled pumping angles was employed.

Result: Transverse pumping, despite a higher instability threshold, produces a stronger magnon population at the spectral minimum compared to parallel pumping. The study identifies two competing scattering mechanisms for magnon transfer.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the role of pumping geometry in magnon distribution and offers guidelines for optimizing magnon pumping into the condensate, advancing the field of magnon Bose-Einstein condensation in magnetic insulators.

Abstract: We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of angle-dependent
parametric pumping of magnons in Yttrium Iron Garnet films, with a focus on the
mechanisms that transfer parametrically injected magnons toward the spectral
minimum where Bose-Einstein condensation occurs. Using a classical Hamiltonian
formalism, we analyze the threshold conditions for parametric instability as a
function of the angle between the microwave pumping field and the external
magnetic field, continuously tracing the transition between parallel and
transverse pumping. We also describe two competing four-magnon scattering
mechanisms that transfer parametric magnons toward the bottom of their
frequency spectrum: The step-by-step Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade, which is
allowed for all magnetic field values, and the kinetic instability mechanisms
that provide a much more efficient single-step channel in transferring magnons
directly to the lowest-energy states, but occurs within specific regions of the
pumping angle and the external magnetic field where the conservation laws
permit it. In the experimental part, we employ microfocused Brillouin light
scattering spectroscopy in combination with a vector magnet, allowing for
angle-resolved mapping of the magnon population spectrum under controlled
pumping angle. We observe that transverse pumping, although characterized by a
higher instability threshold, yields a markedly stronger population at the
spectral minimum compared to parallel pumping. These observations demonstrate
that the kinetic instability channel plays a dominant role in transferring
magnons to the spectral minimum under such conditions. These results reveal the
crucial role of pumping geometry in shaping the magnon distribution and provide
guidelines for optimizing the flux of magnons into the condensate, thereby
advancing the control of magnon Bose-Einstein condensation in magnetic
insulators.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the superfluid properties of a two-dimensional,
weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in the zero-temperature regime,
when it is subjected to a triangular optical lattice potential. We implement an
original method, which involves solving the hydrodynamic continuity equation to
extract the superfluid fraction tensor from the measured in situ density
distribution of the fluid at rest. In parallel, we apply an independent
dynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity
measurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield
consistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured
density profiles.

### [91] [Quadrature-witness readout for backscatter mitigation in gravitational-wave detectors limited by back-action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03842)
*Niels Böttner,Roman Schnabel,Mikhail Korobko*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper discusses a new method to eliminate non-stationary noise in gravitational wave detectors caused by laser interference called back-scattering, using an orthogonal measurement quadrature to better reproduce the original gravitational wave signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detectors suffer from various sources of noise, including non-stationary noise from the detector itself, e.g., laser stray light scattering into the signal field. Traditional methods for handling such noise often only involve measuring one quadrature of the signal, which can lead to incomplete noise characterization and reduction. This paper aims to address this limitation by introducing a method that uses an orthogonal quadrature to simultaneously measure both quadratures, enabling a more comprehensive understanding and reduction of non-stationary noise.

Method: The paper presents the concept of a 'quadrature witness channel' which measures an orthogonal quadrature of the signal that is typically not used in conventional methods. This witness quadrature is specifically designed to be compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, a technique already employed in reducing other types of noise in gravitational wave detectors, such as photon shot noise and radiation pressure noise. By simultaneously measuring both the primary signal quadrature and the witness quadrature, the method allows for more accurate reconstruction and subtraction of non-stationary noise sources such as back-scattered laser light.

Result: The demonstration shows that implementing this method in a gravitational wave detector can effectively reduce noise caused by loud back-scatter events, potentially improving the sensitivity and robustness of the detector. This is a significant improvement because it directly addresses a limitation of current noise reduction techniques, which often rely on measuring only one quadrature. By using both quadratures, the method provides a more robust approach to noise reduction.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the use of a quadrature witness channel provides a promising solution for the challenge of non-stationary noise in gravitational wave detectors. This approach complements existing methods and allows for simultaneous measurement of both gravitational waves and interfering noise, leading to more effective noise reduction and improved observational capabilities.未来的研究可以进一步优化这一方法，减少计算复杂度，扩展其适用性，使得它在更多类型的噪声控制和信号检测中得到广泛应用。

Abstract: Disturbances in gravitational wave (GW) observational data are often caused
by non-stationary noise in the detector itself, such as back-scattering of
laser stray light into the signal field. Unlike GW signals, non-stationary
noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal
quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this
orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to
reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of
non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that
is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to
simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We
demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise
caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity
and robustness of GW observatories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The combination of inverse beta decay (IBD) and the detection of the diffuse supernova (DSNB) neutrino background is a long-standing goal in neutrino physics. The SK-Gd upgrade enables much more efficient identification of IBD events, which are the primary channel for DSNB detection.

Method: The study describes specific upgrades to the Super-Kamiokande detector, including the addition of gadolinium sulfate to its ultrapure water system. This development enhances the detection capabilities through improved neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium.

Result: Operational results from the SK-Gd upgrade demonstrate high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced background noise, and world-leading limits on the DSNB flux. These findings provide significant advancements toward the goal of discovering the DSNB.

Conclusion: The successful implementation of the SK-Gd upgrade marks a major milestone in the Super-Kamiokande experiment, establishing it as a leading observatory in the study of atmospheric neutrinos and the DSNB.

Abstract: Super-Kamiokande [SK] was upgraded through the addition of gadolinium sulfate
to its ultrapure water, initiating the SK-Gd program. This development enables
efficient neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium,
greatly improving the identification of inverse beta decay events, the primary
channel for detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background [DSNB]. The
upgrade also enhances sensitivity to galactic and pre-supernova neutrinos, as
well as atmospheric neutrino interactions. To realize this capability,
extensive work was performed, including the construction and operation of the
EGADS demonstrator, the refurbishment of the SK tank, the development of
radiopure gadolinium production methods, and the validation of the loading and
uniformity of gadolinium in solution. Early SK-Gd operation has demonstrated
high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced backgrounds, and world-leading limits
on the DSNB flux. With these advances, SK-Gd now stands at the threshold of
discovering the DSNB and opens a wide range of new opportunities in
astrophysics and neutrino physics.

TL;DR: A new method called Back-Propagation Counting (BPC) for electron counting in direct electron detectors has been developed. It uses machine learning for large tensor operations without requiring large training datasets. It performs well in synthetic and experimental data, reconstructing diffraction peaks and improving image contrast compared to standard methods in high-fluence environments like in situ TEM movies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate electron counting in high-fluence environments such as in situ TEM movies and diffraction analysis.

Method: BPC uses machine learning techniques on large tensors without large training datasets.

Result: BPC is effective in synthetic data, counts multiple electrons per pixel, and is robust to increasing occupancy. It reconstructs diffraction peaks with higher intensity and improves image contrast in experimental data compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: BPC excels in high-fluence electron counting applications, such as in situ TEM movies and diffraction analysis, with improved accuracy and contrast.

Abstract: Electron microscopy (EM) is a foundational tool for directly assessing the
structure of materials. Recent advances in direct electron detectors have
improved signal-to noise ratios via single-electron counting. However,
accurately counting electrons at high fluence remains challenging. We developed
a new method of electron counting for direct electron detectors,
Back-Propagation Counting (BPC). BPC uses machine learning techniques designed
for mathematical operations on large tensors but does not require large
training datasets. In synthetic data, we show BPC is able to count multiple
electron strikes per pixel and is robust to increasing occupancy. In
experimental data, frames counted with BPC are shown to reconstruct diffraction
peaks corresponding to individual nanoparticles with relatively higher
intensity and produce images with improved contrast when compared to a standard
counting method. Together, these results show that BPC excels in experiments
where pixels see a high flux of electron irradiation such as in situ TEM movies
and diffraction.

Abstract: We report on R&D study to improve the photon detection efficiency of water
Cherenkov detectors by doping ultra-pure water with 4-methylumbelliferone
(4-MU), a wavelength shifting additive. Cherenkov light yields from cosmic-ray
muons were measured for various 4-MU concentrations and compared with those
from pure water. At a concentration of 1 ppm, the detected light yield
increased by approximately a factor of three. This enhancement can be
attributed to wavelength shifting and improved photon collection efficiency. No
noticeable degradation in optical transparency was observed across the tested
concentrations of 0.5 and 1 ppm with different concentration of ethanol. These
results suggest that 4-MU is a promising additive for improving the performance
of water Cherenkov detectors.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how to correct for nonlinearities in homodyne quadrature interferometers (HoQI), which improve their noise performance and expand their applications in gravitational wave detection and other fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving displacement sensing in gravitational wave detectors and other applications by addressing nonlinearities in HoQI.

Method: Developed methods for real-time correction and calibration of nonlinearities using a working HoQI and mechanical resonator.

Result: Achieved suppression of nonlinear effects through real-time correction and post-processing, enhancing HoQI's applicability.

Conclusion: Real-time correction methods for HoQIs expand their utility in various sensing applications, particularly in gravitational wave detection upgrades.

Abstract: Homodyne Quadrature interferometers (HoQI) are an interferometric
displacement sensing scheme proven to have excellent noise performance, making
them a strong candidate for sensing and control schemes in gravitational wave
detector seismic isolation. Like many interferometric schemes, HoQIs are prone
to nonlinear effects when measuring displacements. These nonlinearities, if
left unsuppressed, would substantially limit the use cases of HoQIs. This paper
first shows a means of measuring and quantifying nonlinearities using a working
HoQI and a mechanical resonator. We then demonstrate a method for real-time
correction of these nonlinearities and several approaches for accurately
calibrating the correction technique. By correcting in real time, we remove one
of the biggest obstacles to including HoQIs in upgrades to future gravitational
wave detectors. Finally, we discuss how to post correct data from HoQIs,
suppressing even further the nonlinearity-induced errors, broadening the appeal
of such sensors to other applications where measurement data can be
reconstructed after the fact. We demonstrate all of this on a working HoQI
system and show the measured suppression of nonlinear effects from each of
these methods. Our work makes HoQIs a more broadly applicable tool for
displacement sensing.

Method: 使用有序统计量方法，考虑相关事件和coincidence作为概率分支过程，评估了crosstalk和afterpulsing的协作效应。

Result: 模型显示，随着种子数量增加，第一次到达事件的时间分布变得更加集中，反映出更高的相关事件概率。

Conclusion: 此方法可有效分离和分析ided和其他次级事件，提升探测器的时间分辨率评估能力。

Abstract: This paper briefly presents an order statistic approach to the time
distribution of the first detected event after a primary avalanche breakdown
from a mixture of correlated and dark counting processes. The well-known order
statistic method, commonly used to describe the time resolution of
scintillation detectors, is applied to the arrival times of correlated events.
The established model of crosstalk as a branching Poisson process is extended
to afterpulsing, and correlated events are considered starting from their seeds
-- free (de-trapped or diffused) charge carriers capable of triggering
secondary avalanche breakdowns. The proposed approach enables the extraction of
timing information for delayed crosstalk and afterpulsing events mixed with
dark counts and predicts that the distribution of the first arrival time
narrows as the number of seeds increases, corresponding to a higher probability
of correlated events.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The research identifies symmetry-protected quasi-bound states (SP-qBIC) in a photonic slab backed by molybdenum disulfoxide nanowedges (WSe2) with a continuous band of these states extending from the Gamma point to the X direction of the Brillouin zone, achieving a narrow spectral width. The quasi-bound states exhibit long lifetimes, supporting their existence as BIC analogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quest for long-lived, localized wave states that can be integrated into confined systems is critical in photonics and phononics. These states, known as Bound states in the continuum (BIC), are essential for applications such as optoelectronic and metafilter devices.

Method: The researchers conducted a device-level measurement of wavevector-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WSe2 weakly coupled to a photonic slab, formed by an array of aluminum nanodisks. They demonstrated the photonic slab's ability to support symmetry-protected quasi-bound states by observing the continuous band of states along the Gamma-X direction.

Result: The experimental results reveal a continuous band of symmetry-protected quasi-bound states (SP-qBIC) extending from the previously reported SP-qBIC at the Gamma point to the X direction. This band's spectral width remains narrow over at least half of the Brillouin zone, indicating a significant contribution to long-lived light propagation through the material.

Conclusion: This study paves the way for the use of symmetry-protected quasi-bound states in next-generation optoelectronic and metafilter devices by demonstrating their long lifetimes and ability to host a continuous band of states in a naturally occurring system.

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) are localized waves in electronic,
photonic and acoustic systems, which remain decoupled from surrounding
propagating waves and hence maintain their oscillation for extraordinary long
time [Nat Rev Mater 1, 16048 (2016)]. In photonic crystals, symmetry-protected
quasi-BICs (SP-qBIC) have been realized at high symmetry points of the
Brillouin zone and utilized in photonic crystal and distributed feedback
lasers. In the present work, we measure wavevector-resolved photoluminescence
(PL) of monolayer WSe2 weakly coupled to a photonic slab, consisting of a
square array of aluminum nanodisks. The results show that the slab supports a
continuous band of symmetry-protected quasi-bound states along the Gamma-X
direction, extending from the previously reported SP-qBIC at the Gamma point.
The spectral width of this quasi-bound band in the continuum remains narrow
through at least a half of the Brillouin zone, indicating its long lifetime.

TL;DR:  This paper proposes a compact RF spectrum analyzer using a pic-based speckle spectrometer and an interferometric encoding scheme, achieving 100 MHz resolution and 10 MHz separation across 10 GHz bandwidth, suitable for compact and fast RF analysis.ailed in reducing resolution, it is still limited compared to its theoretical potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop compact and fast RF spectrum analyzers for applications in communication, radar, and sensing, overcoming the challenges of combining high resolution, large bandwidth, and fast update rates.

Method: The method involves integrating a pic-based ultra-high-resolution speckle spectrometer with an interferometric RF-to-optical encoding scheme. The speckle spectrometer uses a path-mismatched multimode interferometer with inverse designed splitters to compensate for waveguide loss, achieving 100 MHz resolution. The encoding scheme directs the RF signal through a path-mismatched interferometer and encodes the outputs on separate optical carriers to further improve resolution.

Result: The system achieves 100 MHz resolution in a single-shot measurement and can resolve RF tones separated by 10 MHz across a 10 GHz bandwidth. However, the speckle-based approach suffers from limitations such as path mismatch and difficulty in temporal resolution, reducing the overall theoretical resolution.

Conclusion: This work makes progress toward compact and fast RF spectrum analysis but does not fully meet the theoretical potential, indicating future work is needed to address remaining challenges like path mismatch and temporal resolution.

Abstract: Designing miniaturized optical spectrometers is an increasingly active area
of research as spectrometers are crucial components for a wide range of
applications including chemical and material analysis, medical diagnostics,
classical and quantum sensing, characterization of light sources, and radio
frequency (RF) spectrum analysis. Among these applications, designing on-chip
spectrometers for RF spectrum analysis is particularly challenging since it
requires combining high resolution and large bandwidth with a fast update rate.
Existing chip-scale spectrometers cannot achieve the resolution required for RF
analysis, setting aside challenges in maintaining a fast update rate and broad
bandwidth. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a silicon
photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based RF spectrum analyzer that combines an
ultra-high-resolution speckle spectrometer with an interferometric
RF-to-optical encoding scheme. The PIC-based speckle spectrometer uses a
path-mismatched multimode interferometer with inverse designed splitters to
compensate for waveguide loss, enabling a record-high resolution of 100 MHz
(0.8 pm at a wavelength of 1550 nm). To further improve the resolution of the
overall RF spectrum analyzer, we modify the RF-to-optical encoding scheme by
directing the RF signal through a path mismatched interferometer and encoding
the outputs of the RF interferometer on separate optical carriers. This further
reduces the RF spectral correlation width of the combined system, enabling the
RF spectrum analyzer to resolve RF tones separated by 10 MHz across a bandwidth
of 10 GHz. Since this approach operates as a single-shot spectrometer, it can
support fast update rates, providing a path to compact, persistent wideband RF
spectrum analysis.

Abstract: We present a single-shot near-field technique to reconstruct the isofrequency

resonant modes using a fixed source in a resonator composed of the material
under test and map the in-plane field distribution with a movable probe.
Applying a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the measured field reveals the
sample's in-plane dispersion. By extending this analysis over multiple
frequencies and comparing the results with Fabry-P\'erot resonances, we
retrieve the full three-dimensional dispersion relation. When we apply the
method to a double non-connected wire metamaterial, it accurately captures the
low-frequency hyperbolic isofrequency surface, providing both a precise
experimental tool and conceptual insight into spatially dispersive
metamaterials.

Abstract: Achieving spatiotemporal control of light at subwavelength and subcycle
scales is an important milestone in the development of new photonic materials
and technologies. Ultrafast spatiotemporal light modulation currently relies on
electronic interband and intraband transitions that yield pronounced refractive
index changes but typically suffer from slow, picosecond response times due to
carrier relaxation. Here we show that by leveraging resonant light-matter
interactions in a high-quality factor metasurface it is possible to use the
optical Kerr effect, a weaker, but instantaneous optoelectronic polarization
effect, to achieve ultrafast, reconfigurable light modulation with
unprecedented spatial and temporal control. By the subwavelength all-optical
tuning of the refractive index of the dielectric metasurface unit cells, we
experimentally demonstrate pulse-limited beam steering with a 74-fs response
time at angles up to $\pm $13{\deg} in the near-infrared. The steering
originates from the Kerr effect with a background contribution arising from
slower two-photon-excited free carrier absorption. Additionally, we observe
spatial back-action, linear frequency conversion, and demonstrate arbitrary
ultrafast spatial light modulation in two dimensions. Our findings open the
possibility of realizing new ultrafast physics in metastructures with
applications in signal processing, pulse shaping, and ultrafast imaging.

difficult to grow and process, but attainment of the desired optical device
performance is often fundamentally more challenging. This Roadmap will review
the leading applications for mid-IR optoelectronics, summarize the status and
deficiencies of current device technologies, and then suggest possible roadmaps

Conclusion: 提出了设计高效，广谱微分镜的实用指导原则。

Abstract: Soliton microcombs are evolving towards octave-spanning for $f$-$2f$
self-referencing and expanding applications in spectroscopy and timekeeping. As
spectra broaden and pulses shorten, the Raman-induced soliton self-frequency
shift (SSFS) becomes a principal limitation: it reduces pump-to-comb conversion
efficiency, constrains achievable span, and can, in extremes, preclude
stationary operation. We develop a complementary theory of SSFS in
microresonators that remains valid when the soliton duration $\tau_s$ is
shorter than the Raman response timescale. The theory predicts a reduced
dependence of the SSFS on $\tau_s$ which also expands the soliton existence
range. Such predictions are validated by numerical simulations and by
experiments on Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators. Our results provide practical
guidelines for engineering efficient and broadband soliton microcombs.

Abstract: A neural network model based on the Transformer architecture has been
developed to predict the nonlinear evolution of optical pulses in Er-doped
fiber amplifier under conditions of limited experimental data. To address data
scarcity, a two-stage training strategy is employed. In the first stage, the
model is pretrained on a synthetic dataset generated through numerical
simulations of the amplifier's nonlinear dynamics. In the second stage, the
model is fine-tuned using a small set of experimental measurements. This
approach enables accurate reproduction of the fine spectral structure of
optical pulses observed in experiments across various nonlinear evolution
regimes, including the development of modulational instability and the
propagation of high-order solitons.

### [107] [Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04118)
*Xiaochen Liu,Ken-Tye Yong*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A unified effective field theory bridges the gap between few-photon quantum optics and strong-field nonlinear optics by incorporating electromagnetic gauge fields with vector polarisation modes, higher-dimension axion-like terms for magnetoelectric effects, and Schwinger-Keldysh contour quantisation to preserve gauge symmetry in dissipative media. The theory successfully predicts dispersion in polariton cavities and thin films within experimental accuracy up to one-dimensional geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing a comprehensive theoretical framework that unifies different regimes of optics is essential for advancing our understanding of complex material interactions governed by both quantum and nonlinear phenomena.

Method: The approach involves constructing an effective field theory that couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes, incorporating higher-dimension axion-like terms to capture magnetoelectric effects, and employing Schwinger-Keldysh contour quantisation with doubled BRST ghosts to preserve gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations are used to predict dispersion relations, and matrix-product-operator engine simulations are performed to validate the theoretical predictions against experimental results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films, and superconducting quarton circuits.

Result: The unified effective field theory achieves excellent agreement with experimental results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films, and superconducting quarton circuits, demonstrating its validity for 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step forward in unifying different optical regimes, offering a robust framework for predicting phenomena in materials where quantum and nonlinear optical effects coexist. The success in matching experimental data suggests that the current formulation can effectively handle a wide range of applications, though it is limited to one-dimensional geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies, requiring extensions for higher-dimensional or high-frequency scenarios.

Abstract: Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field
nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for
each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for
frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap,
plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic
gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the
optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures
magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with
doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop
renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the
third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after
matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a
matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with
published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero
indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current
formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies;
higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees
of freedom or numerical methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为利用硅的成熟加工技术实现 UV 可读的高密度光学存储平台提供了一个可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving state-of-the-art optical data storage requires raising device
capacity well above commercial standards. This requires media structured at a
much smaller scale and enabling readout at a shorter wavelength. Current CDs,
DVDs and Blu-rays are read with visible light, and are based on metallic
reflection gratings and phase-change recording layers structured at the
few-hundred-nm scale. Herein, we introduce 10-nm structured silicon as a
promising UV-readable data storage platform. Recording on it harnesses the
amorphous-to-crystalline phase-change of silicon, the two phases presenting
well-constrasted UV optical properties. Furthermore, the phase-change contrast
is strongly enhanced in the Vacuum UV thanks to the distinct interband plasmon
resonances of the amorphous and crystalline nanostructures, which have an
epsilon-near-zero and surface plasmonic character, respectively. Silicon
nanogratings with a 10 nm width and a 20 nm period resonate near the wavelength
of 120 nm, at which phase-change induces a 600% maximum optical transmittance
contrast. This paves the way toward UV-readable data storage platforms with a
10 to 100 times increased data density, which could be implemented by
harnessing the well-established silicon nanotechnology.

Abstract: We present an analytical theory of second harmonic generation (SHG) in hybrid
structures combining a nonlinear 2D crystal with a dielectric metasurface
waveguide. The theory describes the excitation spectrum and enhancement of SHG
at both leaky mode and quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC)
resonances in terms of the material parameters. For low-loss systems, the SHG
efficiency at leaky resonances is determined by their radiative broadening,
governed by the relevant Fourier harmonics of the metasurface polarizability,
whereas the SHG enhancement at quasi-BIC resonances is ultimately limited by
inhomogeneous broadening and absorption in the system. We also describe the
emergence and polarization properties of second harmonic diffracted beams.
These beams appear even if both the 2D crystal and the meta-waveguide are
centrosymmetric owing to the nonlocal mechanism of SHG. The developed framework
provides a systematic theoretical basis for optimizing the resonant nonlinear
frequency conversion in hybrid 2D-material-metasurface platforms and identifies
the fundamental limitations of the SHG efficiency.

Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL) enables optical-frequency analysis of samples with
nanometer resolutions, originating from the interaction of a focused electron
beam with radiative electronic states, or directly with the optical modes of
the sample. Here we decompose the various mechanisms underlying CL generation
and emission from an archetype spherical resonator using its spectral, angular
and spatially resolved features. We investigate radiation of optical
whispering-gallery modes in regimes of coherent and incoherent luminescence.
The use of different experimental regimes allows us to disentangle the
different contributions to the CL in spheres, namely, photon absorption,
generation and radiative leakage, and conclude that the photon generation
occurs precisely on the sphere's surface. In addition, the spheres serve as
high-NA collimating lenses for CL, resulting in mode quality unprecedented for
CL in free space. We believe that such collimated and directed CL in free space
will enhance existing quantum measurements of CL and facilitate new ones, such
as high-rate electron-photon entangled pairs, CL from quantum emitters, and
homodyne analysis of CL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for non-destructive, high-resolution characterization of samples in engineering, materials science, and biomedical applications drives the development of advanced imaging techniques like dark-field x-ray microtomography.

Method: The method involves two-directional beam tracking (2DBT), which uses a single optical element, making it compatible with standard x-ray sources and detectors, and simplifies setup and data acquisition.

Result: The system successfully captures sub-resolution features such as fiber orientation and microstructural heterogeneity, providing complementary information to traditional attenuation and phase tomography.

Conclusion: The robust and precise 2DBT system offers significant potential for non-destructive and three-dimensional analysis in various scientific and engineering applications, advancing structural characterization capabilities.

Abstract: We demonstrate dark-field x-ray microtomography in a compact,
laboratory-based system capable of resolving attenuation, phase, and
anisotropic scattering signals with micrometer-scale resolution across
centimetre-scale samples. The method is based on two-directional beam tracking
(2DBT), which requires only a single optical element and is compatible with
standard x-ray sources and detectors. We validate the system's capabilities
through imaging of a custom-built phantom, a fibre-reinforced composite and
ex-vivo biological tissues, including a bovine intervertebral disc, a rat
heart, and a porcine meniscus. The results show that dark-field tomography
provides complementary information to attenuation as well as to phase
tomography, by revealing sub-resolution features such as fibre orientation and
microstructural heterogeneity at length scales that are well below the voxel
size. A key element of our system is its sensitivity to scattering along two
orthogonal directions in the image plane, enabling the measurement of
scattering anisotropy with a single exposure. As well as simple and robust, our
approach is sensitive and precise. These findings demonstrate the potential of
2DBT for non-destructive and three-dimensional structural characterisation of
samples and materials in engineering, materials science and biomedical
applications.

Abstract: Contemporary schemes for waveform-resolved characterization are constrained

Abstract: This study presents a method for deterministic Er3+ doping of x-cut TFLN
using focused ion beam (FIB) implantation with sub-100 nm spatial precision,
enabling seamless integration of active rare-earth ions into this
technologically relevant platform for lithium niobate integrated nanophotonics.
Photoluminescence (PL) measurements from implanted regions reveal Stark-split
4f-4f transitions consistent with bulk Er-doped lithium niobate, indicating
similar lattice occupation. Temperature-dependent PL measurements from 300 K to
5 K exhibit conventional behaviour down to approximately 50 K, followed by a
marked decrease in the emission intensity and lifetime. This anomaly is
attributed to a suppression of the pyroelectric response in LiNbO3 at low
temperatures, which affects local electric fields and, consequently, Er3+
emission. The sensitivity of the PL response to the modulation frequency and
polarization of the 980 nm excitation light is also consistent with possible
mechanisms linking thermal effects and internal fields arising in the thin
film. The results demonstrate a method for the targeted doping with Er3+ ions
into the most widely used cut of TFLN for integrated photonic devices and
provide further important considerations for their exploitation in cryogenic
quantum devices.

Abstract: Optical spectrometers are indispensable tools across various fields, from
chemical and biological sensing to astronomical observations and quantum
technologies. However, the integration of spectrometers onto photonic chips has
been hindered by the low spectral resolution or large device footprint with
complex multiple channel operations. Here, we introduce a novel chip-integrated
spectrometer by leveraging the acoustically-stimulated Brillouin scattering in
a hybrid photonic-phononic chip. The Brillouin interaction provides a dynamic
reflection grating with a high reflectivity up to 50% and a fast switching time
on the microsecond scale, achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution of
0.56 nm over a 110 nm bandwidth using just a single 1 mm-long straight
waveguide. This remarkable performance approaches the fundamental limit of
resolution for a given device size, validating the potential of the hybrid
photonic-phononic device for efficient and dynamically-reconfigurable spectral
analysis, and thus opens up new avenues for advanced optical signal processing
and sensing applications.

Result: The MSP achieved excellent performance, with R-squared values close to 1 in both absorbance and fluorescence measurements. It successfully recorded spectra for various samples, including dyes, proteins, and cells.

Conclusion: The MSP represents a cost-effective, functional solution for in situ UV/Vis-NIR spectroscopy, suitable for environmental monitoring, biological research, forensic analysis, and materials science.

Abstract: This article describes the design and construction of a portable, compact,

(200_800 nm). This microscope spectrophotometer records highresolution
absorption and emission spectra in situ. The dual head design of this MSP
enables simultaneous real time imaging and spectral recording of heterogeneous
samples with high selectivity and micrometer spatial resolution. Our compact,
portable MSP design reduces construction costs by more than 20 times compared
to commercial benchtop alternatives, primarily due to its innovative
illumination system and microscope objective design. The performance of the
UV_vis_NIR MSP was confirmed by comparing the absorption and fluorescence
spectra of an aqueous solution of Ru(bpy) obtained with our system to those
measured by commercial spectroscopic systems. The high accuracy and reliability
of our system in measuring absorbance and fluorescence were confirmed by R
squared values of 0.998 and 0.990, respectively, from colorimetric and
fluorometric tests. The MSP was further used to record absorption and
fluorescence spectra from a variety of samples, including dyes and protein
crystals, in both the solution and solid state, as well as individual living
cells. This compact instrument is ideal for rapid, in situ spectroscopic
measurements and is expected to find on site applications across various

This result resolves the apparent paradox between bimodal eigenvalue

Abstract: We present an analytic, first-order description of how black hole ringdown
imprints on the operational signature of near-horizon thermality. Building on a
static Schwarzschild baseline in which a freely falling two-level system
coupled to a single outgoing mode exhibits geometric photon statistics and a
detailed-balance ratio set by the surface gravity, we introduce an even-parity,
axisymmetric quadrupolar perturbation and work in an ingoing
Eddington-Finkelstein, horizon-regular framework. The perturbation corrects the
outgoing eikonal through a gauge-invariant double-null contraction of the
metric, yielding a compact redshift map that, when pulled back to the detector
worldline, produces a universal, decaying-oscillatory modulation of the
Boltzmann exponent at the quasinormal frequency. We derive a closed boundary
formula for the response coefficient at the sampling radius, identify the
precise adiabatic window in which the result holds, and prove that the
modulation vanishes in all stationary limits. Detector specifics (gap,
switching wavepacket width) enter only through a smooth prefactor, while the
geometric content is captured by the quasinormal pair and the response
coefficient. The analysis clarifies that near-horizon "thermality" is robust
but not rigid: detailed balance persists as the organizing structure and is
gently driven by ringdown dynamics. The framework is minimal yet extensible to
other multipoles, parities, and slow rotation, and it suggests direct numerical
and experimental cross-checks in controlled analog settings.

Abstract: We study a system of a self-gravitating condensate, a boson star, formed from
scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM), with a black hole hosted at its center.
We numerically solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in the
non-relativistic limit, consistently incorporating the gravitational potential
of the black hole, to obtain all possible configurations of this BS-BH system
for different boson star masses, interaction types, and black hole masses. We
also propose an analytic expression for the density profile and compare it with
the numerical results, finding good agreement for attractive interactions and
for a finite range of mass ratios between the black hole and boson star.
Finally, considering the inspiral of this BS-BH system with a second, smaller
black hole, we study the dephasing of gravitational waves due to the presence
of the ULDM environment. A Fisher matrix analysis reveals the regions of
parameter space of the ULDM mass and self-coupling that future
gravitational-wave observatories such as LISA can probe.

Abstract: The horizon-scale images of supermassive black holes (BHs) by the Event
Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) have provided new opportunities to test
general relativity and other theories of gravity. In view of future projects,
such as the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Black-Hole
Explorer (BHEX), having the potential of enhancing our ability to probe extreme
gravity, it is natural to ask: \textit{how much can two black-hole images
differ?} To address this question and assess the ability of these projects to
test theories of gravity with black-hole shadows, we use general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic and radiative-transfer simulations to investigate the
images of a wide class of accreting BHs deviating from the Kerr solution. By
measuring the mismatch between images of different BHs we show that future
missions will be able to distinguish a large class of BHs solutions from the
Kerr solution when the mismatch in the images exceeds values between $2\%$ and
$5\%$ depending on the image-comparison metric considered. These results
indicate future horizon-scale imaging with percent-level image fidelity can
place meaningful observational constraints on deviations from the Kerr metric
and thereby test strong-field predictions of general relativity.

from known correlations between morphology, environment and dynamics of
galaxies. While Chae et al's analysis provides a valuable attempt at a clear
test of Modified Newtonian Dynamics, an evidently important topic, a
re-analysis of the observational data does not permit us to confidently assess
the presence of an EFE or to distinguish this interpretation from that proposed
in this article.

Abstract: We identify a general class of spacetime metrics that mimic the properties of
black holes without possessing a true event horizon. These metrics are
constrained by the requirements of being singularity-free and geodesically
complete. Specifically, we study metrics that do not possess $Z_2$ symmetry and
may deviate slightly or significantly from the symmetric case. Focusing on
scalar perturbations propagating on such backgrounds, we analyze the resulting
effective radial potentials and their dependence on different corners of the
mimicker landscape. We further investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes
and explore their characteristic features. Finally, we survey the landscape for
potential observational signatures, including shadow properties and the
possible presence or absence of echo effects.

Abstract: We explore charged black holes in Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG),
unveiling their distinctive features across multiple physical domains. Our
topological analysis reveals that the STVG coupling parameter $\alpha$ bolsters
thermal stability while electromagnetic charge $Q$ weakens it. Using the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we find that $\alpha$ amplifies light deflection and
enlarges shadow silhouettes, with $Q$ generating opposite effects. Our
quantum-corrected models with exponential entropy terms pinpoint phase
transitions in the microscopic regime, modifying conventional thermodynamic
relationships. Calculations of strong gravitational lensing, shadow geometry,
and Hawking emission show clear STVG signatures that diverge from Einstein's
predictions. Notably, our accretion disk analysis uncovers an intriguing
phenomenon: specific combinations of $\alpha$ and $Q$ can produce radiation
patterns resembling spinning Kerr black holes, creating potential
identification challenges for observers. These findings establish concrete
observational tests for STVG theory through next generation astronomical
imaging and lensing campaigns. By connecting theoretical predictions to
measurable quantities, we outline specific pathways to confirm or constrain
STVG using data from current and future space telescopes.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解物理黑洞的近地izon几何和其对观测量的影响提供了新的视角，且为未来研究这类问题提供了有用的方法和模型。

Abstract: The requirement that a trapped spacetime domain forms in finite time for
distant observers is logically possible and sometimes unavoidable, but its
consequences are not yet fully understood. In spherical symmetry, the
characterization of the near-horizon geometry of these physical black holes is
complete and shows marked differences from their eternal counterparts. Whether
these differences lead to observable signatures remains unclear. We construct
an approximate near-horizon metric that encapsulates them and is suitable for
modeling. The timelike apparent horizon of physical black holes provides a
natural surface for a consistent membrane description: we obtain closed-form
expressions for the redshift, proper acceleration, and extrinsic curvature, and
assign a two-dimensional viscous-fluid stress tensor via junction conditions.
These results also provide an additional perspective on the relation between
Rindler and near-horizon geometries. Among dynamical generalizations of surface
gravity, only a subset applies to these models. We complete their analysis and
recover the intuitive definition of surface gravity -- the acceleration in the
frame of a near-horizon observer, redshifted to infinity -- directly from the
membrane acceleration.

Abstract: We numerically investigate the superradiant amplification effect of a charged
scalar filed in the scattering experiment and the black hole bomb model in a
charged black-bounce spacetime. Due to the shallowing effect on the effective
potential by the introduced quantum parameter $\l$, superradiance in both the
above cases are verified to be weakened. In a scattering experiment, the
quantum parameter and the field mass suppress the amplification in all
frequency ranges, while the black hole and field charge influence it
differently in high and low frequencies. In a Type I black hole bomb model,
where the reflective mirror is placed outside the ergo-region, we find a new
distinct eigen-mode for the scalar field evolution in a high $\l$ value, which
is however absent in the case of Type II black bomb where the mirror is set
inside the ergo-region. Moreover, we investigate the heavy field mass scenario
in a Type II black hole bomb and find no amplification effect in this confined
configuration.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: According to General Relativity (GR), gravitational waves (GWs) should travel
at the speed of light $c$. However, some theories beyond GR predict deviations
of the velocity of GWs $c_{\rm gw}$ from $c$, and some of those expect vacuum
dispersion. Therefore, probing the propagation effects of GWs by comparing the
wave format detectors against the one at emission excepted from GR. Since such
propagation effects accumulate through larger distance, it is expected that
super-massive black holes binary (SMBHB) mergers serve as better targets than
their stellarmass equivalent. In this paper, we study with simulations on how
observations on a population of SMBHs can help to study this topic. We simulate
LISA observations on three possible SMBHB merger populations, namely
Pop\MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 3}, Q3-nod and Q3-d over a 5-year mission. The
resulting constraints on the graviton mass are \(9.50\), \(9.33\), and \(9.05
\times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{eV}/c^2\), respectively. We also obtain the
corresponding constraints on the dispersion coefficients assuming different
dispersion scenarios. If the electromagnetic wave counterparts of SMBHB merger
can be detected simultaneously, the $c_{\rm gw}$ can be constrained
waveform-independently to \(\Delta c/c\) to \(10^{-13}-10^{-12}\),
corresponding to graviton mass constraints of \(10^{-26}-10^{-24}
\mathrm{eV}/c^2\).

Conclusion: 研究证实了Sgr A$^*$的超质量黑洞身份。银河中心的暗物质分布可以通过研究黑洞影和S2星运动来揭示。

Abstract: It is widely believed that Sgr A$^*$, located at the center of our Galaxy, is
a supermassive black hole. Recent observations of its shadow and long-term
monitoring of the S2 star have provided compelling evidence supporting this
hypothesis. These observational advancements also offer valuable opportunities
to explore the physical properties of the black hole and its surrounding
environment. Since a dark matter halo is expected to exist in the Milky Way and
around Sgr A$^*$, investigating the behavior of the Galactic Center black hole
embedded in such a halo provides a crucial means to simultaneously probe both
black hole physics and dark matter properties. In this work, We develop a black
hole metric that incorporates a generalized double power law dark matter halo,
and analyze the corresponding null and timelike geodesics to investigate how
the halo parameters affect the black hole shadow and the motion of the S2 star.
Furthermore, by comparing our theoretical predictions with observational data
of the shadow and the S2 orbit, we constrained the dark matter halo parameters.
The results of this study provide both theoretical and phenomenological
insights into the nature of Sgr A$^*$ and the distribution of dark matter in
our Galaxy.

Abstract: The deep connection between black hole thermodynamics and spacetime geometry
remains a central focus of general relativity. While recent studies have
revealed a precise correspondence for null orbits, given by $K = -\lambda^2$
between the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, its
validity for timelike orbits had remained unknown. Our work introduces the
massive particle surface (MPS) framework and constructs a new geometric
quantity $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{G} \propto -\lambda^2$ on
unstable timelike orbits, thus establishing the geometry-dynamics
correspondence for massive particles. Crucially, near the first-order phase
transition of a black hole, $\mathcal{G}$ displays synchronized multivalued
behavior with the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and yields a critical exponent
$\delta=1/2$. Our results demonstrate that spacetime geometry encodes
thermodynamic information, opening a new pathway for studying black hole phase
transitions from a geometric perspective.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解不同引力理论之间的联系提供了新的视角，并扩展了现有理论的应用范围。

Abstract: We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and
scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical
kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric
tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent
gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique
way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a
scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of
the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context
of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to
a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic
term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new
equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the
aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence
relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and
scalar-tensor theories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the stability and oscillation modes of rotating string loops in Kerr spacetime is important for exploring the dynamics of relativistic astrophysical systems, such as black holes and neutron stars. This could have implications for gravitational wave astronomy and the study of high-energy phenomena near compact objects.

Method: The authors use analytical methods to derive the equations governing the motion of the string loops under various perturbations in the equatorial and polar regions. They solve these equations to find the fundamental frequencies of oscillation.

Result: The paper presents analytical expressions for the fundamental frequencies of oscillation for the string loops under equatorial and polar perturbations. These results are presented for different equations of state, which likely describe the state-dependent properties of the string material.

Conclusion: The derived analytical expressions for the fundamental frequencies are significant for understanding the oscillatory behavior of relativistic rotating string loops in Kerr spacetime. The study provides a theoretical foundation for further numerical simulations and observational studies of such systems.

Abstract: We study stability of the circular string loops rotating in the equatorial
plane of Kerr spacetime against equatorial and polar perturbations. We consider
motion of such string loops for different modes in the case of arbitrary

Abstract: We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to
a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of
entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity,
starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an
explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function,
which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an
anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may
resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with
modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide
class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis,
logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications,
and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical
properties and energy conditions.

Abstract: Finslerian extensions of Special and General Relativity -- commonly referred
to as Very Special and Very General Relativity -- necessitate the development
of a unified Lorentz-Finsler geometry. However, the scope of this geometric
framework extends well beyond relativistic physics. Indeed, it offers powerful
tools for modeling wave propagation in classical mechanics, discretizing
spacetimes in classical and relativistic settings, and supporting effective
theories in fundamental physics. Moreover, Lorentz-Finsler geometry provides a
versatile setting that facilitates the resolution of problems within
Riemannian, Lorentzian, and Finslerian geometries individually. This work
presents a plain introduction to the subject, reviewing foundational concepts,
key applications, and future prospects.
  The reviewed topics include (i) basics on the setting of cones, Finsler and
Lorentz-Finsler metrics and their (nonlinear, anisotropic and linear)
connections, (ii) the global structure of Lorentz-Finsler manifolds and its
space of null geodesics, (iii) links among Riemannian, Finsler and Lorentz
geometries, (iv) real world applications for wildfires and seisms, and
discretization in classical and relativistic settings with quantum prospects,
and (v) Finslerian variational approach to Einstein equations. The new results
include the splitting of globally hyperbolic Finsler spacetimes, in addition to
the analysis of several extensions as the case of timelike boundaries.

Abstract: We investigate the threshold of collapse of a massless complex scalar field
in axisymmetric spacetimes under the ansatz of Choptuik et al. 2004, in which a
symmetry depending on the azimuthal parameter $m$ is imposed on the scalar
field. This allows for both non-vanishing twist and angular momentum. We extend
earlier work to include higher angular modes. Using the pseudospectral code
bamps with a new adapted symmetry reduction method, which we call $m$-cartoon,
and a generalized twist-compatible apparent horizon finder, we evolve
near-critical initial data to the verge of black hole formation for the lowest
nontrivial modes, $m=1$ and $m=2$. For $m=1$ we recover discrete
self-similarity with echoing period $\Delta\simeq0.42$ and power-law scaling
with exponent $\gamma\simeq0.11$, consistent with earlier work. For $m=2$ we
find that universality is maintained within this nonzero fixed-$m$ symmetry
class but with smaller period and critical exponents, $\Delta\simeq0.09$ and
$\gamma\simeq0.035$, establishing an explicit dependence of the critical
solution on the angular mode. Analysis of the relation between the angular
momentum and the mass of apparent horizons at the instant of formation,
$J_{\mathrm{AH}}{-}M_{\mathrm{AH}}$, shows that the effect of angular momentum
is minimal at the threshold, with
$\chi_{\mathrm{AH}}=J_{\mathrm{AH}}/M_{\mathrm{AH}}^2\to0$, and, therefore,
excludes extremal black holes for the families under consideration. Our results
demonstrate that while universality and DSS hold within each $m$-sector, the
critical universal values vary with $m$, and neither extremality nor
bifurcation occur in the complex scalar field model within the families
considered here.

Conclusion: 黑洞外的静态球对称复杂标量场吸积行为揭示了完美流体与其实现的超流之间的区别。

Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and
astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such
a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field
approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a
simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with
canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either
preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is
well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such
a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate
that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate
with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to
distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the
complex scalar field.

Abstract: Multiscale dynamical systems characterized by interacting fast and slow
processes are ubiquitous across scientific domains, from climate dynamics to
fluid mechanics. Accurate modeling of such systems requires capturing both the
long-term statistical properties governed by slow variables and the short-term
transient dynamics driven by fast chaotic processes. We present a hybrid
data-driven framework that integrates score-based generative modeling with
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to construct reduced-order
models (ROMs) capable of reproducing both regimes. The slow dynamics are
represented by a Langevin equation whose drift is informed by a score function
learned via the K-means Gaussian Mixture Model (KGMM) method, ensuring faithful
reproduction of the system's invariant measure. The fast chaotic forcing is
modeled by a NODE trained on delay-embedded residuals extracted from observed
trajectories, replacing conventional Gaussian noise approximations. We validate
this approach on a hierarchy of prototypical metastable systems driven by
Lorenz 63 dynamics, including bistable potentials with additive and
multiplicative forcing, and tristable non-autonomous systems with cycloperiodic
components. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid framework maintains
statistical consistency over long time horizons while accurately forecasting
rare critical transitions between metastable states with lead times approaching
the Lyapunov time of the chaotic driver. This work establishes a principled
methodology for combining statistical closure techniques with explicit
surrogate models of fast dynamics, offering a pathway toward predictive
modeling of complex multiscale phenomena where both long-term statistics and
short-term transients are essential.

Motivation: The increasing interest in the potential applications of hidden multistability, especially in information storage, encryption, and safety precaution, is a key motivation for this research.

Method: An experimental setup using a programmable acoustic coupled-cavity platform with precise programming of system parameters to demonstrate hidden multistability.

Result: The successful demonstration of hidden and semi-hidden tristabilities, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of hidden multistability and enabling advanced control techniques for applications in information and safety fields.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for leveraging hidden multistability in emerging technologies, though further studies are needed to fully understand its behavior and optimize its applications. The controlled visualization and dynamic control of stable states are significant steps, but more research is required to expand its practical use in fields like information storage, encryption, and safety.

Abstract: Multistability, the coexistence of multiple stable states, is a cornerstone
of nonlinear dynamical systems, governing their equilibrium, tunability, and
emergent complexity. Recently, the concept of hidden multistability, where
certain stable states evade detection via conventional continuous parameter
sweeping, has garnered increasing attention due to its elusive nature and
promising applications. In this Letter, we present the first experimental
observation of hidden multistability using a programmable acoustic
coupled-cavity platform that integrates competing self-focusing and
self-defocusing Kerr nonlinearities. Beyond established bistability, we
demonstrate semi- and fully-hidden tristabilities by precisely programming
system parameters. Crucially, the hidden stable states, typically inaccessible
via the traditional protocol, are unambiguously revealed and dynamically
controlled through pulsed excitation, enabling flexible transitions between
distinct types of stable states. These experimental findings not only offer new
insights into the fundamental physics of emerging hidden multistability, but
also unlock new avenues for applications in information storage, information
encryption, and safety precaution, where multi-state dynamics could enable
advanced control techniques.

Abstract: We investigate energy propagation in a one-dimensional stub lattice in the
presence of both disorder and nonlinearity. In the periodic case, the stub
lattice hosts two dispersive bands separated by a flat band; however, we show
that sufficiently strong disorder fills all intermediate band gaps. By mapping
the two-dimensional parameter space of disorder and nonlinearity, we identify
three distinct dynamical regimes (weak chaos, strong chaos, and self-trapping)
through numerical simulations of initially localized wave packets. When
disorder is strong enough to close the frequency gaps, the results closely
resemble those obtained in the one-dimensional disordered discrete nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Klein-Gordon lattice model. In particular,
subdiffusive spreading is observed in both the weak and strong chaos regimes,
with the second moment $m_2$ of the norm distribution scaling as $m_2 \propto
t^{0.33}$ and $m_2 \propto t^{0.5}$, respectively. The system's chaotic
behavior follows a similar trend, with the finite-time maximum Lyapunov
exponent $\Lambda$ decaying as $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.25}$ and $\Lambda \propto
t^{-0.3}$. For moderate disorder strengths, i.e., near the point of gap
closing, we find that the presence of small frequency gaps does not exert any
noticeable influence on the spreading behavior. Our findings extend the
characterization of nonlinear disordered lattices in both weak and strong chaos
regimes to other network geometries, such as the stub lattice, which serves as
a representative flat-band system.

(`stripe') order. Motivated by recent experimental evidence for a
fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate temperature
pseudogap metal, we employ a theory of fermionic spinons which are confined
with the onset of stripe order at low temperatures. The theory produces the
`hourglass' spectrum near stripe-ordering wavevector observed by neutron
scattering. Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears
at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed
by neutron or X-ray scattering.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In altermagnets, magnons-the quanta of collective spin excitations-exhibit
chiral splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and external
magnetic fields. Typically, this chiral splitting behavior can be well
described by alternating isotropic spin exchanges (ISE) in the low-temperature
regime; however, its dynamic behavior at a finite temperature remains unclear.
In this study, we reveal that, when including magnon-magnon interactions, long
range anisotropic spin exchange (ASE) can also induce chiral splitting of
magnons at a finite temperature. Crucially, the chiral splitting induced by ASE
competes with that arising from ISE, leading to a pronounced temperature
dependent modulation of the altermagnetic chiral splitting. Moreover, this
competition is intimately connected to spin fluctuations, and can reverse the
spin current driven by the band splitting as temperature increases. Our work
uncovers the intrinsic competition governing collective spin excitations in
altermagnets, providing new insights into their finite-temperature dynamical
behavior.

Abstract: We report ARPES studies combined with DFT+DMFT calculations to confirm that
the magnetic ordering vector transition from \textbf{Q}=(1/2,0,0) to
\textbf{Q}=(1/3,0,0) in the metallic triangular antiferromagnets
Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$ ($\epsilon\approx$0.007) is induced by the
electronic structure change in the system. The ARPES-measured Fermi surface
(FS) maps of Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_2$ show two hexagonal and one circular hole-like
FSs around $\Gamma$, which matches well with the triple-\textbf{Q} state by
taking into account the contribution of nesting vectors occurring between Co
3$d$ and Ta 5$d$ orbitals. In the case of Co$_{0.340}$TaS$_2$, a new electron
pocket around K appears and the FS geometry changes as a result of the
correlation effect of Co$_4$S$_{18}$ tripods forming in the system. The
magnetic susceptibility calculations based on the DFT+DMFT band structure
indicate that the most stable magnetic ordering vector changes to (1/3,0,0)
from (1/2,0,0), which is very consistent with the magnetic phase transition
around $x$=1/3 in Co$_{x}$TaS$_2$.

Abstract: We study the $T=0$ phase diagrams of models of bilayers of $S=1/2$ square
lattices antiferromagnets with SU(2) Heisenberg symmetry that have 2, 4, and 6
spin exchanges. We study two families of bilayer models with distinct internal
symmetries and, hence, different phase diagram topologies. A traditional
bilayer model in which the interlayer interaction is Heisenberg so that the two
layers can exchange spin (and energy) with each other, making it possible to
achieve a simple dimerized valence bond liquid-like state. The resulting phase
diagram is rich with N\'eel, valence bond solid and simple dimer phases, and
both first-order and continuous transitions, which we demonstrate are
consistent with the conventional Landau theory of order parameters. In the
second family of models in which the layers can exchange only energy but no
spin (reminiscent of the Ashkin-Teller coupling), the simple dimer state cannot
occur. The phase diagrams reveal a number of phase transitions that are
accessed for the first time. We find that the phase transition between N\'eel
and VBS is first order in both the spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models,
although they have strikingly distinct finite-size scaling behavior and that
the transition from VBS to dimer in the spin-spin coupling model deviates from
the expected scenario of an XY model with dangerously irrelevant four-fold
anisotropy.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between altermagnetic band structures and
electronic correlations by focusing on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic
generalization of the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. We find that with increasing
interaction, a many-body Lifshitz transition takes place when doubly occupied
regions disappear from the Fermi surface and each momentum state becomes fully
spin polarized. The spin susceptibility is directly evaluated from the Kubo
formula in terms of many-body occupation probabilities. We find that the
dynamical susceptibility, which possesses only transverse non-zero components
for small wavevectors, develops a gap proportional to the interaction strength,
and displays a sharp peak at a frequency increasing with the interaction. %with
increasing frequency. Above the Lifshitz transition, this peak moves to the
lower gap edge and becomes log-divergent. The signal intensity increases with
the interaction up until the Lifshitz transition and saturates afterwards. The
static susceptibility remains unaffected by the correlations and altermagnetism
reduces the static transverse response.

*Zeinab Bakhshipour,Mir Vahid Hosseini*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of disorder on the helical edge of a 2D topological insulator in the presence of a Zeeman field and superconductivity. Using bosonization and renormalization-group analysis, the study reveals that the Zeeman field controls the competition between attractive and repulsive regimes. In the attractive regime, the Zeeman field amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant disorder regime. Disorder induces logarithmic suppression of transverse density-wave correlations and introduces logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations, contributing to their stability. These effects modify the scaling of spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper examines an intricate quantum phenomenon involving topological insulators, spin-orbit coupling, and superconductivity. The interplay between disorder, magnetic fields, and Fermi surface fluctuations presents fundamental questions about material stability and quantum criticality, making this a significant topic in condensed matter physics.

Method: The study employs advanced theoretical tools like bosonization and renormalization-group analysis to model and analyze the system. These methods are chosen for their ability to handle strong correlations and microscopic disorder effects in two-dimensional systems, making them particularly suitable for exploring this complex problem.

Result: In the attractive Zeeman regime, the system exhibits enhanced superconducting gaps. Conversely, in the repulsive regime, disorder is better managed, stabilizing impurity effects. Disorder is shown to suppress certain correlation channels logarithmically while enhancing others, thereby stabilizing superconductivity. These findings directly impact observable quantities like spin conductance, offering new insights into material behavior under competing interactions.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the complex interplay between disorder, Zeeman fields, and superconductivity in topological insulators. The results have important implications for the design of new materials with tailored electronic properties and could guide future experimental efforts to observe these phenomena.

Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the
helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman
field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group
analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave
correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal
that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it
amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes
impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for
disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of
transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing
positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations
and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of
spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the
interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.

Abstract: We present a study of low-temperature electric and thermal transport in
RuO$_2$, a metallic oxide which has attracted much recent attention. Careful
scrutiny of electric resistivity reveals a quadratic temperature dependence
below $\sim$ 20 K undetected in previous studies of electronic transport in
this material. The prefactor of this T$^2$ resistivity, given the electronic
specific heat, corresponds to what is expected by the Kadowaki-Woods scaling.
The variation of its amplitude across 4 different samples is negligible despite
an eightfold variation of residual resistivity. There is also a T$^5$
resistivity due to scattering by phonons. By measuring thermal conductivity,
$\kappa$, at zero field and at 12 T, we separated its electronic and the
phononic components and found that the electronic component respects the
Wiedemann-Franz law at zero temperature and deviates downward at finite
temperature. The latter corresponds to a threefold discrepancy between the
prefactors of the two (thermal and electric) T-square resistivities. Our
results, establishing RuO$_2$ as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid, provide new
input for the ongoing theoretical attempt to give a quantitative account of
electron-electron scattering in metallic oxides starting from first principles.

Abstract: We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$
bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of
modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB
codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that
the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be
determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$
are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i
p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the
well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular,
this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric
methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon
fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's
symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior,
resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a
computational algebraic method using Gr\"{o}bner bases over the ring of
integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.

Abstract: We study the correlated electronic structure and local spin behaviour of the

using DFT+DMFT with a two-orbital Cu-centred low-energy model. Simulations are
done for several temperatures (20, 60, 100 K) and a broad range of band
fillings 2.46 $\leq$ n $\leq$ 3.54. We find that the present compound stays
metallic even once correlations are treated dynamically around the
stoichiometric filling (n $\simeq$ 3). Away from n $\simeq$ 3, both hole and
electron doping drive the system toward non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, and
spectral weight is transferred from the low-energy peak into upper and lower
Hubbard-like features. By analysing the low-frequency self-energy exponent and
the dynamical part of the local spin susceptibility, we identify a narrow
window of enhanced spin fluctuations on the slightly hole-doped side (n
$\simeq$ 2.94), i.e. a spin-freezing-crossover regime of the kind reported in
the literature for multiorbital Hund metals. This places
Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ among the promising members of the Cu-substituted

*Mohsen Hafez-Torbati,Götz S. Uhrig*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper proposes that Néel AF Mott insulators with a buckled honeycomb structure can be used to create high-temperature AF Chern insulators (AFCIs). Using a generalized Kondo lattice model, the authors show that applying a perpendicular electric field due to buckling can induce the necessary conditions for an AFCI phase transition. They analyze the Hall conductance and chiral edge states, finding that the quantization temperature $T_q$ depends mainly on spin-orbit coupling and hopping parameters. Above $T_q$, the Hall conductance deviates from quantization due to spectral broadening of the chiral states, indicating finite lifetimes. Using parameters typical for heavy transition metals like Ca and Os, the authors predict that the proposed compound Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ could achieve room-temperature stability as a high-$T$ AFCI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore and potentially realize high-temperature Chern insulators, which are exotic quantum materials with potential applications in quantum computing and other advanced technologies. By proposing a new structural framework and utilizing established theoretical models, the authors aim to advance our understanding of strongly correlated electron systems and topological phases.

Method: The authors employ a generalized Kondo lattice model to theoretically investigate the electronic properties of the proposed material. They use parameters characteristic of heavy transition-metal elements to simulate and predict the behavior of the system under various conditions. The study combines detailed computational modeling with experimental parameters to make concrete predictions about the viability of the proposed material.

Result: The key results include the successful demonstration that the proposed buckled honeycomb structure with Néel AF Mott insulators can lead to an AFCI phase under certain conditions. The quantization temperature $T_q$ is found to be independent of the model's specific details and is solely dependent on spin-orbit coupling and hopping parameters. The Hall conductance shows quantization up to $T_q$, beyond which a deviation occurs with accompanying spectral broadening of chiral edge states. The calculations suggest that the proposed material Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ could be a promising candidate for a high-temperature AFCI at room temperature.

Conclusion: The paper successfully designs and analyzes a potential candidate for a high-temperature AF Chern insulator, offering a promising avenue for future experimental studies. The structural buckling of the honeycomb lattice combined with Néel AF Mott properties provides a route to realizing a robust quantum material with promising electronic features.

Abstract: We propose N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulators with a buckled
honeycomb structure as potential candidates to host a high-temperature AF Chern
insulator (AFCI). Using a generalized Kondo lattice model we show that the
staggered potential induced by a perpendicular electric field due to the
buckling can drive the AF Mott insulator to an AFCI phase. We address the
temperature evolution of the Hall conductance and the chiral edge states. The
quantization temperature $T_q$, below which the Hall conductance is quantized,
depends essentially on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the hopping
parameter, independent of the specific details of the model. The deviation of
the Hall conductance from the quantized value $e^2/h$ above $T_q$ is found to
be accompanied by a spectral broadening of the chiral edge states, reflecting a
finite life-time, i.e., a decay. Using parameters typical for heavy
transition-metal elements we predict that the AFCI can survive up to room
temperature. We suggest Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ as a potential compound to realize
a high-$T$ AFCI phase.

Abstract: We present the physical design and systematic optimization of a
high-performance storage ring tailored for the generation of high-power
coherent radiation, with particular emphasis on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
regime. The proposed ring adopts a Double Bend Achromat (DBA) lattice
configuration and integrates 12 superconducting wigglers to significantly
enhance radiation damping and minimize the natural emittance. And a bypass line
is adopted to generate high power coherent radiation. Comprehensive linear and
nonlinear beam dynamics analyses have been conducted to ensure beam stability
and robustness across the operational parameter space. The optimized design
achieves a natural emittance of approximately 0.8 nm and a longitudinal damping
time of around 1.4 ms, enabling the efficient buildup of coherent radiation.
Three-dimensional numerical simulations, incorporating the previously proposed

the strong potential of the proposed design for applications in coherent photon

### [149] [Murray's Law as an Entropy-per-Information-Cost Extremum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04022)
*Justin Bennett*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种新的分支规律，称为熵产生效率最大值（EPIC），该规律通过计算每单位信息的成本，如有效比特能量 Eb,eff = ζ k_B T ln2，来解决粘性熵产生量的最优分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分支现象在生物系统中广泛存在，理解其背后的物理规律有助于揭示自然选择和适应性机制。

Method: 研究者引入了熵产生效率最大值（EPIC）的概念，通过将分支半径与 bits 的成本进行比较，建立了一个新的数学框架来描述分支现象。

Result: 分支半径遵循一个新的幂律关系 Q ∝ r^α，其中 α 由分数指数 (m+4)/2 决定，m 表示成本函数的幂次。当成本函数按体积或表面积变化时，α 的值分别为 3 和 2.5。混合成本函数时，α 值处于 2.5 到 3 之间。

Conclusion: 该研究为分支现象提供了一个统一的物理理解框架，即通过最大化每比特信息的能量效率来选择分支模式。实验验证表明，该框架能够准确预测分支比例，从而具有广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: At steady laminar Y-junctions (Murray family), the observed branching-radius
law follows from a single ratio extremum: entropy production per information
cost (EPIC). Structure is priced by an effective bit energy Eb,eff = zeta k_B T
ln 2 (J per bit); normalizing viscous entropy production by this tariff defines
an information-priced entropy flux Phi_b = sigma_s / Eb,eff. Extremizing at
fixed demands gives Q proportional to r^alpha with alpha = (m+4)/2 and the node
rule r0^alpha = r1^alpha + r2^alpha, where m encodes how the tariff scales with
radius (m=2 volume-priced -> alpha = 3; m=1 surface-priced -> alpha = 2.5).
Mixed surface/volume pricing implies a local alpha_eff in the range 2.5-3
without changing the fluid physics and leads to a weighted Murray law for
heterogeneous tariffs. The ratio extremum is equivalent to an additive
functional via fractional programming (Dinkelbach) and reduces, for uniform
tariffs, to the familiar near-equilibrium extremum of classical theory (minimum
entropy production). The framework is falsifiable: measure how stabilized-bit
counts and the overhead zeta scale with radius, and alpha must track (m+4)/2.
EPIC recasts branching selection as maximizing entropy throughput per paid bit
and provides a platform-agnostic lever to predict and tune morphology.

### [150] [Coherent control of magnon-polaritons using an exceptional point](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03899)
*N. J. Lambert,A. Schumer,J. J. Longdell,S. Rotter,H. G. L. Schwefel*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: Magnonic hybrid systems can have their gain and loss balanced manipulated in time shorter than their decay rate, utilizing non-Hermitian physics for coherent control and exploring exceptional points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coherent control of quantum systems, especially non-Hermitian ones, is crucial for advanced technologies, driving research in areas like quantum computing and sensing.

Method: By encircling exceptional points, they controlled the system's dynamics, achieving state preparation and studying system behavior at these points.

Result: They showed time for population transfer and balanced mode preparation via encircling exceptional points, opening new research avenues.

Conclusion: This work provides innovative methods for controlling non-Hermitian systems, essential for future quantum technologies.

Abstract: The amplitude of resonant oscillations in a non-Hermitian environment can
either decay or grow in time, corresponding to a mode with either loss or gain.
When two coupled modes have a specific difference between their loss or gain, a
feature termed an exceptional point emerges in the excitations' energy
manifold, at which both the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the system
coalesce. Exceptional points have intriguing effects on the dynamics of systems
due to their topological properties. They have been explored in contexts
including optical, microwave, optomechanical, electronic and magnonic systems,
and have been used to control systems including optical microcavities, the
lasing modes of a PT-symmetric waveguide, and terahertz pulse generation. A
challenging problem that remains open in all of these scenarios is the fully
deterministic and direct manipulation of the systems' loss and gain on
timescales relevant to coherent control of excitations. Here we demonstrate the
rapid manipulation of the gain and loss balance of excitations of a magnonic
hybrid system on durations much shorter than their decay rate, allowing us to
exploit non-Hermitian physics for coherent control. By encircling an
exceptional point, we demonstrate population transfer between coupled
magnon-polariton modes, and confirm the distinctive chiral nature of
exceptional point encircling. We then study the effect of driving the system
directly through an exceptional point, and demonstrate that this allows the
coupled system to be prepared in an equal superposition of eigenmodes. We also
show that the dynamics of the system at the exceptional point are dependent on
its generalised eigenvectors. These results extend the established toolbox of
adiabatic transfer techniques with a new approach for coherent state
preparation, and provide a new avenue for exploring the dynamical properties of
non-Hermitian systems.

### [151] [Interstitial dual-mode ultrasound with a 3-mm MR-compatible catheter for image-guided HIFU and directional in-vitro tissue ablations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04207)
*Thomas Biscaldi,Romain l'Huillier,Laurent Milot,W Apoutou N'Djin*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: A miniaturized dual-mode USgHIFU catheter was successfully developed and tested, demonstrating its feasibility for interventional radiology applications with improved precision and reduced size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for minimally invasive tumor ablation techniques necessitates the development of compact and efficient ultrasound catheters.

Method: An MR-compatible dual-mode ultrasound catheter prototype was designed using a 9gauge linear array with 64 piezocomposite elements. The device was tested in vitro for thermal ablation in liver tissue phantoms, incorporating techniques like dynamic focusing to enhance performance without grating lobes.

Result: The catheter achieved a peak surface intensity of 14 W•cm⁻² and successfully performed 17 intra-ablation thermal imaging experiments. The multi-focal strategies reduced grating lobes and preserved tissue directionality, proving the catheter's effectiveness for precise tumor ablation.

Conclusion: This study validates the potential of compact dual-mode USgHIFU catheters for future interventional therapies, offering a balance between size, functionality, and precision.

Abstract: Current interstitial techniques of tumor ablation face challenges that
ultrasound technologies could meet. The ablation radius and directionality of
the ultrasound beam could improve the efficiency and precision. Here, a 9gauge
MR-compatible dual-mode ultrasound catheter prototype was experimentally
evaluated for Ultrasound Imageguided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound
(USgHIFU) conformal ablations. The prototype consisted of 64 piezocomposite
linear array elements and was driven by an open research programmable dual-mode
ultrasound platform. After verifying the US-image guidance capabilities of the
prototype, the HIFU output performances (dynamic focusing and HIFU intensities)
were quantitatively characterized, together with the associated 3D HIFU-induced
thermal heating in tissue phantoms (using MR thermometry). Finally, the ability
to produce robustly HIFU-induced thermal ablations in in-vitro liver was
studied experimentally and compared to numerical modeling. Investigations of
several HIFU dynamic focusing allowed overcoming the challenges of
miniaturizing the device: mono-focal focusing maximized deep energy deposition,
while multi-focal strategies eliminated grating lobes. The linear-array design
of the prototype made it possible to produce interstitial ultrasound images of
tissue and tumor mimics in situ. Multi-focal pressure fields were generated
without grating lobes and transducer surface intensities reached up to Isapa
=14 W$\bullet$cm -2 . Seventeen elementary thermal ablations were performed in
vitro. Rotation of the catheter proved the directionality of ablation, sparing
non-targeted tissue. This experimental proof of concept demonstrates the
feasibility of treating volumes comparable to those of primary solid tumors
with a miniaturized USgHIFU catheter whose dimensions are close to those of
tools traditionally used in interventional radiology, while offering new
functionalities.

Abstract: Theoretical predictions of photochemical processes are essential for
interpreting and understanding spectral features. Reliable quantum dynamics
calculations of vibronic systems require precise modeling of anharmonic effects
in the potential energy surfaces and off-diagonal nonadiabatic coupling terms.
In this work, we present the n-mode quantization of all vibronic Hamiltonian
terms comprised of general high-dimensional model representations. This results
in a second-quantized framework for accurate vibronic calculations employing
the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We demonstrate the accuracy
and reliability of this approach by calculating the excited state quantum
dynamics of maleimide. We analyze convergence and the choice of parameters of
the underlying time-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm
for the n-mode vibronic Hamiltonian, demonstrating that it enables accurate
calculations of complex photochemical dynamics.

Abstract: With the rapid development of nanophotonics and cavity quantum
electrodynamics, there has been growing interest in how confined
electromagnetic fields modify fundamental molecular processes such as electron
transfer. In this paper, we revisit the problem of nonadiabatic electron
transfer (ET) in confined electromagnetic fields studied in [J. Chem. Phys.
150, 174122 (2019)] and present a unified rate theory based on Fermi's golden
rule (FGR). By employing a polaron-transformed Hamiltonian, we derive analytic
expressions for the ET rate correlation functions that are valid across all
temperature regimes and all cavity mode time scales. In the high-temperature
limit, our formalism recovers the Marcus and Marcus-Jortner results, while in
the low-temperature limit it reveals the emergence of the energy gap law. We
further extend the theory to include cavity loss by using an effective Brownian
oscillator spectral density, which enables closed-form expressions for the ET
rate in lossy cavities. As applications, we demonstrate two key cavity-induced
phenomena: (i) resonance effects, where the ET rate is strongly enhanced at
certain cavity mode frequencies, and (ii) electron-transfer-induced photon
emission, arising from the population of cavity photon Fock states during the
ET process. These results establish a general framework for understanding how
confined electromagnetic fields reshape charge transfer dynamics, and suggest
novel opportunities for controlling and probing ET reactions in nanophotonic
environments.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: GNOF offers an effective way to capture electron correlation without the need for perturbative corrections or a limited active space. Its modified version, GNOFm, shows slight improvements over GNOF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores a computationally feasible method for capturing electron correlation, which is crucial for accurate quantum chemical calculations.

Method: The authors compare the GNOF method with its modified variant, GNOFm, using a set of twelve 5- and 6-membered molecular rings. The performance of both methods is evaluated with respect to benchmark CCSD(T) in complete-basis-set limit.

Result: Both the original GNOF and the modified GNOFm perform similarly, with GNOFm showing minor but consistent improvements. This suggests that the GNOF family remains reliable for capturing dynamic correlation effects.

Conclusion: The study validates the applicability of the GNOF methods in practical molecular systems, highlighting the potential of the original formulation and suggesting that minor modifications can be explored further for improving accuracy.

Abstract: The Global Natural Orbital Functional (GNOF) provides a straightforward
approach to capture most electron correlation effects without needing
perturbative corrections or limited active spaces selection. In this work, we
evaluate both the original GNOF and its modified variant GNOFm on a set of
twelve 5- and 6-membered molecular rings, systems characterized primarily by
dynamic correlation. This reference set is vital as it comprises essential
substructures of more complex molecules. We report complete-basis-set limit
correlation energies for GNOF, GNOFm, and the benchmark CCSD(T) method. Across
the Dunning basis sets, both functionals deliver a balanced and accurate
description of the molecular set, with GNOFm showing small but systematic
improvements while preserving the overall robustness of the original
formulation. These results confirm the reliability of the GNOF family and its
ability to capture dynamic correlation effects.

Abstract: A simplification of the VV10 van der Waals density functional [J. Chem. Phys.
133, 244103 (2010)] is made by an approximation of the integrand of the
six-dimentional integral in terms of a few products of three-dimensional
density-like distributions and potential-like functions of the interelectronic
distance only, opening the way for its straightforward computation by fast
multipole methods. An even faster computational scheme for molecular systems is
implemented where the density-like distributions are fitted by linear
combinations of usual atom-centered basis functions of Gaussian type and the
six-dimensional integral is then computed analytically, at a fraction of the
overall cost of a typical calculation. The simplicity of the new approximation
is commensurate with that of the original VV10 functional, and the same level
of accuracy is seen in tests on molecules.

Abstract: Real-time and accurate monitoring of humidity and pH is of great significance
in daily life and industrial production. Existing humidity and pH measurement
suffer from limitations such as low sensitivity, signal crosstalk, complex
system structures, and inability to achieve real-time monitoring. In this work,
the surface of a polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) was functionalized with a
composite humidity-sensitive polymer composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and
carbon nanosheets (CNs). A humidity-sensitive film with a microporous structure
was prepared on the PMF cladding through high-temperature rapid film formation
and laser processing, enhancing humidity sensitivity and stability. To enable
pH sensing, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly (acrylic acid) (PAA)
were successively adsorbed onto the PMF surface via electrostatic
self-assembly, forming a pH-sensitive nanofilm structure. By connecting a
temperature-compensated PMF within the same Sagnac loop and combining it with a
multi-wavelength matrix, simultaneous real-time monitoring of humidity, pH, and
temperature was achieved, effectively solving the issue of temperature
crosstalk and extending toward a universal optical fiber multi-parameter
measurement platform.

Abstract: 3D-printed materials are used in many different industries (automotive,
aviation, medicine, etc.). Most of these 3D-printed materials are based on
ceramics or polymers whose mechanical properties vary with frequency. For
numerical modeling, it is crucial to characterize this frequency dependency
accurately to enable realistic finite-element simulations. At the same time,
the damping behavior plays a key role in product development, since it governs
a component's response at resonance and thus impacts both performance and
longevity. In current research, inverse material characterization methods are
getting more and more popular. However, their practical validation and
applicability on real measurement data have not yet been discussed widely. In
this work, we show the identification of two different materials, POM and
additively manufactured sintered ceramics, and validate it with experimental
data of a well-established measurement technique (dynamic mechanical analysis).
The material identification process considers state-of-the-art reduced-order
modeling and constrained particle swarm optimization, which are used to fit the
frequency response functions of point measurements obtained by a laser Doppler
vibrometer. This work shows the quality of the method in identifying the
parameters defining the viscoelastic fractional derivative model, including
their uncertainty. It also illustrates the applicability of this identification
method in the presence of practical difficulties that come along with
experimental data such as boundary conditions and noise.

Abstract: Versatile, ultracompact, easy-to-handle, high-sensitivity sensors are
compelling tools for in situ pivotal applications, such as medical diagnostics,
security and safety assessments, and environmental control. In this work, we
combine photoacoustic spectroscopy and feedback interferometry, proposing a
novel trace-gas sensor equipped with a self-mixing readout. This scheme
demonstrates a readout sensitivity comparable to that of bulkier
state-of-the-art balanced Michelson-interferometric schemes, achieving the same
spectroscopic performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and minimum
detection limit (MDL). At the same time, the self-mixing readout benefits from
a reduced size and a lower baseline, paving the way for future system
downsizing and integration while offering a higher detectability for lower gas
concentrations. Moreover, the intrinsic wavelength independence of both
self-mixing and photoacoustic techniques allows the applicability and
tailorability of the sensor to any desired spectral range.

Abstract: Ionization by a sequence of extreme ultraviolet pulses is investigated based
on the rigorous numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation, when the driving laser field is treated exactly. This goes beyond the
typically used first-order nondipole approximation and reveals the effects of
radiation pressure to its full extent. Specifically, we observe the comb
structures in both the momentum and the energy distributions of photoelectrons.
The comb peaks are shifted, however, depending on the emission angle of
electrons. While similar effect is observed already in the first-order
nondipole approximation, with increasing the laser field strength the
discrepancy with our exact results becomes more pronounced. Also, we observe
the additional substructure of the comb peaks arising in the angle-integrated
energy distributions of photoelectrons. Finally, as our numerical calculations
account for the atomic potential in the entire interaction region, we observe
the loss of coherence of comb structures with increasing the number of laser
pulses, that we attribute to rescattering.

Abstract: Parity mixing in photoionization, i.e. when emitted electrons have different
parities but the same energy, causes interference observable only in
angle-resolved measurements. The interference typically manifests as a symmetry
violation in the photoelectron angular distributions. The traditional, based on
HHG, RABBITT scheme with high-order harmonics separated by twice the seed field
energy, precludes parity mixing. On the contrary, a free-electron laser
provides a possibility to generate even harmonics. Using triple the fundamental
frequency as a seed, one obtains a comb of alternating even and odd harmonics,
separated by three times the initial frequency [Nature 578, 386-391 (2020)]
(2-SB RABBITT). In this setup, there are two sidebands between the main
photoelectron lines, versus one in the traditional scheme. In the paper, we
examine the general properties of a two-sideband scheme and analyze the
symmetry breakdown of photoelectron angular distributions for various
polarization geometries of the incident pulse. We found a crucial difference in
symmetries between 2-SB RABBITT and other photoionization schemes with parity
mixing. Illustrative calculations are carried out for neon with pulse
parameters typical for modern facilities. The possibility to reconstruct the
temporal profile of the pulse from the angle-resolved measurements is
discussed.
