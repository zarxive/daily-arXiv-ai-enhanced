This has been motivated by the high quality of data collected recently\nby programs such as the International Space Station (ISS), by the fundamental\nimportance of the topic, and by the unsatisfactory state of our understanding\nof the actual source of cosmic rays. A ``minor'' change in the Newtonian\ngravitational formulation converts solar production of high energy cosmic rays\nfrom ``impossible'' to ``likely'', without much disrupting the vast existent\ndomain of well understood astronomical gravitational processes. This change\nenables the sun to ``capture'' protons of energy so high that they would,\notherwise, escape the solar system. This change in Newton's gravitational\nformula would disrupt current cosmological understanding of missing mass and\ndark energy. With this changed understanding of gravity, it has been quite easy\nto produce a semi-quantitative understanding of the solar origin of cosmic rays\nup to energies at least as great as $10^6$\\,GeV/nucleon that have by now been\ndetected and measured so persuasively.

The perturbation is an external harmonic driver with a chosen small\namplitude and frequency (which is slightly detuned from the beam\neigenfrequency), that when engaged with the unperturbed beam oscillations,\ncauses it reach a state of \"injection pulling\" - an effect that occurs when one\nharmonic oscillator is coupled with a second one and causes it to oscillate in\na frequency near its own.

The\nprocess begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific\ntopological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed\nby two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen\natom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100\nfemtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving\nrise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated\nexcess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast\ncoupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the\nformation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can\nsurvive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of\nvisible photons.

Earlier work\nby Nelson, Kac and others have established that key quantum features such as\nthe Schr\\\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations together with the Born rule can be\nderived from classical random processes involving finite speeds and\nprobabilistic reversals. A fundamental length scale, inherent for dimensional\nconsistency, regularizes the infinities that typically plague conventional\nfield theories. The method can be used to quantize electrodynamics as well as\nlinear gravity, using the Riemann-Silberstein vector and its generalization.\n  To include fields beyond electromagnetism, the Riemann-Silberstein vector can\nbe generalized to describe non-Abelian gauge fields without relying on gauge\nsymmetry. These fields can be coupled to spin networks--geometric structures\nthat discretize space--leading to a unified framework that includes both matter\nand geometrty. In the large-scale limit, the model reproduces familiar quantum\nfield behaviour, while remaining finite and background-independent at the\nfundamental level. The emergence of equilibrium states resembling\nWheeler-DeWill constraints in gravity adds further depth, suggesting a novel\nroute to quantum gravity and unification grounded in physical

By exploiting\nthe linear scaling of the dimension of the decomposed amplitudes with respect\nto the system size $N$, one can reduce the computational cost of the method to\nthe level of $N^6$ and storage requirements to $N^4$. While in practice the\nproposed rank-reduced formalism introduces an error, we show that it is several\ntimes smaller than the inherent error of the parent theory with the proposed\ndefault settings for a wide range of problems. Higher level of accuracy can be\nachieved by increasing the value of a single parameter present in this\nformulation, recovering the canonical method in an appropriate limit. We\nillustrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed method by calculations\nfor a group of molecules with excited states of different character -- from\ndominated by single excitations with respect to the reference determinant to\nstates with moderate and large contribution of double and higher excitations.\nWe report calculations of potential energy curves and related spectroscopic\nparameters for the first four singlet excited states of magnesium dimer, as\nwell as the potential energy curve for the excited state of charge-transfer\ncharacter in the NH$_3$-F$_2$ complex as a function of intermolecular\nseparation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u964d\u9636\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Tucker\u5206\u89e3\u683c\u5f0f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u964d\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8db3\u591f\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Tucker\u5206\u89e3\u683c\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684triply-excited\u632f\u5e45\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u6309\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5355\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u591a\u6fc0\u53d1\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Crucial in the connection relations is\nthe phase acquired by the Floquet solutions by going from a (ir)regular\nsingularity to another. The new 'kink method' is exploited to compute the\nquantum momentum of the Floquet solutions as convergent series, explicitly at\nall orders. Hence, upon integrating it term by term, the acquired phase can be\nderived explicitly as a similar series. Since Heun equation and its confluences\ndescribe ${\\cal N}=2$ SYM theories in the NS background as quantisation of\nSeiberg-Witten differentials and also appear in perturbations of gravity\nsolutions, tests and predictions in both domains can be made. A very\nencouraging test is the matching of the acquired phase with the dual gauge\nperiod, $A_D$, as given by the Nekrasov instanton function.

The Tlalpan Interpretation (QTI) proposes that the\nwavefunction collapse is not a primitive, axiomatic rule but an emergent\nphenomenon, a spontaneous breaking of time symmetry triggered by amplification\nand record creation. The novelty of QTI lies in its embedding of collapse\nwithin the conceptual language of critical phenomena in statistical physics.\nThe theory introduces measurable parameters (the amplification fraction, the\nrecord asymmetry, and the retrocausal coherence time) that serve as order\nparameters describing the quantum-classical transition. Collapse is thus\ncharacterized not as a mysterious fiat but as a phase transition, with\nthresholds and scaling laws analogous to magnetization in ferromagnets. This\nperspective allows the interpretation to retain microscopic time symmetry and\nspatial locality, while attributing quantum correlations and Bell-type\nviolations to retrocausal boundary constraints rather than instantaneous action\nat a distance. Collapse corresponds to the granularization of trajectories: the\nconversion of smooth, time-symmetric quantum evolution into discrete,\nirreversible records. Most importantly, QTI is testable. It predicts: (1) sharp\nthreshold-like disappearance of interference when amplification exceeds a\ncritical value, (2) anomalously fast decay of reversibility in chaotic optical\ncavities compared with regular ones, and (3) qualitatively new interference\nfringes in a time-symmetric generalization of Moshinsky's diffraction in time.\nIf confirmed, these predictions would place collapse squarely in the realm of\nthermodynamic processes, removing the last \"mystical\" postulate from quantum\ntheory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We use a\nmean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of\nimpurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the\nimpurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant\napproach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced\nlocalisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then\nstudy the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the\nimpurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey\ninterferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of\nimpurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the\nuniversal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when\nthe mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show\nthat mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and\nthat bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance\nat low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our\nresults showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities\ndephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise\ntemperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86two mobile impurities\u5728ultracold fermionic gas\u4e2d painter \u7684\u76f8\uad00\u6027 decoherence\u52a8\u529b\u5b66.\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u81ea\u6d3d\u63cf\u8ff0impurity-gas\u78b0\u649e\u5bf9impurity\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd,\u540c\u65f6\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86impurity\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7684decoherence,\u4f7f\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5.\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b,\u968f\u7740impurities-gas\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0,impurities\u53d7\u5230\u73af\u5883\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316.\u7814\u7a76\u4e86non-equilibrium\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7531sudden\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u8d77,\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Ramsey\u5e72\u6d89\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u6d4b.\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e,\u5f53impurity\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6,impurities\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9decoherence\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5f3a\u504f\u5dee,\u504f\u79bb\u4e86Andersos\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027 Catastrophe\u666e\u904d\u884c\u4e3a.\u8fd8\u663e\u793a\u79fb\u52a8impurities\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u8ba1,\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u79fb\u52a8impurities\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd.\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8impurities\u5728\u5171\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2ddephasing\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66,\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8d85\u51b7 fermionic \u6df7\u5408\u7269\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1.", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u79fb\u52a8impurities\u5728\u8d85\u51b7 fermionic\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u76f8\u76f8\u5173 decoherence\u52a8\u529b\u5b66,\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6d3d\u63cf\u8ff0,\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7684decoherence,\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b,\u968f\u7740impurities-gas\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0,impurities\u53d7\u5230\u73af\u5883\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316;\u7814\u7a76\u4e86non-equilibrium\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7531sudden\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u8d77,\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Ramsey\u5e72\u6d89\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u6d4b;\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6,\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bbAndersos\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027 Catastrophe\u7684\u666e\u904d\u884c\u4e3a;\u79fb\u52a8impurities\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u8ba1,\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u5173\u8054\u6539\u5584\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8impurities\u5728\u5171\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2ddephasing\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027,\u4e3a\u8d85\u51b7\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc."}}

However, molecular\nsimulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become\ncomputationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale.\nField-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these\nlimitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these\napproaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the\nbottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular\nsystems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical\nfield models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical\nstep toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques.\nBy introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this\nhierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the\natomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important\nmicroscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical\nmodels in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles\nusing the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional\nfields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode\ntheory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond\nthe conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to\npositive Fourier modes.

Each detector has Transition Edge Sensors (TESs)\npatterned on the top and bottom faces of a large crystal substrate, with the\nTESs electrically grouped into six phonon readout channels per face. Noise\ncorrelations are expected among a detector's readout channels, in part because\nthe channels and their readout electronics are located in close proximity to\none another. Moreover, owing to the large size of the detectors, energy\ndeposits can produce vastly different phonon propagation patterns depending on\ntheir location in the substrate, resulting in a strong position dependence in\nthe readout-channel pulse shapes. Both of these effects can degrade the energy\nresolution and consequently diminish the dark matter search sensitivity of the\nexperiment if not accounted for properly. We present a new algorithm for pulse\nreconstruction, mathematically formulated to take into account correlated noise\nand pulse shape variations. This new algorithm fits N readout channels with a\nsuperposition of M pulse templates simultaneously - hence termed the N$\\times$M\nfilter. We describe a method to derive the pulse templates using principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and to extract energy and position information using a\ngradient boosted decision tree (GBDT). We show that these new N$\\times$M and\nGBDT analysis tools can reduce the impact from correlated noise sources while\nimproving the reconstructed energy resolution for simulated mono-energetic\nevents by more than a factor of three and for the 71Ge K-shell electron-capture\npeak recoils measured in a previous version of SuperCDMS called CDMSlite to $<$\n50 eV from the previously published value of $\\sim$100 eV.

Standard multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs) struggle with this task due to an inherent spectral bias,\npreventing them from fitting high-frequency sinusoids.

This reframes the learning\nproblem from approximating a complex function to finding a linear combination\nof basis functions. We demonstrate this method by training a Fourier Feature\nNetwork to predict the transmission matrix of a multimode fibre under\nmechanical compression. Compared to a standard MLP, our network reduces\nprediction error in the output field's amplitude and phase by an order of\nmagnitude, achieving a mean complex correlation of 0.995 with the ground truth,\ndespite using 85% fewer parameters.

In this paper, we introduce a perturbed\nColor Code Hamiltonian with a rich phase structure which can be well matched to\nthe mechanism of anyon condensation in the Color Code. We consider Color Code\nmodel defined on a three-colorable hexagonal lattice and add Ising interactions\nbetween spins corresponding to edges of the lattice. We show that Ising\ninteractions play the role of physical factor for condensing anyons in the\nColor Code. In particular, corresponding to three different colors of edges in\nthe hexagonal lattice, we consider three different coupling parameters. Then,\nwe are able to condense anyons with different colors by tuning power of Ising\ninteractions in the corresponding edges. In particular, we explicitly show that\ncondensation of one type of anyons in the Color Code leads to a phase\ntransition to the Toric Code state. On the other hand, by condensing two types\nof anyons, we observe a phase transition to a modified version of the Toric\nCode where partial set of anyons in the Toric Code are condensed and we call it\na partially topological phase. Our main method for derivation of the above\nresults is based on a suitable basis transformation on the main Hamiltonian in\nthe sense that our model is mapped onto three decoupled transverse-field Ising\nmodels, corresponding to the three colors. We use the above mapping to analyze\nbehavior of string order parameters as non-local indicators of topological\norder.

Our results indicate that at low\ninclination the astrometric observables extracted from the parametrized BH\nspacetimes considered are qualitatively similar to those extracted from the\nSchwarzschild one, with minor quantitative deviations caused by differences in\nthe size and position of the secondary images. On the other hand, the\npolarimetric observables at high inclination present qualitative differences,\nbut these are only visible for a short portion of the whole hot-spot orbit.\nFurthermore, the observables extracted from the JP parametrized BH models\ndeviate more prominently from those of the Schwarzschild model than the ones\nextracted from the KZ parametrized BH models, with the JP model with a positive\nfree parameter deviating the most among all models tested.

We derive the analytical formula of\nthe proposed procedure and numerically confirm its validity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u660e\u667a\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u5b50\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u5149 interference\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u76f8\u90bb\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u79bb\u5b50\u9677\u9631\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u8c03\u63a7\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u548c beamsplitter \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u76f8\u90bb\u79bb\u5b50\u9677\u9631\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8c03\u63a7\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u8c03\u63a7\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
