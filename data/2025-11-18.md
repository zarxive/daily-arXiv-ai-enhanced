Abstract: We perform laser spectroscopy of dysprosium monoxide (DyO) to determine the hyperfine structure of the ground X8 and excited [17.1]7 states in the $^{161}$Dy and $^{163}$Dy isotopologues. These dysprosium nuclei have non-zero nuclear spin and dynamical octupole deformation, which gives them high sensitivity to time-reversal-violating new physics via the nuclear Schiff moment (NSM). The DyO molecule was recently identified as being amenable to optical cycling -- the basis for many laser cooling and quantum control techniques -- which makes it a practical candidate for NSM searches. The measurements reported here are prerequisites to implementing optical cycling, designing precision measurement protocols, and benchmarking calculations of molecular sensitivity to symmetry-violating effects. The measured hyperfine parameters are interpreted using simple molecular orbital diagrams and show excellent agreement with relativistic quantum chemical calculations.

TL;DR: 研究了HeH+在强椭圆激光场中被电离的穿隧道机制，发现光电子动量分布具有两个不同的偏转角，对应于在一个激光周期中第一和第二半周期的电离事件。较大角度的电离须大于等于对称分子的电离势时，较小角度小于该对称分子的电离势。采用考虑永久电偶极矩和非对称库仑势的强场模型，能够定量模拟这些现象。发现永久电偶极矩能通过影响原子中的电子响应时间来调整第一半周期和第二半周期峰的相对大小和偏转角度。电子在核附近的激光脱出致密势也在子周期响应时间以及偏转角度中起到关键作用。该模型可用于定量研究强激光场中对称分子的穿隧道电离动力学。

Motivation: 研究原子和分子在强激光场中被电离的穿隧道机制及其动力学行为，是量子电子学和光物理研究的重要方向。

Method: 通过数值模拟和解析方法研究HeH+在强椭圆激光场中的被电离。考虑了永久电偶极矩和非对称库仑势的影响。使用激光脱出势模型来定量还原偏转角度和响应时间。

Result: HeH+在强椭圆激光场中被电离的穿隧道机制具有精细的子周期依赖性，这依赖于永久电偶极矩和核附近非对称库仑势的相互作用。模型成功预测了偏移角在第一和第二半周期的演化。

Conclusion: 文章提出了一种关于强椭圆激光场中HeH+被电离的穿隧道机制的强场模型，解释了偏移角的子周期依赖性，并提供了对电离动力学的新见解。

Abstract: We study tunneling ionization of HeH+ in strong elliptical laser fields numerically and analytically. The calculated photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) show two different offset angles corresponding to ionization events occurring in the first and the second half cycles of one laser cycle. When the larger angle is greater than the angle of a model symmetric molecule with a similar ionization potential to the polar molecule, the smaller angle is smaller than the symmetric molecule. Using a developed strong-field model that consider effects of both the permanent dipole (PD) and the asymmetric Coulomb potential, we are able to quantitatively reproduce these phenomena. We show that the PD effect can increase (decrease) the response time of electrons within polar molecules to light in photoemission, thereby increasing (decreasing) the offset angle related to the first (second) half cycle of a laser cycle. The laser-dressed asymmetric Coulomb potential near the atomic nuclei also plays an important role in the sub-cycle-related response time and offset angle. This model may be useful for quantitatively studying attosecond ionization dynamics of polar molecules in strong laser fields.

TL;DR: 研究了二氧化碳红外发射的二阶强度相关性 $g^{(2)}(τ)$，在 10 厘米无涂覆和无缓冲气体的钠原子蒸气环境中，使用双色光激发（589.2 nm 和 569.0 nm）。在正向和正反向方向上分别测得 2.34 μm 和 2.21 μm 的方向性发射。所有情况下的 $g^{(2)}(0)$ 值均超过 1，但远低于 2 的理论值，即热光限值。正向和反向传播的 2.21 μm 光在不同实验条件下表现出高度相关性。观察到 $g^{(2)}(τ)$ 在大范围内经历振荡特征，振荡频率随激光功率变化，这与 AC 唯石位移有关，原子速度组中的超精细结构在 Doppler 淼 Directors 散射存在时也起作用。研究证明，所观察的中红外发射源于连续激光和集体放大受激发的相互配合过程。光相关性和正反向发射对称性的观察结果源于长期振荡偶极相干的建立和选择性速度原子组的耦合。向后发射在激光导航光标和亚球层外感测等领域有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We report on measurements of second-order intensity correlations $g^{(2)}(τ)$ of infrared emission under bichromatic excitation at 589.2\,nm and 569.0\,nm of sodium atoms contained in a buffer-gas-free and uncoated 10-cm-long vapor cell. Directional emissions at $2.34\,μ$m in the forward direction and $2.21\,μ$m in both forward and backward directions under different experimental parameters are considered for this study. The measured values of $g^{(2)}(0)$ in all cases are found to exceed unity, while remaining significantly below the thermal light limit of 2. Cross-correlation measurements reveal that forward- and backward-propagating $2.21\,μ$m radiations are correlated. Oscillatory features in $g^{(2)}(τ)$ are observed over a broad range of excitation powers, and the dependence of the oscillation frequency on laser power can be attributed to AC Stark shifts, with contributions from hyperfine atomic structure in selected atomic velocity groups even in the presence of Doppler broadening. Our study establishes that the observed mid-infrared emission arises from a phase-matched, continuous-wave cooperative process that combines features of lasing and collective amplified spontaneous emission. The results highlight the buildup of long-range dipole coherence and velocity-selective coupling of atomic groups, which together govern the observed photon correlations and forward-backward emission symmetry. The demonstrated backward emission is of particular interest for applications in laser guidestar generation and mesospheric remote sensing, where understanding the statistical properties of the emitted light is essential for optimizing sodium-based light sources.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental breakthroughs toward a realization of a solid-state Thorium-229 nuclear clock, we review the technology, basic physics motivation, and limitations of the present generation of atomic clocks. We then discuss prospects for a new generation of clocks based on an anomalous low-energy 8.4 eV nuclear transition in Th-229, with an extremely long lifetime of 641 seconds when doped into CaF crystals. To realize such solid-state nuclear clocks one must confront basic nuclear, AMO, and solid state physics questions. Key challenges are understanding and minimizing the effects of inhomogeneous broadening, associated with strains and electric field gradients due to both the Th dopants and intrinsic crystal defects.

TL;DR: This study examines the spin relaxation dynamics of Yb³⁺ ions in Y₂SiO₅ crystals, crucial for quantum memory applications. At cryogenic temperatures (~1 K), the ions exhibit slow re-thermalization (~few hours), driven by phonon interactions. However, individual spin states have shorter lifetimes (several seconds to milliseconds) due to strong spin-spin interactions. The findings suggest that optimizing doping levels and operating temperatures can enable atomic frequency combs with lifetimes of several hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum memory applications rely on atomic frequency combs, which are highly dependent on the spin relaxation dynamics of rare-earth ions. Understanding and optimizing these dynamics is essential for improving the efficiency and storage time of quantum memory protocols.

Method: The study involved optically perturbing the spin population distribution and monitoring the re-thermalization process through optical absorption spectroscopy. Different types of perturbations allowed the distinction between spin-phonon and spin-spin interaction-induced relaxation processes.

Result: Below 1 K, the re-thermalization of the Yb³⁺ ion population takes several hours, driven by phonon absorption or emission. However, the individual spin states have much shorter lifetimes (several seconds to milliseconds) due to spin-spin interactions.

Conclusion: These results provide guidelines for optimizing doping levels and operating temperatures in rare-earth-doped crystals to enhance quantum memory applications, suggesting that high-quality Y₂SiO₅ crystals with slight doping can support atomic frequency combs with lifetimes in the range of several hours at near-1 K.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of spin relaxation dynamics at cryogenic temperatures in a rare-earth-doped crystal used for quantum memory applications: $^{171}$Yb:Y$_2$SiO$_5$. Spin relaxation is indeed a major limiting factor for both the efficiency and storage time of quantum memory protocols based on atomic frequency combs in rare-earth materials. The relaxation dynamics among the four ground-state hyperfine levels were simultaneously investigated by optically perturbing the spin population distribution and monitoring its return to thermal equilibrium through optical absorption spectroscopy. By applying different types of perturbations, we were also able to distinguish between two types of relaxation processes, induced by spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions.
  Below 1 K, we observed that the re-thermalization of the Yb$^{3+}$ ion population takes several hours, driven solely by direct phonon absorption or emission. However, the effective lifetime of individual spin states is much shorter - on the order of several seconds in low-doped (2 ppm) samples and of milliseconds in 10 ppm samples - due to spin-spin interactions. These findings provide valuable guidelines for optimizing doping levels and operating temperatures in rare-earth-doped crystals for quantum applications. Notably, they suggest that atomic frequency combs with lifetimes of several hours could be realized using $^{171}$Yb:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals with slightly less than 2 ppm doping and operating near 1 K.

Abstract: We derive an analog of the Lellouch-Lüscher (LL) relation for few-body bosonic systems, linking few-body scattering loss rates to the energies and widths of the corresponding harmonically trapped few-body states. Three-body numerical simulations show that the LL relation applies across a broad range of interaction strengths and energies and allows the determination of scattering rates within a single partial wave. Our work establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the role of the finite volume effect in few-body observables in optical lattice and tweezer experiments, enabling precise determination of multi-body scattering rates.

Motivation: 探索few-body量子系统中的普遍现象，如Efimov效应，对于理解弱束缚系统至关重要。

Result: 有限截断的有效范围在首要阶就准确模仿了实验模型，即便在次要阶也实现了高精度。

Conclusion: 有限截断的有效场论提供了描述弱束缚量子系统效率高的框架，平均了实验势模型与理论模型。

Abstract: Small clusters of $^4$He atoms provide a paradigmatic setting for exploring universal phenomena in few-body quantum systems with large scattering length. Their weakly bound states serve as ideal test cases for studying Efimov physics and the emergence of universality beyond the three-body sector. In this work, we investigate few-$^4$He systems within a finite-cutoff effective field theory (EFT) framework. The EFT interactions are calibrated to reproduce low-energy observables obtained from the realistic LM2M2 potential, enabling a direct and systematic comparison between the two approaches. We demonstrate that, for suitably chosen finite cutoffs, the empirical effective range is accurately reproduced already at leading order, achieving next-to-leading-order precision without explicit higher-order corrections. Using these interactions, we solve the Schrödinger equation for systems of a few atoms, obtaining binding energies and scattering observables in excellent agreement with results derived from realistic interatomic potentials. In particular, we compute atom--tetramer scattering parameters and binding energies of clusters up to eight atoms, thereby extending the EFT description to larger helium systems. Our findings establish a quantitative bridge between realistic helium potentials and finite-cutoff EFT, showing that the latter provides an efficient and predictive framework for describing few-body universality in weakly bound quantum systems.

*RuGway Wu,Maximilian Prüfer,Jörg Schmiedmayer*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how interactions fundamentally alter matter-wave optics, leading to nonlinear quantum phenomena such as interaction-dependent diffraction and enhanced quantum metrology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum phenomena and their applications in quantum metrology.

Method: Analysis of ultracold quantum gases and their interference effects.

Result: Interactions lead to nonlinear effects in matter-wave optics and enhance quantum sensitivity.

Conclusion: Interactions open new possibilities for advanced quantum technologies.

Abstract: Matter-wave optics is often viewed as a linear analogue of photonics, where noninteracting particles are coherently split, diffracted, and recombined, and interference arises from single-particle coherence. In ultracold quantum gases, however, interactions are intrinsic and can rival or exceed kinetic and optical energy scales. This drives matter-wave optics into a nonlinear regime: diffraction and momentum distributions become interaction-dependent, interference contrast degrades or collapses, and revival dynamics appear. In the mean time, interactions can generate squeezing and entanglement, enabling sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit. We showcase representative examples - covering diffraction, splitting, and interferometry - that illustrate how interactions reshape the basic elements of matter-wave optics and open new opportunities for nonlinear quantum technologies.

Conclusion: 这项研究扩展了埃伦费斯特定理的应用范围，并提供了修正后的理论来描述在有限区域中量子系统的运动。该结论为 trap 在盒势的 Bose-Einstein 凝聚体的研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: It is known that the usual form of the Ehrenfest theorem (ET), which couples the motion of the center of mass (COM) of the one-dimensional (1D) wave function to the respective classical equation of motion, is not valid in the case of the potential box, confined by the zero boundary conditions. A modified form of the ET was proposed for this case, which includes an effective force originating from the interaction of the 1D quantum particle with the box edges. In this work, we derive an amended ET for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which includes the cubic nonlinear term, as well as for the 2D square-shaped potential box. In the latter case, we derive an amended COM equation of motion with an effective force exerted by the edges of the rectangular box, while the nonlinear term makes no direct contribution to the 1D and 2D versions of the ET. Nonetheless, the nonlinearity affects the amended ET through the edge-generated force. As a result, the nonlinearity of the underlying GPE can make the COM motion in the potential box irregular. The validity of the amended ET for the 1D and 2D GPEs with the respective potential boxes is confirmed by the comparison of numerical simulations of the underlying GPE and the corresponding amended COM equation of motion. The reported findings are relevant to the ongoing experiments carried out for atomic Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in the box potentials.

Abstract: We introduce a GPU-accelerated variational framework with exact projection onto the Lowest Landau Level to probe vortex patterns in rapidly rotating two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. For repulsive interactions, our approach faithfully reproduces Abrikosov vortex lattices, achieving quantitative alignment with Thomas-Fermi theory and the Abrikosov constant, while underscoring the profound analogy between superfluid vortex ordering and Abrikosov lattices in type-II superconductors. In the attractive regime, we reveal that weak attractions sustain stable vortex arrays, whereas stronger attractions quench vortices, trigger radial contraction, and culminate in collapse at the Gagliardo-Nirenberg threshold. These findings deliver a cohesive numerical benchmark for vortex formation and collapse dynamics, forging a rigorous link between superfluidity and superconductivity in rotating quantum matter.

Abstract: Lattice spin models featuring kinetic constraints constitute a paradigmatic setting for the investigation of glassiness and localization phenomena. The intricate dynamical behavior of these systems is a result of the dramatically reduced connectivity between many-body configurations. This truncation of transition pathways often leads to a fragmentation of the Hilbert space, yielding highly collective and therefore often slow dynamics. Moreover, this mechanism supports the formation of characteristic elementary excitations, which we investigate here theoretically in a two-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas. We explore their properties as a function of interaction strength and range, and illustrate how they can be experimentally probed via sideband spectroscopy. Here, we show that the transition rate to certain delocalized superposition states of elementary excitations displays collective many-body enhancement.

Abstract: We investigate the Lieb--Liniger model of interacting one-dimensional bosons coupled to a localized impurity, modeled by a delta barrier. While the Lieb--Liniger gas is integrable, the impurity breaks integrability and induces a transition towards quantum chaos. We show that the low-energy spectrum exhibits random-matrix statistics, in striking contrast to the Bohigas--Giannoni--Schmit conjecture, where chaotic behavior typically emerges at high energy. For two bosons, the odd-parity sector remains integrable, whereas the even-parity sector displays clear signatures of chaos at low energy and a crossover back to quasi-integrable behavior at higher energies. For three bosons, both parity sectors exhibit spectral statistics close to chaos at low energy. We argue that this unconventional form of many-body quantum chaos originates from diffractive processes induced by the impurity.

TL;DR: Phonons in 1D Bose gases remain robust even under strong excitations due to their rich physics supporting collective excitations without dissipation beyond linear scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of collective excitations, particularly phonons, in one-dimensional quantum systems is crucial for advancing our knowledge of quantum many-body phenomena, especially in regimes where dissipation is expected or observed.

Method: The study employs a combination of direct excitation of phonon modes in a weakly interacting 1D Bose gas and subsequent monitoring of their time evolution using linear response techniques and nonlinear Schrödinger equation simulations.

Result: Key findings reveal that phonon modes exhibit minimal damping even under strong excitations, with damping rates consistent with Andreev's hydrodynamic predictions in the linear response regime. In the nonlinear regime, wave breaking and other complex dynamic behaviors are observed.

Conclusion: This experimental and theoretical work provides a comprehensive understanding of phonon behavior in 1D Bose gases, confirming their resilience to dissipation and offering insights into the onset of nonlinear regimes in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Collective excitations in one-dimensional (1D) quantum fluids are expected to propagate almost without dissipation. Here we directly excite phonon modes in a weakly interacting 1D Bose gas and study their time evolution. In the linear response regime, damping is surprisingly fast and quantitatively follows the non-analytic scaling predicted by Andreev's hydrodynamic description. For stronger excitations, we observe a crossover to a highly nonlinear regime characterized by wave breaking, captured by the finite-temperature nonlinear Schrödinger evolution. Our results resolve a long-standing question on the fate of phonons in 1D Bose gases, and open new pathways to study non-linear relaxation in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We theoretically explore the electronic structure of holes in cylindrical Germanium/Silicon core/shell nanowires using a perturbation theory approach. The approach yields a set of interpretable and transferable effective low-energy models for the lowest few sub-bands up to fifth order for experimentally relevant growth directions. In particular, we are able to resolve higher order cross terms e.g., the dependency of the effective mass on the magnetic field. Our study reveals orbital inversions of the lowest sub-bands for low-symmetry growth directions, leading to significant changes of the lower order effective coefficients. We demonstrate a reduction of the direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction due to competing symmetry effects for low-symmetry growth directions. Finally, we find that the effective mass of the confined holes can diverge yielding quasi flat bands interesting for correlated states. We show how one can tune the effective mass of a single spin band allowing one to tune the effective mass selectively to its divergent points.

Abstract: We describe two 3D-printing approaches for realizing tight-binding models in acoustic metamaterials using H-shaped resonators: a modular system with tunable interconnections and an integrated one-piece design for reducing dissipation. The platform supports both positive and negative coupling through geometric control, enabling accurate acoustic analogs of topological models.

Abstract: Understanding O2 bubble nucleation and growth during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to comprehend their influences on catalytically active sites in the process. To achieve this goal, mapping the spatial variation of nanoscale dynamic individual steps at the electrocatalytic interfaces is vital, as it further enables a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the process. Here, we combined tapping mode AFM imaging with a Pt ultramicroelectrode to investigate oxygen bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment. Our AFM feedback error signal and topography data reveal that bubbles of O2 gas nucleate at the step edge sites and interact with the catalytically active sites. This interaction between primary catalytic sites and bubble nucleation sites is the primary reason for a decrease in the current density at a given high overpotential of the OER. Our findings advance the understanding of the complexity of phenomena involved in gas evolution on catalytic surfaces.

Abstract: Understanding charge transport in networks of two-dimensional crystals is essential for developing reliable applications such as chemiresistors or electromagnetic shields. For this purpose, intra- and inter-flake contributions to the network resistance must be disentangled. MXenes, such as Ti3C2Tx, are prime examples of 2D crystals often employed as thin networks of interconnected flakes deposited on substrates to realize functional devices. While a significant number of studies focused on transport in individual MXene flakes, inter-flake transport remains scarcely explored. Here, we demonstrate that charge transport in multi-flake conductive paths of Ti3C2Tx is dominated by interflake junctions and provide quantitative estimates of junction resistances. Scanning probe measurements reveal that in a MXene multi-flake conductive path, individual flakes behave as isopotential domains, since the voltage drop is localized precisely at the inter-flake junctions. We further investigate the chemiresistive response to humidity at the single flake, multi-flake and flake network scale, evidencing the leading impact of junctions on sensing kinetics. These findings underline the crucial role of junctions in charge transport and sensing capabilities of MXenes.

Abstract: This work treats the dynamics of pairs of microelectromechanical ultrasound transducers (MUTs) that are immersed in water and acoustically coupled through the fluid medium. A series of these transducer pairs with varying diameters (and thus resonance frequency) and pitch separation (and thus coupling strength) are fabricated and measured. The work presented here models and quantifies the open-loop coupling between the MEMS transducer pairs and its dependence on pitch. Furthermore, a gain feedback loop is systematically applied to one of the device pair and the dynamics of the acoustically-coupled gain-loss system is investigated, and the formation of an exceptional-point or of an Hopf bifurcation is equally used to quantify the coupling coefficient. This work provides an experimental study of acoustic coupling in MUT transducers, as well as an exploration of the formation of exceptional points in acoustically-coupled MEMS transducers.

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal $|C|>1$ flat bands can be viewed as color-entangled composites of $C$ lowest Landau levels, but in realistic moiré systems non-ideal quantum geometry complicates this picture, leaving their stabilization mechanism incompletely understood. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a platform, we observe two FCIs joined by a continuous transition controlled by continuum model parameter $κ$, arising from a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions. For $κ$ below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable and effectively decomposes into two independent $C=1$ color sectors. Although the flat band is non-ideal, the resulting fractional phase is naturally accounted for by the non-chiral Halperin-(112) state with counterpropagating edge modes. Above the transition, the system enters a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this robustness, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: when the Bloch wave function is geometrically unstable, interactions dynamically split a non-ideal flat band into an ideal subcomponent that hosts the FCI and non-ideal remnants. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a "color separator," explicitly visualizing the ideal subcomponent at the single-particle level. Together, these results establish two different routes by which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, expanding their viable parameter space and clarifying the interplay between geometry and topological order.

Abstract: One of the characteristics of disordered semiconductors is the slow thermalization of charge carriers after excitation due to photoabsorption or high electric fields. An elegant way to capture the effects of the latter on the conductivity is through a field-dependent effective electronic temperature T_eff that can significantly exceed that of the lattice. Despite its elegance, its actual use has been limited, which, at least in part, can be attributed to the concept originating from computer simulations; experimental confirmations have largely been indirect (through scaling of conductivity) and did not establish that T_eff equals the real temperature of the electron distribution. Moreover, it has hardly been tested for important classes of disordered materials, including quantum dot solids. Here, we investigate whether the effective temperature concept is applicable to quantum dot solids, using zinc oxide as relevant model system. To verify that field-driven conductivity increases indeed reflect an actual increase of the electronic temperature, we combine direct and indirect measurements of T_eff: we convert conductivity changes at high fields to an effective temperature that we show to be consistent with a direct measurement of the electronic temperature using the Seebeck effect. These results not only confirm the relevance of the effective temperature concept to quantum dot solids but also confirm its general physical reality and open the way to systematic investigations into charge carrier (de)localization in disordered media.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spintronics applications rely on reliable magnetization reversal without explicit symmetry breaking, making this research particularly relevant for next-generation computing technologies.

Method: Using vector spherical harmonics expansion and first-principles calculations on the noncentrosymmetric Weyl ferromagnet PrAlGe, the researchers demonstrated the dominance of higher-order torque terms.

Result: The study shows that higher-order spin-orbit torque can reliably switch the magnetization without additional symmetry breaking, with conventional lowest-order torques being relatively weak due to a small Fermi surface.

Conclusion: This work establishes higher-order spin-orbit torque as a key factor in understanding and controlling magnetization dynamics in topological materials, offering a promising approach for deterministic switching in spintronic applications.

Abstract: Field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular ferromagnets is a central challenge for spintronics applications, typically requiring explicit symmetry breaking. Here we show that deterministic switching can instead be achieved through higher-order (in magnetization angles) spin-orbit torques, even in systems that preserve in-plane mirror symmetry. Using a vector spherical harmonics expansion, we demonstrate that higher-order torque terms naturally give rise to additional out-of-equator fixed points, enabling reliable magnetization reversal when their magnitude is comparable to conventional lowest-order torques. We illustrate this mechanism with first-principles calculations on the noncentrosymmetric Weyl ferromagnet PrAlGe, where the combination of Weyl-node band topology and strong spin-orbit coupling produces sizable higher-order torque components. Because the Fermi surface is small, the conventional lowest-order torques are relatively weak, allowing the higher-order harmonics to compete on equal footing and strongly reshape the magnetization dynamics. The resulting spin dynamics confirm deterministic switching without additional symmetry breaking. Our results establish higher-order spin-orbit torque as a key ingredient for understanding and controlling magnetization dynamics in topological and spintronic materials.

Conclusion: 提供了一个新的热传输机制，可以用于在无需改变界面结构的情况下提高热传递效率。

Abstract: The presence of interfaces in semiconductor devices substantially hinders thermal transport, contributing disproportionately to the overall thermal resistance. However, approaches to enhance interfacial thermal transport remain scarce without changing the interface structure, as the intrinsic electron and phonon properties of constituent materials set an upper limit. Here, we find a new thermal transport pathway, electronic heat tunneling, to enhance interfacial thermal conductance through metal-insulator-semiconductor junctions. By applying photoexcitation or bias voltage, we observe remarkable thermal conductance increases in operando, opening a new channel for efficient interfacial heat dissipation. The electron quantum tunneling pathway is parallel to conventional phonon-mediated interfacial thermal transport, and violates the Wiedemann-Franz law since this pathway deviates from the paradigm of diffusive transport. Moreover, we develop a tunneling mismatch model to describe the enhanced thermal conductance, originating from tunneling heat flux. Our Letter demonstrates a previously unexplored heat transport mechanism to enhance thermal conductance, bypassing the need for interface engineering. These findings emphasize the essential need to understand semiconductor thermal properties under realistic operating conditions.

Abstract: Interlayer sliding, together with twist angle, is a crucial parameter that defines the atomic registry and thus determines the properties of two-dimensional (2D) material homobilayers. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that controlled interlayer sliding in bilayer graphene induces Berry curvature reversals, leading to topological states confined within a one-dimensional moiré channel. We experimentally realize interlayer sliding by bending the bilayer graphene geometry across a nanoridge. Systematic electronic transport measurements reveal topological valley transport when the Fermi energy resides within the band gap, consistent with theoretical predictions of eight topological channels. Our findings establish interlayer sliding as a powerful tool for tuning the electronic properties of bilayer graphene and underscore its potential for broad application across 2D material systems.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper reports the observation of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The magnetism was confirmed via scanning NV center microscopy, and the zGNR was fabricated into a transistor, where magneto-transport measurements revealed coherent transport through the channel with a large magnetoresistance of ~175 Ω (~1.3% ratio). The magneto-transport signal is anisotropic and persists above room temperature, providing evidence for robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. This finding offers an effective platform for future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to experimentally confirm the existence of magnetic conduction channels along zigzag edges of graphene, which have been predicted theoretically. The motivation is driven by the potential applications of these magnetic channels in spintronic devices.

Method: Zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) were embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) to stabilize their edges. The presence of magnetism was confirmed using scanning NV center microscopy. A zGNR-based transistor was fabricated with specific dimensions, and magneto-transport measurements were performed to observe the magneto-resistance effects. The results were analyzed using Fabry-Pérot interference patterns and magnetoresistance ratios.

Result: The key experimental results include the confirmation of magnetism in zGNR edges, the observation of coherent transport in the fabricated transistor, and the measurement of a large magnetoresistance (~175 Ω) with significant anisotropy and persistence above room temperature. These findings validate the theoretical predictions about the magnetic electronic states in zigzag graphene nanoribbons and demonstrate their potential for spintronic applications.

Conclusion: This paper experimentally confirms the existence of intrinsic magnetic ordering in zigzag graphene nanoribbons embedded in hexagonal boron nitride. The results provide direct evidence of magnetic conduction channels along the zigzag edges of graphene and highlight the potential for integrating these materials into graphene-based spintronic devices. Because magnetoresistance effects are observed in the zGNR-based transistor and persist above room temperature, this work opens new avenues for exploring and utilizing the magnetic properties of graphene edges for future spintronic devices.

Abstract: Zigzag edges of graphene have long been predicted to exhibit magnetic electronic state near the Fermi level, which can cause spin-related phenomena and offer unique potentials for graphene-based spintronics. However, the magnetic conduction channels along these edges have yet been reported experimentally. Here, we report the observation on signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-Pérot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 Ω, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. The findings on zGNR embedded in h-BN provide an effective platform for the future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices.

Abstract: We investigate quantum inverse problems in one-dimensional (1D) electronic disordered systems strongly coupled to optical cavities. More specifically, we consider the Anderson and the Aubry-Andre-Harper models connected to electronic reservoirs and embedded in a single-mode optical cavity. The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-André-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the quantum inverse problem provides a robust diagnostic tool for quantum materials, particularly effective for systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions.

Abstract: We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.

Result: Dual diode effects (Josephson and Bloch diodes) with asymmetric current-voltage characteristics are observed and theoretically predicted in the setup.

Conclusion: This research provides a platform for exploring and implementing nonreciprocal effects in future electronic devices using existing superconducting quantum circuits.

Abstract: In a SQUID tuned away from half-integer flux (in units of the superconducting flux quantum), the concurrence of multiple Josephson harmonics and an asymmetry between the junctions leads to the Josephson diode effect -- a nonreciprocal current-voltage characteristic manifested as an asymmetry of critical currents at opposite polarities. We predict a dual version of this effect in a gate-tunable Cooper pair transistor placed in series with a highly resistive environment. When tuned away from half-integer gate charge (in units of the Cooper pair charge) it shows an asymmetry of critical voltages at opposite polarities -- a dual diode effect we refer to as the Bloch diode effect. It arises from an asymmetry in the dispersion of the transistor's Bloch bands. A highly resistive environment can be realized with a Josephson junction array, suggesting that such a diode could be implemented using conventional superconducting quantum circuits.

Here, we explore the transport properties of a multi-site QH circuit with special focus on that with four sites, and report their unique quantum critical behaviors that can be accessed via transport measurements. Tunneling phenomena in multichannel QH circuits based on multi-site geometry are also investigated, and a promising route to realizing different aspects of quantum critical phenomena is offered

Abstract: We investigate exciton confinement to a quantum wire in monolayer $\text{MoSe}_2$ where the confinement is achieved by a p-i-n junction. We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters. We find that the confined states can be divided into bright and dark states with the dark states having small but finite oscillator strengths. Their oscillator strengths are low enough that they have not yet been detected in experiments, whereas the spectrum of the bright exciton states reproduces recent experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the theoretical background of confined exciton states beyond the ground state and pave the way for the development of new confinement schemes as well as avenues to access the previously not detected dark states.

Abstract: Coexistence of nontrivial topology and flat electronic bands in low-energy lattices provides a fertile platform for correlated quantum states. The square-octagon lattice hosts Dirac nodes and flat bands at half-filling, yet the influence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered magnetic flux on its topological and flat-band properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine this lattice using tight-binding models that include SOC and magnetic flux, uncovering a quantum spin Hall phase with spin Chern number $C_s=1$, crossovers to quantum anomalous Hall phases with $C=1$ and $C=2$, and higher-order topological insulator phases carrying quantized quadrupolar corner charges. The initially dispersionless flat bands evolve into quasi-flat, topologically nontrivial bands with uniform quantum geometry and large flatness ratios, conducive to fractional Chern insulator states. We further identify realistic material candidates, including octagraphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, synthetic $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and magnetic $α$-MnO$_2$, as potential candidates for realizing tunable topological phases intertwined with flat-band physics, opening new opportunities for correlated topological matter.

TL;DR: SA-MOKE Microscopy enables imaging of magnetic thin-films with opaque metallic layers, achieving cm-scale imaging via spin accumulation detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imaging magnetic thin-films with opaque layers is challenging; this technique solves the substrate transparency issue.

Method: SA-MOKE uses spin accumulation generation and detection through magnetic layers, even in thick metallic environments.

Result: Optical signals decay over 60 nm, allowing detection up to hundreds of nm.

Conclusion: This method opens new possibilities in fields like spintronics and magnetism with practical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Magnetic imaging techniques are widespread critical tools used in fields such as magnetism, spintronics or even superconductivity. Among them, one of the most versatile methods is the magneto-optical Kerr effect. However, as soon as light is blocked from interacting with the magnetic layer, such as in deeply buried layers, optical techniques become ineffective. In this work, we present a spin-accumulation based magneto-optical Kerr effect (SA-MOKE) microscopy technique that enables imaging of a magnetic thin-films covered by thick and opaque metallic layers. The technique is based on the generation and detection of transient spin-accumulations that propagate through the thick metallic layer. These spin-accumulation signals are directly triggered and detected optically on the same side, lifting any substrate transparency requirements. The spin-accumulation signals detected on a Cu layer decay with a characteristic length of 60 nm, much longer than the 12 nm optical penetration depth, allowing for detection of magnetic contrast with Cu capping layers up to hundreds of nm. This method should enable magnetic imaging in a wide-range of experiments where the surface of interest is covered by electrodes.

Abstract: Multi-terminal Josephson junction with three or more superconductors is an attractive quantum system to emerge and tune exotic electronic states. In four terminal Josephson junctions, the Weyl physics, namely topologically protected zero energy state, emerges without assuming any exotic materials. In this study, we consider the four-terminal Josephson junction with the quantum point contact structures between the mesoscopic normal region and four superconducting terminals. The quantum point contacts can tune electrically the number of conduction channels. We theoretically investigate an effect of the increase of channels on the emergence of Weyl points. The increase of channels causes the increase of Andreev bound states in the system, which increase the emergence probability of Weyl points. When all terminals have two channels, the emergence probability is up to 17\%, which is about four times larger than that for all single channel junctions. We consider the balance of the number of conduction channels in the four terminals. When the number of channels is unbalanced, the increase of emergence probability is suppressed.

Abstract: Macroscopic modeling of a non-crimp fabric's (NCF's) forming behavior is challenging as it strongly depends on the textile architecture, fiber type, and stitching type. While shear is the main deformation mode of woven fabrics, membrane modeling approaches for NCFs should also consider stitching deformation and roving slippage. However, for 0{\textdegree}/90{\textdegree} biaxial NCFs (Biax-NCF) with a symmetrical stitching pattern and high stitch pretension, deviations from a pure-shear assumption in coupon tests are only observed at higher shear angles due to limited roving slippage. In this work, a hyperelastic approach initially proposed for unidirectional NCFs is adopted for a tricot stitched 0{\textdegree}/90{\textdegree} Biax-NCF based on a pure-shear assumption. The shear behavior is experimentally characterized through 45{\textdegree} off-axis-tension tests, and the parameterization is derived from energetic approaches originally developed for woven fabrics. This approach efficiently and adequately describes the general behavior in forming simulations of different geometries. Fiber orientation and location of areas with high shear angles are predicted well, but the peak shear angles are overestimated due to the neglected roving slippage.

Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.

Abstract: We establish the analytic structure of the S-matrix in the complex-frequency plane for classical wave scattering on a Schwarzschild background in four space-time dimensions. Our argument relies on the analytic continuation of the gravitational potential, with the singularity behind the horizon playing a crucial role. We find that in the lower half-plane the partial-wave amplitudes are analytic except for the quasinormal-mode poles and the branch cut associated with late-time tails. As a direct consequence of causality, the retarded Green's function and absorption amplitude are analytic in the upper-half plane. We show, however, that Stokes phenomena can obstruct this analyticity domain from carrying over to the elastic amplitude, which instead develops a branch-cut in the upper-half plane. We also determine the effect of infrared (IR) regulators on the analytic structure, showing that polynomial boundedness requires a sharp lower bound on the IR cutoff in terms of the Schwarzschild radius.

Abstract: We investigate the physics of the E-string theory and its compactifications as well as their applications to four-dimensional topology. In particular, we compute the partition function of the topologically twisted theory on $M_4\times T^2$, where $M_4$ is a four-manifold. In a range of examples, we verify that this partition function, as a $q$-series, 1) has integral coefficients, 2) is modular, and 3) can be lifted to a topological modular form. Remarkably, the E-string theory "knows" about various subtle aspects of the world of smooth 4-manifolds, as the (topological) modularity of the partition function is contingent on a collection of properties of 4-manifolds and their Seiberg-Witten invariants, including, notably, the simple-type conjecture. Furthermore, both theoretical and empirical evidences indicate that this partition function defines a genuine smooth invariant, even when $b_2^+\le 1$. Therefore, the E-string theory may offer powerful new tools for exploring regions in the geography of 4-manifolds that have been inaccessible to existing invariants obtained from gauge theory and quantum field theory.

Abstract: We study the large $N$ limit of the spectral duality between the classical $\mathfrak{gl}_M$ XXX spin chain and the $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ trigonometric Gaudin model in its rational reduced form. The infinite-dimensional limit of the Gaudin model is constructed within the framework of the noncommutative torus algebra, following the approach of Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen. In this formulation, the matrix dynamical variables are promoted to fields on the torus, and the corresponding Lax equations acquire the Moyal star-product structure. The dual model is obtained as the large $N$ limit of the $\mathfrak{gl}_M$ classical XXX spin chain with $N$ sites, represented by Laurent series satisfying a quadratic $r$-matrix relation associated with the rational solution of the classical Yang--Baxter equation.

*Damien A. Easson*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper provides a complete understanding of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole evaporation in 2D dilaton gravity, including the effects of anomaly-induced backreaction. They show that Hawking radiation drives entropy growth and satisfy the generalized second law. The system reaches a steady state where black hole and cosmological horizons exchange energy until their surface gravities match, leading to the Nariai limit where horizons coincide. Quantum effects are also discussed in the Page curve and entanglement islands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is unclear from the abstract.

Method: They start from four-dimensional Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant, perform dimensional reduction to 2D, construct a solvable model with Polyakov action, and analyze the evolution of black hole mass and geometry, Hawking flux, and thermodynamic observables. They also incorporate anomaly-induced backreaction and compute steady state properties.

Result: The results show that Hawking radiation drives entropy growth, generalized second law holds, and steady nonequilibrium state exists where black hole and cosmological horizons exchange energy. The results unify semiclassical thermodynamics and information flow in a cosmological setting.

Conclusion: This is a significant paper in black hole thermodynamics, providing a complete solution for SdS evaporation.

Abstract: We present a fully analytic treatment of Schwarzschild--de Sitter (SdS) black-hole evaporation in two-dimensional dilaton gravity with anomaly-induced backreaction. Starting from the spherical reduction of four-dimensional Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant, we construct an exactly solvable 2D model that captures the full causal and thermodynamic structure of the SdS static patch, including both black-hole and cosmological horizons. Incorporating the trace anomaly of $N$ conformal matter fields via the Polyakov action, we determine the evolution of the black-hole mass and geometry in the Unruh--de Sitter state, track the steady nonequilibrium Hawking flux, and compute local thermodynamic observables for static observers. The conserved Killing energy flux drives an irreversible heat current from the black hole to the cosmological horizon whenever their surface gravities differ, ensuring monotonic entropy growth and satisfaction of the generalized second law. We prove that $κ_b > κ_c$ throughout the physical static patch, so the only zero-flux configuration is the Nariai limit where the horizons coincide. Extending the framework to the quantum-information regime, we construct a thermally controlled estimate of the Page curve and show how quantum extremal surfaces and entanglement islands emerge naturally within the anomaly-induced steady state. These results constitute a fully analytic, backreacted solution for SdS evaporation that unifies semiclassical thermodynamics and information flow in a cosmological setting, thereby elucidating the ultimate fate of evaporating black holes in de Sitter space.

*Satish Ramakrishna*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper discusses a quantum field theory approach to solving the cosmological constant problem by introducing non-local terms that suppress the constant at low energies. The authors find that their theory aligns with experimental results, suggesting a potential resolution to the constant's discrepancy. They also propose connections to recent observational findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to offer a novel solution to the long-standing issue of the cosmological constant using quantum field theory methods, specifically addressing the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.

Method: The authors employ a regularization technique involving a cutoff in the wave-vector space to modify Einstein's equations and introduce non-linear, momentum-dependent terms. These modifications are analyzed in both ultraviolet and infrared regimes to infer the behavior at different energy scales.

Result: The study demonstrates that the proposed non-local terms effectively suppress the cosmological constant at low energies, matching existing experimental constraints such as the Casimir effect and recent DESI results.

Conclusion: The paper presents a promising framework for resolving the cosmological constant problem, offering a consistent theoretical model that aligns with experimental data.

Abstract: It is well known that the calculated cosmological constant, when regularized with a cutoff, differs hugely from the measured value. These calculations are made on the basis of a wave-vector cut-off that is usually set at the Planck scale. Further, Weinberg's no-go theorem indicates that in the presence of translational invariance, local quantum field theories cannot produce a zero cosmological constant without fine-tuning. Various non-local theories have been constructed, starting from modifications to Einstein's equations, in order to `cancel' away the cosmological constant term. There is also a well-known theory, due to Coleman, that assumes one can compute a probability distribution function for baby universes connected by wormholes that has the most probable value of the constant to be zero under some assumptions. The current paper starts from a QFT in 4-dimensions, breaks translational invariance by confining the fields to a box and adds a marginal (in power-counting terms) non-linear, momentum-dependent term that dominates the dynamics produced by the quadratic terms in the high-energy limit. It immediately produces an equation for the wave-vector cutoff applicable to the theory - the equation is reminiscent of that from UV/IR mixing and it effectively lowers the cutoff massively for a box the size of the Universe. However, as will be shown, the wave-vector cutoff for a box relevant for regular particle physics experiments is much larger, in fact, the Planck scale, so there is no conflict with current experiments, including the Casimir effect. We consider several possibilities for these additional terms and conclude that only one is relevant to a low cut-off. We also make a connection to the recent DESI results.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了如何在 Cohomotopy 理论中实现四维/十维上的复数/四元数导向，连接了稳定 K 理论与 Cohomotopy。

Abstract: Topological Chern phases of quantum materials, as well as brane charges on M-theory orbifolds, have famously been argued to be classified by (orbi) topological K-theory, or possibly by other stable and, notably, complex-oriented cohomology theories, such as elliptic cohomology or Morava K-theory.
  However, closer inspection reveals that the most fine-grained "fragile" microscopic classification in both cases is in (orbi) Cohomotopy, which is the primordial "unstable" or nonabelian generalized cohomology. Coarsening takes the latter (fragile) to the former (stable) cohomology along an nonabelian cohomology operations. But what then is the role of complex orientation on the stable side?
  We observe here (i) that over gapped nodal lines in the 2D Brillouin torus and on probe M5-branes in 11D spacetime, the cohomotopical phases/charges lift through the complex/quaternionic Hopf fibration, and (ii) that measuring this fragile situation in stable cohomology means equivalently to ask for universal complex/quaternionic orientation on stable cohomology in four/ten dimensions!
  Then we give an explicit realization of such unstable four/ten-dimensional complex/quaternionic orientation in U(2)/Sp(2)-equivariant K-theory, using real division-algebraic tools within a new model of twisted orbifold K-theory in cohesive homotopy theory; and we explain this as an extraordinary character map from orbi Cohomotopy-twisted Cohomotopy to relative orbi K-theory.
  Finally, we discuss an application to the classification of 2-band crystalline topological insulator phases sensitive to the topology in the gapping process of their nodal line semimetal parent phase, and to the measurement of M-string charges inside M5-brane probes.

Abstract: We first note that, at least in perturbation theory, there is a well-defined (subject to regularization) Lorentzian definition of the quantum effective action in both flat and curved space including (perturbative) gravity. The advantage of the latter is that we do not need to deal with the conformal factor problems of Euclidean quantum gravity. We then make some remarks on the Euclidean version (in flat space) and convexity and resolve a puzzle that highlights the importance of keeping the initial and final states in the functional integral. Next we discuss the gauge invariant effective action of Vilkovisky and DeWitt and show its gauge fixing independence. We conclude with the expression for the Wilsonian effective action in this framework.

In addition, we analyze the method's robustness under measurement noise and propose filtering strategies to improve reconstruction accuracy. This work advances data-driven bulk reconstruction by providing a concrete, experimentally viable pathway to recover spacetime geometry from field-theoretic observables.

Abstract: We consider single particle excitations of the massive Chern-Simons field of mass M in AdS3 and evaluate their contribution at the first sub-leading order in GN to the entanglement entropy across the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. Quantizing the Chern- Simons field in AdS3, we evaluate the corrections to the holographic entanglement entropy using the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula. The massive Chern-Simons field also obeys the equations of motion of a massive vector in AdS3. The lowest energy single particle excitation of this field is dual to the primary operator of conformal dimensions M + 1 with spin one in the dual CFT, all other single particle excitations are dual to its global descendants. We compare the result for the entanglement entropy from the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula to the single interval entanglement entropy in large charge holographic CFT obtained using the replica trick for the primary and its tower of holomorphic descendants. The two results agree precisely in the leading and sub-leading terms of the short interval expansion. On taking the massless limit the result coincides with the contribution of a U(1) current to the single interval entanglement entropy.

Abstract: We study non-equilibrium initial states of quantum fields in curved space-time and develop a framework for describing global quenches as unitary perturbations of the initial density matrix. Using the Keldysh-Schwinger functional integral, we derive expressions for post-quench correlators in arbitrary geometries and apply the method to both Minkowski and de Sitter backgrounds. In flat space, the approach reproduces the known relaxation behaviour for massive fields and reveals qualitatively distinct dynamics in the massless case. In de Sitter space, we find that the late-time decay of quench-induced corrections depends sensitively on the mass and may influence the behaviour of cosmological observables such as the power spectrum. The framework also extends straightforwardly to non-Gaussian initial states, providing a basis for future studies of loop effects and primordial non-Gaussianities.

Abstract: In this proceeding contribution, we review a recently proposed method to compute the minimal form factors (MFFs) of diagonal integrable field theories perturbed by irrelevant fields of the $T\bar{T}$ family. Our construction generalizes standard form factor techniques to deal with the deformed two-body scattering amplitudes, which are typical in this setting. The results are minimal form factors which are the product of the undeformed solution and a new function. This function can be fixed by requiring constant asymptotics for large rapidities, smoothness in the limit when the perturbation parameters go to zero, and agreement with standard MFF formulae for particular choices of the perturbation couplings. We observe that, for a certain range of parameters, the new MFF develops a pole at $θ=0$. By considering several UV-complete theories, we argue that such poles can emerge naturally from the MFF integral representation and suggest how they may be eliminated.

The area of this surface is expressed through the eigenvalues of the Douglas-Gram matrix of the boundary loop, and is identical for the self-dual and anti-self-dual chiralities related by parity. We prove the Confinement Theorem by showing that the effective string tension sigma_eff[C] (ratio of our Hodge dual area to a Euclidean one bounded by the same loop) is bounded as sigma_eff[C]>= sqrt(2) , remaining finite and positive for all regular loops. Consequently, the Wilson loop decays exponentially with the Euclidean area, providing a purely geometric proof of confinement. Quantization of the quadratic holomorphic action yields a quantum string, with a universal constant correction for each of the two chiral strings. The worldsheet theory is one-loop exact. This construction defines a solvable quantum Hodge-dual string theory reproducing the QCD area law with explicit tension dependence on the loop shape.

Abstract: We continue the investigation of symmetries and anomalies of $T[M]$ theories obtained by compactifying 6d SCFTs on an internal manifold $M$. We extend the notion of "polarizations on a manifold $M$" to cases where $M$ may have boundaries or defects. Through examples with $M$ of dimension two, three, and four, we illustrate recurring themes in compactifications -- for instance, the important roles played by Kaluza-Klein modes, and how the generalized symmetries (including higher-group and non-invertible ones) of $T[M]$, together with their anomalies, arise from non-trivial combinations of the parent 6d symmetries and the geometric structures of the internal manifold. For each dimension, we also focus on several topics that are especially interesting in that setting. These include: for 2-manifolds, the geometry of the "full moduli space" of $T[M_2]$ and its interaction with polarizations and symmetries; for 3-manifolds, the effect of torsion in homology on the spectrum of line operators in $T[M_3]$, together with applications to the study of quantum invariants such as $\hat Z_a(M_3, q)$; and for 4-manifolds, predictions for VOA$[M_4]$ following from symmetries of $T[M_4]$, as well as the construction of a new invariant of 4-manifolds that depends on two "$q$-parameters." Along the way, we discuss a range of topics that are of independent interest, such as how non-invertible symmetries in higher dimensions can become invertible under compactification, how to classify defects in quantum field theory via their response to a change of framing, and the interplay between $\hat Z_a$ and volume conjectures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gauging fermion parity and summing over spin structures are subtly distinct operations. We introduce 'bosonisation cohomology' groups $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ to capture this difference, for theories in spacetime dimension $d$ equipped with maps to some $X$. Non-trivial classes in $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ contain theories for which $(-1)^F$ is anomaly-free, but spin structure summation is anomalous. We formulate a sequence of cobordism groups whose failure to be exact is measured by $H_B^{d+2}(X)$, and from here we compute it for $X=\text{pt}$. The result is non-trivial only in dimensions $d\in 4\mathbb{Z}+2$, being due to the presence of gravitational anomalies. The first few are $H_B^4=\mathbb{Z}_2$, probed by a theory of 8 Majorana-Weyl fermions in $d=2$, then $H_B^8=\mathbb{Z}_8$, $H_B^{12}=\mathbb{Z}_{16}\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. We rigorously derive a general formula extending this to every spacetime dimension. Along the way, we compile many general facts about (fermionic and bosonic) anomaly polynomials, and about spin and pin$^-$ (co)bordism generators, that we hope might serve as a useful reference for physicists working with these objects. We briefly discuss some physics applications, including how the $H_B^{12}$ class is trivialised in supergravity. Despite the name, and notation, we make no claim that $H_B^\bullet(X)$ actually defines a cohomology theory (in the Eilenberg-Steenrod sense).

Motivation:  investigating the lag in materials science behind AI-driven advancements in natural language processing and the challenges in synthesizing and measuring polymer properties.

Method:  developed PolyOmics using automated molecular dynamics simulations for over 100,000 polymeric materials, involving a collaborative effort of 260 researchers.

Result:  machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics show strong generalization capabilities, especially as the database size increases, following a power-law scaling pattern.

Conclusion:  while PolyOmics represents a significant step forward, there is still a need for more experimental validation and widespread adoption of machine learning approaches in AI-driven polymer science to fully realize the potential of large-scale computational materials datasets.

Abstract: Developing large-scale foundational datasets is a critical milestone in advancing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven scientific innovation. However, unlike AI-mature fields such as natural language processing, materials science, particularly polymer research, has significantly lagged in developing extensive open datasets. This lag is primarily due to the high costs of polymer synthesis and property measurements, along with the vastness and complexity of the chemical space. This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the "more is better" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance. This unprecedented omics-scale database reveals vast unexplored regions of polymer materials, providing a foundation for AI-driven polymer science.

Conclusion: Differentiable Electrochemistry 提供了一种新的框架，不仅在机理发现和参数化方面取得了进展，还能整合多种数据源，为实验与理论的有效结合开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Despite the long history of electrochemistry, there is a lack of quantitative algorithms that rigorously correlate experiment with theory. Electrochemical modeling has had advanced across empirical, analytical, numerical, and data-driven paradigms. Data-driven machine learning and physics based electrochemical modeling, however, have not been explicitly linked. Here we introduce Differentiable Electrochemistry, a mew paradigm in electrochemical modeling that integrates thermodynamics, kinetics and mass transport with differentiable programming enabled by automatic differentiation. By making the entire electrochemical simulation end-to-end differentiable, this framework enables gradient-based optimization for mechanistic discovery from experimental and simulation data, achieving approximately one to two orders of improvement over gradient-free methods. We develop a rich repository of differentiable simulators across diverse mechanisms, and apply Differentiable Electrochemistry to bottleneck problems in kinetic analysis. Specifically, Differentiable Electrochemistry advances beyond Tafel and Nicholson method by removing several limitations including Tafel region selection, and identifies the electron transfer mechanism in Li metal electrodeposition/stripping by parameterizing the full Marcus-Hush-Chidsey formalism. In addition, Differentiable Electrochemistry interprets Operando X-ray measurements in concentrated electrolyte by coupling concentration and velocity theories. This framework resolves ambiguity when multiple electrochemical theories intertwine, and establishes a physics-consistent and data-efficient foundation for predictive electrochemical modeling.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is fundamental to chemical engineering applications such as solvent screening. We present Socrates-Mol, a framework that transforms language models into empirical Bayesian reasoners through context engineering, addressing cold start problems without model fine-tuning. The system implements a reflective-prediction cycle where initial outputs serve as priors, retrieved molecular cases provide evidence, and refined predictions form posteriors, extracting reusable chemical rules from sparse data. We introduce ranking tasks aligned with industrial screening priorities and employ cross-model self-consistency across five language models to reduce variance. Experiments on amine solvent LogP prediction reveal task-dependent patterns: regression achieves 72% MAE reduction and 112% R-squared improvement through self-consistency, while ranking tasks show limited gains due to systematic multi-model biases. The framework reduces deployment costs by over 70% compared to full fine-tuning, providing a scalable solution for molecular property prediction while elucidating the task-adaptive nature of self-consistency mechanisms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($ΔG_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.

Abstract: Obtaining 3D conformations of realistic polyatomic molecules at the quantum chemistry level remains challenging, and although recent machine learning advances offer promise, predicting large-molecule structures still requires substantial computational effort. Here, we introduce StoL, a diffusion model-based framework that enables rapid and knowledge-free generation of large molecular structures from small-molecule data. Remarkably, StoL assembles molecules in a LEGO-style fashion from scratch, without seeing the target molecules or any structures of comparable size during training. Given a SMILES input, it decomposes the molecule into chemically valid fragments, generates their 3D structures with a diffusion model trained on small molecules, and assembles them into diverse conformations. This fragment-based strategy eliminates the need for large-molecule training data while maintaining high scalability and transferability. By embedding chemical principles into key steps, StoL ensures faster convergence, chemically rational structures, and broad configurational coverage, as confirmed against DFT calculations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the potential of light-atom chromophores in organic semiconductors is crucial for developing efficient materials for optoelectronic applications.

Method: The researchers synthesized HM610, a light-atom chromophore derivative, and used computational methods like Slater-Condon and trajectory surface hopping simulations to evaluate its properties.

Result: Computational results, including SOC values and trajectory simulations, suggest that HM610 has limited potential as a triplet sensitizer without heavy atom substitution.

Conclusion: Further structural modifications, particularly heavy atom substitution, are needed to enhance HM610's functionality as a triplet sensitizer in organic semiconductors.

Abstract: Light-atom chromophores can display properties often associated with heavy-atom compounds, such as intersystem crossing leading to phosphorescence and singlet oxygen generation, yet their use remains comparatively underexplored. Here, we report the synthesis of HM610, a derivative of the benzylidenehydrazinylthiazole light-atom chromophore backbone. Spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), computed with the sf-X2C-S-TDDFT method, follow Slater-Condon rules and predict moderate values. Trajectory surface hopping simulations further illustrate the role of dynamical effects in promoting ISC, yet these results together establish that HM610 has only limited potential as a triplet sensitizer without further structural modification, such as heavy atom substitution. Based on the benchmarked (TD)DFT protocol, a computational set studying six systematic analogues allowed us to study the influence of electron-donating (-OMe) and electron-withdrawing (-CF3) substituents on the common backbone, revealing the impact of substitution on the geometry and photophysics of light-atom analogues of HM610 and paving the way for future studies where the introduction of heavy atoms and their impact on triplet sensitization by this family of chromophores can be probed.

Abstract: Hydrophobic solid-water interfaces underpin processes in nanofluidics, electrochemistry, and energy technologies. Microscopic insights into these systems are often inferred from our understanding of the air-water interface, which is assumed to exhibit similar behavior. Here, we challenge this paradigm by combining heterodyne-detected vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy with machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at first-principles accuracy to investigate the graphene-NaCl(aq) interface as a prototypical hydrophobic solid-water system. Spectroscopic results suggest that ions have a minimal effect on the structure of the interfacial water, while simulations reveal that Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ accumulate densely at the surface. Together, these findings reveal a new adsorption mechanism that departs from the established air-water interface paradigm, where interfacial ion adsorption is typically associated with, and often detected through, pronounced alteration of the interfacial water alignment and orientation. This difference arises because ions cannot penetrate the solid boundary and reside at a similar depth as the interfacial water molecules. As a consequence, large ion populations can be accommodated within the extended two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network at the interface, causing only minor local distortions but significant changes to its longer-range connectivity. These results reveal a distinct mechanism of electrolyte organization at aqueous-carbon interfaces, relevant to energy applications, where performance is highly sensitive to the local organization of interfacial water.

Motivation: Improving battery technology requires efficient molecular simulations, and this paper presents a novel method to achieve this.

Method: PhyNEO-Electrolyte uses a hybrid physics-data approach with a focus on long-range interactions, improving scalability and efficiency.

Result: The method significantly enhances data efficiency and scalability while maintaining accuracy in bulk property predictions.

Conclusion: PhyNEO-Electrolyte is a valuable tool for optimizing battery electrolytes future research.

Abstract: Electrolyte design plays an important role in the development of lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. Battery electrolytes feature a large design space composed of different solvents, additives, and salts, which is difficult to explore experimentally. High-fidelity molecular simulation can accurately predict the bulk properties of electrolytes by employing accurate potential energy surfaces, thus guiding the molecule and formula engineering. At present, the overly simplified classic force fields rely heavily on experimental data for fine-tuning, thus its predictive power on microscopic level is under question. In contrast, the newly emerged machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) can accurately reproduce the ab initio data, demonstrating excellent fitting ability. However, it is still haunted by problems such as low transferrability, insufficient stability in the prediction of bulk properties, and poor training cost scaling. Therefore, it cannot yet be used as a robust and universal tool for the exploration of electrolyte design space. In this work, we introduce a highly scalable and fully bottom-up force field construction strategy called PhyNEO-Electrolyte. It adopts a hybrid physics-driven and data-driven method that relies only on monomer and dimer EDA (energy deomposition analysis) data. With a careful separation of long/short-range and non-bonding/bonding interactions, we rigorously restore the long-range asymptotic behavior, which is critical in the description of electrolyte systems. Through this approach, we significantly improve the data efficiency of MLIP training, allowing us to achieve much larger chemical space coverage using much less data while retaining reliable quantitative prediction power in bulk phase calculations. PhyNEO-electrolyte thus serves as an important tool for future electrolyte optimization.

Abstract: The projection-based wave function (WF)-in-DFT embedding enables an efficient description of both the energetics and properties of large and complex chemical systems, with accuracy exceeding that of pure DFT. Recently, we have proposed using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as the WF method for molecules containing strongly correlated fragments [Beran, P. et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 3, 716-722]. In this work, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the DMRG-in-DFT approach is primarily limited by the approximate treatment of the coupling between the active component and its environment through nonadditive exchange-correlation functionals. To address this issue, we combine exact exchange to reduce the nonadditive exchange error with a multireference adiabatic connection (AC) scheme to recover nonadditive correlation. The performance of the improved DMRG-in-DFT embedding is illustrated on two prototypical strongly correlated systems: the dissociation of the H20 chain and the cleavage of a triple CN bond in propionitrile.

By combining an Autoencoder for nonlinear dimensionality reduction with clustering and information entropy analysis, our method autonomously maps reaction channels and pinpoints their governing structural motions. When applied to keto isocytosine and the methaniminium cation, the framework objectively revealed invovled reaction channels and corresponding active coordinates with high efficiency and accuracy. This work establishes an effective paradigm for mechanistic insight in excited-state dynamics, transforming raw trajectory data into clear, interpretable reaction mechanisms.

*Wanqi Zhou,Pablo M. Piaggi*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Mineral dust aerosols influence Earth's climate by acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs), and K-feldspar's (110) surface is the most active for ice formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the microphysical processes of ice nucleation on planetary surfaces is crucial for improving climate modeling and predicting cloud behavior, which in turn affects global climate systems.

Method: Machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations were employed to systematically investigate ice nucleation on all K-feldspar surfaces. Advanced sampling methods were used to observe the formation of clusters with cubic-ice structure.

Result: The (110) surface of K-feldspar, potentially exposed at defects like steps or terrain features, serves as the most active nucleation site. This surface uniquely structures interfacial water into an arrangement resembling that on the (110) surface of cubic ice, providing an optimal template for nucleation. These simulations directly observed the formation of clusters with cubic-ice structure, whose orientation matches experimental observations.

Conclusion: This study provides a detailed and comprehensive understanding of ice nucleation in planetary atmospheres, contributing to the development of more accurate climate models and weather prediction systems, with implications for understanding climate change and its impacts on atmospheric processes.

Abstract: Mineral dust aerosols strongly influence Earth's climate by acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Feldspar minerals, particularly K-feldspar, are recognized as dominant INPs, and a previous study attributed this behavior to (100) surfaces exposed at defects. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate ice nucleation on all K-feldspar surfaces. We identify the (110) surface, exposed at defects such as steps, as the most active plane for ice formation. This surface uniquely structures interfacial water into an arrangement resembling that on the (110) surface of cubic ice, providing an optimal template for nucleation. Using advanced sampling, we directly observe the formation of clusters with cubic-ice structure and their orientation agrees with experiment. These results provide a microscopic explanation of how ice forms in our planet's atmosphere.

Abstract: Gas phase ultrafast electron diffraction (GUED) has become a powerful technique to directly observe the structural dynamics of photoexcited molecules. GUED reveals information about the nuclear motions that is complementary to the information on the electronic states provided by spectroscopic measurements. GUED experiments so far have utilized a single laser pulse to excite the molecules and an electron pulse to probe the dynamics. This limits the excited states which can be studied to only those that can be reached by absorption of a photon from the ground state or in some cases simultaneous absorption of multiple photons. A broader class of experiments and dynamics can be accessed using two time-delayed laser pulses to access unexplored regions of the potential energy surfaces. As a proof-of-principle experiment using a double excitation, we studied the photodissociation of trifluoroiodomethane molecules that are pre-excited with an infrared (800 nm) femtosecond laser pulse before photo-dissociation is triggered with an ultraviolet (266 nm) femtosecond laser pulse. We have observed significant differences in the dissociation dynamics, with pre-excitation resulting in a slower dissociation process. This new capability can offer new insights on the evolution of nuclear wavepackets in regions of the excited potential energy surface which are inaccessible in single photon excitation. We present a methodology to carry out the measurement, analyze and interpret the data that could be applied to a broad class of experiments.

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了HNC在含有碳、氮和氢的等离子体中的重要角色， discovered it highlights the未被重视的HNC在等离子体化学中的作用，并为HNC在工业合成和表面处理中的应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a well-known product in combustion, astrophysical, and plasma environments, but its isomer, hydrogen isocyanide (HNC), remains unexplored in molecular plasmas. Here, we report on the detection and quantification of both HNC and HCN isomers in low-temperature plasmas generated from N$_2$/H$_2$/CH$_4$ mixtures using quantum cascade laser and frequency comb absorption spectroscopy. The identification of HNC is confirmed by comparison with molecular spectroscopic databases. The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity. We attribute this stark difference to fundamentally different kinetics, dominated by an interplay between formation of vibrationally 'hot' intermediates (HCN* and HNC*) and their subsequent stabilization and destruction. This mechanism contrasts with cold interstellar environments, where dissociative recombination reactions dominate and the formed HNC persists and accumulates over astrochemical timescales. Our results highlight the overlooked role of HNC in plasma chemistry containing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, with implications for plasma-assisted HCN synthesis and nitrogen-carbon plasma processes in surface modification and material treatments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A method for increasing the accuracy of configuration interaction (CI) calculations of molecules and other electronic systems is proposed. The energy defect of a given calculation is associated with the electron pair origin of configurations not yet generated and this defect is mapped onto the exchange interaction for the corresponding pair of spatial molecular orbitals. The orbitals can be of opposite spin and thus the contribution includes the self-energy and differs from fermion exchange due to antisymmetry. A single parameter multiplying the exchange integral, is determined from the exact thermodynamic energy of a few reference molecules. The value of the parameter depends on the basis and level of configuration interaction but is the same for all molecules. Calculated energies are compared with experimental thermodynamic data for a set of forty mainly organic molecules representing a wide range of bonding environments. Results are reported for two types of multi- reference CI calculations: 1) a triple-zeta basis plus d-type functions for C, N, O and F and an s, p basis for H, and 2) a severely truncated virtual space in which higher spherical harmonic basis functions are removed. The error of the initial CI calculations is large, however, including the exchange-based contribution brings calculated CI energies into much closer agreement with exact values.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A new method called ZAPT-FNO is introduced which improves the accuracy of quantum chemical modeling by selecting virtual orbitals with controllable precision, outperforming traditional methods especially in systems with large multiple-polarized basis sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and precise quantum chemical methods that can handle large systems while maintaining basis-set quality drives the development of ZAPT-FNO.

Method: ZAPT-FNO employs second-order Z-averaged perturbation theory (ZAPT2) for virtual orbital selection, reducing the size of the orbital space used in open-shell frozen natural orbital (FNO) approaches.

Result: ZAPT-FNO shows superior performance compared to canonical FNO methods, particularly in terms of systematic convergence of correlation energies and accurate calculation of singlet-triplet T₀-S₀ gaps.

Conclusion: ZAPT-FNO represents a significant advancement in quantum chemical methods, offering Hermition accuracy with a more manageable computational cost, particularly for large open-shell systems.

Abstract: We present an open-shell frozen natural orbital (FNO) approach, which utilizes the second-order Z-averaged perturbation theory (ZAPT2), to reduce the restricted opten-shell Hartree-Fock virtual space size with controllable accuracy. Our ZAPT2 frozen natural orbital (ZAPT-FNO) selection scheme significantly outperforms the canonical molecular orbital virtual space truncation scheme based on Hartree-Fock orbital energies, especially when using large multiple-polarized and augmented basis sets. We demonstrate that the ZAPT-FNO-selected virtual orbitals lead to a systematic convergence of the correlation energies, but more importantly to the singlet-triplet T$_1$-S$_ 0$ energy gaps with respect to the complete active space (CAS) [occupied + virtual] size. We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver. Finally, we applied the iQCC method with ZAPT-FNO-selected active space to the phosphorescent Ir(ppy)$_3$ complex with 260 electrons, where extended basis sets are required to achieve chemical (ca. 1 m$E_h$) accuracy. In this case, CASCI results are not available; however, the iQCC-computed T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps show robust convergence with enlarging basis set and CAS size, approaching the experimental value. Thus, the ZAPT-FNO method is very promising for improving the accuracy of quantum chemical modelling in a resource-efficient manner, and opens the door to simulating open-shell states of large materials within realistic active space sizes and without compromising on basis-set quality.

Abstract: The recent experimental characterization of B80- via photoelectron spectroscopy stimulated renewed interest in exploring B80 clusters. Here, a D3h-symmetric B80 bilayer structure has been proposed using density functional theory calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the bilayer structure maintain its structural integrity up to 1400 K, indicating superior thermodynamic stability compared to previously known B80 configurations, including the B80 buckyball and volleyball-like structures. Vibrational frequency analysis confirms its kinetic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveals a HOMO-LUMO gap of 0.72 eV and pronounced aromaticity, further supported by a nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS(0)) value of -44.3 ppm in the interlayer B-B bonds. The simulated photoelectron spectrum of the B80- bilayer reproduces key experimental features, with vertical detachment energies agreeing with experimental peaks within 0.04 eV. These findings support the potential existence of this bilayer configuration, and enrich the structural diversity of boron clusters, offering promising prospects for applications in nanoscale electronics.

Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.

Abstract: Phase space trajectories are fundamentally important for understanding and analysing chaotic attractors. This is mostly carried out by direct numerical solution of the dynamical equations. Though the origin of scrolls can be understood from the properties of dynamical equations, their appearance in the phase space can also be inferred from the geometry and relative orientations of Nambu surfaces, drawn using Nambu Hamiltonians than from direct numerical solutions. Therefore, one can attribute the origin of wings in the phase space due to energy like Nambu surfaces, giving a geometrical interpretation. In this article, we have carried out, both numerical analysis of bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponents(LEs) to characterise chaos and geometric approach by applying the Nambu generalized Hamiltonian mechanics to explain the fundamental reason for the appearance of wings like geometry in the phase space. We have shown how a fixed number of scrolls or wings can appear in the phase space due to specific geometry of the Nambu surfaces and how different geometries are formed when set of parameters are changed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of Mott insulators and their conductivity properties in different conditions is crucial for advancing our knowledge in condensed matter physics.

Method: A holographic model with higher-order coupling terms was constructed to simulate electron interactions and analyze their effects on conductivity.

Result: The model exhibits a metal-insulator transition, reduced DC conductivity with increasing charge density, and features indicating a Mott and charge-transfer gap in AC conductivity.

Conclusion: This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of Mott insulators and their response under varying conditions, offering insights relevant to materials with strong electron correlations.

Abstract: We construct a simple holographic model incorporating higher-order coupling terms for electron self-interactions. It can exhibit typical behavior of a Mott insulator, including a metal-insulator transition and a decrease in DC conductivity with the increase of charge density. In the analysis of AC conductivity, a soft gap is generally observed. Notably, when the DC conductivity approaches zero, the AC conductivity reveals a multi-peak structure, which can be attributed to the Mott and charge-transfer gaps observed experimentally in transition metals. With the increase of DC conductivity, the multi-peak structure gradually reverts to soft-gap behavior or even metallic conductivity. The numerical reliability is confirmed by the agreement between zero-frequency AC and DC conductivities.

Abstract: We study the interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in the square-lattice Hubbard model under periodic driving with circularly polarized light. Formulating diagrammatic techniques based on the random-phase approximation in terms of Floquet Green's functions, allows us to analyze fluctuation-driven unconventional pairing for weak-to-moderate interactions. The interplay of repulsive interactions and photo-assisted hopping of electrons gives rise to a rich magnetic phase diagram featuring an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic crossover prior to a Floquet Lifshitz transition. Close to the antiferromagnetic transition, topological $d+id$-wave superconductivity prevails in the phase diagram for a wide range of drive parameters. At intermediate-to-high frequency driving near the Floquet Lifshitz transition, superconducting orders are tuned from spin-singlet $d$-wave to spin-triplet $p$-wave character, providing an effective protocol for Floquet engineering topological superconductivity.

Abstract: Due to the Coulomb blockade effect, electrons rarely bunch during transport, a phenomenon observed only in a few specially engineered mesoscopic configurations. In this work, we introduce an atomically resolved shot-noise study to demonstrate the possibility of electron bunching through vibrational coupling which takes place in an atomically sized nano-electro-mechanical system. Using tunnelling spectroscopy, we observe signatures of vibron-assisted tunnelling on an Fe impurity in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Notably, simultaneous shot-noise measurements at the centre of the vibrating impurity reveal super-Poissonian noise. In the absence of alternative sources of super-Poissonian noise, this implies vibronic-coupling-induced bunching of electrons during the tunnelling process through the impurity, as theoretically predicted decades ago. As a future outlook, if coherence between electrons can be implemented, vibron-mediated electron bunching at single atomic sites may be exploited as a local injection source of $N$-paired electrons.

Abstract: We consider the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Tasaki square lattice (flat-band spin system) and study its low-temperature thermodynamics around the saturation magnetic field.

The most prominent feature of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Tasaki square lattice is an order-disorder phase transition which occurs at a low temperature just below the saturation magnetic field and belongs to the 2D Ising universality class.

Abstract: We investigate the periodic Anderson model composed of an itinerant $c$-band and a strongly localized $f$-band, featuring on-site electron-electron interactions in the $f$-orbitals. The two bands interact via a hybridization term with spin-orbit coupling, which enables spin-flip processes. In the non-interacting limit, these profoundly alter the electronic structure, leading to the emergence of flat bands, van Hove singularities, and, most notably, Dirac cones within a single Kondo-Dirac semimetal order. The strongly interacting regime is explored via the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, in the absence of the sign problem, where we unveil a complete ground-state phase diagram revealing two distinct phases, the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase and a novel antiferromagnetic semimetal phase. Their characterization by the spectral functions establishes an orbital-selective Mott transition in the antiferromagnetic semimetal phase, marked by the opening of a gap exclusively in the $f$-orbital while Dirac cones persist in the $c$-orbital. Conversely, in the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase, both $c$- and $f$-orbitals sustain robust Dirac cones. We establish that spin-orbit coupling in the hybridization term gives rise to Dirac cones, which, combined with additional symmetry-breaking conditions, can generate novel topological states.

Abstract: Building on the recent success of a quantum-classical method for computing transport properties in the Holstein model with a single phonon mode [Phys. Rev. B ${\bf 111}$, L161105 (2025)], we now assess its reliability in more realistic scenarios involving multiple phonon modes in the Holstein model, as well as single- and multi-mode Peierls models. For parameters relevant to the prototypical organic semiconductor rubrene, we compute the frequency-dependent charge mobility and find excellent agreement with results from the state-of-the-art hierarchical equations of motion method. These results show that the method, previously validated only for the single-mode Holstein model, preserves quantitative accuracy in substantially more complex and material-relevant regimes. Our microscopic approach complements the phenomenological transient-localization theory and is readily applicable to realistic electron-phonon Hamiltonians.

Abstract: CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ is a well-known heavy fermion paramagnet, and substituting Ge for Si induces antiferromagnetism. This antiferromagnetism is Ising-like and has a tricritical point in the magnetic field ($H$) -temperature ($T$) phase diagram. Since the temperature of the tricritical point is expected to decrease with increasing pressure ($P$), we investigated the pressure dependence of the magnetic phase transitions. We determined the $H$-$P$ phase diagram and revealed that a first-order phase-transition line changes to a quantum critical line, which implies the existence of the quantum tricritical point. A ferromagnetic quantum fluctuation arises in the vicinity of the possible quantum tricritical point.

Abstract: A mechanism for electrically tunable PT-symmetric magnonic lasing and anti-lasing is proposed along with a device consisting of a current-biased region in a magnetically ordered planar waveguide. Within the bias area, several heavy-metal wires carrying dc charge current are periodically attached to the waveguide and exert so spatially periodic spin-orbit torques, producing current-controllable modulated magnon gain and loss. It is demonstrated that this decorated waveguide can emit a strong, single frequency magnon mode at the Bragg point (lasing) and also absorb at the same frequency phase-matched incoming coherent magnons (anti-lasing). The underlying physics is captured by an analytical model and validated with full material and device-specific numerical simulations. The magnonic laser absorber response is tunable via the current density in the wires, the extent of the biased region, and the intrinsic damping, enabling the control of lasing frequency and emission power. The structure is shown to amplify thermal magnons, offering a route to low-noise on-chip microwave sources. The concept is compatible with planar waveguides, ring geometries, and antiferromagnets. The results establish an experimentally realistic platform where a single element functions simultaneously as both magnon laser and absorber, opening opportunities for reconfigurable non-Hermitian magnonics and integrated magnon signal processing.

Abstract: We report broadband dielectric spectra of the non-Kramers hexaaluminate PrMgAl(*{11})O(*{19}), revealing a pronounced interplay between permittivity and magnetization at cryogenic temperatures. The zero-field dielectric response follows a Barrett-type quantum-paraelectric form, while a broad dielectric anomaly near 5 K shifts systematically to higher temperatures under applied magnetic fields, evidencing robust magnetoelectric coupling. The inverse permittivity (\varepsilon'^{-1}(T,H)) scales linearly with (M^{2}), consistent with a biquadratic (P^{2}M^{2}) term in a Landau framework. Fits yield temperature-dependent coupling constants (λ(T)) that decrease with heating, reflecting the thermal population of low-lying energy levels of Pr(^{3+}).
  These results identify PrMgAl(*{11})O(*{19}) as a paradigmatic non-Kramers hexaaluminate where quantum paraelectricity and magnetoelectric interactions are intrinsically entangled, establishing hexaaluminates as a tunable platform for magnetoelectric physics in frustrated quantum materials.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: even-size chains can have a partially symmetric phase, but the magnetization typically scales with the inverse square root of the system size, while in an odd-numbered chain, the magnetization is finite. Parity conservation protects magnetization in odd-sized chains but not in even-sized ones, implying that such chains cannot exhibit finite magnetization. Symmetry-breaking fields in low-energy physics lead to manifestation of SSB in specific quantum systems, such as spin chains with Luttinger liquid phases. This suggests that metrological applications benefit from the unique properties of odd-sized chains with finite effective magnetization in the broken symmetry phase.

Abstract: Finite-size quantum spin systems can be magnetized by the application of a symmetry-breaking field, but in general their symmetry is expected to be restored once the field is turned off adiabatically. Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $ξ_R^2 \sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了 PCA 在分析强相互作用系统中的有效性，并为理解 Hubbard 模型中的相关激发层次结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present a data-driven analysis of correlation hierarchies in the quarter-filled simple and extended Hubbard models by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to exact-diagonalization (ED) data on 3x4 and 4x4 cylindrical clusters. While the non-interacting limit (U=0) provides a finite-size reference, increasing on-site repulsion U induces localization and reorganizes the low-energy spectrum. For the extended model, we examine moderate (U=4) and strong (U=10) coupling regimes, where conventional structure factors reveal familiar crossovers among charge, spin and local-pairing correlations. PCA of the corresponding correlation matrices captures these crossovers directly from the data, without assuming predefined order parameters by identifying charge-dominated, spin-dominated and pairing-dominated regimes through variance condensation into leading components. This establishes PCA as a transparent, model-agnostic framework for uncovering the hierarchy and competition of correlation channels in finite Hubbard lattice clusters, providing a bridge between exact diagonalization and modern machine-learning diagnostics in strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: Two-dimensional moiré superlattices have been extensively studied, and a variety of correlated phenomena have been observed. However, their lower-dimensional counterpart, one-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattices, remain largely unexplored. Electrons in 1D are generally described by Luttinger liquid theory, with universal scaling relations depending only on the Luttinger parameter g. In particular, at half-filling, Umklapp scattering plays a crucial role, as it can significantly change the conductance-temperature scaling relation and lead to Mott insulators. However, this prediction has never been observed since doping an empty band to half-filling was extremely difficult. Here, we show that the marriage of moiré superlattices and 1D electrons makes it possible to study the Luttinger liquid in an exceptionally wide filling region simply by electrical gating. We perform transport measurements on 1D moiré superlattices of carbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, and observe correlated insulating states at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings of the superlattice mini-band, where Umklapp scattering becomes dominant. We also observe a T-linear conductance at these commensurate fillings over a range of temperatures. Strikingly, the T-linear conductance leads to a strongly suppressed Luttinger parameter, suggesting a state of extreme correlation.

Motivation: The paper aims to summarize the key driving forces in quantum materials and provide a comprehensive review of the kagome lattice physics and its experimental applications.

Method: The paper employs a review-based approach, synthesizing theoretical models and experimental evidence from various material classes that exhibit kagome lattice characteristics.

Result: The paper synthesizes insights into how the unique structure of kagome lattices contributes to the stabilization of exotic electronic states in different materials.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that kagome lattices offer a promising framework for understanding and engineering new electronic phases in quantum materials.

Abstract: Three important driving forces for creating qualitatively new phases in quantum materials are the topology of the materials' electronic band structures, frustration in the electrons' motion or magnetic interactions, and strong correlations between their charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the effects of time-dependent electromagnetic fields on frustrated magnets with the spatial inversion symmetry. Two types of external-field setups are considered: One is a circularly polarized electromagnetic field and the other is a combination of a circularly polarized electric field and a static magnetic field. The system is modeled by a classical frustrated Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice, whose ground state is a single-$Q$ spiral spin configuration. The effects of irradiated electric and magnetic fields are taken into account by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the Zeeman coupling, respectively, without heating effects. By numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that the two field configurations lead to distinct skyrmion crystal (SkX) phases and their associated topological phase transitions: in the former setup, SkXs composed of skyrmions with skyrmion numbers of one and two with opposite signs emerge, whereas in the latter setup, SkXs with the same sign appear. The stabilization mechanisms of these SkXs are accounted for by the competition among electromagnetic-field-induced chiral DM interactions, electric-field-induced three-spin interactions, and the Zeeman coupling based on the high-frequency expansion within the Floquet formalism. Furthermore, for the latter setup, we find that the stability region of the SkX phase varies significantly depending on the timing of the application of the circularly polarized electric field and the static magnetic field. Our findings would broaden the possible routes to generate and control SkXs by time-dependent electromagnetic fields, advancing both the theoretical comprehension and experimental control of topological spin crystals.

Abstract: We present a hybrid lattice Hamiltonian truncation method that integrates the numerical renormalization group (NRG) with a truncated lattice integrable spectrum. The technique is tailored for generic deformations of integrable lattice models, where the NRG enables a controlled incorporation of high-energy states. The method extends the basis set more effectively and efficiently than brute-force truncation, meanwhile significantly reducing errors. We show its capability on two paradigmatic models: an Ising chain in a magnetic field and a quantum Ising ladder. The resulting dynamical structure factors accurately capture the essential low-energy physics, including the $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ excitations of the former and later models, respectively, demonstrating the approach's computational efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental advances have identified cobaltates with a high-spin $d^7$ electronic configuration as promising hosts for spin-orbit entangled $J_{eff} = 1/2$ magnetism that can support bond-dependent exchange interactions. In two-dimensional triangular lattices, the coexistence of such exchange frustration along with geometric frustration gives rise to a rich landscape of competing magnetic phases, establishing monolayer triangular $d^7$ cobaltates as a compelling platform for frustrated magnetism. Here we investigate a representative triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate CoBr$_2$, where first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a dominant nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping channel that enhances the ferromagnetic Kitaev-type exchange interactions. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg term is highly sensitive to a direct $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hopping path and electronic correlations. The magnetic exchange parameters are evaluated using the hopping amplitudes obtained from DFT calculations within an exact diagonalization framework. We construct the first and third nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange dependent $J_1$-$J_3$ magnetic phase diagram in the physically relevant regime and identify multiple competing ground states, including ferromagnetic, stripy, spiral, and $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic orders. The Luttinger-Tisza analysis further predicts a Z$_2$ vortex crystal phase, while exact diagonalization reveals a bond-nematic phase stabilized by the longer-range couplings. Going beyond the conventional bond-independent XXZ picture typically applied to Co$^{2+}$ systems, our results on monolayer CoBr$_2$ establish d$^7$ cobalt dihalides as a promising platform to explore the interplay of long-range Heisenberg and bond-dependent exchange interactions that can stabilize diverse magnetic ground states on a triangular lattice.

Abstract: The Hubbard model has attracted considerable interest due to its prototypical role in describing strongly interacting electronic systems, such as high-critical-temperature superconductors as well as many novel quantum materials. By introducing next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hoppings to the Hubbard model, the phase diagram becomes richer, and fascinating phenomena arise in both, one-dimensional chains and square lattices, such as: antiferromagnetism (AFM), ferromagnetism (FM), superconductivity (SC), as well as charge orders, among others. Moreover, NNN hoppings play a fundamental role in understanding effects of doping on magnetism and pairing orders in strongly interacting regimes. In this article, we review the recent progress in understanding the different competing phases of this model in one and two dimensions from a computational perspective. We comment on the pressing technical challenges, illustrate the controversial results concerning the emergence of the SC phase, and conclude with our perspectives on future explorations.

Abstract: We derive the condition for the occurrence of the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems, expressed as $φν-ρ\in\mathbb{Z}$, where $φ$, $ν$, and $ρ$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly containing redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be manipulated by a factor of the system size.

Our results show that these observables, typically regarded as hallmarks of quantum criticality, exhibit pronounced and coherent signatures even at a classical thermal transition, highlighting the emergence of quantum complexity as the system nears thermal criticality.

Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators, characterized by symmetry-protected anomalous boundary modes, have been generalized to the strongly correlated regime for both bosonic and fermionic systems. As correlated topological insulators (TI) approach experimental realization in quantum simulators, conventional probes, such as transport measurements, are not easily applicable to these synthetic platforms. In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry. We propose a unified, readily implementable protocol based on measuring the disorder parameter $\langle\exp(\mathrm{i}θ\hat{Q}_A)\rangle$ for a large subregion $A$, with $\hat{Q}_A$ the total charge operator within $A$. Our key finding is that this quantity exhibits non-analytical dependence on $θ$ for correlated TI, a signature robust against decoherence. We establish this diagnostic through both numerical simulations and analytical derivations. This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.

Abstract: Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is a powerful photon-in, photon-out spectroscopy technique for probing electronic, magnetic, and lattice excitations in matter. Time-resolved RIXS extends this capability through a stroboscopic optical pump-probe scheme to characterize the time evolution of the photoexcitation and subsequent relaxation dynamics of a sample. This technique is, however, extremely photon-hungry, requiring high-repetition-rate and intense X-ray facilities. The Heisenberg RIXS (hRIXS) spectrometer at the Spectroscopy and Coherent Scattering (SCS) instrument of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) is designed to exploit high-repetition-rates, while maintaining optimal time and energy resolution. In this work, we demonstrate the successful deployment of a JUNGFRAU detector equipped with an inverse Low Gain Avalanche Diode (iLGAD) sensor for time-resolved RIXS studies in the soft X-ray range, using the hRIXS spectrometer. A spatial resolution of $19.71 \pm 0.7~μ\mathrm{m}$ and a resolving power exceeding 10,000 were achieved at an unprecedented frame rate of 47 kHz. Intra-train resolved data measured with a high FEL peak fluence of $1.8~\mathrm{mJ/cm^{2}}$ for a 928.5 eV ph photon energy and 1.1 MHz repetition rate from cupric oxide (CuO) revealed a decrease in the emitted signal by ~10% over a time interval of $340~μ\mathrm{s}$, indicating FEL-induced effects that require monitoring when conducting high-repetition-rate experiments. These results establish the JUNGFRAU-iLGAD as a promising detector to harvest the full potential of the hRIXS spectrometer, and validate its suitability for soft X-ray applications.

TL;DR: The DUNE's Far Detectors, X-ARAPUCA devices, are used for photon detection. They detect VUV photons by total internal reflection and collect them onto Silicon Photomultiplier arrays. The Far Detector's Photon Detection System includes Dichroic Filters (DFs) that improve photon collection efficiency. A characterization of the Vertical Drift module in Liquid Argon yielded an efficiency of 4.5 ± 0.4% at 4.5 V for the XA units with DFs, showing an improvement over previous XA versions. However, using configurations without DFs improved efficiency up to 18% (attributed to transmittance), enhancing the overall system performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The analysis of the abstract from the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and its Far Detectors, X-ARAPUCA, focuses on improving photon detection efficiency by utilizing Dichroic Filters (DFs) and alternative configurations to enhance their performance in detecting VUV photons in the Liquid Argon environment, contributing to the overall success of particle physics and cosmology research.

Method: The abstract describes a detailed characterization of the DUNE's Vertical Drift module using cryogenic setups. It compares different configurations of the X-ARAPUCA detectors, including those with and without Dichroic Filters, to measure their performance and efficiency in detecting photons under varying conditions. Various design optimisation studies conducted as part of an R&D campaign are also mentioned to improve the system's efficiency.

Result: The results of the study show that the X-ARAPUCA-based detectors with Dichroic Filters achieve a high efficiency of 4.5 ± 0.4% at 4.5 V. Additionally, configurations without DFs yielded even better efficiency, up to 18% higher, which is attributed to transmittance deficits in the previous implementations. These findings indicate significant improvements in the Photon Detection System's performance.

Conclusion: The research concludes that the proposed configurations and the inclusion of Dichroic Filters (DFs) lead to substantial enhancements in the performance of the X-ARAPUCA detector system, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting VUV photons and its potential impact on advancing particle physics and cosmology research by the DUNE experiment.

Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will probe fundamental questions in particle physics and cosmology. Its Far Detectors implement a Photon Detection System composed of light-sensitive devices called X-ARAPUCA (XA). These trap incoming VUV photons by total internal reflection in a Wavelength Shifter Light Guide to be collected onto wrapping Silicon Photomultiplier arrays, sensitive to visible light. In the baseline design, Dichroic Filters (DFs) are implemented to improve the collection efficiency of escaping photons. The configuration proposed for DUNE's Vertical Drift module has been characterised in Liquid Argon for the first time using dedicated cryogenic setups developed at CIEMAT and INFN Naples. Additionally, several alternative configurations, based on the design optimisation studies of an R&D campaign, have been evaluated. The results show an efficiency of up to 4.5 $\pm$ 0.4% at 4.5 V overvoltage, representing a high improvement with respect to previous XA implementations. Most noticeably, configurations without DFs show an improvement of up to 18%, which has been attributed to transmittance deficits.

Abstract: The potential to use neutrinos for nuclear non-proliferation has been heavily debated due to the tension between production abundance and low interaction rate. A newly detected neutrino interaction channel, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$ν$NS), could potentially end this debate due to its improved cross-section compared to other neutrino interactions. This paper presents a feasibility study for the use of CE$ν$NS superconducting detectors to find trafficked radiological materials. To do this, we calculated the minimal activity required for situational detection under ideal conditions, without background, at 95% confidence level. This analysis was performed for four commonly smuggled radioisotopes: $^{137}$Cs, $^{109}$Cd, $^{192}$Ir, and $^{57}$Co. Using these results, we conclude that CE$ν$NS could be used to discover trafficked $^{137}$Cs sources with an activity above the PBq level, but that it is not applicable for finding other radioactive sources. This framework can also be applied to other nuclear security concerns, such as safeguarding generation IV nuclear reactors.

Abstract: Depleted p-channel field effect transistor detectors with repetitive-non-destructive readout (RNDR-DEPFETs) achieve a deep sub-electron noise by averaging several independent measurements of one single event. During the repetitive readout collected electrons are transferred between two readout nodes within each pixel to enable electron number-resolved measurements. The pixels serve as a unit cell of an active pixel sensor to achieve a high level of parallelization and fast readout. These properties are exploited in the DANAE experiment, which aims for the direct detection of light dark matter based with the event signature of electron recoils. We present the experimental characterization of an $64\times64$ RNDR-DEPFET pixel detector with a focus on the charge carrier generation rate. This technology achieves a high time resolution, which increases its sensitivity on rare events with a signal of two or more electrons due to the Poisson distribution of thermal generated electrons.

Abstract: Low-noise cryogenic microwave amplifiers are widely used in applications such as radio astronomy and quantum computing. On-wafer noise characterization of cryogenic low-noise transistors is desirable because it facilitates more rapid characterization of devices prior to packaging, but obtaining accurate noise measurements is difficult due to the uncertainty arising from the input loss and temperature gradients prior to the device-under-test (DUT). Here, we report a calibration method that enables the simultaneous determination of the backend noise temperature and effective-noise-ratio at the input plane of the DUT. The method is based on measuring the S-parameters and noise power of a series of attenuators at two or more distinct physical temperatures. We validate our method by measuring the noise temperature of InP HEMTs in 4-8 GHz. The calibration method can be generalized to measure the microwave noise temperature of any two-port device so long as a series of attenuators can be measured at two or more distinct physical temperatures.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the production of $^{161}Tb$ in the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) using neutron irradiation of enriched $Gd_{2}O_{3}$ targets. Results show that $^{161}Tb$ activity can reach approximately 4.5 GBq per gram after 14 days, which is competitive with other research reactors and suggests the feasibility of terabecquerel-scale yields. Methods like AVLIS could further enhance $^{160}Gd$ enrichment. The study highlights the RMB's potential for producing emerging therapeutic radionuclides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for radioisotopes in radiotherapy and the RMB's role in providing such isotopes domestically.

Method: Monte Carlo (MCNP) simulations and ORIGEN calculations were used to model neutron flux distributions and isotope buildup after neutron irradiation of enriched $Gd_{2}O_{3}$ targets.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that $^{161}Tb$ can be produced at a rate of approximately 4.5 GBq per gram after only 14 days, which matches data from other research reactors. This suggests that terabecquerel-scale yields are feasible with the RMB's current capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings confirm that the RMB can produce $^{161}Tb$ at scales relevant to clinical applications and discuss the potential use of the AVLIS method to further enhance $^{160}Gd$ enrichment for other isotopes.

Abstract: The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) was conceived to meet national needs for radioisotope production, materials irradiation testing, and neutron beam applications. In addition to its 30~MW pool-type reactor, the RMB complex will include additional facilities for radioisotope production and related applications. $^{161}Tb$ is a promising radionuclide for radiopharmaceutical therapy, offering decay properties similar to $^{177}Lu$ but with additional conversion and Auger electrons that enhance dose delivery to cancer cells. In light of this emerging radioisotope, this study explores the potential production of $^{161}Tb$ in the RMB through neutron irradiation of enriched $Gd_{2}O_{3}$ targets. Monte Carlo (MCNP) simulations provided detailed neutron flux distributions, which were used as input for ORIGEN calculations of isotope buildup. Assuming 10 mg targets enriched to 97.5% in $^{160}Gd$, a 40-day irradiation, and a thermal flux of $2 \cdot 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$, the results indicate that $^{161}Tb$ activity reaches approximately 4.5 GBq after 14 days ($\approx 450 GBq/g$), in agreement with data from other research reactors. Building on prior studies that demonstrated the RMB's capability to irradiate larger targets, terabecquerel-scale yields appear feasible. These findings highlight the RMB's potential to support domestic production of emerging therapeutic radionuclides such as $^{161}Tb$. The potential for isotopic enrichment of $^{160}Gd$ using the AVLIS method is also discussed.

Abstract: Multistability -- the emergence of multiple stable states under identical conditions -- is a hallmark of nonlinear complexity and an enabling mechanism for multilevel optical memory and photonic computing. Its realization in a compact footprint, however, is limited by intrinsically weak optical nonlinearities and the enlarged free spectral range that raises the multistability threshold. Here, we overcome this constraint by engineering a pair of spectrally close, ultra-high-Q resonances in a photonic crystal microcavity. Leveraging structural perturbations that deliberately introduce non-Hermitian coupling through a shared radiation channel, we drive the resonances toward an exceptional point with nearly degenerate wavelengths and balanced quality factors approaching $10^6$. This configuration substantially enhances thermo-optical nonlinearity and produces pronounced tristability and hysteresis loops within a footprint of 20 μm at input powers below 240 μW. We further demonstrate proof-of-concept optical random-access memory through controlled switching among multistable states. These results establish a general strategy for nonlinear microcavities to achieve energy-efficient multistability for reconfigurable all-optical memories, logic, and neuromorphic processors.

*Punnag Padhy,Mohammad Asif Zaman,Jennifer Dionne*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper investigates photothermal energy harvesting in high-quality silicon metasurfaces, highlighting the impact of photothermal nonlinearities on matter. The study demonstrates that strong light-matter interactions can lead to significant temperature changes in metasurfaces, with maximum temperatures differing based on the excitation pathway. Temporal dynamics reveal a linear rise to critical temperatures followed by rapid stabilization. A key finding is the emergence of a Q-factor-dependent temperature band splitting, creating a temperature gap that affects the metasurface's resonance. This research opens new possibilities for site-selective catalytic and biochemical reactions enabled by localized heating in high-Q metasurfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to explore and harness photothermal nonlinearities in high-Q metasurfaces for energy harvesting applications, with a focus on understanding how these interactions can be controlled and optimized for various technological purposes.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments using high-quality-factor silicon metasurfaces, employing both direct excitation with a single wavelength and continuous spectral scans. They measured temperature changes and analyzed the temporal dynamics of the photothermal response. Additionally, they investigated the relationship between Q-factor and temperature-dependent properties.

Result: The study reveals several key results: (1) Maximum metasurface temperatures vary significantly based on the excitation pathway, showing a temperature difference of 90°C. (2) The system exhibits a two-stage temperature rise, with an initial linear phase followed by a rapid stabilization. (3) A Q-factor-dependent temperature band splitting and an energy gap of approximately 60°C were observed, indicating that the high temperature steady state is further from nominal resonance than the linewidth allows. (4) The use of hyperspectral accumulation effectively introduces optical states within the bandgap, facilitating efficient energy transfer. (5) The thermal response is tunable by adjusting the metasurface's geometry and material properties.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive understanding of photothermal energy harvesting in high-Q metasurfaces, demonstrating how photothermal interactions can be controlled and utilized for on-chip catalytic and biochemical applications. The findings suggest that high-Q metasurfaces enable localized, path-dependent heating, opening up new possibilities for efficient thermal management and energy conversion in integrated optical systems.

Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions in silicon metasurfaces give rise to photothermal nonlinearities. While the effect of this strong coupling on light has been extensively studied, its impact on matter remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate photothermal energy harvesting using strong light-matter interactions in high-quality-factor metasurfaces. First, we show that maximum metasurface temperatures can differ by $90^\circ C$ based on the spectral excitation pathway: direct excitation of the metasurface from its nominal equilibrium by a single wavelength results in lower metasurface temperatures compared to continuous spectral scans. Investigating the temporal dynamics of this thermo-optic nonlinearity, we show an initial linear rise to a critical temperature over $~10s$ of seconds, followed by a rapid rise to the high temperature steady state in $~33ms$ around the bistable transition point. This linear rise time increases sharply around the bistable transition point. Most significantly, we show emergence of a Q-factor-dependent temperature band splitting and energy gap of around $60^\circ C$ between the critical temperature and the high temperature steady state of the metasurface under single wavelength illumination. This forbidden equilibrium temperature band signifies that the high temperature steady state of the metasurface resonance after transitioning across the laser wavelength is further away from its nominal resonance than its linewidth. Interestingly, hyperspectrally accumulated nonlinearities from prior wavelengths effectively dope the metasurface with optical states within this bandgap. These thermal nonlinearities are tunable using the geometry and material of the metasurface. Collectively, these results show how high-Q metasurfaces enable strongly localized, path-dependent photothermal heating to drive site-selective on-chip catalytic and biochemical transformations.

Result:  100 Mfps, 78.4 Gppixel/s,aker dynamic events

Conclusion:  enable study of things conventional cameras can't, but still has the bad resolution of practical GI at 1 second per frame.

Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) and single-pixel imaging (SPI) techniques enable image reconstruction without spatially resolved detectors, offering unique access to wide spectral ranges and challenging imaging environments. Yet, their adoption has been limited by the slow generation of mask patterns, which constrains achievable frame rates. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast GI that achieves a spatial-temporal information flow of 78.4 gigapixels per second for a single wavelength, at least two orders of magnitude larger than those reported for previous training-data-free GI approaches. This breakthrough is enabled by 25 GHz speckle pattern switching and allows parallelizing the pattern illumination using a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technique. We show that the proposed approach is capable of reconstructing 28$\times$28-pixel images at the exposure time of 10 ns, achieving 100 megaframes per second (Mfps), and demonstrate the GI of a microsecond-scale dynamic event. This approach opens avenues for studying rapid processes in physics, chemistry, and biology, where conventional cameras are limited by detector bandwidth, readout speed, or cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid methodology combining weak value amplification (WVA) and deep learning to enhance the precision of pump-probe interferometry by mitigating residual timing jitter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to overcome the limitations of current techniques in ultrafast spectroscopy, specifically the issue of residual timing jitter, which affects the precision of measurements at the attosecond scale.

Method: The method involves using weak value amplification (WVA) to amplify the minute timing jitter induced by sample perturbations. To address the distortion caused by this amplification, deep learning models, specifically a convolutional neural network regressor (CNN-Regressor) and a classifier (CNN-Classifier), are employed as high-precision parameter estimators. These models are benchmarked against traditional Fourier-transform-based analysis.

Result: The key results are: (1) WVA enhances measurement precision across all estimators by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); (2) Both deep learning models outperform traditional FFT approaches: the CNN-Regressor achieves higher SNR at small weak values, and the CNN-Classifier enables accurate estimation under challenging phase shift conditions where conventional methods fail.

Conclusion: This synergistic combination of WVA and deep learning establishes a powerful framework for attosecond metrology, significantly improving the precision of ultrafast spectroscopy techniques.

Abstract: We introduce a hybrid methodology that synergistically combines weak value amplification (WVA) and deep learning to suppress the limiting effects of residual timing jitter in pump-probe interferometry, achieved through simulations of pump-induced time delays at a few-attosecond resolution. The WVA protocol, employing real weak values, amplifies the minute delay induced by sample perturbation, thereby translating it into a measurable shift of interference fringes. However, this amplification introduces significant fringe distortion. To address this, we deploy deep learning architectures as high-precision parameter estimators: a convolutional neural network regressor (CNN-Regressor) for direct delay estimation and a classifier (CNN-Classifier) for discrete delay categorization. These are systematically benchmarked against traditional Fourier-transform-based analysis. Two key conclusions are drawn: (i) The WVA technique consistently enhances measurement precision across all estimators by effectively increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). (ii) Both deep learning models surpass the traditional FFT approach; the CNN-Regressor achieves a higher SNR at small weak values, while the CNN-Classifier enables accurate estimation even under a challenging "$π$ phase shift" condition where conventional analysis fails. This synergistic combination of WVA and deep learning establishes a powerful framework for attosecond metrology, paving the way for enhanced precision in ultrafast spectroscopy.

Abstract: In recent years, a self-consistent optical thermodynamic framework has emerged that offers a systematic methodology to understand, harness and exploit the complex collective dynamics of multimode nonlinear systems. These developments now allow consideration of a series of longstanding problems in optics, including the prospect of funnelling the entire power flowing in a multimode system into its ground state, for which no methodology currently exists. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical Joule-Thomson expansion process mediated by photon-photon interactions whereby the temperature of the optical gas drops abruptly to zero. Our experiments in various configurations of coupled multicore nonlinear waveguide arrangements illustrate how light undergoing expansion-induced cooling can be channelled from arbitrary input states into the fundamental mode with near-unity efficiency. We show that the stability of the post-expansion state is ensured through an irreversible process of energy conversion. The all-optical thermodynamic phenomena explored in this study may enable innovative techniques where various uncorrelated but identical sources are merged into a unified spatially coherent state, offering a route for direct beam combining.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials, due to their remarkable physical and chemical properties, hold significant potential for future optical and electrical applications. In this study, the synthesis of 2D phlogopite (magnesium-rich mica) via liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) is reported using an efficient and scalable procedure. XRD structural analysis revealed a preferential orientation along the (033) plane, whereas AFM and SEM demonstrated a nanoscale thickness and homogeneous morphology. Optical characterisation by UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy shows tuneable band gaps up to 4.52 eV for the exfoliated 2D phlogopite and distinct vibrational modes indicative of structural evolution. At intense laser conditions, three-photon saturable absorption (3PSA) behaviour was evidenced by light-modulated electrical property studies, which emphasise the potential for optical limiting, switching, and mode-locking applications. The present investigation indicates 2D phlogopite as a versatile material for next-generation optoelectronic devices of high-intensity light modulation.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which incorporates the magnon-photon and magnon-phonon interactions simultaneously, enables rich physical phenomena, including exceptional-point-enhanced sensing, and offers pathways toward topological transitions and nonreciprocal quantum transformation. These interactions exert a pivotal influence on the optical response of a weak probe field and pave the way for novel applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of π/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift. These findings establish a direct correspondence between the PSHE and the underlying non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectrum.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态融合网络(MFN)用于使用修正Michelson干涉仪进行微小位移测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单波长干涉测量存在λ/2相位歧义问题，限制了其精度，因此开发MFN以解决这一问题。

Method: MFN采用双重学习机制，一个头进行亚λ/2位移回归，另一个进行整数干涉阶次分类。

Result: MFN在模拟的2×10^5干涉图上训练，仅需约500实际实验数据，精度为4.84±0.15 nm，分类准确度为98%。在噪声严重情况下，其RMSE仍稳定在16 nm，而传统方法误差超过100 nm。

Conclusion: MFN是一种高效、抗噪声且成本低的单波长干涉测量解决方案，消除了对多波长硬件或复杂相位拟合的需要。

Abstract: We propose a multimodal fusion network (MFN) for precise micro-displacement measurement using a modified Michelson interferometer. The model resolves the intrinsic λ/2 phase ambiguity that limits conventional single-wavelength interferometry by introducing a dual-head learning mechanism: one head performs sub-λ/2 displacement regression, and the other classifies integer interference orders. Unlike dual-wavelength or iterative fitting methods, which require high signal quality and long computation time, MFN achieves robust, real-time prediction directly from interferometric images.
  Trained on 2x10^5 simulated interferograms and fine-tuned with only about 0.24% of real experimental data (about 500 images), the model attains a displacement precision of 4.84 +/- 0.15 nm and an order-classification accuracy of 98%. Even under severe noise, MFN maintains stable accuracy (about 16 nm RMSE), whereas conventional heuristic algorithms exhibit errors exceeding 100 nm. These results demonstrate that MFN offers a fast, noise-tolerant, and cost-efficient solution for single-wavelength interferometric metrology, eliminating the need for multi-wavelength hardware or complex phase fitting.

Motivation: Understanding and controlling topological transitions is crucial for advancing various technologies in electronics, photonics, and quantum mechanics.

Method: Used plasmonic Moire superlattices combined with wavefront engineering to create structured optical skyrmion lattices. The method involved tailoring the phases of elementary evanescent waves in hexagonal systems to induce programmable and scalable topological transitions.

Result: Theoretical calculations showed that the topological invariants can span a wide range (-58 to +58) and are tunable by adjusting the Moire angle. Symmetry constraints lead to specific exclusions in the topological invariants, revealing a strong link between symmetry and quantized topological states. This work opens up new avenues for topology-based applications in structured light, photonic computing, and condensed matter physics.

Conclusion: This study provides a versatile platform for exploring the mechanisms of topological transitions and studying topologically critical phenomena, with potential breakthroughs in structured light, photonic computing, and condensed matter physics

Abstract: Topological transitions are fundamental phenomena in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies. However, the scalability and tunability of Topological transitions in these systems have still been constrained by their material properties or structural rigidities. Here, we demonstrate that plasmonic Moire superlattices offer a platform for large-range and programmable topological transitions via wavefront engineering. By tailoring the phases of elementary evanescent waves in hexagonal systems, we create Moire-structured optical skyrmion lattices whose topological invariants evolve programmably and scalably. Theoretical calculations indicate that the topological invariants span from -58 to +58 and are extendable by tuning the Moire angle. Remarkably, their values are constrained by symmetry to exclude integer multiples of 3/2, revealing an intrinsic link between symmetry and topological quantization. Our work establishes a versatile real-space topology control platform for exploring topological transitions mechanisms and studying topologically critical phenomena, and further promoting breakthroughs in structured light, photonic computing, and condensed matter physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance the capabilities of Brillouin microscopy by addressing its limitations in excitation energy and spectral resolution.

Method: PHBM employs pulsed excitation, reducing energy by 2 orders of magnitude, while using advanced detection techniques to maintain spectral performance.

Result: PHBM achieves low phototoxicity, enabling imaging of sensitive cells; demonstrates high mechanical specificity with double peak resolution; and shows effective imaging of complex tissues.

Conclusion: PHBM offers a practical solution for biomedical research with advantages in excitation energy, spectral resolution, and applications in imaging sensitive samples and complex tissues.

Abstract: Brillouin microscopy (BM) enables three-dimensional, non-contact viscoelastic imaging with high spatial resolution. Since its introduction in 2008, different BM modalities have balanced accessibility and spectral performance. Spontaneous BM offers single-ended access but limited spectral resolution, while stimulated BM provides higher resolution but requires a dual-objective configuration, restricting sample types and thicknesses. Heterodyne BM combines single-ended access with high spectral resolution, yet its demand for high optical power (276 mW) and long pixel dwell time (100 ms) limits biological applications. Here, we present pulsed heterodyne Brillouin microscopy (PHBM), which reduces excitation energy by two orders of magnitude while maintaining high spectral resolution and precision. Using only 10 mW average power and 10 ms pixel dwell time, PHBM achieves 27 MHz intrinsic spectral resolution and 10 MHz shift precision in water. The low phototoxicity of PHBM enables imaging of sensitive single cells, revealing subcellular mechanical features. Moreover, we resolve double Brillouin peaks with frequency separations as small as 200 MHz, demonstrating high mechanical specificity. High-quality imaging of ex vivo porcine cornea further highlights the benefits of single-ended access for thick and complex tissues. The high-resolution, high-accuracy, calibration-free, alignment-free, compact and robust characteristics of PHBM opens new opportunities in biomedical research.

The momentum transfer to the sample modifies the apparent dispersion relation which is significant when the planner sample is tilted.

Abstract: Lithium niobate is one of the most sought-after materials for nanophotonic devices, including frequency converters, modulators, and quantum light sources. Integration of lithium niobate into optical devices, however, is hampered by significant top-down fabrication challenges due to its exceptional chemical resistance. Scalable fabrication methods that preserve material quality while reducing fabrication complexity and cost are, therefore, crucial to advancing lithium niobate devices. We present a photochemical metal-organic decomposition technique for the scalable patterning of lithium niobate at ambient conditions, eliminating the need for harsh etching conditions and cleanroom protocols. The method utilizes a solution of a custom-prepared photosensitive organometallic precursor as a negative photoresist. The UV light exposure of the thin films of the precursor through a photomask, followed by rinsing with ethanol, yields amorphous patterns, which transform into crystalline lithium niobate after a calcination step. This method enables a scalable fabrication of a range of complex geometric shapes with a feature resolution down to $30\,μ\mathrm{m}$. The patterned lithium niobate structures exhibit a tunable second harmonic generation activity with an isotropic optical response. This approach offers a scalable and low-cost pathway for manufacturing lithium niobate photonics and the potential to fabricate other materials (e.g., barium titanite and lithium tantalate).

Abstract: We investigate, by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the single-active-electron approximation in helium, a two-color scheme for tabletop high-order harmonic generation (HHG) that combines a mid-infrared (MIR) driving field with an ultrashort ultraviolet (UV) pulse that could be generated via resonant dispersive wave emission in gas-filled hollow-core fibers. This configuration enables the generation of bright, isolated, and tunable attosecond X-ray pulses. In contrast to single-color driving schemes, which suffer from low conversion efficiency, unfavorable wavelength scaling, and limited spectral control, the MIR+UV approach provides a practical and controllable route for advancing tabletop ultrafast spectroscopy and real-time molecular imaging within current experimental capabilities.

Result: The framework successfully enables high-fidelity holographic video displays and dynamic, full-color holographic videos through single-element rotations in cascaded systems.

Conclusion: This work offers a new approach for optical parameter multiplexing and end-to-end inverse design, with potential applications in compact optical systems and dynamic holography.

Abstract: Mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces capable of translation, rotation, and permutation have attracted considerable attention for high-capacity optical information storage and full-color holographic displays, owing to their low-power and high functional scalability, despite the additional system-level complexity introduced by precision rotation stages. This study presents a differentiable inverse design framework for such metasurfaces, creating an accurate mapping between meta-atom geometries and their multi-channel optical responses across diverse optical dimensions. Using a deep neural network-driven, end-to-end optimization pipeline, the framework enables intelligent, iterative refinement of rotatable metasurface within constrained design space. Using this approach, we show high-fidelity holographic video display by rotating a single element in a cascaded metasurface doublet around the optical axis. The doublet enables pixel-resolved holographic imaging with 288 independent channels, and by switching input/output polarization states, the system demonstrates four distinct full-color dynamic holographic videos. This work establishes an alternative paradigm for optical parameter multiplexing and end-to-end inverse design in mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces, suggesting applications in compact optical systems, dynamic holography, information processing, and optical computing.

Abstract: Measurement of low power infrared light emission spectra from microstructures can be challenging, but is of key importance in several research fields. Fourier transform infrared spectrometers (FTIR) can be used for characterizing such weak light emitters, but this requires additional custom user calibration compared to traditional FTIR measurements of, e.g., transmission or reflection. These calibration techniques are well documented for standalone FTIR instruments but not for microscope coupled-FTIRs, even though such an architecture greatly simplifies collection of light from micro and nano scale structures. We propose and demonstrate a calibration method for microsope-FTIRs based on the well-known emissivity of doped silicon at high temperature. With this method, we measure responsivity and noise floor of a recently installed microscope-FTIR instrument (Bruker\textsuperscript{\textcopyright} Invenio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} R coupled with a Hyperion II microscope), which is found to be within theoretically predicted values. The method is demonstrated for two different detectors (Mercury Cadmium Telluride and Indium Antimonide), in both continuous wave (CW) and modulated (step-scan) emission measurements mode.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for achieving $	extit{PT}$-like phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems by constructing a Hamiltonian as the square root of a supersymmetric partner energy-shifted by a constant. It naturally leads to balanced gain and loss, incorporates non-reciprocal couplings, and exhibits entirely real spectra over a finite parameter range when the corresponding passive Hamiltonian lacks a zero mode. The spectrum undergoes controlled real-to-complex transitions at second-order exceptional points as the non-Hermitian parameter increases. The framework is demonstrated through various examples, including Hatano-Nelson and complex Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models, and can be extended to $q$-commuting matrices for higher-order exceptional points in unidirectional systems. This work bridges non-Hermitian physics and supersymmetry, offering a practical route for engineering photonic arrays with tunable spectral properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to extend the understanding of non-Hermitian systems and their potential applications, particularly in optics and photonics, by introducing a new framework that allows for the realization of $	extit{PT}$-like phase transitions without explicit $	extit{PT}$ symmetry. This could lead to the development of photonic devices with tunable properties, such as waveguides or resonators, with applications in quantum computing, sensing, and communication technologies

Method: The method involves constructing a Hamiltonian as the square root of a supersymmetric partner energy shifted by a constant. The approach naturally leads to bipartite dynamics with balanced gain and loss and can incorporate non-reciprocal couplings. The systems exhibit entirely real spectra over a finite parameter range when the corresponding passive Hamiltonian lacks a zero mode. The framework is systematically used to demonstrate transitions at second-order exceptional points by extending it to $q$-commuting matrices for higher-order exceptional points in unidirectional systems

Result: The paper demonstrates that the proposed framework successfully achieves phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems without explicit $	extit{PT}$ symmetry. It shows that the systems exhibit entirely real spectra under certain conditions, undergo controlled transitions at exceptional points, and can be extended to realize higher-order transitions. The framework is validated through examples such as the Hatano-Nelson and complex Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models, and its extension to $q$-commuting matrices allows for systematic realization of higher-order exceptional points in unidirectional systems. This opens new avenues for both theoretical exploration and practical applications in non-Hermitian physics and photonics

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel approach to achieving $	extit{PT}$-like phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems by leveraging the square root of a supersymmetric partner energy-shifted by a constant. The method results in balanced gain and loss dynamics, incorporates non-reciprocal couplings, and successfully achieves entirely real spectra under specific conditions. The framework not only bridges non-Hermitian physics and supersymmetry but also provides a practical pathway for engineering photonic arrays with tunable spectral properties, offering potential applications in quantum technologies and optics.

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for realizing $\mathcal{PT}$-like phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems without imposing explicit parity--time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. The approach is based on constructing a Hamiltonian as the square root of a supersymmetric partner energy-shifted by a constant. This formulation naturally leads to bipartite dynamics with balanced gain and loss and can incorporate non-reciprocal couplings. The resulting systems exhibit entirely real spectra over a finite parameter range precisely when the corresponding passive Hamiltonian lacks a zero mode. As the non-Hermitian parameter representing gain and loss increases, the spectrum undergoes controlled real-to-complex transitions at second-order exceptional points. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through several examples, including well-known models such as the Hatano--Nelson (HN) and complex Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (cSSH) lattices. Extending the formalism to $q$-commuting matrices further enables the systematic realization of higher-order exceptional points in systems with unidirectional couplings. Overall, this work uncovers new links between non-Hermitian physics and supersymmetry, offering a practical route to engineer photonic arrays with tunable spectral properties beyond what is achievable with explicit $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry.

Abstract: We study a class of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in all-dielectric periodic structures, near which resonant states approach ideal circularly polarized states (CPSs). We term these BICs {\em asymptotically circularly polarized BICs} ({\em acp}-BICs) and identify two types: single-angle and all-angle. Single-angle {\em acp}-BICs permit convergence to left- or right-handed CPSs only along a single momentum-space direction, whereas all-angle {\em acp}-BICs exhibit convergence to CPSs of a single handedness throughout the entire momentum space, rendering them exceptionally promising for chiral optical applications. We reveal that the existence of {\em acp}-BICs is underpinned by total reflection of circularly polarized waves.
  Moreover, all-angle {\em acp}-BICs qualify as super-BICs, with uniform nearby polarization being an intrinsic property.
  In addition, a bifurcation theory is developed to analyze the emergence of genuine CPSs from {\em acp}-BICs
  under $C_{2}$-symmetric structural perturbations.
  Our results suggest {\em acp}-BICs as a platform for singular and chiral optical responses in all-dielectric systems.

Abstract: Integrated photonics is increasingly demanded in applications such as large-scale data centers, intelligent sensing, and next-generation wireless communications, where compact, multifunctional, and energy-efficient components are essential. Inverse-designed photonics, empowered by optimization and learning algorithms, have emerged as a powerful paradigm for realizing compact and multifunctional integrated photonic components. In this work, we develop a staged-annealing topological optimization (SATO) framework tailored for the design of integrated terahertz (THz) beam-shaping devices. Employing this inverse-designed framework, we experimentally demonstrate a class of compact THz vortex beam emitters on an all-silicon on-chip platform. These devices efficiently convert the in-plane fundamental transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode into free-space vortex beams with mode purity up to 87% and energy conversion efficiency up to 74% across the target wavelength range (680 μm to 720 μm). The inverse-designed emitters exhibit ultracompact footprints (lateral size < 4λ) and a free-standing configuration, enabling the generation of dual-directional vortex beams carrying opposite topological charges. The proposed SATO framework provides a generalizable and fabrication-compatible approach for THz photonic device engineering, offering a scalable pathway toward complex structured beam manipulation in next-generation wireless communication systems and on-chip integrated THz photonic systems.

Abstract: A dual-mode asymmetric transmission (AT) nanodevice based on the asymmetric and orthogonal grating-film-grating (AO-GFG) structure is proposed and systematically investigated theoretically. The device supports two distinct localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes for forward transmission, corresponding to the polarization-dependent (M1) and the polarization-independent (M2) resonances, respectively. This results in the fact that when x-polarized light is incident, only M2 exists; when y-polarized light is incident, both M1 and M2 exist. Besides, both modes yield the maximum isolation ratio of more than 10 dB. The electric field distributions further indicate that M2 exhibits strong confinement and efficient tunneling through the metallic film, while M1 shows weaker but more polarization-sensitive hybridization. The coexistence and tunability of these two modes constitute the physical basis of dual-mode AT, highlighting the AO-GFG structure as a promising platform for high-isolation and polarization-tunable plasmonic devices in the visible and near-infrared regions.

Abstract: Detecting Pancharatnam-Berry geometric phases of light typically requires interferometry or diffraction through a specially truncated aperture. Here, we introduce a simpler method that allows direct and fully visual detection of geometric phases in structured light without using interferometers or beam truncation. Our approach takes advantage of the geometric phase that naturally arises in SU(2) structured beams, where spatial wave packets follow caustic trajectories during propagation. By observing the evolution of these caustic-linked wave packets, we directly visualize both the geometric phase and the Gouy phase. This visual detection method provides new insight into geometric phases in complex optical fields and expands the possibilities for designing optical systems that exploit phase geometry.

Abstract: We consider theoretical models of the nanolaser and logic gates on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In our work, it is shown at pumping the nanoresonator of the nanolaser on CNT by optical radiation using a quantum dot as nano light emitted diode (LED), the coherent flow of surface plasmon-polaritons arises when the generation threshold is exceeded. The coherent plasmonic flow from the partially reflecting mirror of the nanolaser enters the attached CNT plasmonic waveguide. Plasmonic logic gates NOT and OR based on CNTs represent the complete functional basis for binary logic. The proposed nanolaser and logic gates on CNTs can be used in plasmonic circuitry in the telecommunication frequency band.

The surfaces can be reflectors or lenses, and control both the spatial and directional source and target coordinates of light rays. From energy conservation we derive Jacobian equations for optical mappings, and the optical path length provides generating functions for the optical surfaces. A three-stage least-squares algorithm numerically solves the resulting equations. We present examples with complex source and target distributions.

Abstract: Pushing nanoscale optical confinement to its ultimate limits defines the regime of nano-cavity quantum electrodynamics (nano-cQED), where light--matter interactions approach the fundamental quantum limits of individual atoms, e.g., picocavities. However, realizing such extreme confinement in a stable and controllable manner remains a key challenge. Here, we introduce a van der Waals material-based nano-cQED platform by coupling monolayer MoS2 excitons to plasmonic sub-nanocavities formed via assembly of ultrasmall gold clusters (3-5 nm) in the nanogap of a nanoparticle-on-mirror nanocavity. These clusters emulate the field-confining role of atomic protrusions of the picocavities through a resonance-insensitive lightning-rod effect, achieving deep-subwavelength mode volumes. In this nano-cQED testbed, we observe pronounced multi-branch Rabi splittings and ultrastrong lower-branch polaritonic photoluminescence with up to 10^4-fold enhancement. This deterministic architecture provides a controllable pathway to access picocavity-like behavior and opens new opportunities for single-molecule spectroscopy and the exploration of nano-cQED.

TL;DR: This study explores the microscopic design of molecules to improve their second-order nonlinear response in organic thin films.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for high-efficiency, large-area nonlinear photonic materials, which are essential for next-gen integrated photonics. The challenge of reduced device efficiency and complexity is tackled through molecular engineering.

Method: The researchers synthesized and characterized four derivatives of the TPA-QCN molecule, designed to enhance nonlinear properties. Real-space measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to correlate optical properties with structural features.

Result: Adding an intramolecular bridge to lock the molecule's orientation significantly enhanced the second-order nonlinear response, with nonlinear susceptibilities reaching 16 and 18 pm V⁻¹ at 1550 nm. Analysis revealed that better molecular orientation was the key factor driving performance improvements.

Conclusion: The study shows that molecular structural design can effectively enhance nonlinear optical properties in poling-free materials, making them viable for integrated photonic applications despite limitations like losses and complexity.

Abstract: Materials with large second-order nonlinearities are crucial for next-generation integrated photonics. Spontaneously oriented organic thin films prepared by physical vapor deposition offer a promising poling-free and scalable approach. This study investigates molecular engineering strategies to enhance the second-order nonlinear response of derivatives based on the donor-acceptor molecule 2-(4'-diphenylaminobiphenyl-4-yl)quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (TPA-QCN). Four derivatives incorporating modifications designed to increase molecular hyperpolarizability ($β$) or promote favorable orientation were synthesized and characterized. The most successful modification, intramolecular bridge-locking, simultaneously increases hyperpolarizability and enhances spontaneous orientation by reducing detrimental electrostatic interactions during deposition. It leads to a significant enhancement of the second-order nonlinear response, achieving off-resonance $χ^{(2)}_{31} \approx 16$ pm V$^{-1}$ and $χ^{(2)}_{33} \approx 18$ pm V$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm, a twofold improvement over the parent TPA-QCN. Analysis combining nonlinear optical measurements, surface potential measurement, optical anisotropy, and density functional theory calculations indicates that improved molecular orientation, rather than increased $β$ alone, is the primary driver for the enhanced performance in the leading derivatives. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of targeting molecular orientation via structural design and position spontaneously oriented organic films as compelling poling-free candidates for integrated nonlinear photonic applications where the increased electrode-induced optical losses, fabrication complexity and footprint are a critical limitation.

Abstract: Halide perovskites exhibit significant advantages for active optical components such as light emitting diodes, solar cells and photodetectors due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Their nonlinear optical effects and other characteristics also make them suitable for integration into waveguide components, such as optical fibers, for applications like optical modulation. Although some efforts have been made to integrate perovskite nanomaterials with optical fibers, technological challenges have hindered reliable in-situ preparation methods. Herein, we propose an area-selective wetting strategy for optical fibers, which utilizes hydrophobic sidewalls and hydrophilic end facets to reliably hold small precursor droplets. By introducing a space confinement strategy to suppress the kinetics of solvent evaporation, Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals were successfully grown in-situ on the fiber end facet. The versatility of this in-situ growth method for single crystals on fiber end facets of various sizes has also been verified. In a separate approach, the controllable in-situ preparation of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline thin films was achieved through vacuum-assisted rapid crystallization. Our strategy provides a controllable platform for the integration of perovskite materials and optical fibers, enabling further development in optical applications.

Abstract: Integer factorization is a computational problem of fundamental importance in cybersecurity and secure communications, as its difficulty form the basis of modern public-key cryptography. While Shor's algorithm can solve this problem efficiently on a universal quantum computer, near-term devices require alternative approaches. The Adiabatic Factorization Algorithm and its digitized counterparts offer a promising NISQ-era pathway but suffer from high-order many-body interactions that are difficult to implement. In this work, we propose a modified QAOA-based factorization protocol that simplifies the interacting Hamiltonian to include only two-body terms, significantly reducing its experimental complexity. Numerical simulations show that this method achieves comparable or higher fidelities than the standard protocol, while requiring fewer quantum resources and converging more rapidly for problem instances up to eight qubits. We analyze the characteristic fidelity behavior introduced by the Hamiltonian modification. Additionally, we report on simulations with alternative cost-function definitions that frequently yielded improved performance.

Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently sample from probability distributions that are believed to be classically intractable, providing a foundation for quantum generative modeling. However, practical training of such models remains challenging, as gradient evaluation via the parameter-shift rule scales linearly with the number of parameters and requires repeated expectation-value estimation under finite-shot noise. We introduce a training framework that extends the principle of contrastive divergence to quantum models. By deriving the circuit structure and providing a general recipe for constructing it, we obtain quantum circuits that generate the samples required for parameter updates, yielding constant scaling with respect to the cost of a forward pass, analogous to backpropagation in classical neural networks. Numerical results demonstrate that it attains comparable accuracy to likelihood-based optimization while requiring substantially fewer samples. The framework thereby establishes a scalable route to training expressive quantum generative models directly on quantum hardware.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study exact quantum recurrences in the double kicked top (DKT), a driven spin model that extends the quantum kicked top (QKT) by introducing an additional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kick. Reformulating its dynamics in terms of effective parameters $k_r$ and $k_θ$, we analytically show exact periodicity of the Floquet operator for $k_r = jπ/2$ and $k_r = jπ/4$ with distinct periods for integer and half-odd integer $j$. These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_θ$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = jπ/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_θ= \pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_θ= 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $jπ/2$. Our work demonstrates that regular and chaotic regimes can be controlled for any system size by tuning $k_r$ and $k_θ$, making the DKT a useful platform for quantum control and information processing applications.

We verify that the level of coherence between groups of emitters travelling at different speeds is unchanged in all reference frames. We also derive relativistic versions of the maser equations applicable in the steady-state regime.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation with competing powers (p,q), specifically for the cases (2,3), (3,4), and (3,5). It shows that in the anticontinuum limit, intrinsic localized modes are compact and classified by their codes, which indicate the state and sign of each mode. Through spectral stability analysis, the paper determines that certain codes are stable, while others are unstable. Numerical simulations further validate these findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work is driven by the need to understand the stability properties of localized modes in nonlinear systems, which is crucial for applications in physics and engineering, such as in the behavior of optical pulses and energy localization in discrete systems.

Method: The authors employ spectral stability analysis, a mathematical technique that examines the eigenvalues of the linearized system about the localized modes to determine their stability. Additionally, numerical simulations are used to confirm the analytical findings.

Result: The key results are the identified conditions under which specific codes (classification of modes) are stable. Codes with larger states of the same sign are found to be orbitally stable, while smaller, alternating-sign states exhibit spectral stability but with particular eigenvalue properties (negative Krein signature). The paper also identifies which combinations of these states are numerically stable.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of mode stability in nonlinear systems, with implications for the design and control of discrete systems such as waveguide arrays and discrete nonlinear media.

Abstract: We study the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation with competing powers (p,q) satisfying 2 <= p < q. The physically relevant cases are given by (p,q) = (2,3), (p,q) = (3,4), and (p,q) = (3,5). In the anticontinuum limit, all intrinsic localized modes are compact and can be classified by their codes, which record one of two nonzero (smaller and larger) states and their sign alternations. By using the spectral stability analysis, we prove that the codes for larger states of the same sign are spectrally and nonlinearly (orbitally) stable, whereas the codes for smaller states of the alternating signs are spectrally stable but have eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. We also identify numerically the spectrally stable codes which consist of stacked combinations of the sign-definite larger states and the sign-alternating smaller states.

Abstract: We present a non-perturbative Hamiltonian mapping method for quantum systems strongly coupled to a quantized field mode (cavity), yielding compact closed-form representations of hybrid light-matter systems. The mapping method builds on an entangling transformation of photonic and atomic degrees of freedom. By truncating the resulting cavity-dressed Hamiltonian (CDH) to successively larger excitation sectors, we construct a series of compact models that converge to the exact limit, outpacing conventional approaches even in the challenging resonant and ultrastrong light-matter regime. The mapping principle also applies to multimode cavities coupled to matter through noncommuting operators and to leaky cavities. We benchmark the CDH framework on the quantum Rabi model, demonstrating accurate spectral predictions in both weak and strong coupling regimes, together with converging ground-state and thermal observables. We study the Dicke-Heisenberg lattice model and determine its phase diagram under resonant and strong light-matter coupling, achieving significant computational savings over brute-force simulations and identifying cavity-mediated spin correlations both analytically and numerically. The closed-form and compactness of the CDH provide both physical insight and enhanced computational efficiency, facilitating studies of strongly coupled hybrid light-matter systems.

These results provide the first demonstration of error-mitigated multicomponent correlated simulations on quantum hardware and outline a path toward scalable algorithms unifying electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom.

Abstract: We report a new oscillatory form in the two coupled dissipative Rydberg atomic chains by modulating its spacing. Such oscillation has $π$-phase difference between two neighboring sites, which distinguishes itself from antiferromagnetic-type synchronization in the previous studies. Theoretically, we find a phase with coexisting two types of continuous time crystals, and recognize that the transition belongs to Hopf and pitchfork bifurcation. Furthermore, we generalize the conclusion to multiple chains and verify the uniqueness of the new synchronization mode. We also discuss its experimental feasibility.

Abstract: Quantum computation departs from the classical paradigm of deterministic, bit-based processing by exploiting inherently quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations.

Motivation: Exploring the potential of quantum materials for quantum computing applications.

Method: Analyzing the ground state properties of the spin-1 XXZ chain with uniaxial and Ising anisotropies within the Haldane phase to evaluate gate fidelity.

Result: Demonstrated gate fidelity exceeding 0.99 for single-qubit gates via appropriate tuning of parameters.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum computation based on quantum spin chains.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the ground state of a spin-1 XXZ chain with uniaxial anisotropies, single-ion anisotropy $D$ and Ising anisotropy $J$, within the Haldane phase can serve as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation implementing single-qubit gates. The gate fidelity of both elementary rotation gates and general single-qubit unitary gates composed of rotations about the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes is evaluated, and is found to exceed 0.99 when $D$ or $J$ is appropriately tuned. Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the rotation-gate fidelity under the assumption that the state lies within the $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$-protected Haldane phase, showing that it is determined by the post-measurement spin-spin correlation function and the failure probability. The observed enhancement of gate fidelity in the spin-1 XXZ chain originates from the strengthening of antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations near the AFM phase, which effectively suppresses failure states.

Abstract: We derive a closed-form expression for the Bell--CHSH correlation of entangled, counter-propagating electrons using realistic Dirac wavepackets and localized detection. In contrast to the conventional distance-independent result, the Bell parameter evolves continuously from the quantum bound $2\sqrt{2}$ to the classical limit $2$ as the spatial overlap of the two waves decreases. The quantum enhancement arises entirely from transverse overlap, showing that the Bell violation reflects the local overlap of propagating Dirac waves rather than any action at a distance.

Abstract: Photon-number resolved detection with superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) attracts increasing interest, but lacks a systematic framework for interpreting and benchmarking this capability. In this work, we combine principal component analysis (PCA) with a new readout technique to explore the photon-number resolving capabilities of SNSPDs and find that the information of the photon number is contained in a single principal component which approximates the time derivative of the average response trace. We introduce a new confidence metric based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient to quantify the photon-number-resolving capabilities of a detector system and show that this metric can be used to compare different systems. Our analysis and interpretation of the principal components imply that photon-number resolution in SNSPDs can be achieved with moderate hardware requirements in terms of both sample rate (5 GSample/sec) and analog bandwidth (3 GHz) and could be implemented in an FPGA, giving a highly scalable solution for real-time photon counting.

Conclusion: QAAE提供了一种无变分参数且兼容当前量子计算机硬件的方法，可用于基态估计问题的量子模拟。该方法在精度和稳定性上优于基于能量梯度的变分量子 BOTTOM。

Abstract: Ground-state estimation lies at the heart of a broad range of quantum simulations. Most near-term approaches are cast as variational energy minimization and thus inherit the challenges of problem-specific energy landscapes. We develop the quantum amplitude-amplification eigensolver (QAAE), which departs from the variational paradigm and instead coherently drives a trial state toward the ground state via quantum amplitude amplification. Each amplitude-amplification round interleaves a reflection about the learned trial state with a controlled short-time evolution under a normalized Hamiltonian; an ancilla readout yields an amplitude-amplified pure target state that a state-learning step then re-encodes into an ansatz circuit for the next round -- without evaluating the energy gradients. Under standard assumptions (normalized $\hat{H}$, a nondegenerate ground-state, and a learning update), the ground-state overlap increases monotonically per round and the procedure converges; here, a per-round depth bound in terms of the ansatz depth and Hamiltonian-simulation cost establishes hardware compatibility. Cloud experiments on IBMQ processor verify our amplification mechanism on a two-level Hamiltonian and a two-qubit Ising model, and numerical benchmarks on $\mathrm{H}_2$, $\mathrm{LiH}$, and a $10$-qubit longitudinal-and-transverse-field Ising model show that QAAE integrates with chemistry-inspired and hardware-efficient circuits and can surpass gradient-based VQE in accuracy and stability. These results position QAAE as a variational-free and hardware-compatible route to ground-state estimation for near-term quantum simulation.

Abstract: Quantum batteries have attracted significant attention as efficient quantum energy storage devices.In this work, we propose a nonlinear two-photon driving quantum battery model featuring nonreciprocal dynamics that enables a highly efficient unidirectional charging mechanism through environmental engineering. Using a Markovian master-equation approach, we derive analytical solutions for the system dynamics and identify the parameter regime required for dynamical equilibration. Our results reveal that increasing the driving strength enhances both energy conversion and storage efficiency, albeit at the cost of longer equilibration times. Compared with single-photon driving, the two-photon process exhibits a pronounced advantage in energy capacity and entropy regulation, which becomes more prominent under stronger driving. Under asymmetric dissipation, optimizing the system-bath coupling can further improve performance. The proposed model is experimentally feasible and can be implemented across multiple quantum platforms, including photonic systems, superconducting circuits, and magnonic devices.

Abstract: High-Q optical microresonators combine low losses and high optical energy concentration in a small effective mode volume, making them an attractive platform for optical sensors. While light is confined in the microresonator by total internal reflection, a portion of the optical field, known as the evanescent field, extends outside. This makes the mode's resonant frequency sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment.
  In this work, we explore the quantum sensitivity limits of this type of sensors. We demonstrate that by preparing the probe light in a squeezed quantum state, it is possible to surpass the shot-noise limit. The resulting sensitivity is constrained only by optical losses and the available degree of squeezing. The influence of the losses can be reduced using additional squeezing of the light inside the microresonator.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the task of optimizing the parameters in Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). While popular algorithms, such as Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), limit the number of circuit-execution to two per iteration, irrespective of the number of parameters in the circuit, they have their own challenges. These methods use central-differences to calculate biased estimates of directional derivatives. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that this may lead to instabilities in \emph{training} the PQCs. To remedy this, we propose Stochastic Shadow Descent (\texttt{SSD}), which uses random-projections (or \emph{shadows}) of the gradient to update the parameters iteratively. We eliminate the bias in directional derivatives by employing the Parameter-Shift Rule, along with techniques from Quantum Signal Processing, to construct a quantum circuit that parsimoniously computes \emph{unbiased estimates} of directional derivatives. Finally, we prove the convergence of the \texttt{SSD} algorithm, provide worst-case bounds on the number of iterations, and numerically demonstrate its efficacy.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates charging optimization for inhomogeneous Dicke batteries using reinforcement learning, comparing policies across different observability regimes. The results show that full observability yields near-optimal performance, while partial observability can be compensated by incorporating second-order correlations. The learned nonmyopic policies effectively balance immediate performance with long-term outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization of quantum battery charging is crucial for their practical implementation, particularly under conditions of inhomogeneity and partial observability. This paper uses reinforcement learning to address these challenges by evaluating different observability levels.

Method: The study employs reinforcement learning to optimize piecewise-constant charging policies for an inhomogeneous Dicke battery. It systematically compares policies across four observability regimes, from full-state access to experimentally accessible observables such as individual two-level system energies, first-order averages, and second-order correlations.

Result: Simulation results reveal that full observability provides near-optimal ergotropy with low variability. However, under partial observability, policies that access only single-TLS energies or energies plus first-order averages perform less optimally compared to the fully observed baseline. Incorporating second-order correlations into these policies significantly improves their performance, achieving 94%-98% of the full-state baseline.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate a practical approach to developing effective fast-charging protocols under realistic information constraints. The learned nonmyopic policies allow for trading off temporary plateaus or declines in performance for better terminal outcomes, which is particularly valuable in real-world scenarios where perfect information is often unavailable.

Abstract: Charging optimization is a key challenge to the implementation of quantum batteries, particularly under inhomogeneity and partial observability. This paper employs reinforcement learning to optimize piecewise-constant charging policies for an inhomogeneous Dicke battery. We systematically compare policies across four observability regimes, from full-state access to experimentally accessible observables (energies of individual two-level systems (TLSs), first-order averages, and second-order correlations). Simulation results demonstrate that full observability yields near-optimal ergotropy with low variability, while under partial observability, access to only single-TLS energies or energies plus first-order averages lags behind the fully observed baseline. However, augmenting partial observations with second-order correlations recovers most of the gap, reaching 94%-98% of the full-state baseline. The learned schedules are nonmyopic, trading temporary plateaus or declines for superior terminal outcomes. These findings highlight a practical route to effective fast-charging protocols under realistic information constraints.

Abstract: We present a channel-constrained Markovian quantum diffusion (CCMQD) model that prepares quantum states by rigorously framing the generative process within the dynamics of open quantum systems. Our model interprets the forward diffusion process as natural decoherence using quantum master equations, whereas the reverse denoising is achieved by learning inverse quantum channels. Our core innovation is a comprehensive channel-constrained framework: we model the diffusion and denoising steps as quantum channels defined by Kraus operators, ensure their physical validity through optimization on the Stiefel manifold, and introduce tailored training strategies and loss functions that leverage this constrained structure for high-fidelity state reconstruction. Experimental validation on systems ranging from single qubits to entangled states $7$ -qubits demonstrates high-fidelity state generation, achieving fidelities exceeding $0.998$ under both random and depolarizing noise conditions. This work confirms that quantum diffusion can be characterized as a controlled Markov evolution, demonstrating that environmental interactions are not limited to being a source of decoherence but can also be utilized to achieve high-fidelity quantum state synthesis.

Abstract: The realization of quantum technologies in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era is severely constrained by qubit decoherence and control errors, presenting fundamental challenges to achieving quantum advantages. Dynamical decoupling is a widely used, powerful technique for decoherence error suppression. However, it is susceptible to control errors, making non-robust sequences like UDD impractical to implement and robust ones like CPMG to significantly overestimate decoherence times. This overestimation issue remains largely unexplored in the past few decades, leading to many reports of exceptionally long yet plausible decoherence times across various qubit platforms. Here, we construct Hadamard phase cycling as a non-Markovian quantum error mitigation method for dynamical decoupling. This method exploits group structure to design phase configurations of equivalent ensemble quantum circuits, effectively eliminates circuit outputs generated from erroneous dynamics, and scales linearly with circuit depth. Harnessing its error mitigation capability for ensemble solid-state electron spin qubits embedded in paramagnetic molecules and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond enables accurate acquisition of decoherence times. Applying Hadamard phase cycling on single trapped ion and superconducting transmon qubits effectively preserves their state fidelity during dynamical decoupling. The integration of scalable quantum error mitigation and suppression would facilitate the development of quantum technologies with noisy qubits and control hardware.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional anisotropic XY model subject to a complex-valued transverse field. Within the biorthogonal framework, we calculate the ground-state correlation functions and entanglement entropy, confirming that their scaling behavior remains identical to that in the Hermitian XY model. The preservation of Hermitian phase transition features in the non-Hermitian setting is rooted in the persistence and emergence of symmetries and their breaking. Specifically, the ferromagnetic (FM) phase arises from the breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry, while the Luttinger liquid (LL) phase is enabled by the emergence of a $U(1)$ symmetry together with the degeneracy of the real part of the energy spectrum. The nontrivial topology of the LL phase are characterized by the winding number around the exceptional point (EP). Given that non-Hermitian systems are inherently open, this research opens a new avenue for exploring conventional quantum phase transitions that are typically vulnerable to decoherence and environmental disruption in open quantum systems.

Abstract: The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.

Motivation: Addressing the scalability issues of quantum networks using improved QAN protocols and integrating them seamlessly with existing network infrastructure to enhance security.

Method: Investigated the performance of an enhanced QAN protocol using rotation operations on GHZ states under dephasing noise; proposed a machine learning integration for classification.

Result: The modified QAN protocol significantly outperforms existing QAN approaches in resilience to false notifications under dephasing noise conditions.

Conclusion: Proposed QAN enhancements consolidate against quantum channel decoherence and integrate well with augmented networks, promise improved security in quantum communication networks.

Abstract: The scalability of current quantum networks is limited due to noisy quantum components and high implementation costs, thereby limiting the security advantages that quantum networks provide over their classical counterparts. Quantum Augmented Networks (QuANets) address this by integrating quantum components in classical network infrastructure to improve robustness and end-to-end security. To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises. In this work, we propose an improved quantum anonymous notification (QAN) protocol that utilizes rotation operations on shared GHZ states to produce an anonymous notification in an n-user quantum-augmented network. We study the behavior of this modified QAN protocol under the dephasing noise model and observe stronger resilience to false notifications than earlier QAN approaches. The QAN framework is also proposed to be integrated with a machine-learning classifier, enhanced quantum-augmented network. Finally, we discuss how this notification layer integrates with QuANets so that receivers can allow switch-bypass handling of quantum payloads, reducing header-based information leakage and vulnerability to targeted interference at compromised switches.

Abstract: Conservation of symmetries plays a crucial role in both classical and quantum simulations of many-body systems, enabling the tracking of states with specific symmetry properties and leading to substantial reductions in the number of optimization parameters. The design of efficient quantum circuits that enforce all symmetries typically encountered in chemistry has remained elusive, mainly due to the interplay of point group and spin symmetries. By exploiting Lie algebraic techniques, we derive exact product formulas representing symmetry-adapted unitaries. These decompositions allow us to design the most efficient symmetry-preserving quantum circuits to date. Finally, we introduce a minimum universal symmetry-adapted operator pool to further reduce the required quantum resources.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new post-quantum cryptography scheme, CHSH-Kyber, which integrates quantum non-locality verification into lattice-based KEMs to enhance security against hybrid attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the threat of quantum computing, traditional cryptography is insufficient. This paper aims to develop a robust post-quantum scheme that safeguards against both classical and quantum attacks.

Method: The authors propose integrating the CHSH game with Kyber's key exchange mechanism. They use EPR pairs for quantum non-locality tests and formally reduce the security to Module-LWE and a QMA-complete problem.

Result: The CHSH-Kyber scheme provides forward-secure, composable key agreement. It's compatible with the FO transform, ensuring CCA security. Quantum tests yield advantages beyond classical limits, offering information-theoretic and computational security.

Conclusion: CHSH-Kyber represents a novel hybrid post-quantum framework combining lattice cryptography and quantum physics for secure key agreement.

Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) must secure large-scale communication systems against quantum adversaries where classical hardness alone is insufficient and purely quantum schemes remain impractical. Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) such as CRYSTALS-Kyber provide efficient quantum-resistant primitives but rely solely on computational hardness assumptions that are susceptible to hybrid classical-quantum attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)-certified Kyber protocol, which embeds quantum non-locality verification directly within the key exchange phase. The proposed design integrates CHSH entanglement tests using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs to yield measurable quantum advantage values exceeding classical correlation limits, thereby coupling information--theoretic quantum guarantees with lattice-based computational security. Formal reductions demonstrate that any polynomial-time adversary breaking the proposed KEM must either solve the Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem or a Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA)-complete instance of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem, under the standard complexity assumption QMA $\subset$ NP. The construction remains fully compatible with the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, preserving chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security and Kyber's efficiency profile. The resulting CHSH-augmented Kyber scheme therefore establishes a mathematically rigorous, hybrid post-quantum framework that unifies lattice cryptography and quantum non-locality to achieve verifiable, composable, and forward-secure key agreement.

Abstract: The Hawking effect amplifies fluctuations in the vicinity of horizons, both in black holes and in analogue platforms.
  Here, we consider a polariton simulator and numerically examine the \emph{stimulated} Hawking effect using a coherent probe incident on the horizon from the exterior.
  We implement an experimentally realistic effective spacetime that supports a quasinormal mode (QNM) in the vicinity of the horizon.
  We find that the stimulated Hawking effect manifests as transmission into a negative-energy Bogoliubov channel inside the horizon, consistent with pseudo-unitary Bogoliubov scattering.
  Moreover, transmission across the horizon peaks at the QNM frequency.
  The computed spectral signatures provide a practical guide for future experimental investigations of the Hawking effect and its interplay with QNMs, an open question in quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an experimentally viable scheme to enhance the simultaneous estimation precision of the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, with a particular focus on the performance of heterodyne detection. By comparing simultaneous and individual estimation strategies, we demonstrate that the simultaneous approach offers a notable advantage in our system. To support this, we compute the quantum Fisher information matrices (QFIMs) based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). Our results show that the quantum Cramér Rao bound (QCRB) associated with the RLD is consistently lower than that of the SLD, indicating superior estimation precision. From a physical standpoint, this improvement reflects the system's enhanced capacity to encode, transfer, and extract quantum information while allowing optimal control of fundamental interactions. We show that increasing the Rabi frequency, cavity loss rate, and the average number of photons and phonons, combined with reduced mechanical damping and temperature, enhances the system's sensitivity to the coupling parameters. These mechanisms act on the available quantum resources, such as entanglement, squeezing, and state purity, leading to more precise estimations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that under certain conditions, heterodyne detection can closely approach the ultimate precision set by the QFIM. This suggests that a measurement strategy based on heterodyne detection can offer an efficient and practical route for estimating the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, paving the way for high precision hybrid quantum sensors.

Abstract: Quantum optimization allows for up to exponential quantum speedups for specific, possibly industrially relevant problems. As the key algorithm in this field, we motivate and discuss the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which can be understood as a slightly generalized version of Quantum Annealing for gate-based quantum computers. We delve into the quantum circuit implementation of the QAOA, including Hamiltonian simulation techniques for higher-order Ising models, and discuss parameter training using the parameter shift rule. An example implementation with Pennylane source code demonstrates practical application for the Maximum Cut problem. Further, we show how constraints can be incorporated into the QAOA using Grover mixers, allowing to restrict the search space to strictly valid solutions for specific problems. Finally, we outline the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) as a generalization of the QAOA, highlighting its potential in the NISQ era and addressing challenges such as barren plateaus and ansatz design.

Motivation: Understanding the locality of Everettian quantum mechanics (EQM) is key to grasping its implications for quantum nonlocality.

Method: Analyzed EQM's mechanism for global state changes and their role in explaining Bell correlations.

Result: EQM's reliance on global states implies it's not local, countering the view that only local actions at a distance are nonlocal.

Conclusion: EQM offers a novel explanation for quantum nonlocality without traditional local influences between distant systems.

Abstract: According to a common view, Everettian quantum mechanics (EQM) is a local theory because it avoids nonlocal action at a distance, and this is an important point in EQM's favor. Unlike collapse theories, EQM does not allow an action on one system to change the reduced density matrix (RDM) of a remote entangled system - a clear case of nonlocal action. However, EQM does allow an action on one system to change the global state of the system and its remote entangled partners. We argue that such changes should also count as nonlocal actions, meaning EQM is not local after all. First, we consider an argument to the contrary, which deems such global changes to be mere extrinsic changes, whereas nonlocal action requires intrinsic changes to the remote system. We respond that the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction is problematic and cannot hold the weight of this argument. We then try to clarify when actions that change global states count as nonlocal actions. We argue that it is when the global states are essential explanatory mechanisms of the theory. In EQM, the global state is needed to explain why, in an anti-correlated Bell state, Alice's measuring spin-up ensures that she encounters only the branch where Bob measures spin-down.

TL;DR: An efficient open-source simulator for fermionic linear optical circuits with controlled-phase gates is developed, which can compute Born-rule probabilities with both exact and approximate methods. The simulator's runtime scales exponentially only with the magnitudes of the angles in the controlled-phase gates. This feature allows it to handle certain systems beyond the reach of conventional methods.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to develop efficient simulation tools for fermionic linear optical circuits, which are crucial for advancing quantum algorithms in chemistry and other related domains. The existing state-vector methods often struggle with large systems, so creating a simulator that trades off some accuracy for efficiency is particularly useful for such scenarios. Additionally, leveraging existing methods like SQD to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency is a significant goal in quantum computing research.

Method: The method involves developing a simulator for circuits composed of passive fermionic linear optical elements and controlled-phase gates. The simulator supports both exact and approximate probability calculations. For approximate calculations, the runtime scales exponentially only with the magnitudes of the angles in the controlled-phase gates, making it more efficient for certain systems. The simulator was then applied to simulate the LUCJ ansatz and integrate it with SQD to improve molecular ground-state energy estimates.

Result: The simulator demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy when applied to a 52-qubit nitrogen molecule system, achieving up to 46% improvement over existing SQD implementations. This result highlights the effectiveness of the simulator in handling large fermionic systems and its potential to enhance near-term quantum algorithms in chemistry.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this simulator represents a valuable advancement in the efficient simulation of fermionic linear optical circuits, particularly for systems where exact methods are computationally prohibitive. By enabling accurate simulations with manageable computational overhead, the simulator facilitates further research and development in quantum chemistry and related fields.

Abstract: We present and open source a simulator for circuits composed of passive fermionic linear optical elements and controlled-phase gates. Given such a circuit, our simulator can compute Born-rule probabilities for samples drawn from it. Our simulator supports both exact and approximate probability calculation, allowing users to trade accuracy for efficiency as needed. For approximate Born-rule probability calculation, our simulator's runtime is exponential only in the magnitudes of the angles of the circuit's controlled-phase gates. This makes our simulator useful for simulating certain systems that are beyond the reach of conventional state vector methods. We demonstrate our simulator's utility by simulating the local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz and integrating it with sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) to improve the accuracy of molecular ground-state energy estimates. Applied to a 52-qubit $N_2$ system, we observe accuracy improvements of up to $46\%$ over the baseline SQD implementation with negligible computational overhead. As an efficient and flexible tool for simulating fermionic circuits, our simulator enables new opportunities for enhancing near-term quantum algorithms in chemistry and related domains.

Abstract: The characterization of high-dimensional quantum entanglement is crucial for advanced quantum computing and quantum information algorithms. Traditional methods require extensive data acquisition and suffer from limited visibility due to experimental noise. Here, we introduce a sparsity-driven framework to enhance the detection and certification of high-dimensional entanglement in spatially entangled photon pairs. By applying $\ell_1$-regularized reconstruction to sample covariance matrices obtained from measurements on photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) measurements, we enhance the visibility of the correlation signal while suppressing noise. We demonstrate, using a position-momentum Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement criterion, that this approach enables certification of an entanglement dimensionality that cannot be achieved without regularization. Our method is scalable, simple to use and compatible with existing quantum-optics platforms, thus paves the way for efficient, real-time analysis of high-dimensional quantum states.

Abstract: The quantum Wasserstein distance (W-distance) is a fundamental metric for quantifying the distinguishability of quantum operations, with critical applications in quantum error correction. However, computing the W-distance remains computationally challenging for multiqubit systems due to exponential scaling. We present a machine learning framework that efficiently predicts the quantum W-distance by extracting physically meaningful features from quantum state pairs, including Pauli measurements, statistical moments, quantum fidelity, and entanglement measures. Our approach employs both classical neural networks and traditional machine learning models. On three-qubit systems, the best-performing Random Forest model achieves near-perfect accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9999$) with mean absolute errors on the order of $10^{-5}$. We further validate the framework's practical utility by successfully verifying two fundamental theoretical propositions in quantum information theory: the bound on measurement probability differences between unitary operations and the $W_1$ gate error rate bound. The results establish machine learning as a viable and scalable alternative to traditional numerical methods for W-distance computation, with particular promise for real-time quantum circuit assessment and error correction protocol design in NISQ devices.

Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, standard methods relying on active measurements may introduce additional errors. Autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) circumvents this by utilizing engineered dissipation and drives in bosonic systems, but identifying practical encoding remains challenging due to stringent Knill-Laflamme conditions. In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover Bosonic codes under approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of solving the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning. The agent first identifies an encoded subspace surpassing the breakeven point through rapid exploration within a constrained evolutionary time-frame, then strategically fine-tunes its policy to sustain this performance advantage over extended temporal horizons. We find that the two-phase trained agent can discover the optimal set of codewords, i.e., the Fock states $\ket{4}$ and $\ket{7}$ considering the effect of both single-photon and double-photon loss. We identify that the discovered code surpasses the breakeven threshold over a longer evolution time and achieve the state-of-art performance. We also analyze the robustness of the code against the phase damping and amplitude damping noise. Our work highlights the potential of curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning in discovering the optimal quantum error correct code especially in early fault-tolerant quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum computers based on cold-atom arrays offer long-lived qubits with programmable connectivity, yet their progress toward fault-tolerant operation is limited by the relatively low fidelity of site-selective local control. We introduce an artificial-intelligence (AI) framework that overcomes this limitation. Trained on atom-laser dynamics, a deep neural network autonomously designs composite pulses that improve local control fidelities tenfold while remaining compatible with existing control hardware. We further demonstrate the robustness of these pulses against optical aberrations and beam misalignment. This approach establishes AI-trained pulse compilation for high-fidelity qubit control and can be readily extended to other atom-like platforms, such as trapped ions and solid-state color centers.

Abstract: Frequency combs are multimode photonic systems that underlie countless precision sensing and metrology applications. Since their invention over two decades ago, numerous efforts have pushed frequency combs to broader bandwidths and more stable operation. More recently, quantum squeezing and entanglement have been explored in single frequency comb systems for quantum advantages in sensing and signal multiplexing. However, the production of quantum light across multiple frequency combs remains unexplored. In this work, we theoretically explore a mechanism that generates a series of nonlinearly coupled frequency combs through cascaded three-wave upconversion and downconversion processes mediated by a single idler comb. We show how this system generates inter- and intracomb two-mode squeezing and entanglement spanning a very large spectral range, from ultraviolet to mid-IR frequencies. Finally, we show how this system can be engineered to produce on-demand multimode quantum light through covariance matrix optimization. Our findings could enable tunable broadband ghost spectroscopy protocols, squeezing-enhanced pump-probe measurements, and broadband entanglement between spectrally-multiplexed quanta of information.

Abstract: Long-lived storage of single photons is a fundamental requirement for enabling quantum communication and foundational tests of quantum physics over extended distances. While the implementation of a global-scale quantum network requires quantum storage times on the order of seconds to minutes, existing photonic quantum memories have so far been limited to subsecond lifetimes. Although $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals exhibit substantially extended spin coherence times at the `magic' magnetic field, the concomitant weak optical absorption has until now prevented single-photon storage. Here, we overcome this challenge by integrating a noiseless photon echo protocol -- which makes full use of the crystal's natural absorption for photonic storage -- with a universally robust dynamical decoupling sequence incorporating adiabatic pulses to protect nuclear spin coherence, enabling long-lived quantum storage at the `magic' magnetic field. At a storage time of 5.6 s, we achieve a time-bin qubit storage fidelity of 88.0 $\pm$ 2.1%, surpassing the maximum fidelity attainable via classical strategies. Our device reaches a $1/e$ storage lifetime of 27.6 $\pm$ 0.6 s, enabling single-photon-level storage for 42 s with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than unity. This work establishes photonic quantum memory in the minute-scale regime, laying a solid foundation for global-scale quantum network and deep-space quantum experiments.

Abstract: The random nature of spontaneous emission leads to unavoidable fluctuations in a laser's output. This is often included through random Langevin forces in laser rate equations, but this approach falls short for nanolasers. In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merely assuming that the number of photons and excited electrons only takes discrete values. The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded.

Abstract: This is a preliminary version. Improvements and additional analysis will be included in a revised manuscript. We investigate the charge-state stability of individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in weakly doped HPHT IIa diamond containing sub-ppm concentrations of boron and nitrogen. Using Ti/Al coplanar electrodes on an oxygen-terminated surface, we study how applied electric fields and optical excitation jointly govern NV charge conversion. By combining voltage-dependent photoluminescence, real-time charge-state monitoring, laser-power saturation with spectral decomposition, and time-resolved measurements, we reveal that electric fields several micrometers from the contacts significantly increase the NV- population and enhance spin readout. At low excitation powers, the NV- population evolves on minute timescales following compressed-exponential kinetics, consistent with slow space-charge rearrangement in ultra-insulating diamond. Under pulsed excitation, we observe hundreds-of-nanoseconds NV-/NV0 conversion driven by hole capture, which is strongly suppressed by applied bias. Our results demonstrate that residual boron acceptors play a key role in determining charge-state stability and show how electrical bias can reliably stabilize NV- in weakly doped bulk diamond.

Abstract: This paper introduces Quantum Orthogonal Separable Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QO-SPINNs), a novel architecture for solving Partial Differential Equations, integrating quantum computing principles to address the computational bottlenecks of classical methods. We leverage a quantum algorithm for accelerating matrix multiplication within each layer, achieving a $\mathcal O(d\log d/ε^2)$ complexity, a significant improvement over the classical $\mathcal O(d^2)$ complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of the matrix, $ε$ the accuracy level. This is accomplished by using a Hamming weight-preserving quantum circuit and a unary basis for data encoding, with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the overall architecture provided. We demonstrate the practical utility of our model by applying it to solve both forward and inverse PDE problems. Furthermore, we exploit the inherent orthogonality of our quantum circuits (which guarantees a spectral norm of 1) to develop a novel uncertainty quantification method. Our approach adapts the Spectral Normalized Gaussian Process for SPINNs, eliminating the need for the computationally expensive spectral normalization step. By using a Quantum Orthogonal SPINN architecture based on stacking, we provide a robust and efficient framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) which, to our knowledge, is the first UQ method specifically designed for Separable PINNs. Numerical results based on classical simulation of the quantum circuits, are presented to validate the theoretical claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

The first code converts Gauss's law at each vertex into a stabilizer while the second only uses half vertices and is locally the carbon code. Both codes are able to correct single-qubit errors. The electric and magnetic terms in the SU(2) Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of logical gates in both codes. The logical-gate Hamiltonian in the first code exactly matches the spin Hamiltonian for gauge singlet states found in previous work.

Abstract: A significant challenge in quantum computing (QC) is developing learning models that truly align with quantum principles, as many current approaches are complex adaptations of classical frameworks. In this work, we introduce Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing (QHDC), a fundamentally new paradigm. We demonstrate that the core operations of its classical counterpart, Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a brain-inspired model, map with remarkable elegance and direct correspondence onto the native operations of a QC. This suggests HDC is exceptionally well-suited for a quantum-native implementation. We establish a direct, resource-efficient mapping: (i) hypervectors are mapped to quantum states, (ii) the bundling operation is implemented as a quantum-native averaging process using a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and Oblivious Amplitude Amplification (OAA), (iii) the binding operation is realized via quantum phase oracles, (iv) the permutation operation is implemented using the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), and (v) vector similarity is calculated using quantum state fidelity measurements based on the Hadamard Test. We present the first-ever implementation of this framework, validated through symbolic analogical reasoning and supervised classification tasks. The viability of QHDC is rigorously assessed via a comparative analysis of results from classical computation, ideal quantum simulation, and execution of a 156-qubit IBM Heron r3 quantum processor. Our results validate the proposed mappings and demonstrate the versatility of the framework, establishing QHDC as a physically realizable technology. This work lays the foundation for a new class of quantum neuromorphic algorithms and opens a promising avenue for tackling complex cognitive and biomedical problems intractable for classical systems.

Abstract: We investigate dissipative dynamics in a graphene-based quantum battery modeled as a four level spin valley system. The battery is charged via a Gaussian pulse and subsequently evolves under amplitude damping, dephasing, and both Markovian and non Markovian reservoirs. We find that amplitude damping, while inducing energy loss, can stabilize non passive steady states with finite ergotropy, whereas pure dephasing suppresses coherence and eliminates work extraction. On the other hand, non-Markovian memory slows ergotropy loss and enables partial recovery through information backflow. These results identify coherence and reservoir memory as essential resources for enhancing the long-time performance of graphene quantum batteries.

Abstract: Moments of ensembles of unitaries play a central role in quantum information theory as they capture the statistical properties of dynamics of systems with some form of randomness. Indeed, concepts such as approximate $t$-designs arise when comparing how close an associated moment operator of a given unitary ensemble is to that of another, reference ensemble. Despite the importance of moment operators, their properties have not been as explored for quantum channels. In this work we develop a theoretical framework to compute moment operators for ensembles of quantum channels, for all moment orders $t$, with a special focus on determining ensembles that can be used as points of reference. By deriving hierarchies between ensembles, via inequalities of their moment operator norms, we give them operational meaning, and define useful concepts such as that of channel $t$-designs. Finally, we perform theoretical and numerical studies which show that different types of noise can decrease the norm of the moment operators (e.g., depolarizing noise), as well as increase it (e.g., amplitude damping), and generalize noise-induced concentration phenomena to channel-design-induced phenomena. Along the way, we find a block-orthogonal basis for permutations, which greatly simplifies our analyses, and may be of independent interest.

Abstract: This work presents a study of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols over fast-fading channels, typically found in free-space communication links. Two eavesdropping models are considered to evaluate their security under collective attacks: \textit{Holevo bound average} (HBA) and \textit{covariance matrix average} (CMA). In the HBA approach, the Holevo bound is averaged over the channel transmittance. In contrast, the CMA method calculates the Holevo bound from the average covariance matrix. Analytical expressions are developed for both strategies. The two methods also differ in how they calculate the mutual information between the legitimate parties. The results demonstrate that the SKR is significantly influenced by how you treat channel fluctuations, highlighting the importance of choosing the model that better describes the actual implementation of the protocol.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum computers have steadily improved over the last decade, but developing fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) techniques, required for useful, universal computation remains an ongoing effort. Key elements of FTQC such as error-correcting codes and decoding are supported by a rich bed of stabilizer simulation software such as Stim and CHP, which are essential for numerically characterizing these protocols at realistic scales. Recently, experimental groups have built nascent high-dimensional quantum hardware, known as qudits, which have a myriad of attractive properties for algorithms and FTQC. Despite this, there are no widely available qudit stabilizer simulators. We introduce the first open-source realization of such a simulator for all dimensions. We demonstrate its correctness against existing state vector simulations and benchmark its performance in evaluating and sampling quantum circuits. This simulator is the essential computational infrastructure to explore novel qudit error correction as earlier stabilizer simulators have been for qubits.

### [170] [Verified Implementation of GRAPE Pulse Optimization for Quantum Gates with Hardware-Representative Noise Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12799)
*Rylan Malarchick*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QubitPulseOpt is an open-source Python framework that bridges the 'sim-to-real' gap in quantum optimal control by implementing hardware-representative optimal control strategies, specifically GRAPE, on physical quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the critical 'sim-to-real' gap in quantum computing, where theoretical models often fail to account for real-world hardware imperfections, thereby improving the reliability and practicality of quantum computations.

Method: The framework leverages GRAPE, a quantum optimal control algorithm, and integrates it with hardware parameters from IQM's Garnet processor. It also includes a 659-test verification suite with 59% code coverage and adheres to NASA JPL's Power-of-10 standards for safety-critical software.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrated a simulated gate error reduction of 77× compared to standard Gaussian pulses using GRAPE-optimized pulses.

Conclusion: QubitPulseOpt provides a new paradigm for trustworthy quantum control software by ensuring reliability through rigorous testing and adherence to safety standards, thereby advancing the practical implementation of quantum computing technologies.

Abstract: Gate fidelity in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers remains the primary bottleneck limiting practical quantum computation, constrained by decoherence and control noise. Quantum optimal control (QOC) techniques, such as the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) algorithm, offer a powerful approach to designing noise-robust pulses that actively mitigate these effects. However, most QOC implementations operate in idealized simulation environments that fail to capture the real-time parameter drift inherent to physical quantum hardware, creating a critical ``sim-to-real'' gap. In this work, I present QubitPulseOpt, an open-source, rigorously-tested Python framework designed to bridge this gap through hardware-representative optimal control. The framework demonstrates API connectivity to IQM's Garnet quantum processor (20-qubit superconducting device) and implements a workflow that constructs a high-fidelity ``digital twin'' using hardware-representative parameters. Using this simulation framework, I demonstrate that GRAPE-optimized pulses achieve a simulated gate error reduction of 77$\times$ compared to standard Gaussian pulses. The framework's reliability is ensured through a 659-test verification suite (59\% code coverage) and adherence to NASA JPL Power-of-10 safety-critical coding standards, establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy quantum control software. All results are from verified GRAPE optimizations with full provenance documentation.

TL;DR: Low-rank quantum state tomography can be improved using approximate message passing (AMP), which offers significant advantages over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on low-rank quantum state tomography, a method essential for characterizing quantum systems, especially with the exponential growth in computational costs.

Method: The authors employ LOWAMP, a variant of AMP, to approximate low-rank states, leveraging compressed sensing techniques in quantum mechanics.

Result: By carefully designing the AMP algorithm specifically for quantum states, the method achieves a substantial reduction in reconstruction errors compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that AMP-based methods can enhance low-rank quantum state tomography, making it more practical for large quantum systems while considering device noise impacts.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an indispensable tool for characterizing many-body quantum systems. However, due to the exponential scaling cost of the protocol with system size, many approaches have been developed for quantum states with specific structure, such as low-rank states. In this paper, we show how approximate message passing (AMP), a compressed sensing technique, can be used to perform low-rank QST. AMP provides asymptotically optimal performance guarantees for large systems, which suggests its utility for QST. We discuss the design challenges that come with applying AMP to QST, and show that by properly designing the AMP algorithm, we can reduce the reconstruction infidelity by over an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches to low-rank QST. We also performed tomographic experiments on IBM Kingston and considered the effect of device noise on the reliability of the predicted fidelity of state preparation. Our work advances the state of low-rank QST and may be applicable to other quantum tomography protocols.

Motivation: 图论中的量子行走问题一直是研究热点， bouquet 图的构造及其动力学行为具有重要理论意义和潜在应用价值。

Method: 考虑了两个简单图通过一个桥连接而成的有限图，使用微扰方法分析了 Grover 走在 Small ε 约束下的行为。通过校正项展开和级数求和，推导了小 ε 下 walker 在各图的概率表达式及其脉动周期。

Result: 当桥的权重 ε 很小且两图的边数不同时，量子行走者在两图之间周期性传输的概率表现出显著的脉动特征。具体来说，当两图的边数不同时，行走者在图间的概率随时间呈现周期性变化；而当两图的边数相等时，行走者几乎全部移动至另一图。此外，通过精确计算得到了脉动周期的阶数为 O(ε^{-1/2})。

Conclusion: 通过构造 bouquet 类有限图及其 Grover 走，在 Small ε 的情况下，成功发现了量子行走者在两图间的周期性脉动现象。结果表明该现象仅依赖于两图的边数数量，而与图的具体结构无关。尤其是当两图的边数相等时，量子行走者的传输效果最佳。这些发现为更广泛图灵点的量子行走问题提供了一种可行的分析途径和潜在的应用方向。

Abstract: We consider the Grover walk on a finite graph composed of two arbitrary simple graphs connected by one edge, referred to as a bridge. The parameter $ε>0$ assigned at the bridge represents the strength of connectivity: if $ε=0$, then the graph is completely separated. We show that for sufficiently small values of $ε$, a phenomenon called pulsation occurs. The pulsation is characterized by the periodic transfer of the quantum walker between the two graphs. An asymptotic expression with respect to small $ε$ for the probability of finding the walker on either of the two graphs is derived. This expression reveals that the pulsation depends solely on the number of edges in each graph, regardless of their structure. In addition, we obtain that the quantum walker is transferred periodically between the two graphs, with a period of order $O(ε^{-1/2})$. Furthermore, when the number of edges of two graphs is equal, the quantum walker is almost completely transferred.

Abstract: The Schmidt number is an important kind of characterization of quantum entanglement. Quantum states with higher Schmidt numbers demonstrate significant advantages in various quantum information processing tasks. By deriving a class of k-positive linear maps based on symmetric measurements, we present new Schmidt-number witnesses of class (k + 1). By detailed example, we show that our Schmidt number witnesses identify better the Schmidt number of quantum states in high-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we note that the Fedorov ratio, which coincides with the Schmidt number for pure Gaussian states and provides a close approximation in non-Gaussian cases such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, serves as an experimentally accessible tool for validating the proposed (k +1)-class Schmidt-number witnesses.

Abstract: Quantum Mechanical ground states of many-body systems can be important resources for various investigations: for quantum sensing, as the initial state for nonequilibrium quantum dynamics following quenches, and the simulation of quantum processes that start by coupling systems in ground states, eg, could be a process in quantum chemistry. However, to prepare ground states can be challenging; for example, requires adiabatic switching of Hamiltonian terms slower than an inverse gap, which can be time consuming and bring in decoherence. Here we investigate the possibility of preparing a many-body entangled ground state of a certain Hamiltonian, which can be called a quantum ``problem'' Hamiltonian, using the time evolution of an initial fiducial state by another ``solver'' Hamiltonian/s for a very short fixed (unit) time. The parameters of the solver Hamiltonian are optimised classically using energy minimisation as the cost function. We present a study of up to n=10 qubit many-body states prepared using this methodology.

Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging computational paradigm with the potential to outperform classical computers in solving a variety of problems. To achieve this, quantum programs are typically represented as quantum circuits, which must be optimized and adapted for target hardware through quantum circuit compilation. We introduce ZX-DB, a data-driven system that performs quantum circuit simplification and rewriting inside a graph database using ZX-calculus, a complete graphical formalism for quantum mechanics. ZX-DB encodes ZX-calculus rewrite rules as standard openCypher queries and executes them on an example graph database engine, Memgraph, enabling efficient, database-native transformations of large-scale quantum circuits. ZX-DB integrates correctness validation via tensor and graph equivalence checks and is evaluated against the state-of-the-art PyZX framework. Experimental results show that ZX-DB achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup for independent rewrites, while exposing pattern-matching bottlenecks in current graph database engines. By uniting quantum compilation and graph data management, ZX-DB opens a new systems direction toward scalable, database-supported quantum computing pipelines.

Abstract: Open quantum systems exhibit dynamics ranging from purely unitary evolution to irreversible dissipative relaxation. The Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) equation uniquely characterizes Markovian dynamics that are completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP), yet many physical systems display non-Markovian features such as algebraic relaxation and coherence backflow beyond the reach of semigroup evolution. Fractional calculus provides a natural framework for describing such long-memory behavior through power-law temporal kernels introduced by fractional time derivatives. Here we establish a unified hierarchy that embeds fractional quantum master equations within the broader landscape of open system dynamics. The fractional master equation forms a structured subclass of memory-kernel models, reducing to the GKSL form at unit fractional order. Through Bochner--Phillips subordination, fractional evolution is expressed as an average over Lindblad semigroups weighted by a power-law waiting-time distribution. This construction ensures physical consistency, explains the algebraic origin of long-time decay, and bridges unitary, Markovian, and structured non-Markovian regimes. The resulting framework positions fractional calculus as a rigorous and unifying language for quantum dynamics with intrinsic memory, enabling new directions for theoretical analysis and quantum simulation.

Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian quantum battery based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattice, charged through a PT-symmetric protocol that alternates gain and loss between the two sublattices. The interplay between lattice topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to both bulk and edge exceptional points (EPs), which govern the charging dynamics. In the topological regime, an edge-state EP emerges at an exponentially small non-Hermitian strength, resulting in early PT-symmetry breaking and rapid energy accumulation. This topological enhancement originates from the PT-symmetric non-Hermitian dynamics, in which the broken-symmetry edge mode with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue dominates the time evolution. Consequently, the topological phase consistently yields higher stored energy and faster saturation than the trivial configuration across all parameter regimes and system sizes. These findings demonstrate that topology constitutes a genuine physical resource for enhancing the performance of quantum batteries.

Abstract: The fundamental division of the total quantum evolution phase into geometric and dynamical components is a central problem in quantum physics. Here, we prove a remarkably simple and universal law demonstrating that this partitioning is governed, at every instant, solely by a single geometric quantity: the Bargmann angle (Bures angle). This result provides a universally applicable and rigorous way to define the exact fraction of the total phase that is geometric versus dynamical in origin, thereby establishing a new quantitative link between the dynamics of quantum evolution and the geometry of the state space. This finding has immediate practical consequences, furnishing a real-time measure of the geometricity of an evolution for designing high-fidelity geometric quantum gates with optimized robustness, and opening new avenues for quantum speed limit and coherent control.

We verify the feasibility of this mechanism in a dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator model. Providing a new insight into the interesting non-equilibrium dynamics phenomenon, our work paves a way to accelerate the transfer of energy and information in quantum systems.

Abstract: Color codes present distinct advantages for fault-tolerant quantum computing, such as high encoding rates and the transversal implementation of Clifford gates. However, existing matching-based decoders for the color codes such as the restricted decoder (Kubica and Delfosse, 2023), suffer from limited decoding performance. Inspired by the global decoding insight of the unified decoder (Benhemou et al., 2023), this paper introduces a correlated decoder for the 4.8.8 color code, which improves upon the conventional restricted decoder by leveraging correlations between restricted lattices, and is derived by mapping the correlated matching decoder for the surface code onto the color code lattice. Analytical and numerical results show that the correlated decoder achieves higher thresholds than the restricted and unified decoders, while matching the performance of the unified decoder at very low physical error rates. Under the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, the estimated thresholds for the color code against bit-flip error are 10.38% and 3.13%, respectively. Furthermore, by applying the surface-color code mapping, the thresholds of 16.62% and 3.52% are obtained for the surface code against depolarizing noise.

A recursion level of three suffice for high-fidelity approximation, and high precision is achieved through detailed numerical simulations for specific parameter values.

Result: The gates constructed include the Hadamard and phase gates, and the CNOT gate with high precision, demonstrating the potential for fault-tolerant quantum computation. The recursion level of three indicates a resource-efficient approach to gate approximation.

Conclusion: This work opens a new pathway for implementing universal quantum computation using non-semisimple Ising anyons, as demonstrated by the successful construction of a universal gate set with controlled fidelity.

Abstract: We present a systematic numerical construction of a universal quantum gate set for topological quantum computation based on the non-semisimple Ising anyons model. Using the elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) of this model by the Monte Carlo-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (MC-enhanced SKA), we achieve high-fidelity approximations of standard one-qubit gates (Hadamard H-gate and phase T-gate). Remarkably, a recursion level of just three suffices to meet the fidelity requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our numerical results demonstrate that for the parameter α /in (2, 2.031], a single braiding operation can approximate the local equivalence class [CNOT] with high precision and great unitary measurement. Specifically, at α = 2.031, 2.047, and 2.063, we successfully construct a universal gate set {H-gate, T-gate, CNOT-gate} with high accuracy. This work establishes a new pathway towards universal quantum computation using non-semisimple Ising anyons.

Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has been proposed as a class of hardware-friendly error suppression techniques. While QEM has been primarily studied for mitigating errors in the estimation of expectation values of observables, recent works have explored its application to estimating noiseless probability distributions. In this work, we propose two protocols to improve the accuracy of QEM for probability distributions, inspired by techniques in software engineering. The first is the N-version programming method, which compares probability distributions obtained via different QEM strategies and excludes the outlier distribution, certifying the feasibility of the error-mitigated distributions. The second is a consistency-based method for selecting an appropriate extrapolation strategy. Specifically, we prepare $K$ data points at different error rates, choose $L<K$ of them for extrapolation, and evaluate error-mitigated results for all $\binom{K}{L}$ possible choices. We then select the extrapolation method that yields the smallest variance in the error-mitigated results. This procedure can also be applied bitstring-wise, enabling adaptive error mitigation for each probability in the distribution.

Abstract: The increasing depth of quantum circuits presents a major limitation for the execution of quantum algorithms, as the limited coherence time of physical qubits leads to noise that manifests as errors during computation. In this work, we focus on circuits relevant to variational quantum algorithms and demonstrate that their depth can be reduced by introducing additional qubits, mid-circuit measurements, and classically controlled operations. As an illustrative example, we consider nonlinear dynamics governed by the one-dimensional Burgers' equation, which has broad applications in computational fluid dynamics. In particular, we show that the proposed non-unitary quantum circuits can efficiently represent fluid flow configurations in both laminar and turbulent regimes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, when noise is taken into account, these circuits are advantageous in regimes where two-qubit gate error rates are relatively low compared to idling error rates.

Abstract: We analytically investigate the switching rate in a two-photon driven Kerr oscillator with finite detuning and two-photon dissipation. This system exhibits quantum bistability and supports a logical manifold for a bosonic qubit. Using Kramer's theory together with the $P$-representation, we derive an analytical expression for the bit-flip error rate within the potential-barrier approximation. The agreement is demonstrated between analytical calculations and numerical simulations obtained by diagonalization of the Liouvillian superoperator. In the purely dissipative limit, the switching rate increases monotonically with detuning, as the two metastable states approach each other in phase space. However, the exponential contribution to the bit-flip rate exhibits a nontrivial dependence on system parameters, extending beyond the naive scaling with the average photon number. In the presence of large Kerr nonlinearity, the switching rate becomes a nonmonotonic function of the detuning and reaches a minimum at a finite detuning. This effect arises because detuning lowers the activation barrier for weak nonlinearity but increases it for large ones, ensuring a minimum of the switching-rate at nonzero detuning. These results establish key conditions for optimizing the performance of critical cat qubits and are directly relevant for the design of scalable superconducting bosonic quantum architectures.

Abstract: Quantum computers (QCs) have the potential to solve critical problems significantly faster than today's most advanced supercomputers. One major challenge in realizing this technology is designing robust electrostatic pulses to realize unitaries on qubits. Current practice when calibrating unitaries involves recursive experimentation to find the highest-fidelity pulses. To accelerate this process for experimentalists, we implement Qalibrate, a fast, JAX-enabled simulator that generates pulses given target unitaries. Specifically, we generate a propagator that models the time evolution of three-electron spin qubits and integrate our gradient-based optimizer to generate the pulses. The simulation involves solving the Lindblad master equation, which we parallelize by employing an approximation of the time evolution called the Magnus expansion. Qalibrate shows up to a 34x speedup compared to an existing ODE simulator, making progress towards generating robust pulses for n-qubit systems.

Abstract: The traditional Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM) theory is unable to solve the Spin-s problem, i.e., to justify the utterly important "Pauli Exclusion Principle". A complete and straightforward solution of the Spin-Statistics problem is presented based on the "Weyl Integrable Quantum Mechanics" (WIQM) theory. This theory provides a Weyl-gauge invariant formulation of the Standard Quantum Mechanics and reproduces successfully, with no restrictions, the full set of the quantum mechanical processes, including the formulation of Dirac's or Schrödinger's equation, of Heisenberg's uncertainty relations, and of the nonlocal EPR correlations. etc. When the Weyl Integrable Quantum Mechanics is applied to a system made of many identical particles with spin, an additional constant property of all elementary particles enters naturally into play: the "intrinsic helicity", or the "intrinsic angular - momentum". This additional particle property, not considered by Standard Quantum Mechanics, determines the correct Spin-Statistics Connection (SSC) observed in Nature. All this leads to the consideration of a novel, most complete (in the EPR sense) quantum mechanical theory.

Abstract: The tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV) has emerged as a compelling building block for realizing next-generation quantum networks thanks to its excellent optical and spin properties. Coupling to photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) promises to further enhance the SnV light-matter interface and unlock a diverse range of entanglement generation protocols. Recent pioneering experiments showing Purcell enhancement of SnV centers in PCCs underscore this potential. However, optical coupling that is coherent - the key ingredient for use in quantum protocols - has so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate above-unity coherent cooperativity of SnV centers embedded in photonic crystal cavities. We fabricate free-standing PCCs using a quasi-isotropic undercut. Across two samples, we conduct room-temperature characterizations, measuring resonances for 327 cavities, with an average quality factor exceeding $Q = 1.0(3) \times 10^4$. Two cavity-coupled emitters are examined in detail, exhibiting quality factors up to $Q = 25.4(4) \times 10^3$ and Purcell-reduced lifetimes corresponding to cooperativities up to $C = 20.6(11)$. Furthermore, the single SnVs are observed to strongly modulate the cavity transmission with an extinction contrast up to $98.8(4) \%$ on resonance. Finally, SnV linewidth measurements reveal above-unity coherent cooperativities in both devices, with the highest value being $C_\mathrm{coh} = 8.3(12)$. These results open the door to using cavity-coupled SnV centers as efficient, coherent light-matter interfaces for future quantum networks.

Abstract: The fidelity estimation between two quantum states is crucial for quantum computation and information science. However, an efficacious method for this, especially for mixed states and higher-dimensional density matrices, remains elusive. While there are many existing algorithms on computing the fidelity between two pure states, there is not much work on how to obtain the fidelity between two mixed states. Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for the fidelity estimation, based primarily on the density matrix exponentiation and interferometeric scheme for mixed states, with a time complexity of $O(N^2/ε^7)$, where $N$ is the system size and $ε$ is a precision error. Our algorithm may serve as a resource-efficient technique to deduce fidelity of any two (pure or mixed) unknown or known quantum states, when the density matrices of the quantum states commute with each other.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing.

Abstract: Gaussian quantum states and channels are pivotal across many branches of quantum science and their applications, including the processing and storage of quantum information, the investigation of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, and quantum computation. The great advantage is that Gaussian states are experimentally accessible via their first and second statistical moments. In this work, we investigate parameter estimation for Gaussian states, in which the probe-state preparation stage involves two noncommutative Gaussian measurements on the position and momentum observables, introducing tunable parameters. The influence of these noncommutative Gaussian measurements is investigated through the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We showed that the QFI for characterizing Gaussian channels can be increased by adjusting the uncertainty parameters in the preparation of the probe state. Furthermore, if the probe is initially in a thermal state, probe-state preparation may generate quantum coherence in its energy basis. We showed that not only does the amount of coherence affect the improvement of the QFI, but also the rate of change of the coherence with respect to the parameter to be estimated. The proposed probe-state protocol is applied to two paradigmatic single-mode Gaussian channels, the attenuator and amplification channels, which are building blocks of Gaussian quantum information. Our results contribute to the use of coherence in quantum metrology and are experimentally feasible in quantum-optical devices.

Result: A simulation framework automating design and execution across quantum systems

Conclusion: Advocates quantum simulation as a viable alternative to classical systems, with a new software framework to support it.

Abstract: Quantum simulation is a leading candidate for demonstrating practical quantum advantage over classical computation, as it is believed to provide exponentially more compute power than any classical system. It offers new means of studying the behaviour of complex physical systems, for which conventionally software-intensive simulation codes based on numerical high-performance computing are used. Instead, quantum simulations map properties and characteristics of subject systems, for instance chemical molecules, onto quantum devices that then mimic the system under study.
  Currently, the use of these techniques is largely limited to fundamental science, as the overall approach remains tailored for specific problems: We lack infrastructure and modelling abstractions that are provided by the software engineering community for other computational domains.
  In this paper, we identify critical gaps in the quantum simulation software stack-particularly the absence of general-purpose frameworks for model specification, Hamiltonian construction, and hardware-aware mappings. We advocate for a modular model-driven engineering (MDE) approach that supports different types of quantum simulation (digital and analogue), and facilitates automation, performance evaluation, and reusability. Through an example from high-energy physics, we outline a vision for a quantum simulation framework capable of supporting scalable, cross-platform simulation workflows.

Conclusion: The concept of $	extit{	extbackslashh}$-perfect graphs is shown to have diverse applications across quantum information and graph theory. The efficient quantum algorithms and theoretical connections presented in the paper highlight potential advancements in both fields.

Abstract: A set of Pauli stings is well characterized by the graph that encodes its commutatitivity structure, i.e., by its frustration graph. This graph provides a natural interface between graph theory and quantum information, which we explore in this work. We investigate all aspects of this interface for a special class of graphs that bears tight connections between the groundstate structures of a spin systems and topological structure of a graph. We call this class $\hbar$-perfect, as it extends the class of perfect and $h$-perfect graphs.
  Having an $\hbar$-perfect graph opens up several applications: we find efficient schemes for entanglement detection, a connection to the complexity of shadow tomography, tight uncertainty relations and a construction for computing good lower on bounds ground state energies. Conversely this also induces quantum algorithms for computing the independence number. Albeit those algorithms do not immediately promise an advantage in runtime, we show that an approximate Hamilton encoding of the independence number can be achieved with an amount of qubits that typically scales logarithmically in the number of vertices. We also we also determine the behavior of $\hbar$-perfectness under basic graph operations and evaluate their prevalence among all graphs.

Conclusion: MDD is a scalable and effective protocol for suppressing decoherence in large-scale quantum algorithms, offering significant performance improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a key technique for suppressing decoherence and preserving the performance of quantum algorithms. We introduce a measurement-based DD (MDD) protocol that determines control unitary gates from partial measurements of noisy subsystems, with measurement overhead scaling linearly with the number of subsystems. We prove that, under local energy relaxation and dephasing noise, MDD achieves the maximum entanglement fidelity attainable by any DD scheme based on bang-bang operations to first order in evolution time. On the IBM Eagle processor, MDD achieved up to a $450$-fold improvement in the success probability of a $14$-qubit quantum Fourier transform, and improved the accuracy of ground-state energy estimation for $N_2$ in the $56$-qubit sample-based quantum diagonalization compared with the standard XX-pulse DD. These results establish MDD as a scalable and effective approach for suppressing decoherence in large-scale quantum algorithms.

Abstract: We show that given an instance of a bivariate bicycle (BB) code, it is possible to generate an infinite sequence of new BB codes using increasingly large covering graphs of the original code's Tanner graph. When a BB code has a Tanner graph that is a $h$-fold covering of the base BB code's Tanner graph, we refer to it as a $h$-cover code. We show that for a BB code to be a $h$-cover code, its lattice parameters and defining polynomials must satisfy simple algebraic conditions relative to those of the base code. By extending the graph covering map to a chain map, we show there are induced projection and lifting maps on (co)homology that enable the projection and lifting of logical operators and, in certain cases, automorphisms between the base and the cover code. The search space of cover codes is considerably reduced compared to the full space of possible polynomials and we find that many interesting examples of BB codes, such as the $[[144,12,12]]$ gross code, can be viewed as cover codes. We also apply our method to search for BB codes with weight 8 checks and find many codes, including a $[[64,14,8]]$ and $[[144,14,14]]$ code. For an $h$-cover code of an $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code with parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h, d_h]]$, we prove that $k_h \geq k$ and $d_h \leq hd$ when $h$ is odd. Furthermore if $h$ is odd and $k_h = k$, we prove the lower bound $d \leq d_h$. We conjecture it is always true that an $h$-cover BB code of a base $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code has parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h \geq k, d \leq d_h \leq hd]]$. While the focus of this work is on bivariate bicycle codes, we expect these methods to generalise readily to many group algebra codes and to certain code constructions involving hypergraph, lifted, and balanced products.

Abstract: Simulating entangled, many-body quantum systems is notoriously hard, especially in the case of high-dimensional nature of physical underlying objects. In this work, we propose an approach for simulating the Potts model based on the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition that we construct for qudit systems. Specifically, we introduce two qudit-native decomposition schemes: (i) the first utilizes Molmer-Sorensen gate and additional local levels to encode the Potts interactions, while (ii) the second employs an light-shift gate that naturally fits qudit architectures. These decompositions enable a direct and efficient mapping of the Potts model dynamics into hardware-efficient qudit gate sequences for trapped-ion platform. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a Suzuki-Trotter approximation with our evolution-into-gates framework, for detecting the dynamical quantum phase transition. Our results establish a pathway toward qudit-based digital quantum simulation of many-body models and provide a new perspective on probing nonanalytic behavior in high-dimensional quantum many-body models.

Abstract: Fault tolerant quantum computation over distributed quantum computing (DQC) platforms requires careful evaluation of resource requirements and noise thresholds. As quantum hardware advances toward modular and networked architectures, various fault tolerant DQC schemes have been proposed, which can be broadly categorized into three architectural types. Type 1 architectures consist of small quantum nodes connected via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, enabling nonlocal stabilizer measurements. Type 2 architectures distribute a large error correcting code block across multiple modules, with most stabilizer measurements remaining local, except for a small subset at patch boundaries that are performed using nonlocal CNOT gates. Type 3 architectures assign code blocks to distinct modules and can perform fault tolerant operations such as transversal gates, lattice surgery, and teleportation to implement logical operations between code blocks. Using the planar surface code and toric code as representative examples, we analyze how the resource requirements, particularly the number of Bell pairs and the average number of generation attempts, scale with increasing code distance across different architectural designs. This analysis provides valuable insights for identifying architectures well suited to fault tolerant distributed quantum computation under near term hardware and resource constraints.

### [199] [Quantum Advantage in Learning Mixed Unitary Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13683)
*Yue Tu,Liang Jiang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究学习混合酉信道的使用Fisher信息在不同的量子资源假设下（包括辅助器和组合）的结果表明，当量样本复杂性在渐近情况下按比例$rac{r}{d 	imes 	ext{误差平方}}$，其中$r$为信道的秩（即不同酉的数量），$d$为系统维度，误差平方为均方误差。因此，关键资源是辅助器，这一点也得到了更精确的证明，因为我们指出$r$同样重要。此外，我们表明混合酉信道具有实际的学习潜力，也就是说，随机混合酉信道易于学习。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在合理资源假设下学习混合酉信道的有效性，并为后续研究提供了实际应用的基础。

Abstract: We study the task of learning mixed unitary channels using Fisher information, under different quantum resource assumptions including ancilla and concatenation. Our result shows that the asymptotic sample complexity scales as $\frac{r}{d\varepsilon^2}$, where $r$ is the rank of the channel (i.e.\ the number of different unitaries), $d$ is the dimension of the system, and $\varepsilon^2$ is the mean-square error. Thus the critical resource is the ancilla, which mirrors the result in~\cite{chen2022quantum} but in a more precise form, as we point out that $r$ is also important. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical potential of mixed unitary channels by showing that random mixed unitary channels are easy to learn.

TL;DR: Comparing two scheduling approaches for quantum computing architectures: RCPSP framework and greedy heuristic. Focuses on minimizing make span with resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal scheduling in quantum computing architectures is crucial for efficient resource utilization and scalability.

Method: Analyzed two approaches, RCPSP framework and greedy heuristic. Tested them on a star network with a Quantum switch and QPUs running the Quantum Fourier Transform. Used METIS solver for partitioning.

Result: RCPSP framework outperforms greedy heuristic in some cases, while they perform similarly in others.

Conclusion: Both approaches have their merits depending on specific scenarios.

Abstract: Realizing distributed architectures for quantum computing is crucial to scaling up computational power. A key component of such architectures is a scheduler that coordinates operations over a short-range quantum network required to enable the necessary non-local entangling gates between quantum processing units (QPUs). It is desirable to determine schedules of minimum make span, which in the case of networks with constrained resources hinges on their efficient usage. Here we compare and contrast two approaches to solving the make span minimization problem, an approach based on the resource constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) framework, and another based on a greedy heuristic algorithm. The workflow considered is as follows. Firstly, the computational circuit is partitioned and assigned to different QPUs such that the number of nonlocal entangling gates acting across partitions is minimized while the qubit load is nearly uniform on the individual QPUs, which can be accomplished using, e.g., the METIS solver. Secondly, the nonlocal entangling gate requirements with respect to the partitions are identified, and mapped to network operation sequences that deliver the necessary entanglement between the QPUs. Finally, the network operations are scheduled such that the make span is minimized. As illustrative examples, we analyze the implementation of a small instance of the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm over instances of a simple hub and spoke (star) network architecture comprised of a quantum switch as the hub and QPUs as spokes, each with a finite qubit resource budget. In one instance, our results show the RCPSP approach outperforming the greedy heuristic. In another instance, we find the two performing equally well. Our results thus illustrate the effectiveness of the RCPSP framework, while also underlining the relevance and usefulness of greedy heuristics.

Abstract: We establish a new performance benchmark for the fault-tolerant syndrome extraction of [[7, 1, 3]] Steane code with a dynamic protocol. Our method is built on two highly optimized circuits derived using fault-equivalent ZX-rewrites: a primary fault-tolerant circuit with 14 CNOTs and an efficient non-fault-tolerant recovery circuit with 11 CNOTs. The protocol uses an adaptive response to internal faults, discarding flagged measurements and falling back to the recovery circuit to correct potentially detrimental errors. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the efficiency of our protocol, reducing the logical error rate per cycle by an average of ~14.3% relative to the optimized Steane method [arXiv:2506.17181] and ~17.7% compared to the Reichardt's three-qubit method [arXiv:1804.06995], the leading prior techniques.

Abstract: The rational design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is hindered by a complex interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic factors. To unravel these relationships, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis of \num{747} experimentally known TADF molecules to establish large-scale, quantitative design principles. Our validated semi-empirical protocol systematically reveals how molecular architecture, conformational geometry, and electronic structure govern photophysical properties. We establish a clear performance hierarchy, with Donor-Acceptor-Donor (D-A-D) architectures being statistically superior for minimizing the singlet-triplet energy gap ($ΔE_{\text{ST}}$). Crucially, we identify an optimal D-A torsional angle window of \qtyrange{50}{90}{\degree} that resolves the key trade-off between a small $ΔE_{\text{ST}}$ and the non-zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC) required for efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). Data-driven clustering further identifies a distinct family of high-performance candidates and confirms Multi-Resonance (MR) emitters as a unique paradigm for high-efficiency blue emission. These findings culminate in a set of actionable design rules and the identification of \num{127} high-priority candidates predicted to have $ΔE_{\text{ST}}< \qty{0.1}{\electronvolt}$ and oscillator strength $f \num{> 0.1}$. This work provides a data-driven framework that unifies thermodynamic and kinetic principles to accelerate the discovery of next-generation TADF emitters.

Motivation:  studying low-cycle fatigue is crucial as it involves rapid cyclic loading and high stress concentrations, which are common in many engineering applications like aerospace and automotive industries.

Method:  the authors developed an extended micromechanics-based phase-field model. they incorporated a thermodynamically consistent formulation for ratcheting strain evolution. the model allows independent control over deviatoric and volumetric ratcheting components, ensuring smooth evolution of free energy and its derivatives. numerical simulations under both monotonic and cyclic loading were conducted to validate the model.

Result:  the model accurately captures the progression of fatigue fractures with ratcheting, providing a robust framework for predicting material response under cyclic loading conditions. simulations reveal significant ratcheting effects in low-cycle fatigue scenarios, highlighting its critical role in fracture mechanisms.

Conclusion:  this study offers a comprehensive understanding of the role of ratcheting in low-cycle fatigue and advances the micromechanics-based modeling of fatigue fracture.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the micromechanics-based phase-field modeling of fatigue fracture to capture cyclic plasticity with ratcheting. This mechanism is particularly important for low-cycle fatigue, where the accumulation of inelastic strains plays an important role in the progression to final failure. The ratcheting contribution is formulated through the evolution of ratcheting strain, which accumulates over loading cycles and captures the inelastic strain growth characteristic of cyclic plasticity in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The extended plastic potential allows independent control over deviatoric and volumetric ratcheting components, ensuring smooth evolution of the free energy and its derivatives. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the model under both monotonic and cyclic loading and to assess the influence of ratcheting on material response.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising optical biomechanical force sensors due to their near infrared excitation, low toxicity, photostability, and linear colorimetric sensitivity to micronewtons of force. Recently, a composite force sensor based on UCNPs embedded in a polystyrene microbead enabled the first real time measurement of feeding forces in living nematodes. However, the comparatively large stiffness of polystyrene only makes it relevant to biomedical application in a small subset of biological tissue. To facilitate deployment of UCNPs into biological tissues with a range of mechanical properties, we expand upon polymer UCNP composite systems by embedding UCNPs in three polymer matrices with varying stiffnesses (epoxy resin, polydimethylsiloxane, and alginate hydrogels). Furthermore, to enhance these composites mechanosensitivity, we methodically investigate using two different core-shell architectures of SrLuF based UCNPs doped with ytterbium, erbium, and varying manganese concentrations. We calibrate polymer UCNP composite optical force sensitivity with colocalized atomic force and confocal microscopy. Using the red to green emission ratio (Delta Percent IRed:IGreen) as the force read-out, we determine that SrLuF:Yb0.28Er0.025Mn0.013 with SrYF inert shell dispersed in epoxy resin exhibits the greatest emission color change (12 Delta Percent IRed:IGreen per microNewton). Finally, we map forces in the epoxy UCNP composite on the macroscale between the joint of a chicken wing bone using a commercially available wide field microscope, thereby demonstrating its ability to optically measure pressures in situ. This work establishes the utility and modularity of the UCNP polymer composite system for force sensing in geometrically and mechanically diverse biological systems.

Abstract: Conventional photoelastic methods are largely limited to two-dimensional stress visualization, leaving a gap in techniques that can capture three-dimensional force interactions with high sensitivity at low stress levels, a capability that is critical for biomechanics and dynamic force analysis. This study develops and demonstrates a cubic photoelastic model that enables accurate fringe-order estimation from three orthogonal views, providing a foundation for reconstructing full three-dimensional stress states. A transparent, low-elasticity epoxy cube, free of prestress, was fabricated and examined using combined transmission and reflection photoelastic imaging. Three mutually orthogonal isochromatic fringe fields were recorded simultaneously under a single applied load. Image analysis employed a peak-valley intensity method to extract sub-fringe orders and to resolve low-stress cases with minimal noise. The cubic block produced high-quality fringe patterns in all directions, enabling separation of tangential and normal stress components. Independent orthogonal views confirmed directional sensitivity and yielded consistent fringe-order estimates under low loading, with response times on the order of tens of microseconds. These results establish a practical approach for three-dimensional photoelastic stress measurement from orthogonal views and create a pathway toward full vector force reconstruction with strong potential for biomedical applications and studies of dynamic loading.

Abstract: To increase the power level and energy utilization rate of injection-locked magnetron sources, a dual way 1-kW S-band magnetron microwave power combining system with high combining efficiency was proposed and validated. A waveguide magic-Tee was used to achieve power combining and to provide a pathway for the reference signal. This system utilizes the power-dividing characteristic of a magic-Tee to lock two magnetrons. Frequency tuning is applied to adjust the phase difference between the two magnetrons' signals so as to achieve a high combining efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the microwave power combining efficiency of the proposed system reaches 94.5%. The attenuation of microwave power is caused only by the waveguides and magic-Tee. Our investigation provides a guideline for future high-power microwave combining systems with low losses.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a new framework for adaptive materials and structures with embedded intelligence, focusing on memory integration with information processing.

The approach avoids traditional black-box methods, emphasizing direct interaction with the environment and enhanced resilience.

Motivation: The need for efficient and interpretable integration of memory and information processing in intelligent materials and structures, addressing limitations of existing paradigms in terms of efficiency, scalability, and transparency.

Method: The method involves the design of phononic metastructures that encode spatial information into stable structural states for mechanical memory. It uses wave localization for sensory perception and optimizes input waveforms for memory-pattern classification, with decisions inferred from output wave energy.

Result: The framework demonstrates the ability to decompose complex patterns into geometric features, classify memory patterns, and make decisions using elastic waves, achieving efficient, transparent, and low-power cognitive computing without additional electronics.

Conclusion: Innovative approach to creating intelligent, low-power materials and structures with embedded intelligence, overcoming traditional limitations in computational materials.

Abstract: Modern autonomous systems are driving the critical need for next-generation adaptive materials and structures with embodied intelligence, i.e., the embodiment of memory, perception, learning, and decision-making within the mechanical domain. A fundamental challenge is the seamless and efficient integration of memory with information processing in a physically interpretable way that enables cognitive learning and decision-making under uncertainty. Prevailing paradigms, from intricate logic cascades to black-box morphological computing or physical neural networks, are seriously limited by trade-offs among efficiency, scalability, interpretability, transparency, and reliance on additional electronics. Here, we introduce in-memory phononic learning, a paradigm-shifting framework that unifies nonvolatile mechanical memory with wave-based perception within a phononic metastructure. Our system encodes spatial information into stable structural states as mechanical memory that directly programs its elastic wave-propagation landscape. This memory/wave-dynamics coupling enables effective sensory perception, decomposing complex patterns into informative geometric features through frequency-selective wave localization. Learning is created by optimizing input waveforms to selectively probe these features for memory-pattern classification, with decisions inferred directly from the output wave energy, thereby completing the entire information loop mechanically through an efficient and physically transparent mechanism without hidden architectures or electronics. This work transcends the paradigm of 'materials that compute' to cognitive matter capable of interpreting dynamic environments, paving the way for future intelligent structural-material systems with low power consumption, more direct interaction with surroundings, and enhanced cybersecurity and resilience in harsh conditions.

Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization lies at the heart of spintronic and magnonic technologies, with the ultimate performance of such systems limited by the velocity at which magnetic excitations can propagate. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast propagation of magnon-polaritons-hybrid quasiparticles arising from the coupling between spin waves and electromagnetic fields in thin pure, bismuth-, and gallium substituted yttrium iron garnet (YIG, Bi:YIG and Ga:YIG) films. Using time- and phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy and time-resolved scanning transmission microscopy, we show that magnon-polaritons can propagate faster than 100 km/s, nearly three orders of magnitude more than conventional spin waves, and can be observed at distances exceeding 40 micrometers in 20 nm thick films. Analytical modeling based on retarded Maxwell equations and Polder tensor formalism confirms the hybridized nature of the excitations and captures the nontrivial dispersion and attenuation profiles. Notably, the magnon-polaritons maintain high initial magnetization amplitudes and long decay lengths, enabling ultrafast manipulation of the magnetization far away from the excitation source. We show, that they can move domain walls or stabilize nonlinear magnetization processes. The unprecedentedly high propagation velocities make magnon-polaritons promising candidates for high-speed information transfer in future spin-based computing architectures, potentially overcoming long-standing group delay bottlenecks in magnonic logic circuits.

Abstract: In a complex manifold, one can bridge anti-de Sitter and de Sitter spacetimes via analytic continuation, preserving geometric invariants and regularity, avoiding singularities during the AdS-dS transition. It unifies gravitational and gauge interactions under a complexified symmetry group, maintaining bulk unitarity for both AdS and dS. Boundary unitarity is upheld in AdS but not in dS due to the spacelike conformal boundary. The theory uses holographic principles like the MacDowell-Mansouri and Quantum Extremal Surface prescriptions to align entanglement and black hole entropy with AdS/CFT and general relativity. HUFT provides insights into AdS and dS holography, the cosmological constant, and quantum gravity unitarity and entanglement.

Abstract: The third law of black hole dynamics states that it is impossible, through any finite sequence of physical processes, to reduce the surface gravity of a black hole to zero. In this work, we examine the validity of this law for static, spherically symmetric charged black holes in the pure Lovelock theory of gravity. By studying infinitesimal variations in mass and charge, we derive a set of inequalities that constrain these variations. Our analysis shows that as the surface gravity approaches zero ($κ\to 0$), the range of admissible perturbations gradually diminishes, thereby forbidding the attainment of extremality through any finite classical process. The saturation of the inequality is interpreted as the emergence of a dynamical barrier near extremality, which prevents further evolution toward the extremal configuration.

Abstract: We examine the thermal and statistical properties of the one dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator within two prominent Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) frameworks: Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin. Using the modified dispersion relations specific to each formulation, we derive the positive energy spectra, construct the partition function via the Euler-Maclaurin method, and compute key thermodynamic quantities, including the specific heat $C_v$, as functions of temperature and the deformation scale. Planck-scale corrections produce distinct, theoretically resolvable shifts in both the position and magnitude of the $C_v$ peak in the two models. An accompanying entropy analysis reveals that these peaks correspond to smooth Schottky-type anomalies: the specific heat curves remain analytic and positive across the explored temperature range, and thus do not indicate latent or continuous thermodynamic phase transitions. These comparative results provide a robust diagnostic framework for differentiating DSR prescriptions in relativistic quantum systems and reinforce the transition-free character of their thermal response.

Abstract: We investigate perturbative quasinormal-mode (QNM) shifts of black holes arising from fractional, nonlocal modifications to the wave operator. Starting from a scalar master equation corrected by a small fractional Laplacian term $(-Δ)^{s}$ with $0<s<1$, we derive an analytic expression for the complex frequency shift at first order in the nonlocal coupling $\varepsilon$. Evaluation of the fractional operator in both coordinate and momentum representations reveals a universal scaling law $δω/ω\propto \varepsilon/M^{2s}$, largely independent of the field spin, with an additional $\ell^{2s}$ enhancement in the eikonal regime $\ell \gg 1$. Applying the formalism to Schwarzschild, slowly rotating Kerr, Hayward regular, and LQG-corrected black holes, we demonstrate that the leading-order fractional QNM shift is universal, with geometric details entering only through overlap integrals of the mode functions. This universality provides a model-independent signature of nonlocality in strong-gravity ringdown spectra and offers a potential observational window into quantum-gravity-inspired modifications.

TL;DR: An improved SMA test of GR measures amplitude deviations in higher-order GW modes while maintaining the dominant mode. The test shows promise but has limitations in strongly precessing or eccentric systems. It can also detect phase perturbations, leading to apparent GR violations. The strongest constraint from recent GW detections is δA44 = -0.30^{+1.16}_{-3.45} consistent with GR.

Motivation: Testing the limits of general relativity through gravitational wave analysis is crucial for understanding strong-field gravity and alternative theories of gravity.

Method: The SMA test uses a comprehensive parameter-estimation campaign to evaluate against Gaussian noise, waveform modeling, and physical effects like spin precession and orbital eccentricity. It was applied to numerical-relativity simulations.

Result: The SMA test performs reliably for aligned-spin and mildly precessing systems but shows measurable biases for strongly precessing or eccentric binaries. It also responds to phase perturbations, leading to apparent GR violations.

Conclusion: This work establishes the SMA test as a robust framework for probing strong-field gravity and demonstrates a systematic approach for assessing the robustness of GW tests of GR.

Abstract: We present an improved subdominant-mode amplitude (SMA) test of general relativity (GR), which probes amplitude-level deviations in the higher-order modes of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black hole mergers while keeping the dominant quadrupole mode fixed. Using a comprehensive parameter-estimation campaign, we benchmark the test against Gaussian noise fluctuations, waveform modeling systematics, and physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. When applied to numerical-relativity simulations, the SMA test performs reliably for aligned-spin and mildly precessing systems but exhibits measurable biases for strongly precessing or eccentric binaries. Although designed to detect amplitude deviations, the test also responds coherently to phase perturbations, yielding apparent GR violations when applied to phase-modified waveforms. Applied to recent GW detections, we report the strongest constraint on the hexadecapolar (4,4) mode amplitude deviation, $δA_{44} = -0.30^{+1.16}_{-3.45}$, consistent with GR. With these results, this work establishes the SMA test as a robust and broadly sensitive framework for probing strong-field gravity and demonstrates a systematic approach for assessing the robustness of GW tests of GR.

Abstract: We construct and analyze a symmetric bimetric cosmological model connecting Anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) regimes through a coupled scalar field. Starting from a Lagrangian with Einstein-Hilbert terms for two FLRW metrics and an inter-metric potential, we derive modified Friedmann and Klein-Gordon equations governing their evolution. In the symmetric effective-fluid limit, the model reproduces the main phenomenology of the $Λ$CDM cosmology with a small dynamical correction proportional to $(1+z)^{-3}$, and naturally satisfies local-gravity constraints through Vainshtein screening. This article outlines the theoretical structure and calibration of the model within a dual-geometry cosmological setting.

### [217] [Spin precession effects in the phasing formula of eccentric compact binary inspirals till the second post-Newtonian order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12042)
*Soham Bhattacharyya,Omkar Sridhar*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Derives analytic phasing formulae for compact binaries with eccentric orbits and precessing spins, providing efficient closed-form expressions for gravitational wave waveform modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave modeling for compact binaries with eccentricity and spin precession requires efficient analytic phasing, which is currently unavailable. This work addresses that gap.

Method: Uses precession averaging framework, separates timescales, treats eccentricity as a small parameter, derives analytic solutions up to eighth order in eccentricity, generalizes TaylorT2 approximant, and performs resummation for improved accuracy.

Result: Closed form formulas for phasing incorporating orbital eccentricity and spin precession, applicable for data analysis with moderate to high eccentricities.

Conclusion: This work enables more accurate and efficient gravitational wave waveform modeling, enhancing data analysis for compact binary systems with eccentricity and spin precession.

Abstract: Compact binary systems emitting gravitational waves (GWs) can exhibit orbital eccentricity, along with generic spin orientations, leading to the precession of the orbital angular momentum, individual spins, and the orbital plane. While eccentric binaries with aligned spins are well studied, closed form post Newtonian (PN) expressions that simultaneously include eccentricity and precessing spin effects have remained unavailable. Eccentricity complicates orbital evolution because solving the coupled differential equations typically requires numerical integration, which slows down the generation of waveforms. We exploit the separation of timescales between orbital motion, spin precession, and radiation reaction, applying the precession averaging method of Morras et al. (2025) to remove explicit time dependence from the spin orbit and spin spin dynamics through the second PN order. Using this framework, we derive analytic phasing formulae from the evolution equations for orbital frequency and eccentricity, treating eccentricity as a small parameter. Closed form solutions for the eccentricity evolution and GW phase are obtained up to eighth order in the initial eccentricity. We also generalize the TaylorT2 approximant to include spin precession effects and compute the orbital phase in both time and frequency domains. To improve accuracy for moderate to high initial eccentricities, we perform a resummation of the TaylorT2 phasing. These results offer efficient, closed form phasing expressions that capture the coupled dynamics of eccentricity and precession, enabling more accurate and computationally tractable GW waveform modeling for data analysis.

Abstract: We present a relativistic modeling framework for GNSS-based navigation in Geocentric and Barycentric Celestial Reference Systems, i.e., GCRS and BCRS, respectively. Using the IAU-adopted GCRS and BCRS conventions, we derive closed-form transformations for position, velocity, and acceleration that are required to achieve fractional-frequency transfer precision of 10^{-16} and sub-cm positional accuracy. Numerical simulations with GipsyX validate cm-level orbit determination and timing stability within tens of picoseconds across GCRS and BCRS and demonstrate mm-level round-trip GCRS <--> BCRS frame closure over 24 h. These results underscore the necessity of relativistic corrections for high-precision GNSS throughout the Earth-Moon system and demonstrate that GNSS signals can support a decimeter-level orbit accuracy and sub-nanosecond-scale timing synchronization in cislunar space, establishing a robust framework for future operations. We introduce the Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) and its associated time scale to extend GNSS-based navigation into cislunar space. We present a minimal cislunar case study (NRHO-like geometry) that applies the improved position/velocity/acceleration transformations and the light-time model.

Abstract: This study examines the dynamical evolution of self-gravitating systems in the presence of exotic matter within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. Specifically, we have adopted the Starobinsky model $f(R) = R + αR^2$, which incorporates higher-order curvature corrections to describe nonlinear gravitational behavior. The analysis focuses on the nonlinear spherical evolution of anisotropic matter configurations and explains how dark matter influences their physical characteristics. The presence of dark matter is found to significantly affect the radial and tangential pressure distributions, thereby altering the overall dynamics of the system. The model is employed for the compact object $ Her~X-1$ described by the generalized Tolman-Kuchowicz metric, demonstrating a singularity-free behavior of the physical parameters. The results reveal that increasing the parameter $n$ of the generalized Tolman-Kuchowicz metric leads to striking variations in the model characteristics, highlighting its essential role in governing internal structure and evolution of the compact object. The model remains physically viable under different testing criteria like energy conditions, hydrostatic equilibrium condition, adiabatic index, causality conditions, Herrera's Cracking condition and mass-radius relation presented in this work.

Abstract: Arguably one can use a canonical scalar field $\varphi$, minimally coupled to gravity, with quadratic potentials $V = Λ\pm \frac12 m^2\varphi^2$ to explore some general features of slow-roll and hilltop thawing quintessence, respectively. For each of these two potentials, and pressure-free matter, we introduce a regular unconstrained dynamical system on a compact state space, where the formulation for the hilltop case is new. Together with a derivation of monotonic functions in the two global state space settings, this enables us to obtain global results and to introduce figures that illustrate the global solution spaces of these models, in which we situate the observationally viable quintessence solutions.

Abstract: Quantum information science has been broadly explored in Einstein gravity and in various modified gravity theories; however, its extension to quantum gravity settings remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\tildeζ$, the mode frequency $\tildeω$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\tildeζ$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\tildeζ$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information.

Conclusion: 研究确认，施瓦茨child-加缓慢旋转或球对称halo的外部时空可能具有强稳定性，经受住更密集场的测试。发现的这些特性可能有助于构建更强壮的理论模型，或者解释一些关于黑洞辐射或稳定性的问题。研究结果表明，halo参数对这些现象的影响是次要的，这可能简化了未来的理论建模和观察预测。

Abstract: We study quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of a massive scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a spherically symmetric galactic dark matter halo. The background metric, recently obtained as an analytic generalization of the Schwarzschild geometry, depends on the halo velocity parameter $V_{c}$ and the core radius $a$. Using the sixth- and seventh-order WKB methods with Pade approximants, supported by time-domain integration and Prony analysis, we compute the fundamental quasinormal frequencies and transmission coefficients. The results show that the real part of the frequency slightly increases while the damping rate decreases with growing field mass $μ$, leading to longer-lived oscillations. The influence of the dark matter halo parameters is found to be negligible for astrophysically realistic values, confirming the robustness of Schwarzschild-like ringdown signatures. Grey-body factors decrease with increasing field mass and multipole number, while the effect of the halo parameters remains small.

Abstract: We identify a relativistic-fluid counterpart of the Unruh effect, in which a comoving probe measures a \emph{Thermodynamic Unruh temperature}. Frame changes in first-order hydrodynamics can be recast as a local, time-dependent hyperbolic rotation in a Rindler-style state space; the instantaneous map between frames is the \emph{Thermodynamic Boost}, and its proper-time variation defines the \emph{Thermodynamic Acceleration} that imprints a thermal spectrum. Using the Israel--Stewart theory and extending it to modern relativistic fluid theories,we show that this temperature is frame-independent to leading order and universal for out-of-equilibrium relativistic fluids.

Abstract: In the present work, we develop and examine a series of exact solutions to Einstein's 5-dimensional field equations in the vacuum, which depend on two constant parameters, $p$ and $q$, which generalize the solutions of Lü and Mei [8] belonging to our class $p=2$. This category of solutions can be split into two sections: when $p$ is odd, it represents a compact object that may have naked singularities. However, the intriguing outcome occurs when $p$ is even, as asymptotically Ricci flat wormholes emerge in this scenario. The Kreschman invariant of these solutions depends on the constant parameter $l = 1 + \frac{3 q^2 - p^2}{4}$. When $l = 0$ and $l \leq -\frac{1}{2}$, the solutions are regular. For the specific cases where $l \leq 0$, or $l > 0$ such that $q < 0$ for $p \geq 2$, $q \leq \frac{1}{3}$ for $p = 2$, and $q \leq \frac{1 + \sqrt{2}}{3}$ for $ p \geq 4$, this class of wormholes adheres to Wormhole Cosmic Censorship, implying that the throat effectively obscures all causal anomalies and singularities. In our analysis, we investigated the embedded geometry, geodesics, singularities, potential event horizons, ergoregions, and the wormhole throat.

Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of a dark matter (DM) spike formed during the adiabatic growth of a black hole embedded in a DM halo, and investigate its backreaction on the spacetime geometry. Within the Einstein cluster framework, we derive the complete tensor, explicitly incorporating the kinetic contribution to the energy density and the anisotropic pressure arising from noncircular particle orbits. Adopting the Hernquist profile as an illustrative model of DM halo and employing parameters appropriate to the Milky Way, we find that near the spike, the kinetic term enhances the total energy density by approximately $50\%$ relative to the rest-mass component, while the nonzero radial pressure induces a mild anisotropy in the stress tensor. The derived tensor satisfies all standard energy conditions. By treating it as a fixed source in Einstein' s equations, we numerically obtain a static, spherically symmetric metric that deviates from the Schwarzschild solution by an amount more than twice that found when only the mass density is considered. These results demonstrate that including the full dynamical structure of the DM spike is essential for accurately modeling the backreaction of DM on black hole spacetimes.

Abstract: We unveil a novel class of traversable wormholes exhibiting exact spherical symmetry, geometrically inspired by the minimal surface structure of a catenoid. Introducing the spacetime metric, we rigorously derive its fundamental curvature properties, including the Riemann curvature tensor, and consequently compute the Einstein tensor and stress-energy tensor. This framework reveals that the wormhole is sustained by an anisotropic fluid. A detailed analysis of the energy conditions demonstrates the requisite presence of exotic matter, establishing the physical viability and constraints of this configuration. Subsequent investigations address the wormhole's traversability characteristics, gravitational lensing signatures, and dynamic stability. Crucially, we establish that this catenoid-inspired spacetime represents a finite wormhole, possessing bounded spatial extent.

TL;DR: This paper examines the dynamical tidal response of static, spherically symmetric black holes in general relativity using a combination of Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi methods and worldline effective field theory, revealing ambiguities in tidal Love numbers based on renormalization scheme choices, with potential for extension to other compact objects and alternative theories of gravity.

Motivation: Understanding black hole responses to tidal forces is vital for insights into gravitational theories and gravitational wave signals.

Method: The study employs analytical techniques for BH perturbations combined with effective field theory methods to compute binary dynamics.

Result: The research identifies inherent ambiguities in tidal Love numbers resulting from renormalization choices.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to understanding BH dynamics within GR and suggest applications to other scenarios and theories.

Abstract: The response of a black hole (BH) to tidal forces encodes key information about the underlying gravitational theory and affects the waveform of gravitational waves emitted during binary inspiral processes. In this paper, we analyze the dynamical tidal response of static and spherically symmetric BHs in a low-frequency regime within general relativity (GR), based on a matching between the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) methods for an analytical approach to BH perturbations and the worldline effective field theory (EFT) for an efficient and unified computation of the binary dynamics within the post-Newtonian regime. We show that the renormalized tidal response function is subject to inevitable ambiguities associated with the choice of renormalization scheme and with the initial condition of the renormalization flow equation. Once these ambiguities are fixed, we obtain scheme-dependent dynamical tidal Love numbers. We also discuss possible extensions of our formalism, including generic non-rotating compact objects (e.g., neutron stars) in GR and BHs in theories beyond GR.

Abstract: Upgrades to current gravitational wave detectors for the next observation run and upcoming third-generation observatories, like the Einstein telescope, are expected to have enormous improvements in detection sensitivities and compact object merger event rates. Estimation of source parameters for a wider parameter space that these detectable signals will lie in, will be a computational challenge. Thus, it is imperative to have methods to speed-up the likelihood calculations with theoretical waveform predictions, which can ultimately make the parameter estimation faster and aid in rapid multi-messenger follow-ups. Towards this end, we present a conditional variational auto-encoder model, based on the best performing architecture of Liao+2021, for faster generation of aligned-spin SEOBNRv4 inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. Our parameter space consists of four parameters, [$m_1$, $m_2$, $χ_1(z)$, $χ_2(z)$]. The masses are uniformly sampled in $[5,75]\,M_{\odot}$ with a mass ratio limit at $10\,M_{\odot}$, while the spins are uniform in $[-0.99,0.99]$. We train the model using $\sim10^5$ input waveforms data with a 70\%/10\% train/validation split, while 20\% data are reserved for testing. The median mismatch for the generated waveforms in the test dataset is $\sim10^{-2}$, with better performance in a restricted parameter space of $χ_{\rm eff}\in[-0.80,0.80]$. Our model is able to generate 100 waveforms in 0.1 second at an average speed of about 4.46 ms per waveform. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the native SEOBNRv4 implementation in lalsimulation. The latent sampling uncertainty of our model can be quantified with a mean mismatch deviation of $2\times10^{-1}$ for 1000 generations of the same waveform. Our work aims to be the first step towards developing a production-ready machine learning framework for the faster generation of gravitational waveform approximations.

### [230] [Analytical and numerical study of accretion processes around charged spherically symmetric black holes in scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12670)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Modified gravity parameters in scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet gravity affect physical processes around a black hole by altering orbital stability, accretion disk properties, and shock cone dynamics. Specifically, increasing the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and negative cosmological constant weakens gravitational focusing, reducing accreted matter and material density, while potentially stabilizing accretion configurations by dampening turbulence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors investigate the effects of scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet gravity on astrophysical phenomena around black holes to better understand gravitational modifications and their implications for accretion processes.

Method: The study employs both analytical geodesic analysis to examine orbits and angular momentum, and numerical solutions of the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations to model the shock cone formed in BHL accretion.

Result: The numerical results demonstrate that increasing the Gauss-Bonlet coupling constant and negative cosmological constant reduce gravitational focusing. This leads to a decrease in the accreted matter and material density as well as changes in the opening angle of the shock cone, depending on parameter choices.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonlet corrections can stabilize accretion configurations by dampening turbulence and that observable properties of accretion disks and quasiperiodic oscillations can be used to constrain modified gravity parameters in strong-field regimes.

Abstract: We investigate the physical phenomena occurring around a spherically symmetric, non-rotating charged black hole (BH) to explore the effects of scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet gravity on circular motion, accretion disk properties, and Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion flow. By analytically and numerically examining the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $c_1$ and the cosmological parameter $Λ$, we reveal how these modified gravity parameters alter the underlying physical processes. Using geodesic analysis, we compute the specific energy, angular momentum, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius, and radiation flux of test particles, providing insight into how the modified gravity framework affects orbital stability and the organization of the accretion flow. Subsequently, through numerical solutions of the general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) equations, we describe the morphology of the shock cone formed via the BHL accretion mechanism around the BH. The numerical results demonstrate that increasing the values of $c_1$ and negative $Λ$ reduce gravitational focusing. Consequently, depending on the parameter choices, the opening angle of the shock cone either widens or narrows compared to the Schwarzschild case. However, because of weakened gravitational focusing, both the amount of accreted matter and the density of material trapped inside the cone decrease significantly. These results indicate that scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet corrections act as an effective gravitational damping term, transferring turbulence and transforming shock-dominated accretion into more stable configurations. The consistency between theoretical and numerical results suggests that the observable properties of accretion disks and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) can serve as probes to constrain the parameters of scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet gravity in strong-field regimes.

Abstract: Building on the characterisation in [C. D. Hill, J. Lewandowski and P. Nurowski, Indiana Univ. Math.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring black holes in bumblebee gravity to understand their physical effects and connections to Lorentz violation.

Method: Analyzing spacetime geometry through coordinate adjustments, solving geodesic equations, computing shadow radii, studying particle motion with effective potentials, investigating lensing effects, and deriving bounds from Solar System experiments.

Result: Obtained critical orbits and shadow radii, computed quasinormal frequencies, observed lensing phenomena, and established bounds on the Lorentz-violating parameter.

Conclusion: The study bridges black hole physics in modified gravity with Lorentz symmetry violations, offering insights into potential observational signatures.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the physical consequences of a recently introduced black hole solution in bumblebee gravity [1]. The geometry is first presented and then reformulated through suitable coordinate adjustments, which make its global conical character evident. We then study the propagation of particles by solving the geodesic equations for null and timelike trajectories. The associated critical orbits (or photon spheres) are obtained, and shadow radius are computed and compared with other Lorentz-violating configurations in bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond models, including their charged and cosmological extensions. Massive particle motion is analyzed separately, followed by the construction of the effective potentials for scalar, vector, tensor, and spinor perturbations. These potentials allow the calculations of quasinormal frequencies and the corresponding time-domain evolution. Gravitational lensing phenomena are investigated in the weak and strong deflection regimes, and the light-travel time delay is also evaluated. The study concludes with bounds on the Lorentz-violating parameter based on classical Solar System experiments.

Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of test scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac fields in the background of a new analytic regular black-hole solution obtained as an exact solution of the Einstein equations sourced by a Dehnen-type matter distribution in [R. A. Konoplya, A. Zhidenko, arXiv:2511.03066]. The metric is asymptotically flat and characterized by a simple lapse function $f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass and $a$ represents the characteristic scale of the surrounding dark-matter halo that regularizes the central region. The effective potentials for all perturbing fields possess the standard single-barrier form, ensuring linear stability and the applicability of the WKB formalism. The quasinormal frequencies are computed using the sixth- and ninth-order WKB methods with Padé corrections and verified by time-domain integration, both approaches showing excellent agreement. The parameter $a$ leads to a moderate increase in the real oscillation frequency, while the damping rate remains almost unchanged, producing only small corrections to the Schwarzschild spectrum. Since such deviations become appreciable only for unrealistically dense halos, our results confirm that the quasinormal spectrum of astrophysical black holes is safely unaffected by ordinary galactic dark-matter environments.

Abstract: We present a method for efficiently searching long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). The approach exploits the smooth frequency-domain behavior of ratios between neighboring waveform templates. The matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time series of a data segment is first computed for a reference template, and the SNRs of nearby templates are then reconstructed by convolving this reference SNR time series with the ratio waveforms, defined as the frequency-domain ratios between the reference and neighboring templates. The computational speedup arises because the ratio waveforms can be safely truncated: they are significant only over a short interval approximately equal to the duration difference between the templates. Storing these truncated ratio waveforms is practical and enables additional efficiency gains, in contrast to storing full templates, which is generally infeasible for long-duration, low-mass signals. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method with mock non-spinning CBC injections in the $1-3~M_\odot$ range. The reconstructed SNR time series agrees with that obtained from standard matched filtering to an accuracy of $O(10^{-4})$, while the relative computational cost is reduced by $\gtrsim 25\%$. With a truncation threshold of $10^{-3}$ applied to the ratio waveform amplitudes, the storage requirement is reduced by a factor of $\sim 60$ relative to storing the full template bank.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The thesis sets out to explore modifications to Einstein's theory of General Relativity that could resolve the problematic singularities present in black hole solutions.

Method: The research focuses on constructing modified gravity models and analyzing their properties, such as the behavior of spacetime curvature in these models.

Result: The study identifies specific modified gravity theories that produce regular black holes with well-behaved spacetime properties.

Conclusion: This work supports the viability of modified gravity as a potential pathway to understanding black holes beyond the limitations of classical General Relativity.

Abstract: The prediction of spacetime singularities, regions of infinite curvature where classical physics breaks down, is one of the most profound challenges in General Relativity (GR). In particular, black hole solutions such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics feature central singularities that signal the incompleteness of the theory in high curvature regimes. This thesis is devoted to the study of modified theories of gravity that aim to resolve these singularities and construct physically viable models of regular black holes: black holes that retain an event horizon but exhibit no curvature divergence anywhere in the spacetime ... Throughout the thesis, particular care is taken to ensure that the proposed models are physically sensible: they reduce to GR in the appropriate limits and lead to well behaved curvature scalars. Collectively, these results highlight the viability of regular black hole models in modified gravity theories, providing a promising path toward a consistent semiclassical description of black holes that avoids the need for quantum gravitational resolution of singularities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the images of black holes by gluing two Schwarzschild spacetimes with a thin shell where the Israel junction conditions are satisfied. By studying the refraction law for null geodesics at the spherical shell, and taking account of the light travel time delay, the images are obtained by ray tracing a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk. For a static shell we identify three signatures: a redshift cusp at the shell, a V-shaped profile of the transfer function $r(b)$, and a loss of the one-to-one correspondence between photon spheres and photon rings on the observer's screen. During the collapse of the shell, the spacetime evolves from a stage with a single photon sphere inside the shell, through an intermediate stage with double photon spheres, and finally to a spacetime with a single photon sphere outside the shell. However, when the shell is released from a large distance, the corresponding images never show two separate photon rings, even in the stage with two photon spheres. In addition, the motion of the shell leads to a discontinuity in the redshift factor. These signatures provide a practical basis for testing the Israel junction in black hole spacetimes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) offers a fundamental test of spacetime structure. However, its behavior in higher-dimensional black holes influenced by anisotropic energy-momentum tensors remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we investigate the upper bound of the ISCO in higher-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes in the presence of an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. The energy-momentum tensor is assumed to satisfy the weak energy condition, possess a non-positive trace, and obey constraints on radial and tangential pressures, collectively equivalent to the dominant energy condition with additional constraints. By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics and imposing ISCO conditions, we demonstrate the general absence of an upper bound on the ISCO radius in higher-dimensional spacetimes. For dimensions greater than or equal to eight, an ISCO may not exist, depending on the radial and tangential components of the energy-momentum tensor. If an ISCO exists, its radius remains unbounded. These findings advance our understanding of orbital stability in higher-dimensional gravitational systems and highlight fundamental differences from four-dimensional black hole dynamics.

Conclusion: CCM提供了一个可控的数值实验室，展示了不同几何量的相互作用产生有限维、分形-like 几何结构。

Abstract: We investigate the Coherence--Curvature Model (CCM), a dynamical ensemble of connected graphs governed by a Hamiltonian that couples algebraic connectivity, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, and an edge-density penalty. Using connected simulated annealing we generate low-energy graph configurations and characterize their emergent geometry through the spectral dimension (ds), the Hausdorff dimension (dh), and the average distance. Finite-size scaling shows a clear growth of ds with system size, while dh increases more mildly. At the largest volumes explored the data are compatible with ds ~ 4 and dh ~ 3, implying ds > dh and a nontrivial hierarchy between spectral and volumetric notions of dimension. We also map the dependence on the curvature coupling gamma and the locality coupling beta, and we find a slow power-law growth of typical distances with a small exponent eta. The CCM therefore provides a controlled numerical laboratory in which the interplay of coherence, curvature, and locality yields finite-dimensional, fractal-like geometries.

Abstract: We present the implementation of an anomaly-detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional autoencoder for the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in time-frequency spectrograms. Our method targets short-duration ($\lesssim 2\,\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\simeq 20\,M_\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny. These results demonstrate that anomaly detection offers a powerful, model-independent framework for future GW searches, paving the way toward fully automated and adaptive analysis pipelines.

Abstract: It is the object of the present paper to unimodularise a disformal bimetric scalar-tensor theory, thereby defining what we call bimodular gravity. We impose one unimodular constraint per metric via multipliers $λ_{1,2}$ and show that two natural implementations-a dual fixed-determinant (BUG) and a dual diffeomorphism-invariant (BHT/BDUG) formulation-are classically inequivalent. In BUG the relative volume element $ν=\sqrt{1-2BX}$ is fixed, enforcing a kinematic constraint on the biscalar and we derive the "bimodular cosmological constant" $Λ=λ_1+νλ_2$. In BHT/BDUG, $λ_{1,2}$ are individually constant but $ν$ (hence $BX$) remains dynamical. Recasting the theory in an Einstein-frame form, we derive the biscalar sound speed and identify a subluminal domain $1+B(V+λ_2)>0$. At the background level, BUG admits constant-roll solutions governed by first-order flow, whereas BHT supports solutions with time-dependent roll. These structural differences yield distinct, in-principle testable predictions for the expansion history, the dark-energy equation of state, and the propagation of biscalar perturbations. Finally, we present a diffeomorphism-invariant completion that correlates the two HT volume forms, reproducing the $Λ$ of BUG on shell whilst maintaining full covariance.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study evaluates the detectability of sub-solar mass intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (SSM-IMRIs) and the effectiveness of the IMRPhenomX phenomenological templates in high-mass-ratio regimes compared to the BHPTNRSur1dq1e4 surrogate model. The inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes is found to be critical for maintaining a higher signal-to-noise ratio, degrading it by factors of ~3-5 if excluded. SSM-IMRIs are observable up to ~575 Mpc (z~0.12) with Advanced LIGO and ~10.5 Gpc (z~1.4) with the Einstein Telescope. However, significant systematic uncertainties in the current phenomenological approximants are identified, with matches between IMRPhenomX and BHPTNRSur1dq1e4 degrading to values as low as 0.2 for edge-on inclinations, and fitting factors consistently falling below 0.9. Bayesian parameter estimation shows that these modeling discrepancies induce systematic biases larger than statistical errors, emphasizing the need for waveform models calibrated to perturbation theory in the intermediate mass-ratio regime for robust detection and inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the detectability and waveform modeling of sub-solar mass intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (SSM-IMRIs) is crucial for advancing gravitational wave astronomy, particularly in the context of multi-messenger physics and improving the accuracy of parameter estimation for these systems.

Method: The study involves comparing the performance of the IMRPhenomX phenomenological templates with the BHPTNRSur1dq1e4 surrogate model using black hole perturbation theory. The method involves assessing the impact of higher-order gravitational wave modes, evaluating observable distances with different facilities, and performing Bayesian parameter estimation to identify systematic biases.

Result: The key findings are: 1) Higher-order gravitational wave modes are critical for maintaining a higher signal-to-noise ratio in SSM-IMRIs; 2) SSM-IMRIs are observable up to ~575 Mpc with Advanced LIGO and ~10.5 Gpc with the Einstein Telescope; 3) There are significant systematic uncertainties in current phenomenological approximants, with matching efficiencies as low as 0.2 for edge-on inclinations; 4) Bayesian parameter estimation reveals systematic biases larger than statistical errors, necessitating improved waveform models for robust detection and inference.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of waveform modeling in the intermediate mass-ratio regime for the successful detection and inference of SSM-IMRIs. The inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes and the development of more accurate phenomenological templates are essential for advancing the sensitivity and reliability of gravitational wave detectors like Advanced LIGO and the Einstein Telescope in multi-messenger astronomy applications.

Abstract: We investigate the detectability and waveform systematics of sub-solar mass intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (SSM-IMRIs), characterized by mass ratios $q \sim 10^2-10^4$. Using the black hole perturbation theory surrogate model \textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} as a reference, we assess the performance of the \textsc{IMRPhenomX} phenomenological family in the high-mass-ratio regime. We find that the inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes is critical; their exclusion may degrade the signal-to-noise ratio by factors of $\sim3-5$ relative to quadrupole-only templates. With optimal mode inclusion, SSM-IMRIs are observable out to luminosity distances of $\sim575$ Mpc ($z\sim0.12$) with Advanced LIGO and $\sim10.5$ Gpc ($z\sim1.4$) with the Einstein Telescope. However, we identify substantial systematic uncertainties in current phenomenological approximants. Matches between \textsc{IMRPhenomX} and the reference surrogate model \textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} degrade to values as low as 0.2 for edge-on inclinations, and fitting factors consistently fall below 0.9, indicating a significant loss of effectualness in template-bank searches. Bayesian parameter estimation reveals that these modeling discrepancies induce systematic biases that exceed statistical errors by multiple standard deviations, underscoring the necessity for waveform models calibrated to perturbation theory in the intermediate mass-ratio regime for robust detection and inference.

Abstract: Motivated by weak null singularities in black hole interiors, we study 1+1 dimensional Lorentzian manifolds $(M,g)$ which admit a continuous spacetime extension across a null boundary $v=0$, where $v<0$ is a null coordinate. We study the degree to which such extensions are unique up to the boundary. Firstly, we find that in general not even the $C^0$-structure of the extension is uniquely determined by the assumption that the metric extends continuously. However, we exhibit an interesting local-global relation regarding the $C^0$-structure which in particular entails its rigidity for ''strongly spherically symmetric'' continuous extensions across the Cauchy horizon of the Reissner-Nordström spacetime. Secondly, we construct continuous extensions which have the same $C^0$-structure, but do not have equivalent $C^1$-structures. This construction also carries over to weak null singularities in 3+1 dimensions. Understanding the uniqueness properties of continuous spacetime extensions to the boundary is of importance for the study of low-regularity inextendibility problems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study Einstein-Maxwell (non-null) sourcefree configurations that can be extended to any conformally invariant non-linear electrodynamics (CINLE) by a constant rescaling of the electromagnetic field. We first obtain a criterion which characterizes such extendable solutions in terms either of the electromagnetic invariants, or (equivalently) of the canonical Newman-Penrose form of the self-dual Maxwell field. This is then used to argue that all static configurations are extendable (more generally, all configurations admitting a non-null twistfree Killing vector field). One can thus draw from the extensive literature to straightforwardly extend to CINLE various known exact solutions, whereby the duality invariance of the Einstein-Maxwell theory allows for dyonic solutions even in more general theories. This is illustrated by a few explicit examples, including the homogeneous $Λ<0$ universe of Ozsváth, a black hole in the universe of Levi-Civita, Bertotti and Robinson, a generalization of the charged $C$-metric, and non-expanding gravitational waves in the Bonnor-Melvin background.

Abstract: In this article we investigate the properties of the asymptotically Schwarzschild-like metric as an alternative to the Schwarzschild solution in General Relativity. While asymptotically flat and similar to Schwarzschild at large distances $r$, this metric exhibits a fundamentally different strong-field behavior: it lacks an event horizon and is best interpreted as a traversable wormhole or a black hole surrounded by a specific anisotropic fluid, rather than a true vacuum solution. We analyze key phenomenological features, demonstrating significant deviations from Schwarzschild in the radii of the photon sphere and the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO). Furthermore, we derive the Regge-Wheeler equation for gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations and compute the black hole shadow, providing a direct comparison with the Schwarzschild metric. Despite being ruled out by solar system tests, the exponential metric remains relevant for theories beyond standard GR, regular black hole models, and its connection to screened Yukawa potentials.

Motivation:  the paper builds on prior work in gauge theories of gravity, aiming to generalize and unify different approaches. it uses nonlinear gauge symmetries to achieve local lorentz invariance and introduces projective geometric fields to describe spinor matter.

Method:  the paper is divided into three parts. part i reviews general relativity, metric-affine gauge theory, and tw gravity. part ii constructs a gauge gravitational theory using the projective general linear group, defines tst connections, and generalizes to non-inertial frames. it introduces projective higgs fields and a Lovelock-inspired action. part iii formulates projective spinors with a complex phase redundancy, leading to a chiral mass term.

Conclusion:  the paper successfully unifies various gravity theories under a projective framework and applies it to spinors to derive a novel mechanism for chiral mass generation. the approach introduces novel geometric fields and modifies the dynamics of spinor matter, potentially useful for understanding gravitational interactions with matter in a unified way.

Abstract: We develop a generalized projective gauge theory of gravity and spinorial matter, incorporating both non-metricity and torsion. The work is divided into three parts. Part I provides a thorough review of General Relativity, Metric-Affine gauge theory and Thomas-Whitehead (TW) Gravity. Part II constructs a gauge gravitational theory based on the Projective General Linear Group, wherein the newly found projective symmetric teleparallel (PST) connections are defined. Generalizing to non-inertial frames, and using nonlinear gauge symmetry realizations to implement local Lorentz symmetry, we construct a general geometric framework that unifies TW and Metric-Affine gravity with projectively invariant spacetime torsion. We introduce projective generalized Higgs fields and show how certain gauge choices reduce these to fundamental projective fields, and how they may be used to define fundamental geometric objects such as the projective 2-frame and spacetime connection. A Lovelock-inspired action is shown to support only curvature (metric) dynamics, implying a topologically constrained Schouten field via the Pontrjagin density. The projective Pontrjagin density is shown to contain a new topological invariant, not present in the literature. Part III formulates projective spinors by defining gamma matrices via the projective linear group metric, then employing nonlinear gauge symmetry realizations to ensure local Lorentz covariance. A general spinor metric introduces a complex phase of redundancy. Requiring a real, Hermitian action leads to a projective Einstein-Cartan-type theory. An induced chiral mass emerges without CP violation.

Abstract: We extend previous metric-based Schwarzschild studies of gravitational--electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman--Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime. Within a minimally coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we derive explicit quadratic electromagnetic source terms for the spin-$-2$ Teukolsky equation, providing a foundation for future numerical studies of GEM interactions in the framework of black-hole spectroscopy. Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.

Motivation: 研究微分方程的解法及其变换方法具有重要意义，特别是在非线性系统中，寻找有效的变换和解法可以揭示系统的内在性质和行为。本文通过推广Sundman变换，提供了处理非线性Schrödinger方程中解族的新工具。

Method: 本文采用了一种系统的推广方法：将经典的Sundman变换扩展到不仅考虑函数的幂次，还考虑其导数的幂次，并引入了其逆变换。通过这样的扩展，可以进一步探讨变换的组合及其在不同参数下的应用效果。特别是在NRT方程中，通过参数q的变换，可以简化和推广现有的Lorentzian解，从而揭示非线性行为的本质。

Result: 在应用变换于NRT非线性Schrödinger方程后，得到了Lorentzian孤立波解的显式表达式，并通过不同的q值实现了解的性质的平移变换。同时，发现部分变换族具有群结构，进一步展示了变换的内在对称性和复杂性。这些结果为求解非线性微分方程提供了一种新的视角和方法。

Conclusion: 本文的研究为非线性微分方程的解法和性质分析提供了新的思路。通过推广Sundman变换，不仅简化了求解过程，还揭示了非线性参数对解的影响机制，为理解非线性系统的动态行为提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We present a new generalization of the well-known power-type Sundman transformation, involving not only powers of the function but also of its derivative, along with its inverse. Our aim is to explore the use of such transformations in the derivation of solutions of ordinary differential equations and in the study of their properties. We then show their usefulness in the framework of the nonlinear Nobre--Reigo-Monteiro--Tsallis (NRT) nonlinear Schrödinger equation. More precisely, we employ them to analyze a family of ordinary differential equations which includes the Lorentzian solutions of the NRT-nonlinear Schrödinger equation for a constant potential. Moreover, an explicit expression for the Lorentzian solitary wave solutions is given, for any real value of the non-linearity parameter q, in terms of a transformation depending on q applied to the classical Lorentzian solution with q = 1, i.e., we succeed in encapsulating the whole nonlinear behavior in the new transformations. In addition, the composition of this transformation with its inverse (with different parameters) allows us to perform a shift in the nonlinearity parameter q. Moreover, a certain subfamily of our generalized transformations, which perform a shift on the non-linearity parameter q of the Lorentzian solutions, is found to have a group structure. The same subfamily of transformations allows us, again, to perform a shift in the non-linearity parameter q, but in this case in the traveling wave solution for a free particle.

Abstract: It is well-known that for any wave function $ψ(x,z)$ of the KP Hierarchy, there is another wave function called its ``adjoint'' such that the path integral of their product with respect to $z$ around any sufficiently large closed path is zero. For the wave functions in the adelic Grassmannian $Gr^{ad}$, the bispectral involution which exchanges the role of $x$ and $z$ implies also the existence of an ``$x$-adjoint wave function'' $ψ^{\star}(x,z)$ so that the product of the wave function, the $x$-adjoint, and the Hermite weight $e^{-x^2/2}$ has no residue. Utilizing this, we show that the sequences of coefficient functions in the power series expansion of any KP wave function in $Gr^{ad}$ and its image under the bispectral involution at $t_2=-1/2$ are always ``almost bi-orthogonal'' with respect to the Hermite product. Whether the sequences have the stronger properties of being (almost) orthogonal can be determined easily in terms of KP flows and the bispectral involution. As a special case, the Exceptional Hermite Orthogonal Polynomials can be recovered in this way. This provides both a generalization of and an explanation of the fact that the generating functions of the Exceptional Hermites are certain special wave functions of the KP Hierarchy. In addition, one new surprise is that the same KP Wave Function which generates the sequences of functions is also a generating function for the norms when evaluated at $t_1=1$ and $t_2=0$. The main results are proved using Calogero-Moser matrices satisfying a rank one condition. The same results also apply in the case of ``spin-generalized'' Calogero-Moser matrices, which produce instances of matrix orthogonality.
