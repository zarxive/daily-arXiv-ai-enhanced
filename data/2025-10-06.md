Abstract: Optical non-reciprocity is a fundamental phenomenon in photonics. It is
crucial for developing devices that rely on directional signal control, such as
optical isolators and circulators. However, most research in this field has
focused on systems in equilibrium or steady states. In this work, we
demonstrate a room-temperature Rydberg atomic platform where the unidirectional
propagation of light acts as a switch to mediate time-crystalline-like
collective oscillations through atomic synchronization. We find that
thermal-motion-induced coupling asymmetry, enabled by counterpropagating probe
and control fields, generates persistent oscillations; conversely,
co-propagation quenches this effect. We identify, through both numerical and
analytical approaches, the criteria for realizing optical non-reciprocity
within a synchronization regime. These results provide key insights for chiral
quantum optics and promote the on-chip integration of non-reciprocal devices in
nonequilibrium many-body systems.

### [2] [Simple Quantum Algorithm for Approximate $k$-Mismatch Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02399)
*Ruhan Habib*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper describes a quantum algorithm for approximate k-mismatch comparison with a time complexity of O(ϵ⁻¹√(mn/k)).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to present a novel quantum approach to the k-mismatch problem, which is a fundamental challenge in string processing.

Method: The authors propose a quantum algorithm that identifies substrings within an approximate Hamming distance.

Result: The algorithm achieves a time complexity of O(ϵ⁻¹√(mn/k)) for approximate k-mismatch detection.

Conclusion: This study contributes quantum methods to handle the k-mismatch problem efficiently.

Abstract: In the $k$-mismatch problem, given a pattern and a text of length $n$ and $m$
respectively, we have to find if the text has a sub-string with a Hamming
distance of at most $k$ from the pattern. This has been studied in the
classical setting since 1982 and recently in the quantum computational setting
by Jin and Nogler and Kociumaka, Nogler, and Wellnitz. We provide a simple
quantum algorithm that solves the problem in an approximate manner, given a
parameter $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$. It returns an occurrence as a match only if it
is a $\left(1+\epsilon\right)k$-mismatch. If it does not return any occurrence,
then there is no $k$-mismatch. This algorithm has a time (size) complexity of
$\tilde{O}\left( \epsilon^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{mn}{k}} \right)$.

### [3] [Probability distributions over CSS codes: two-universality, QKD hashing, collision bounds, security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02402)
*Pete Rigas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces new probability distributions for CSS codes, enhancing quantum computation fidelity and security in quantum key distribution. Two-universal hashing protocols, based on parity check matrices' structures, are simplified, improving unconditional security. The security gap between protocols is a factor of $2^{rac{5}{2}(5 - rac{3}{2}) + rac{1}{2}m{log}_2 C}$ for some positive $C$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on advancing quantum error correction codes, specifically CSS codes, to improve quantum computation and key distribution security. By introducing novel probability distributions and analyzing two-universal hashing protocols, the authors aim to simplify complex quantum operations for enhanced unconditional security in quantum phases of computation.

Method: The authors employ probability theory, random matrix theory, and quantum information theory to analyze the probability distributions and hashing protocols. They utilize isometries for efficient computations involving parity check matrices and derive collision bounds to assess protocol security.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the security of the two-universal hashing protocol is significantly enhanced, with the security gap quantified as a factor of $2^{rac{5}{2}(5 - rac{3}{2}) + rac{1}{2}m{log}_2 C}$ for some positive constant $C$. This result provides a clear measure of the protocol's improved security.

Conclusion: The research advances the understanding of CSS codes and two-universal hashing in quantum key distribution, offering a quantifiable improvement in security through the analysis of parity check matrices and their probabilistic properties.

Abstract: We characterize novel probability distributions for CSS codes. Such classes
of error correcting codes, originally introduced by Calderbank, Shor, and
Steane, are of great significance in advancing the fidelity of Quantum
computation, with implications for future near term applications. Within the
context of Quantum key distribution, such codes, as examined by Ostrev in
arXiv: 2109.06709 along with two-universal hashing protocols, have greatly
simplified Quantum phases of computation for unconditional security. To further
examine novel applications of two-universal hashing protocols, particularly
through the structure of parity check matrices, we demonstrate how being able
to efficiently compute functions of the parity check matrices relates to
marginals of a suitably defined probability measure supported over random
matrices. The security of the two-universal QKD hashing protocol will be shown
to depend upon the computation of purified states of random matrices, which
relates to probabilistic collision bounds between two hashing functions.
Central to our approach are the introduction of novel real, simulator, and
ideal, isometries, hence allowing for efficient computations of functions of
the two parity check matrices. As a result of being able to perform such
computations involving parity check matrices, the security of the two-universal
hashing protocol is a factor of $2^{ \frac{5}{2} ( 5 - \frac{3}{2} ) +
\mathrm{log}_2 \sqrt{C}}$ less secure, for some strictly positive constant $C$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spectroscopy is the most important method for probing the structure of
molecules. However, predicting molecular spectra on classical computers is
computationally expensive, with the most accurate methods having a cost that
grows exponentially with molecule size. Quantum computers have been shown to
simulate simple types of optical spectroscopy efficiently -- with a cost
polynomial in molecule size -- using methods such as time-dependent simulations
of photoinduced wavepackets. Here, we show that any type of spectroscopy can be
efficiently simulated on a quantum computer using a time-domain approach,
including spectroscopies of any order, any frequency range, and involving both
electric and magnetic transitions. Our method works by computing any
spectroscopic correlation function based on the corresponding double-sided
Feynman diagram, the canonical description of spectroscopic interactions. The
approach can be used to simulate spectroscopy of both closed and open molecular
systems using both digital and analog quantum computers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Czachor's model of hierarchical arithmetics begins with a valid formal
premise but fixes the key probability mapping g by importing the Born rule and
Fubini-Study metric from standard quantum mechanics, where Born probabilities
are Kolmogorov within a fixed measurement context. This g is then applied in a
non-Newtonian hidden-variable setting, producing a hybrid framework whose
agreement with quantum correlations is built in by design, not derived from new
physics, and thus does not constitute a genuine counterexample to Bell's
theorem

Conclusion: 该方法有效应对了大型量子体系的模拟挑战，证明了对量子计算资源的适应能力，以及在量子计算中的潜在应用。

Abstract: We use Pauli Path simulation to variationally obtain parametrized circuits
for preparing ground states of various quantum many-body Hamiltonians. These
include the quantum Ising model in one dimension, in two dimensions on square
and heavy-hex lattices, and the Kitaev honeycomb model, all at system sizes of
one hundred qubits or more, beyond the reach of exact state-vector simulation,
thereby reaching utility scale. We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results
against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix
renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To
further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the
magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and
compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model.
Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model
with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System
Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path
simulation. We achieve a relative energy error of approximately $5\%$ without
error mitigation and demonstrate the braiding of Abelian anyons on the quantum
device beyond fixed-point models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算在现代科技和工业应用中的重要性日益增长，提升计算效率对研究者和产业界极具吸引力。

Method: 主要采用了离散变量子算法，利用双谱相移器限制，解决了计算资源分配问题。

Result: 该方法在计算成本、收敛速度和资源效率方面相比现有最优方法都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种高效的新量子算法设计方法，将对量子计算领域产生深远影响。

Abstract: We demonstrate a significant speedup of variational quantum algorithms that
use discrete variable boson sampling when the parametrised phase shifters are
constrained to have two distinct eigenvalues. This results in a cost landscape
with less local minima and barren plateaus regardless of the problem, ansatz or
circuit layout. This works without reliance on any classical pre-processing and
allows for the fast gradient-free Rotosolve algorithm to be used. We propose
three ways to achieve this by using either non-linear optics,
measurement-induced non-linearities, or entangled resource states simulating
fermionic statistics. The latter two require linear optics only, allowing for
implementation with widely-available technology today. We show this outperforms
the best-known boson sampling variational algorithm for all tests we conducted.

Abstract: Efficient characterization of noise during quantum gate operations is an
essential step to building and scaling up a quantum computer. One such protocol
is averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES) which efficiently characterizes
a noisy gate set by reconstructing a Pauli noise model for a each gate. Here we
utilize the ACES protocol to characterize two coupled superconducting qubits.
For accurate reconstruction, we tailor the noise via Pauli twirling and account
for measurement errors. We verify the accuracy of the protocol by comparing the
predicted gate fidelities to that extracted from conventional benchmarking
approaches, such as interleaved randomized benchmarking. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the efficacy of ACES in accurately identifying specific noise
sources by reconstructing injected phase errors in the two-qubit gates.

### [9] [Computational access to lattice and long-wavelength physics in quantum mutual information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02466)
*Patrick M. Lenggenhager,M. Michael Denner,Doruk Efe Gökmen,Maciej Koch-Janusz,Titus Neupert,Mark H. Fischer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum mutual information is essential for understanding quantum many-body systems but is computationally expensive. Some variants of R\'enyi Mutual Information (RMI) are more tractable, but it's unclear if they accurately capture long-wavelength physics or are dominated by UV effects. This study examines lattice effects on R\'enyi mutual information for ground states described by conformal field theory. Using massless free fermions as an example and MPS calculations on the transverse field Ising model, the research identifies regions in the α-z plane where lattice corrections are significant or negligible. The findings are supported by the open-source Julia package QMICalc.jl, which aids in applying RMI to quantum many-body physics numerical computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems is a fundamental challenge in modern physics. Mutual information, including R\'enyi Mutual Information (RMI), is a key tool for characterizing correlations in these systems. However, the computational cost of calculating RMI often makes it impractical for large-scale simulations, particularly for lattice models. This paper addresses the critical issue of whether different variants of RMI can reliably capture the long-wavelength physics or are predominantly influenced by short-range (UV) effects, which is crucial for performing accurate lattice simulations. By analyzing specific models like massless free fermions and the transverse field Ising model, the research aims to provide insights into the applicability of RMI in numerical computations for quantum many-body physics. The open-source package QMICalc.jl developed in this study further enhances its utility for researchers in this field.

Method: The research employs a combination of analytical and numerical methods. First, the theoretical framework is established by examining the properties of R\'enyi mutual information in the context of conformal field theory (CFT), which describes the long-wavelength behavior of critical systems. The study then leverages numerical methods, specifically Matrix Product State (MPS) techniques, to perform calculations on the transverse field Ising model (TFIM), a lattice model known for its phase transition and critical behavior. By comparing analytical predictions with numerical results obtained from MPS calculations, the researchers can validate the theoretical findings and assess the impact of lattice effects across different parameter regions in the α-z plane. The Julia package QMICalc.jl is also developed as an open-source tool to facilitate the computation and analysis of RMI for researchers.

Result: The study reveals that lattice effects significantly influence R\'enyi mutual information in certain regions of the α-z parameter space. Specifically, for massless free fermions, the R\'enyi mutual information shows distinct corrections due to the lattice structure depending on the values of α and z. Similarly, MPS calculations on the TFIM confirm that lattice artifacts can either dominate or be negligible in different regions of the α-z plane. These findings provide a clear understanding of when R\'enyi mutual information can be trusted to capture long-wavelength physics or when its lattice corrections must be carefully considered. The open-source Julia package QMICalc.jl further supports practical implementation and application of these methods in quantum many-body physics research.

Conclusion: This paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of R\'enyi mutual information in quantum many-body systems by systematically analyzing its behavior in the presence of lattice effects. The identification of regions where lattice corrections are relevant or irrelevant enhances the applicability of RMI in numerical computations. The provided Julia package QMICalc.jl empowers researchers to apply these methods effectively. The study not only advances theoretical knowledge but also provides practical tools and insights that can be used in future research on quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Quantum mutual information is an important tool for characterizing
correlations in quantum many-body systems, but its numerical evaluation is
often prohibitively expensive. While some variants of R\'enyi Mutual
Information (RMI) are computationally more tractable, it is not clear whether
they correctly capture the long-wavelength physics or are dominated by UV
effects, which is of key importance in lattice simulations. We analyze the
relevance of lattice effects on the family of $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi mutual
informations for ground states of models with conformal field theory
descriptions. On the example of massless free fermions we identify distinct
regions in the $\alpha$-$z$ plane, where RMI corrections due to the lattice are
relevant or irrelevant. We further support these findings with MPS calculations
on the transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Our results, accompanied by the
open-source Julia package QMICalc.jl, provide guidance to using RMI in
quantum-many body physics numerical computations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a class of time-dependent (TD) non-Hermitian Hamiltonians $H(t)$
that can be transformed into a time-independent pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian
$\mathcal{H}_{0}^{PH}$ using a suitable TD unitary transformation $F(t)$. The
latter can in turn be related to a Hermitian Hamiltonian $h$ by a similarity
transformation, $h=\rho \mathcal{H}_{0}^{PH} \rho^{-1}$ where $\rho$ is the
Dyson map. Accordingly, once the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the Hermitian
Hamiltonian $h$ is solved, the general solution of the initial system can be
deduced. This allows to define the appropriate $\tilde{\eta}(t)$-inner product
for the Hilbert space associated with $H(t)$, where
$\tilde{\eta}(t)=F^{\dagger}(t)\eta F(t)$ and $\eta=\rho^{\dagger}\rho$ is the
metric operator. This greatly simplifies the computation of the relevant
uncertainty relations for these systems. As an example, we consider a model of
a particle with a TD mass subjected to a specific TD complex linear potential.
We thus obtain two Hermitian Hamiltonians, namely that of the standard harmonic
oscillator and that of the inverted oscillator. For both cases, the auxiliary
equation admits a solution, and the exact analytical solutions are squeezed
states given in terms of the Hermite polynomials with complex coefficients.
Moreover, when the Hermitian Hamiltonian is that of the harmonic oscillator,
the position-momentum uncertainty relation is real and greater than or equal to
$\hbar/2$, thereby confirming its consistency.

TL;DR: Introducing HATTRIQ, a quantum machine learning framework that computes amplitude-based input attribution scores for circuit-based models, enabling faithful explanations of quantum machine learning outputs by leveraging quantum hardware capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretability in quantum machine learning models, particularly due to the challenges posed by quantum state evolution and the limitations of classical interpretability methods.

Method: HATTRIQ framework incorporates a Hadamard test-based construction to directly compute input gradients on quantum hardware, supporting input amplitude embedding feature encoding for fair and accurate model explanations.

Result: HATTRIQ has been validated on classification tasks for datasets such as Bars and Stripes, MNIST, and FashionMNIST, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing interpretable explanations of quantum machine learning models.

Conclusion: HATTRIQ addresses a critical gap in the interpretability of quantum machine learning models, potentially enhancing trust and application of QML across diverse platforms.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms have demonstrated early promise
across hardware platforms, but remain difficult to interpret due to the
inherent opacity of quantum state evolution. Widely used classical
interpretability methods, such as integrated gradients and surrogate-based
sensitivity analysis, are not directly compatible with quantum circuits due to
measurement collapse and the exponential complexity of simulating state
evolution. In this work, we introduce HATTRIQ, a general-purpose framework to
compute amplitude-based input attribution scores in circuit-based QML models.
HATTRIQ supports the widely-used input amplitude embedding feature encoding
scheme and uses a Hadamard test-based construction to compute input gradients
directly on quantum hardware to generate provably faithful attributions. We
validate HATTRIQ on classification tasks across several datasets (Bars and
Stripes, MNIST, and FashionMNIST).

TL;DR: The paper addresses the incoherence and quantitative problems in probability within the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics by proposing a self-locating, time-extended probability approach. It argues that the Born rule's mathematical form, found in a time-extended wavefunction, can serve as a foundation for quantum probability and presents a time-symmetric interpretation using the Fixed Point Formulation with an Everetian framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve fundamental issues in quantum probability interpretation within the many-worlds framework.

Method: Examines various probability theories, discusses incoherence and quantitative problems, proposes self-locating probabilities, argues against existing solutions, and suggests a time-symmetric approach using the Fixed Point Formulation.

Result: Suggests a solution to the problems in the many-worlds interpretation by proposing self-locating probabilities derived from the Born rule and supports this with a time-symmetric Everettian framework.

Conclusion: Presents a novel approach to quantum probability within the many-worlds framework, suggesting that self-locating probabilities based on the Born rule and a time-symmetric interpretation provide a coherent foundation for quantum probability theory

Abstract: Recent accounts of probability in the many worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics are vulnerable due to their dependence on probability theory per se.
For this reason, the many worlds interpretation continues to suffer from the
incoherence and quantitative problems. After discussing various theories of
probability, I discuss the incoherence problem and argue that self-locating
probabilities centered in time-extended worlds can solve it. I then discuss and
refute various solutions to the quantitative problem. I argue that the only
tenable way to ground these self-locating probabilities is to identify the
mathematical form of the Born rule as a generic pattern in a time-extended
wavefunction, and to distribute degrees of belief over the region of
wavefunction occupied by this pattern. I then outline a time-symmetric version
of quantum mechanics - the Fixed Point Formulation - which, interpreted within
a time-symmetric Everettian framework, can provide the foundation for a theory
of quantum probability.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a programmable photonic circuit that simulates nonunitary quantum systems, showing how loss can be controlled using ancilla modes to perform quantum operations like coherent absorption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on non-Hermitian quantum systems, which are essential for manipulating quantum states in lossy environments. The motivation is likely to develop practical applications for quantum technologies that rely on engineered loss.

Method: The researchers used a programmable integrated linear photonic circuit with loss introduced through coupling to an ancilla mode. They probed the circuit with single-photon and two-photon states to observe tunability and absorption effects.

Result: The results show that the circuit can simulate coherent absorption with control over transmission and absorption. They observed nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, and their Fisher information analysis exceeded the shot-noise limit and approached the Heisenberg limit.

Conclusion: This experiment highlights the potential of photonic circuits for programmable quantum state engineering and nonunitary quantum simulation, with implications for quantum filtering and multiplexed sensing.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, governed by nonunitary evolution, offer
powerful tools for manipulating quantum states through engineered loss. A prime
example is coherent absorption, where quantum states undergo phase-dependent
partial or complete absorption in a lossy medium. Here, we demonstrate a fully
programmable implementation of nonunitary transformations that emulate coherent
absorption of quantum light using a programmable integrated linear photonic
circuit, with loss introduced via coupling to an ancilla mode [Phys. Rev. X 8,
021017; 2018]. Probing the circuit with a single-photon dual-rail state reveals
phase-controlled coherent tunability between perfect transmission and perfect
absorption. A two-photon NOON state input, by contrast, exhibits switching
between deterministic single-photon and probabilistic two-photon absorption.
Across a range of input phases and circuit configurations, we observe
nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, along with
continuous and coherent tuning of output Fock state probability amplitudes.
Classical Fisher information analysis reveals phase sensitivity peaks of 0.79
for single-photon states and 3.7 for NOON states, exceeding the shot-noise
limit of 2 and approaching the Heisenberg limit of 4. The experiment integrates
quantum state generation, programmable photonic circuitry, and
photon-number-resolving detection, establishing ancilla-assisted circuits as
powerful tools for programmable quantum state engineering, filtering,
multiplexed sensing, and nonunitary quantum simulation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Optical non-reciprocity, a phenomenon that allows unidirectional flow of
optical field is pivoted on the time reversal symmetry breaking. The symmetry
breaking happens in the cavity optomechanical system (COS) due to non uniform
radiation pressure as a result of light-matter interaction, and is crucial in
building non-reciprocal optical devices. In our proposed COS, we study the
non-reciprocal transport of optical signals across two ports via three optical
modes optomechanically coupled to the mechanical excitations of two
nano-mechanical resonators (NMRs) under the influence of strong classical drive
fields and weak probe fields. By tuning different system parameters, we
discover the conversion of reciprocal to non-reciprocal signal transmission. We
reveal perfect nonreciprocal transmission of output fields when the effective
cavity detuning parameters are near resonant to the NMRs' frequencies. The
unidirectional non-reciprocal signal transport is robust to the optomechanical
coupling parameters at resonance conditions. Moreover, the cavities' photon
loss rates play an inevitable role in the unidirectional flow of signal across
the two ports. Bidirectional transmission can be fully controlled by the phase
changes associated with the incoming probe and drive fields via two ports. Our
scheme may provide a foundation for the compact non-reciprocal communication
and quantum information processing, thus enabling new devices that route
photons in unconventional ways such as all-optical diodes, optical transistors
and optical switches.

Abstract: Carbon capture is vital for decarbonizing heavy industries such as steel and
chemicals. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high surface area and
structural tunability, are promising materials for CO2 capture. This study
focuses on Fe-MOF-74, a magnetic Mott insulator with exposed metal sites that
enhance CO2 adsorption. Its strongly correlated electronic structure challenges
standard DFT methods, which often yield inconsistent predictions. We initially
benchmark adsorption energies using various DFT functionals, revealing
substantial variability and underscoring the need for more accurate approaches,
such as those provided by quantum computing. However, practical quantum
algorithms are far less established for simulations of periodic materials,
particularly when the plane-wave basis set, often comprising tens of thousands
of basis vectors, is used. To address this, we employ an active space reduction
strategy based on Wannier functions and natural orbital selection. Localized
orbitals around the adsorption site are identified, and MP2 natural orbitals
are used to improve convergence of correlation energies. Adsorption energies
are then computed using a quantum number-preserving ansatz within the
variational quantum eigensolver framework. In addition to classical
simulations, we conduct quantum experiments using the sample-based quantum
diagonalization method. Although current hardware limits the size of feasible
simulations, our approach offers a more efficient and scalable path forward.
These results advance the applicability of quantum algorithms to realistic
models of carbon capture and periodic materials more broadly.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Electron shuttling is key for quantum computing scalability, but disorder limits fidelities. A multiscale simulation shows interface roughness heavily suppresses fidelities, with a sharp anomaly at the atomic layer scale, providing guidelines for scalable electron shuttling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to ensure the scalability of silicon spin-qubit quantum computing, which relies heavily on electron shuttling mechanisms. Achieving high fidelities in electron shuttling is crucial due to challenges like atomistic disorder, and this research provides insights into optimizing the process.

Method: The study employs a multiscale simulation framework combining time-dependent finite-element electrostatics and atomistic tight-binding methods. This integrative approach allows for the comprehensive analysis of factors such as random alloying and interface roughness, which are critical in determining the fidelity of electron shuttling.

Result: The key finding is that interface roughness significantly impacts the fidelity of electron shuttling, with a critical anomaly observed near the atomic-layer scale. This result underscores the importance of controlling interface roughness in materials design to achieve scalable and reliable electron shuttling.

Conclusion: This research provides essential guidelines for designing systems with scalable electron shuttling by addressing the limitations imposed by interface roughness and atomistic disorder. The findings contribute to advancing quantum computing technologies by addressing critical design challenges.

Abstract: Electron shuttling is emerging as a key enabler of scalable silicon
spin-qubit quantum computing, but fidelities are limited by atomistic disorder.
We introduce a multiscale simulation framework combining time-dependent
finite-element electrostatics and atomistic tight-binding to capture the impact
of random alloying and interface roughness on the valley splitting and phase of
shuttled electrons. We find that shuttling fidelities are strongly suppressed
by interface roughness, with a sharp anomaly near the atomic-layer scale,
setting quantitative guidelines to realize scalable shuttling.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate entanglement sharing in a two-qubit sequential measurement
scenario using three complementary classical correlation metrics: mutual
information (I), sum of conditional probabilities (S), and the Pearson
correlation coefficient (C). By investigating both weak measurement and
probabilistic projective measurement (PPM) strategies in unilateral and
bilateral scenarios, the phenomenon of entanglement sharing is conclusively
certified when multiple pairs of classical correlation metrics simultaneously
exceed their thresholds. Our investigation reveals that weak measurement
strategies are more favorable than PPM for exhibiting entanglement sharing,
regardless of the scenario. Furthermore, the mutual information criterion fails
to characterize entanglement sharing in the bilateral scenario. While, the
Pearson correlation criterion (C) is proven to be the most robust across all
strategies and scenarios. These findings unveil a critical trade-off between
measurement disturbance and complementary correlation recovery, which is
essential for quantum resource reuse problems.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum information
science and a crucial resource for quantum technologies such as precision
sensing, secure communication, and computation. In hybrid cavity
magno-optomechanical systems, entanglement among cavity photons, magnons, and
phonons enables manipulation of quantum states across different modes via
radiation pressure-based light-matter interaction. We propose a hybrid
optomechanical cavity-magnonic setup with Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere
allowing magnons to couple with photons via magnetic-dipole interaction. The
system also uses optomechanical and electrostatic interactions to entangle
cavity photons and mechanical resonators. We focus on how the magnon nonlinear
Kerr effect and varying coupling strengths influence entanglement dynamics. By
analysing nonlinear effects alongside other coupling parameters, we identify
optimal conditions for initiating and sustaining robust entanglement between
the motional modes (phonons) of two Coulomb-coupled mechanical resonators. Our
model predicts that adding Coulomb interaction and magnon coupling enhances the
degree and tunability of entanglement, making it more resilient to thermal
baths at 3 K. This study addresses how to optimize and sustain phonon-phonon
entanglement in complex hybrid quantum systems. These findings offer insights
relevant to developing quantum memories for continuous variable quantum
information processing and other quantum technologies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rising interest in quantum-level communication has resulted in proposals
for coexistence schemes with classical signals within the same fiber optic
channel, where the most recent proposals leverage novel fibers designed for
space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission. In all cases the large power
difference between classical and quantum channels presents challenges for such
schemes, as the classical signals generate interfering noise that corrupts the
quantum signal. In this work, we discuss the main interference mechanisms in
coexistence scenarios and provide a model to quantify their impact on the
quantum signal quality. Analytical approximations in the model allow accurate
and fast numerical solutions in the millisecond time-scale. The model accounts
for out-of-band non-linear interference effects, namely spontaneous Raman
scattering (SpRS) and four-wave-mixing (FWM) in both cases of single-mode and
SDM fibers with weakly-coupled degenerate mode groups. Rayleigh and SpRS
backscattering are considered in counter-propagating scenarios. Since broadband
classical transmission is targeted, the model also accounts for the effect of
stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)-induced power tilt. Use of the model in
sample scenarios indicates that the interference noise power is minimized at
the high end of the transmission band in both cases were the quantum is co- and
counter-propagating with respect to the classical signals, with a preference of
one or the other scheme depending on the link length and quantum signal center
frequency. Our model reveals that FWM has negligible impact in
counter-propagating schemes, but can be relevant in co-propagating schemes
under certain scenarios. Nevertheless, the FWM interference can be mitigated by
deallocating the classical signals adjacent to the quantum channel.

Motivation: 提出将信息论与量子力学相结合的概念，挑战传统量子理论的连续假设，探讨其对物理基础和计算能力的影响。

Method: 运用数学物理方法，将 Hilbert 空间离散化，引入 qubit 信息容量的概念，结合引力理论估算 N_max 值。

Result: 计算得出 N_max 约为 500-1000，而传统量子理论中 N_max 为无穷大，预测量子计算机的加速会在超过约 1000 个量子位后停止。

Conclusion: 有限的 qubit 信息容量将导致传统量子计算方法的失效，预示着一场关于量子理论重构的概念革命。

Abstract: Motivated by John Wheeler's assertion that the continuum nature of Hilbert
Space conceals the information-theoretic nature of the quantum wavefunction, a
specific discretisation of complex Hilbert Space is proposed, leading to the
notion of qubit information capacity $N_{\mathrm{max}}$: for any $N \ge
N_{\mathrm{max}}$-qubit state, there is insufficient information in the $N$
qubits to allocate even one bit to each of the $2^{N+1}-2$ degrees of freedom
demanded by complex Hilbert Space and hence unitary quantum mechanics. Using
gravitised quantum mechanics, it is estimated that, for typical qubits in a
quantum computer, $N_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 500-1,000$. By contrast,
$N_{\mathrm{max}}=\infty$ in quantum mechanics. On this basis, it is predicted
that the exponential speed up of algorithms such as Shor's will have saturated
in quantum computers which use more than about 1,000 logical qubits. This
predicted breakdown of quantum mechanics should be testable within the coming
decade. If verified, factoring 2048-RSA integers using quantum computers will
for all practical purposes be impossible. The existence of a finite qubit
information capacity has profound implications for reimagining the foundations
of quantum physics (including the measurement problem, complementarity and
nonlocality) and for developing novel theories which synthesise quantum and
gravitational physics.

Abstract: We address the problem of constructing fully universal private channel coding
protocols for classical-quantum (c-q) channels. Previous work constructed
universal decoding strategies, but the encoder relied on random coding, which
prevents fully universal code construction. In this work, we resolve this gap
by identifying an explicit structural property of codebooks -- namely, the
spectral expansion of an associated Schreier graph -- that guarantees universal
channel resolvability. Our analysis reveals how this property can be related to
channel resolvability through the theory of induced representation. Our main
technical result shows that when the transition matrix of a graph associated
with a codebook has a large spectral gap, the channel output induced by
uniformly sampled codewords is asymptotically indistinguishable from the target
output distribution, independently of the channel. This establishes the first
deterministic, channel-independent construction of resolvability codebooks.
  Building on this, we construct a fully universal private channel coding
protocol by combining it with universal c-q channel coding based on the
Schur-Weyl duality. With appropriate modifications to the requirements on
codebooks of universal c-q channel coding, we show that our fully universal
private channel coding achieves the known optimal rate. This work thus sheds
new light on the expander property of a graph in the context of secure
communication.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) and QAOA are promising quantum optimisation algorithms
used for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial problems on near-term
NISQ systems. Many NP-hard problems can be reformulated as Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO), which maps naturally onto quantum
Hamiltonians. However, the limited qubit counts of current NISQ devices
restrict practical deployment of such algorithms. In this study, we present the
Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework (HADOF), which leverages
an iterative strategy to automatically divide the Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimisation (QUBO) Hamiltonian into sub-Hamiltonians which can be
optimised separately using Hamiltonian based optimisers such as QAOA, QA or
Simulated Annealing (SA) and aggregated into a global solution. We compare
HADOF with Simulated Annealing (SA) and the CPLEX exact solver, showing
scalability to problem sizes far exceeding available qubits while maintaining
competitive accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we realise HADOF for a toy
problem on an IBM quantum computer, showing promise for practical applications
of quantum optimisation.

Abstract: We present a modular atom-array quantum computing architecture with
space-time hybrid multiplexing (MAQCY), a dynamic optical tweezer-based
protocol for fully connected and scalable universal quantum computation. By
extending the concept of globally controlled static dual-species Rydberg atom
wires [1], we develop an entirely new approach using Q-Pairs, which consist of
globally controlled and temporally multiplexed dual-species Rydberg blockaded
atom and superatom pairs. Space-time hybrid multiplexing of Q-Pairs achieves
O(N) linear scaling in the number of required physical qubits, while preserving
coherence and mitigating circuit-depth limitations through in-situ atom
replacement. To demonstrate MAQCY's versatility, we implement a three-qubit
quantum Fourier transform using only global operations and atom transport. We
also propose a concrete implementation using ytterbium isotopes, paving the way
toward large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Boundary time crystals are a class of exotic dissipative quantum phases that
spontaneously break continuous time-translation symmetry in the thermodynamic
limit of open quantum systems. In finite-size systems, the long-time evolution
of boundary time crystals exhibits decaying oscillations that cannot be
captured by widely used mean-field theory. To address this issue, we develop an
effective approach called the stroboscopic rotating wave approximation, which
provides a well approximate state for the long-time evolution of boundary time
crystals under strong driving. In this approach, the order parameter exhibits
both a long-time decaying envelope governed by an effective Lindblad
superoperator and short-time oscillations dominated by a reduced quantum
dynamical semigroup. Our results reveal that the competition among dephasing
processes along three distinct directions induces persistent oscillations,
marking the emergence of the boundary time crystal phase. We obtain the
analytical expressions for the steady-state density operator, the oscillation
period, and the decay rate of the order parameter in the regime where the
coherent energy splitting exceeds the dissipation rate. Our work provides a
beyond-mean-field theoretical tool for studying the dynamics of periodically
driven open quantum systems and understanding the formation of time crystals.

Abstract: Significant efforts are being spent on building a quantum computer. At the
same time, developments in quantum software are rapidly progressing.
Insufficient quantum resources often are the problem when running quantum
algorithms. New techniques can aid in using smaller quantum computers to run
larger quantum algorithms. One of these techniques is circuit cutting. With
this method, a circuit is broken into multiple pieces, each of which is run on
quantum hardware independently and then recombined to obtain the overall
answer. These circuit cutting techniques require additional circuit
evaluations, which can form a bottleneck for algorithms requiring many
interactions. This work explores the potential of circuit cutting techniques
precisely in this regime of many interactions. We consider two different
models, a standard method based on expectation values, and a novel method based
on probability distribution reconstruction. Next, we compare two different
training methods we call train-then-cut and cut-then-train and show that in
practice, cut-then-train still produces good results. This observation brings
closer the practical applicability of circuit cutting techniques, as a
train-then-cut strategy is often infeasible. We conclude by implementing a cut
and uncut circuit and find that circuit cutting helps achieve higher fidelity
results.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates how symmetries affect the efficiency of quantum algorithms for simulating 1+1D lattice models. They create various operator pools that preserve or break certain symmetries (translations, charge conservation, fermionic locality) and find that breaking translation symmetry leads to shallower circuits, which is good for near-term quantum hardware. However, preserving translation symmetry might be better for future, error-corrected devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the need to optimize quantum algorithms for simulation on current and future quantum hardware. Quantum simulations, especially for fermionic systems like the Schwinger model, are resource-intensive. Understanding how symmetries affect the resource requirements can guide the design of more efficient algorithms.

Method: They investigate 11 different operator pools in the lattice Schwinger model, varying which symmetries are preserved or broken. They simulate these pools with different circuit depths and analyze the resulting resource usage.

Result: Breaking translation symmetry leads to shallower circuits, which is beneficial for near-term devices. Preserving translation symmetry could be better for future, error-corrected devices.

Conclusion: The choice of operator pools should depend on the type of quantum device being used. Near-term devices benefit from pools that break translation symmetry, while future error-corrected devices might prefer pools that preserve this symmetry.

Abstract: We investigate the role of symmetries in constructing resource-efficient
operator pools for adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers. In particular, we
focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a discretized model of $1+1$ dimensional
electrodynamics, which we use as a proxy for spin chains with a continuum
limit. We present an extensive set of simulations comprising a total of $11$
different operator pools, which all systematically and independently break or
preserve a combination of discrete translations, the conservation of charge
(magnetization) and the fermionic locality of the excitations. Circuit depths
are the primary bottleneck in current quantum hardware, and we find that the
most efficient ans\"atze in the near-term are obtained by pools that
$\textit{break}$ translation invariance, conserve charge, and lead to shallow
circuits. On the other hand, we anticipate the shot counts to be the limiting
factor in future, error-corrected quantum devices; our findings suggest that
pools $\textit{preserving}$ translation invariance could be preferable for such
platforms.

Abstract: We consider the class of Davies quantum semigroups modelling thermalization

We prove that conditions of Dobrushin-Shlosman-type on the quantum Gibbs state
imply a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with a constant that is uniform
in the system's size. This is accomplished by generalizing parts of the
classical results on thermalization by Stroock, Zegarlinski, Martinelli, and
Olivieri to the CSS quantum setting. The results in particular imply the rapid
thermalization at any positive temperature of the toric code in 2D and the star
part of the toric code in 3D, implying a rapid loss of stored quantum

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Coin-flipping is a fundamental task in two-party cryptography where two
remote mistrustful parties wish to generate a shared uniformly random bit.
While quantum protocols promising near-perfect security exist for weak
coin-flipping -- when the parties want opposing outcomes -- it has been shown
that they must be inefficient in terms of their round complexity, and it is an
open question of how space efficient they can be. In this work, we consider a
variant called cheat-penalised weak coin-flipping in which if a party gets
caught cheating, they lose $\Lambda$ points (compared to $0$ in the standard
definition). We find that already for a small cheating penalty, the landscape
of coin-flipping changes dramatically. For example, with $\Lambda=0.01$, we
exhibit a protocol where neither Alice nor Bob can bias the result in their
favour beyond $1/2 + 10^{-8}$, which uses $24$ qubits and $10^{16}$ rounds of
communication (provably $10^{7}$ times better than any weak coin-flipping
protocol with matching security). For the same space requirements, we
demonstrate how one can choose between lowering how much a malicious party can
bias the result (down to $1/2 + 10^{-10}$) and reducing the rounds of
communication (down to $25,180$), depending on what is preferred. To find these
protocols, we make two technical contributions. First, we extend the point
game-protocol correspondence introduced by Kitaev and Mochon, to incorporate:
(i) approximate point games, (ii) the cheat-penalised setting, and (iii) round
and space complexity. Second, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge)
numerical algorithm for constructing (approximate) point games that correspond
to high security and low complexity. Our results open up the possibility of
having secure and practical quantum protocols for multiparty computation.

Abstract: The emergence of classical world from underlying quantum mechanics is
characterized by not only vanishing quantum correlations but also an unfolding
of objectivity also known as quantum Darwinism. We show that the absence of
this objectivity has a quantum advantage in cryptography and also provides the
crucial missing link in efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits with
zero discord. For this purpose, we consider a model of mixed state quantum
computation where one is promised concordant states at all stages of the
quantum circuit. A concordant quantum state has zero discord with respect to
any part and there exists a basis made up of a tensor product of orthonormal
local subsystem basis in which the density matrix is diagonal. Efficient
classical simulation of concordant computation has surprisingly been an
outstanding question in quantum information theory. We argue that a key
ingredient of an efficient classical simulation algorithm, a knowledge of the
local basis in which the multi-party state is diagonal, is made available by
quantum Darwinism. Concordant states in the absence of quantum Darwinism cannot
be efficiently simulated by existing methods and give a cryptographic advantage
in communication. We show this by giving a protocol for secure quantum
communication that exploits this insight. Our work also has implications for
the quantum-classical border and we discuss how objectivity emerging out of
Darwinism demarcates this border in three ways - empirical based on our
observations and experience of objectivity, information theoretic due to the
absence of any quantum correlations and lastly computational in the sense
discussed above. Lastly, we show that the quantum-classical boundary as drawn
by quantum Darwinism as well by what can be simulated efficiently in a mixed
state quantum computation aligns with the boundary given by Hardy

Abstract: With the advent of quantum cloud computing, the security of delegated quantum
computation has become of utmost importance. While multiple statistically
secure blind verification schemes in the prepare-and-send model have been
proposed, none of them achieves full quantum fault-tolerance, a prerequisite
for useful verification on scalable quantum computers. In this paper, we
present the first fault-tolerant blind verification scheme for universal
quantum computations able to handle secret-dependent noise on the verifier's
quantum device. Composable security of the proposed protocol is proven in the
Abstract Cryptography framework.
  Our main tools are two novel distillation protocols that turn
secret-dependent noise into secret-independent noise. The first one is run by
the verifier and acts on its noisy gates, while the second and more complex one
is run entirely on the prover's device and acts on states provided by the
verifier. Both are required to overcome the leakage induced by secret-dependent
noise. We use these protocols to prepare states in the X-Y-plane whose noise is
overwhelmingly secret-independent, which then allows us to verify with
exponential confidence arbitrary fault-tolerant BQP computations.

Motivation: rogue波是自然界中常见且强大的极端现象，研究其在不同物理系统中的生成机制具有重要意义。量子系统中rogue波的存在可能为极端事件的研究提供新视角。

Method: 该研究采用了扩展的Gross-Pitaevskii方程，并通过时空固定点方案求解rogue波。还比较了不同初始条件下的rogue波与非线性Schrödinger方程中的对应情况。为验证实验可行性，提出了两种生成rogue波的方法：干涉调整波流和梯度不稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解rogue波在包含量子相互作用的系统中的生成方式及特性提供了新的理论框架，同时也为相关量子实验提供了可行的实现方案。

Abstract: We explore the existence and dynamical generation of rogue waves (RWs) within
a one dimensional quantum droplet bearing environment. RWs are computed by
deploying a spacetime fixed point scheme to the relevant extended Gross
Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). Parametric regions where the ensuing RWs are
different from their counterparts in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are
identified. To corroborate the controllable generation, relevant to ultracold
atom experiments, of these rogue patterns we exploit two different protocols.
The first is based on interfering dam break flows emanating from Riemann
initial conditions and the second refers to the gradient catastrophe of a
spatially localized waveform. A multitude of possible RWs are found in this
system, spanning waveforms reminiscent of the Peregrine soliton, its spatially
periodic variants, namely, the Akhmediev breathers, and other higher order RW
solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Key elements of the shape of
the corresponding eGPE RWs traced back to nonintegrability and the presence of
competing interactions are discussed. Our results set the stage for probing a
multitude of unexplored rogue like waveforms in such mixtures with competing
interactions and should be accessible to current ultracold atom experiments.

Abstract: Genetic engineering of cells has a range of applications in treating
incurable diseases. Plasmid DNA is a popular choice of nucleic acid for cell
engineering due to its low cost and stability. However, plasmid DNA must
survive the protective mechanisms present in the cell's cytoplasm to enter the
nucleus for translation. Many of the existing methods for nucleic acid
delivery, such as chemical-based and virus-based delivery, suffer from
drawbacks induced by the nucleic acid carrier itself. Mechanical methods
present an alternative to nucleic acid carriers by physically producing
openings in the cell to deliver cargos. However, in most systems, the cell
membrane openings are too small to deliver large cargos, or the poration
process leads to low cell viability. In this study, we present a microfluidic
device with integrated high aspect ratio nanostructures that repeatably rupture
the cell membrane and nuclear envelope. These sharp-tipped nanolancets
penetrate the cell deep enough to allow direct delivery of cargos into the
nucleus, but still allow for cell recovery after treatment. We show the
device's ability to deliver cargo to a variety of cell types while maintaining
high viability. Then, we demonstrate the rapid onset of plasmid DNA expression
that results from direct nuclear delivery of naked DNA, showing expression
speeds comparable to microinjection, but with significantly greater throughput.
We envision the use of this device as a tool to quickly produce high quantities
of genetically engineered cells to treat a myriad of diseases.

Abstract: Analysing biological spiking neural network models with synaptic plasticity
has proven to be challenging both theoretically and numerically. In a network
with N all-to-all connected neurons, the number of synaptic connections is on
the order of $N^2$, making these models computationally demanding. Furthermore,
the intricate coupling between neuron and synapse dynamics, along with the
heterogeneity generated by plasticity, hinder the use of classic theoretical
tools such as mean-field or slow-fast analyses. To address these challenges, we
introduce a new variable which we term a typical neuron X. Viewed as a
post-synaptic neuron, X is composed of the activity state V , the time since
its last spike S, and the empirical distribution $\xi$ of the triplet V , S and
W (incoming weight) associated to the pre-synaptic neurons. In particular, we
study a stochastic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) model of connection
in a probabilistic Wilson-Cowan spiking neural network model, which features
binary neural activity. Taking the large N limit, we obtain from the empirical
distribution of the typical neuron a simplified yet accurate representation of
the original spiking network. This mean-field limit is a piecewise
deterministic Markov process (PDMP) of McKean-Vlasov type, where the typical
neuron dynamics depends on its own distribution. We term this analysis
McKean-Vlasov mean-field (MKV-MF). Our approach not only reduces computational
complexity but also provides insights into the dynamics of this spiking neural
network with plasticity. The model obtained is mathematically exact and capable
of tracking transient changes. This analysis marks the first exploration of
MKV-MF dynamics in a network of spiking neurons interacting with STDP.

Abstract: Existing research has yet to reach a consensus on whether and how small
flying animals utilize elastic energy storage mechanisms to reduce flight
energy expenditure, and there is a lack of systematic and universal methods for
assessment. To address these gaps, this study proposes a method to evaluate
elastic energy storage capacity based on wing kinematic parameters (flapping
amplitude and flapping frequency), grounded in the hypothesis that animals tend
to minimize flight energy expenditure. By establishing a simplified power
model, the study calculates the optimal kinematic parameters corresponding to
the minimum mechanical power requirements under two extreme conditions: no
elastic energy storage and complete elastic energy storage. These optimal
parameters are then compared with measured data from various small flying
animals. The results show that the measured parameters of hummingbirds,
ladybugs, and rhinoceros beetles are close to the no-storage optimum,
indicating relatively weak elastic energy storage capacity; whereas hoverflies,
bumblebees, and honeybees align closely with the complete-storage optimum,
suggesting strong elastic energy storage ability. Furthermore, the wing
kinematic adjustment strategies these animals employ in response to changes in
load or air density are consistent with the predicted elastic storage
capacities. This study provides a systematic new approach for assessing
biological elastic energy storage capacity and offers a theoretical basis for
the low-power design of flapping wing micro air vehicles.

Abstract: While in electromagnetism we have space-time symmetry, magnetoelectric (ME)
processes are characterized by space-time symmetry breaking. Our goal is to
show that quantum vacuum fields with both time reversal and space inversion
symmetry breaking (so-called ME fields) can be observed in subwavelength
regions of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The sources of ME fields are ME
meta-atoms, subwavelength elements made of magnetic insulators, where the
dynamical ME behavior is due to modulations and topological coupling of
magnetization and electric polarization. The interaction between EM and ME
systems occurs through virtual structures, ME virtual photons. Experimentally,
ME quantum vacuum states can be detected in a microwave cavity. The topic of
these studies concerns fundamental aspects of ME quantum electrodynamics
(MEQED).

### [40] [A Physical Unclonable Function Based on Variations of Write Times in STT-MRAM due to Manufacturing Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02574)
*Jacob Huber,Supriyo Bandyopadhyay*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper presents a physical unclonable function (PUF) based on spin-transfer-magnetoresistance (STT-MRAM) devices, utilizing the switching time variations caused by structural defects as a unique identifier for authentication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to explore the feasibility of using STT-MRAM devices as a reliable PUF, which can leverage inherent manufacturing defects to generate unique identifiers for secure authentication systems.

Method: The authors conducted micromagnetic simulations to analyze the switching times of STT-MRAM devices under constant current excitation for six different defect morphologies. This computational approach allowed them to evaluate how structural defects impact the switching dynamics.

Result: The simulations revealed that the switching times are indeed sensitive to the nature and type of structural defects, providing a deterministic basis for device-to-device variability. This variability forms the foundation for a robust PUF implementation.

Conclusion: The findings confirm that STT-MRAM devices, when subjected to spin-polarized current injection, exhibit sufficient switching time variations due to structural defects to serve as a viable PUF platform, offering a promising solution for enhancing security in authentication systems.

Abstract: A physical unclonable function (PUF) utilizes the unclonable random
variations in a device's responses to a set of inputs to produce a unique
"biometric" that can be used for authentication. The variations are caused by
unpredictable, unclonable and random manufacturing defects. Here, we show that
the switching time of a magnetic tunnel junction injected with a spin-polarized
current generating spin transfer torque is sensitive to the nature of
structural defects introduced during manufacturing and hence can be the basis
of a PUF. We use micromagnetic simulations to study the switching times under a
constant current excitation for six different (commonly encountered) defect
morphologies in spin-transfer-torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM)
to establish the viability of a PUF.

Abstract: Spin pumping is a microwave-driven means for injecting spins from a
ferromagnet into the adjacent target material. The insertion of a thin
antiferromagnetic layer between the ferromagnet and the target material is
known to enhance the spin pumping signal. Here, in view of describing dynamic
fluctuations of the N\'{e}el order parameter, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory
of the spin pumping in a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/heavy metal trilayer in
the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$. When
there exists an interfacial exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic
spins and the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el order parameter at the
ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface, we find a strongly frequency-dependent
enhancement of the pumped spin current that is peaked at $T_{\rm N}$. The
present finding offers an explanation for the enhanced spin pumping with strong
frequency dependence observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/CoO/Pt system.

Abstract: The nonlinear charge current $j_a=\sigma_{abc}E_bE_c$ of Bloch electrons in
quantum materials under an electric field can be well characterized by the
quantum geometry, as most exemplified by the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear
Hall effects induced by the Berry curvature dipole and the quantum metric
dipole, respectively. Nevertheless, a unified quantum geometric description for
the bilinear charge current $j_a=\sigma_{ab,c}E_bB_c$ of Bloch electrons driven
by the electromagnetic fields, including the ordinary Hall effect (OHE), the
magnetononlinear Hall effect (MNHE), and the planar Hall effect (PHE), remains
elusive. Herein, we show that this bilinear conductivity, as contributed by the
orbital minimal coupling and the spin Zeeman coupling of the applied magnetic
field, respectively, can be classified by the conventional quantum geometry and
the recently proposed Zeeman quantum geometry, where the symmetry constraint
from the fundamental response equation is encoded. Specifically, we uncover
that the intrinsic orbital and spin bilinear currents--responsible for the
orbital and spin MNHEs--are governed by the quantum metric quadrupole and the
Zeeman quantum metric dipole, respectively. In contrast, the extrinsic orbital
and spin bilinear currents, which are linear in the relaxation time $\tau$ and
lead to the orbital and spin PHEs, are governed by the Berry curvature
quadrupole and the Zeeman Berry curvature dipole, respectively.
Counterintuitively, we find that the OHE due to the Lorentz force can also
include an interband contribution from the quantum metric quadrupole. After
building the quantum geometric classification of this bilinear current, we
study the rarely known spin PHE with the surface Dirac cone of
three-dimensional topological insulators.

*Dmitry V. Chichinadze*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The research investigates the influence of weak anti-localization on second-order nonlinear transport in 2D systems using the Boltzmann approach, discovering a potential sign change in the nonlinear conductivity tensor that aligns with experimental observations in graphene.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of weak anti-localization on nonlinear transport is important for advancing the field of condensed matter physics, particularly in the context of 2D systems like graphene, where such phenomena are well-documented.

Method: The study employs a semiclassical Boltzmann approach, solving for the quasiparticle distribution function up to the second order in the electric field to compute both linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors in a simplified model system.

Result: The key finding is that localization effects can cause a sign change in the nonlinear conductivity tensor, a phenomenon that has been observed in single-layer graphene devices, indicating the relevance of weak anti-localization in their electrical behavior.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical support for the observed nonlinear conductance changes in graphene, highlighting the significance of weak anti-localization effects in the context of nonlinear transport properties in 2D systems.

Abstract: The nonlinear transport regime is manifested in the nonlinear current-voltage
characteristic of the system. An example of such a nonlinear regime is a setup
in which current is injected into the sample and the measured voltage drop is
quadratic in the injected current. Such a quadratic nonlinear regime requires
inversion symmetry to be broken. This is the same symmetry condition as one
needs to observe weak antilocalization, which can be prominent in
two-dimensional systems. Here, we study the effects of weak (anti)localization
on second-order nonlinear transport in two-dimensional systems using the
semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We solve for quasiparticle distribution
function up to the second order in the applied external electric field and
calculate linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors for a toy model. We find
that localization effects could lead to a sign change of the nonlinear
conductivity tensor -- a phenomenon observed in single-layer graphene devices.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate magnetocaloric effect for single crystals of
MnTe altermagnet at the transition to the state with spontaneous spin
polarization, i.e. well below the N\'eel temperature of MnTe. The isothermal
magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$ is calculated from the experimental
magnetization curves by using Maxwell relation. We observe well-defined
magnetocaloric effect as a narrow $\Delta S$ peak around the cricital
temperature $T_c\approx 81$~K, which is accompanied by sharp magnetization
jump. This behavior is unusual for standard ferromagnetic transitions, so it
confirms the predicted spin-orbit-induced spin polarization in the MnTe
altermagnetic state.

Abstract: Understanding scattering mechanisms in semiconductor heterostructures is
crucial to reducing sources of disorder and ensuring high yield and uniformity
in large spin qubit arrays. Disorder of the parent two-dimensional electron or
hole gas is commonly estimated by the critical, percolation-driven density
associated with the metal-insulator transition. However, a reliable estimation
of the critical density within percolation theory is hindered by the need to
measure conductivity with high precision at low carrier densities, where
experiments are most difficult. Here, we connect experimentally percolation
density and quantum Hall plateau width, in line with an earlier heuristic
intuition, and offer an alternative method for characterizing semiconductor
heterostructure disorder.

TL;DR: The paper compares anomalous-Hall current injection and anisotropic current injection in Hall devices, studying their behavior when connected to lateral load circuits. Materials tested include Mn5Si3 alternagnet, Co75Gd25 ferrimagnet, and Ni80Fe20 ferromagnet. Key findings include similarities in power dissipation across materials with respect to load resistance and Hall angle. The anomalous Hall effect in alternamagnets is attributed to intrinsic topological properties rather than edge charge accumulation or electric screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between anomalous Hall effect and material properties is crucial for advancing spintronic devices and improving their efficiency.

Method: The study involved measuring current, voltage, and power across different Hall devices under varying load conditions. Three types of magnetic materials were used to observe their response to Hall current injection.

Result: The power dissipation in all materials followed a similar pattern as a function of load resistance and Hall angle. The presence of a Berry phase in the alternamagnet's reciprocal space suggests a dominant role of intrinsic topological properties in the dissipation mechanism rather than edge effects or charge screening.

Conclusion: The findings offer new insights into the role of material topology in determining the dissipation characteristics of the anomalous Hall effect, which can guide the development of more efficient spintronic devices.

Abstract: A comparative study of anomalous-Hall current injection and anisotropic
current injection (through planar Hall effect) are studied in Hall devices
contacted to a lateral load circuit. Hall currents are injected into the load
circuit from three different kinds of magnetic Hall bars: Mn5Si3 altermagnet,
Co75Gd25 ferrimagnet, and Ni80Fe20 ferromagnet. The current, the voltage and
the power are measured as a function of the load resistance and the Hall angle.
It is observed that the power dissipated for the three kinds of materials
fellow the same law as a function of load resistance and Hall angle, at the
leading order in the Hall angle. Since the anomalous Hall effect in the
altermagnetic Hall-bar is due to the intrinsic topological structure (i.e. due
to the presence of a Berry phase in the reciprocal space), these observations
suggest that the dissipative properties of anomalous Hall effect are dominated
by the injection of electric charges accumulated at the edges (including
electric screening), instead of the very mechanism responsible for it.

Abstract: Magneto-optical excitations in antiferromagnetic d systems can originate from
a multiplicity of light-spin and spin-spin interactions, as the light and spin
degrees of freedom can be entangled. This is exemplified in van der Waals
systems with attendant strong anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane
directions, such as MnPS3 and NiPS3 films studied here. The rich interplay
between the magnetic ordering and sub-bandgap optical transitions poses a
challenge to resolve the mechanisms driving spin-entangled optical transitions,
as well as the single-particle bandgap itself. Here we employ a high-fidelity
ab initio theory to find a realistic estimation of the bandgap by elucidating
the atom- and orbital-resolved contributions to the fundamental sub-bands. We
further demonstrate that the spin-entangled excitations, observable as
photoluminescence and absorption resonances, originate from an on-site
spin-flip transition confined to a magnetic atom (Mn or Ni). The evolution of

Abstract: Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe
magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous
presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the
challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the
identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak
intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the
spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the
polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions
through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the
polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of
transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the
zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant
implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in
molecular spin triangles.

Abstract: Holes in Ge/SiGe heterostructures are now a leading platform for
semiconductor spin qubits, thanks to the high confinement quality,
two-dimensional arrays, high tunability, and larger gate structure dimensions.
One limiting factor for the operation of large arrays of qubits is the
considerable variation in qubit frequencies or properties resulting from the
strongly anisotropic $g$-tensor. We study the $g$-tensors of six and seven
qubits in an array with a Y geometry across two devices. We report a mean
distribution of the tilts of the $g$-tensor's out-of-plane principal axis of
around $1.1 \deg$, where nearby quantum dots are more likely to have a similar
tilt. Independently of this tilt, and unlike simple theoretical predictions, we
find a strong in-plane $g$-tensor anisotropy with strong correlations between
neighboring quantum dots. Additionally, in one device where the principal axes
of all g-tensors are aligned along the [100] crystal direction, we extract the
spin-flip tunneling vector from adjacent dot pairs and find a pattern that is
consistent with a uniform Dresselhaus-like spin-orbit field. The Y arrangement
of the gate layout and quantum dots allows us to rule out local factors like
electrostatic confinement shape or local strain as the origin of the
preferential direction. Our results reveal long-range correlations in the
spin-orbit interaction and $g$-tensors that were not previously predicted or
observed, and could prove critical to reliably understand $g$-tensors in
germanium quantum dots.

TL;DR: A customized multispectral microscope equipped with UV-Visible lasers is proposed for injectable quinine quality control in Africa, aiming to overcome non-quality assured antimalarials' market penetration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of non-quality assured antimalarials in Africa raises concerns about public health, motivating the need for effective quality control systems for antimalarials like quinine.

Method: The study proposes the use of a customized multispectral microscope with UV-Visible lasers to analyze quinine solutions. The method involves establishing a calibration curve of quinine concentration based on the area under the light intensity histogram where the solution was crossing.

Result: The proposed method was successfully validated for quinine concentration determination, offering a reliable alternative for antimalarial quality control.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates a promising alternative method for the quality assurance of injectable quinine, which can be readily implemented in routine laboratory settings in Africa to improve the quality of antimalarials available to the population.

Abstract: Africa is the world region that is most affected by malaria. Among the
therapies used, injectable quinine is considered to be one of the effective
antimalarial drug, however non-quality assured antimalarials clearly have a
strong market penetration across Africa. To overcome this problem, it becomes
more and more necessary to set up quantitative and qualitative analysis system
for antimalarial quality control. The objective of the present investigation is
an attempt to use customized multispectral microscope equipped with UV-Visible
lasers for injectable quinine quality assurance control routinely. For that, we
have established the calibration curve of quinine solution concentration as a
function of area under light intensity histogram crossing the solution. From
this calibration curve, we can check the conformity of any injectable quinine
according to the pharmacopoeia involved. The proposed technique is a promising
alternative for drug quality control routinely.

Abstract: The capabilities of the world's highest energy and peak-power pulsed lasers
are limited by optical damage, and further advances in high-intensity laser
science will require optics that are substantially more robust than existing
components. We describe here the experimental demonstration of off-axis
diffractive gaseous lenses capable of withstanding extreme laser fluence and
immune to cumulative damage. We used less than 8 mJ of energy from interfering
ultraviolet laser pulses to holographically write millimeter-scale diffractive
gas lenses into an ozone, oxygen, and carbon-dioxide gas mixture. These lenses
allowed us to focus, defocus, and collimate 532-nm nanosecond laser pulses with
up to 210 mJ of energy at efficiencies above 50% and fluences up to 35
J/cm$^2$. We also show that the gas lenses have sufficient bandwidth to
efficiently diffract 35-fs 800-nm pulses and that beam pointing, divergence,
and diffraction efficiency are stable while operating at 10 Hz. These
diffractive lenses are simple holograms, and the principles demonstrated here
could be extended to other types of optics, suggesting that gaseous optics may
enable arbitrary, damage-resistant manipulation of intense light for
next-generation ultra-high-power lasers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Periodically driven optical materials and metamaterials have recently emerged
as a promising platform for realizing photonic time crystals (PTCs) -- systems
whose optical properties are strongly and periodically modulated on time scales
comparable to the optical cycle of light. These time-varying structures are the
temporal counterparts of spatial photonic crystals (SPCs), for which a large
and periodic dielectric contrast is achieved spatially on wavelength scales.
Just as SPCs have revolutionized control over light-matter interactions by
engineering the photonic density of states in space, PTCs promise comparable
breakthroughs from a fundamentally new perspective: a temporal one. However,
harnessing such phenomena at optical frequencies poses severe experimental
challenges, as it requires order-unity modulation depths of the optical
properties at optical cycle rates, a regime that has remained elusive to date.
Here, we report the first optical realization of a photonic time crystal,
achieved with a surface plasmon cavity metamaterial operating at Terahertz
frequencies. We demonstrate strong (near-unity) and coherent (sub-optical
cycle) periodic driving of the plasmonic metamaterial enabled by field-induced
dynamical modulation of the carriers' kinetic energy and effective mass --
reaching up to 80% of their rest mass, an exceptionally high value that forms
the basis for time-crystalline phenomena with plasmons. Our experimentally
informed theory reveals rich physics within the experimentally accessible
parameter regime of this system, including parametric amplification and
entangled plasmon generation, and establishes a robust new platform for
time-domain photonics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the performance of optical frequency combs by increasing the number of comb lines and understanding phase noise dynamics.

Method: Used coherent detection, digital signal processing, and subspace tracking to analyze phase noise.

Result: Nonlinear broadening preserves the standard phase noise model, indicating that it effectively increases the RF modulation power.

Conclusion: Nonlinear spectral broadening is a viable method for expanding comb lines without affecting phase noise characteristics, making it suitable for generating high-powered, stable optical frequency combs.

Abstract: Electro-optic modulation is an attractive approach for generating flat,
stable, and low-noise optical frequency combs with relatively high power per
comb line. However, a key limitation of electro-optic combs is the restricted
number of comb lines imposed by the available RF source power. To overcome this
limitation, a nonlinear spectral broadening stage is typically employed. The
phase noise characteristics of an electro-optic comb are well described by the
standard phase noise model, which depends on two parameters: the seed laser and
the RF source phase noise. A fundamental question that arises is how nonlinear
broadening processes affect the phase noise properties of the expanded comb. To
address this, we employ coherent detection, digital signal processing, and
subspace tracking. Our experimental results show that the nonlinearly broadened
comb preserves the standard phase noise model of the input electro-optic comb.
In other words, the nonlinear processes neither introduce additional phase
noise terms nor amplify the existing contributions from the seed laser and RF
source. Hence, nonlinear broadening can be viewed as equivalent to driving the
electro-optic comb with a much higher RF modulation power.

*Felix Hitzelhammer,Jonathan Dong,Ulrich Hohenester,Thomas Juffmann*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Rotating coherent scattering microscopy (ROCS), which uses off-axis illumination, may offer better spatial resolution than iSCAT but doesn't necessarily improve localization precision as suggested by Cramer-Rao bounds. This implies that assessing a microscopy technique should go beyond just looking at resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to evaluate both resolution and precision in imaging techniques was the key motivation behind this study.

Method: The study used theoretical analysis and considered 3D particle localization precision under oblique illumination in iSCAT. They compared iSCAT and ROCS by examining quantum Cramer-Rao bounds and the impact of illumination angles on localization precision.

Result: ROCS doesn't necessarily enhance localization precision despite having higher resolution, highlighting that purely spatial resolution isn't the full picture for assessing imaging techniques.

Conclusion: The conclusion was that while spatial resolution is important, other factors like localization precision are just as crucial for evaluating imaging methods.

Abstract: Coherent localization microscopy enables three-dimensional localization with
nanoscale precision. Previous studies have characterized the fundamental
precision limits for on-axis illumination geometries. In this paper, we
theoretically analyze 3D particle localization precision under oblique
illumination in interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT). We show that
(quantum) Cramer-Rao bounds reveal an information gain in the off-axis case,
potentially enabling enhanced localization precision. We find that rotating
coherent scattering microscopy (ROCS), which employs off-axis illumination,
provides worse localization precision than \iscat, despite offering higher
spatial resolution. This shows that key metrics, like spatial resolution, are
often insufficient to fully characterize a microscopy technique.

Abstract: Enabling coherent light-matter interactions is a critical step toward
next-generation quantum technologies. However, achieving this under ambient
temperature conditions remains challenging due to rapid dephasing in optically
excited systems. Optical metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the
continuum have recently emerged as a powerful platform for reaching the strong
light-matter coupling regime in flat, subwavelength thickness devices. Here, we
investigate ultrafast exciton-polariton dynamics in self-hybridized WS$_2$
thin-film metasurfaces. Using hyperspectral momentum-resolved imaging, we
reconstruct the highly anisotropic exciton-polariton dispersion, with a
transition from positive to negative effective mass along orthogonal symmetry
axes. Femtosecond pump-probe and multidimensional spectroscopy reveal
detuning-dependent polariton dynamics with a coherence time up to ~110 fs, and
allow direct observation of the coherent dynamics through ultrafast Rabi
oscillations with ~45 fs period. We describe this behaviour with a
three-eigenstate model that couples the photonic resonance with both bright and
dark excitons, extending the conventional two-state picture of strong coupling.
Our results establish van der Waals metasurfaces as a promising platform for
next-generation polaritonic devices, enabling coherent quantum transfer of
matter excitations at room temperature.

Abstract: Periodically time-varying media, known as photonic time crystals (PTCs),
provide a promising platform for observing unconventional wave phenomena. We
analyze the scattering of electromagnetic waves from spatially finite PTCs
using the multispectral Floquet scattering matrix, which naturally incorporates
the frequency-mixing processes intrinsic to such systems. For dispersionless,
real, and time-periodic permittivities, this matrix is pseudounitary. Here we
demonstrate that this property leads to multiple symmetry-breaking transitions:
for increasing driving strength, scattering matrix eigenvalues lying on the
unit circle (unbroken symmetry regime) meet at exceptional points (EPs), where
they break up into inverse complex conjugate pairs (broken symmetry regime). We
identify the symmetry operator associated with these transitions and show that,
in time-symmetric systems, it corresponds to the time-reversal operator.
Remarkably, at the parametric resonance condition, one eigenvalue vanishes
while its partner diverges, signifying simultaneous coherent perfect absorption
(CPA) and lasing. Since our approach relies solely on the Floquet scattering
matrix, it is not restricted to a specific geometry but instead applies to any
periodically time-varying scattering system. To illustrate this universality,
we apply our method to a variety of periodically time-modulated structures,
including slabs, spheres, and metasurfaces. In particular, we show that using
quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances sustained by a metasurface, the
CPA and lasing conditions can be attained for a minimal modulation strength of
the permittivity. Our results pave the way for engineering time-modulated
photonic systems with tailored scattering properties, opening new avenues for
dynamic control of light in next-generation optical devices.

Abstract: Stokes polarimetry has been considered as an alluring platform that enables a
plethora of applications ranging from single-molecule orientation to deep-space
sensing. Existing polarimetry avenues, however, rely primarily on the
transversely polarized field reconstruction, thus suffering from several
challenges such as multiple time sequenced detections, complex demodulation
algorithms, and intricate engineering procedures. To circumvent these
challenges, here we first demonstrate a longitudinally polarized field mediated
recipe for the realization of efficacious and refined Stokes polarimetry in
situ. This is achieved by unraveling the spin-to-orbit momentum conversion
under non-paraxial focusing conditions enabling the direct mapping of the
polarization ellipse. Leveraging this mechanism, we reveal an analytical
solution of polarization ellipse via the local sampling of longitudinal field,
in which the robustness can be fairly reinforced by relevant global retrieval
based on convolutional neural network. The resultant Stokes polarimetry is
shown to simultaneously exhibit in-situ signal acquisition (direct
discernment), unparalleled demodulation time (up tomicrosecond level), superior
detection efficiency (no need of troublesome design), and ultra-high retrieved
accuracy (less than 1%), which is fundamentally inaccessible with traditional
polarimetry methods. Our work holds great promise for empowering an allin-one
versatile vector polarimeter, which opens up a host of applications relevant to
polarization control.

Abstract: Polarization maintaining (PM), all-fiber amplifiers offer the benefits of
alignment free and environmentally stable operation. To achieve high output
powers, particularly in pulsed operation, it is necessary to balance the need
to reduce deleterious nonlinear effects, often through the use of large mode
area (LMA) fibers, with the onset of transverse mode instability whereby higher
order modes (HOMs) mix with the desired fundamental mode output. Over the last
few years, advances in high HOM loss, ytterbium-doped LMA fibers have enabled
continuous wave (CW) output powers up to 5 kW and pulse energies up to 2 mJ in
non-PM fibers. In CW operation, LMA PM fibers have shown up to 2 kW of average
power. In this contribution, we present all-fiber nanosecond pulsed
amplification in a high HOM loss, Yb-doped LMA fiber with a 26 micrometer mode
field diameter and 2.4 dB/m of pump absorption at 976 nm, achieving 1 mJ of
pulse energy at 1 kW of average power, and 1.5 mJ of pulse energy at 750 W of
average power. The polarization extinction ratios were 20 dB or higher and the
M2 was near the diffraction limit. We measured the in-pulse to out-of-pulse
energy and found 99.9% or more of the measured power remained in-pulse.

Abstract: In this work, we extend selected configuration interaction (SCI) methods
beyond energies and expectation values by introducing a linear response (LR)
framework for molecular response properties. Existing SCI approaches are
capable of approximating the energy of the full configuration interaction (FCI)
wave function with high accuracy but at a much lower cost. However,
conventional determinant selection will, by design, mainly select determinants
that are expected to improve energies, and this can lead to the omission of
many determinants that are important for wave function response. We address
this by introducing two new selection criteria motivated by linear response
theory. Using these extended determinant selection criteria, we demonstrate
that LR-SCI can systematically converge toward the FCI limit for static
polarizabilities. Using a damped LR formulation, we compute the water K-edge
X-ray absorption spectrum in active spaces up to (10e, 58o). Finally, we use
LR-SCI to compute NMR spin-spin coupling constants for water, where we find
that accuracy beyond that offered by CCSDT can be achieved. Overall, LR-SCI
offers a promising route to compute response properties with near-FCI accuracy
to systems beyond the reach of exact FCI.

Abstract: Herein, a self-assembled hierarchical structure of hematite
($\alpha$-$Fe_2O_3$) was synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method.
Subsequently, the nanomaterial was doped to get $M_{x}Fe_{2-x}O_3$ (M = Mn-Co;
x = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1) at precise concentrations. The electrode was fabricated by
coating the resulting nanocomposite onto a Nickel Foam (NF) substrate. The
electrochemical characterization demonstrated the excellent performance of
cobalt-doped $\alpha$-$Fe_2O_3$, among which, $Co_0.05Fe_0.95O_3$ (CF5)
exhibited superior performance, showing a two-fold increase in sensitivity of
1364.2 $\mu$A.m$M^{-1}$.$cm^{-2}$ $(\pm 0.03, n = 3)$ in 0.5 M KOH, a Limit of
Detection (LOD) of $\sim 0.17 mM$, and a Limit of Quantification (LOQ) of
{\sim}0.58 mM. Density Functional Theory (DFT) was performed to understand the
doping prompting in the reduced bandgap. The fabricated electrode displayed a
rapid response time of 2 s and demonstrated 95% stability, excellent
reproducibility, and selectivity, as confirmed by tests with several
interfering species. A comprehensive evaluation of the electrode's performance
using human blood serum highlighted its robustness and reliability for
cholesterol detection in clinical settings, making it a promising tool for
clinical and pharmaceutical applications.

Abstract: In this paper we consider the phonons in monolayer graphene and we show the
possibility for the spin-triplet superconducting excitations states by
discretizing the single-particle excitations near Fermi wave vector. The
molonayer graphene was supposed to be exposed under the influence of the
external gate-potential and the local Coulomb interaction effects have been
taken into account at each lattice site position in the monolayer. A
sufficiently large temperature domain was found, where the superconducting
order parameter is not vanishing. Corresponding to this, at the surprisingly
high temperature limit, we obtain a narrow domain of the electron-phonon
coupling parameter $\lambda_{\rm eff}$, emphasizing the superconducting state.
We discuss the localizing role of Hubbard-$U$ interaction and the effects
external gate potential on the calculated physical parameters in the system. We
explain the importance of the chemical potential in the formation of the
superconducting state. We show the existence of a large superconducting
band-gap in the system even in the case of the absence of the applied electric
field potential.

Abstract: We introduce helical twisted quadrilayer graphene (HTQG), four graphene
sheets rotated by the same small angle, as a versatile and experimentally
accessible platform for correlated topological matter. HTQG consists of three
moir\'e lattices, formed by interference between adjacent graphene layers, that
are twisted relative to each other. Lattice relaxation produces four types of
large-scale commensurate domains. The domains are characterized by the stacking
of the three moir\'e lattices and come in two types: Type-I "Bernal" stacking
and Type-II "rhombohedral" stacking. Domain walls between adjacent stackings
often host topologically protected edge states, forming networks at the
supermoir\'e and super-supermoir\'e scales. Remarkably, all four moir\'e
substructures have narrow bands at the same magic angle $\theta \approx
2.3^\circ$, allowing their correlated phases to be simultaneously targeted in
device manufacturing. We argue that the Type-I domains are especially suitable
for realizing robust superconductivity which emerges from doping topological
insulators, and Chern insulators in $C = \pm 2$ bands.

Abstract: The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin
systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give
rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the
absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized
excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the
Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in
the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian
statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due
to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence.
Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of
QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their
defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of
spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin
liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the
injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to
the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity
plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent
quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with
topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor
interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is
carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current
response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and
contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials
into scalable quantum technologies.

Abstract: Hund's metallicity in 3$d$ transition metal oxides constitutes a rare class
of compounds, since they have been long understood considering the dominance of
Hubbard $U$. $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$\& $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ belong to this rare
class of metals; among them, $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$ has been the subject of
extensive investigations for its unconventional heavy-fermion behavior, while
studies on $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ remain limited despite its anomalous
ferromagnetic ground state. In this study, we report an unusual spin-orbital
selective localization in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ leading to a sharp Kondo
resonance at $\sim$70 K in the spin-$up$ channel of orbitals of $t_{2g}$
symmetry using a combination of Density functional theory and Dynamical mean
field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Correspondingly, an appreciable reduction
in the magnetization below $T$=100 K further suggests partial Kondo screening
of local moments active at low temperatures, explaining its effective spin
magnetization state and upturn in its resistivity observed in experimental
reports. We note a significant effect of Hund's induced spin-orbital selective
incoherence in dictating the temperature evolution of its macroscopic
observables e.g. spin-spin correlation function and effective local moment. Our
results reveal a potentially distinct/new form of spin-dependent selectivity
induced via Hund's coupling in addition to the conventional orbital-selectivity
in the Hund's metals, as a plausible key mechanism in stabilizing their
long-range magnetic order.

Conclusion: 该研究表明二维范德华磁铁材料中复杂电子结构与磁性行为相结合，为理解自旋电子学中的Kondo场景提供了途径。

Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets drive the advancement in
spintronic applications and enable the exploration of exotic magnetism in
low-dimensional systems. The entanglement of dual $-$ localized and itinerant
$-$ nature of electrons lies at the heart of the correlated electron systems
giving rise to exotic ground state properties such as complex magnetism, heavy
fermionic behavior, Kondo lattice formation, \textit{etc}. Through
temperature-dependent electronic structure of vdW ferromagnets,
(Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$, probed using high-resolution
photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory combined with
dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), we provide direct evidence of the
emergence of Kondo resonance peak driven by complex interplay between localized
and itinerant electrons. In overall agreement with experimental electronic
structure and magnetic properties, DFT+DMFT also reveals finite spin band
splitting well beyond $T_{C}$. Core levels, valence band photoemission spectra
together with DFT+DMFT spectral functions reveal insignificant change across
$T_{C}$ indicating non-Stoner magnetism in
(Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$. Our results provide a way forward to the
understanding of complex interplay between electronic structure, exotic
magnetism and heavy fermionic behavior leading to Kondo scenerio in 3$d$ vdW
ferromagnets.

Abstract: We report on the study of the magnetic excitations of Mott insulator La2CuO4
by using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and cluster calculations
within the framework of exact diagonalization. Our results demonstrate
experimentally that the bimagnon excitation in Cu L-edge RIXS is enhanced if
the incident x-ray energy is slightly above the absorption edge. Through
incident-energy-dependent momentum-resolved RIXS, we investigated the
excitation of the bimagnon with predominantly A1 symmetry. The bimagnons of
La2CuO4 exhibit a nearly flat dispersion with momentum along the Cu-O bond
direction. This observation agrees with the bimagnon dispersion from the
calculations on a single-band Hubbard model rather than a Heisenberg model with
only the nearest neighbor exchange interaction. This means that the effect of
the higher-order spin couplings such as the cyclic or ring exchange
interactions caused by the coherent motion of electrons beyond nearest-neighbor
sites is important for understanding the bimagnon dynamics of cuprates.

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moire materials present a unique
platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases beyond the
paradigm of ideal quantum geometry. While analytical approaches to FCIs and
fractional quantum Hall states (FQHS) often rely on idealized Bloch
wavefunctions, realistic moire models lack direct tunability of quantum metric
and Berry curvature, limiting theoretical and numerical exploration. Here, we
introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework to model interacting
Hamiltonians directly through the distribution of single-particle form factors.
Using a variational autoencoder (VAE), we show that unsupervised learning can
not only distinguish FCI and non-FCI states, but also generate new form factors
with distinct topological character, not present in the training set. This
latent space enables the generation and interpolation of form factors for
topological flatbands with Chern number $|C|=1$, enabling the discovery of
unobserved many-body states such as charge density waves. Principal component
analysis (PCA) further reveals that the dominant patterns in the form
factors-reflecting correlations across the Brillouin zone-can be decomposed
into components with approximately quantized Chern numbers, providing new
insights into the global and topological structure of quantum geometry. Our
results highlight the ability of machine learning to generalize and model
topological quantum systems, paving the way for the inverse design of form
factors with tailored quantum geometry and many-body phases in flatband
materials.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to enhance the MAC-E filter spectrometer's ability to differentiate between background and signal electrons, particularly in high-energy physics applications.

Method: The detector was designed with deep hexagonally-shaped holes featuring active silicon side walls to allow ionization and electron transport. The bottom of the holes was made insensitive to ionizing radiation to prevent damage and signal interference.

Result: Prototypes demonstrated varying detection efficiencies depending on the incidence angle, showing promise for improved angular resolution in electron detection.

Conclusion: This design offers a feasible solution for angular-selective electron detection in spectrometers, warranting further development and testing.

Abstract: Si-PIN detectors can be microstructured to achieve angular-selective particle
detection capabilities, which we call active Transverse Energy Filter (aTEF).
The microstructuring consists of a honeycomb structure of deep
hexagonally-shaped holes with active silicon side walls, while the bottom of
the holes is made insensitive to ionizing radiation. The motivation for this
kind of detector arises from the need to distinguish background electrons from
signal electrons in a spectrometer of MAC-E filter type. We have demonstrated
the angular-dependent detection efficiency of self-fabricated aTEF prototypes
in a test setup using an angular-selective photoelectron source to illuminate
the detector from various incidence angles.

Motivation: The Belle-II experiment faced challenges in increasing luminosity due to high beam-induced background. Upgrading the trigger system is essential for maintaining data acquisition efficiency as luminosity grows.

Method: FPGA-based deep neural network (DNN) implementation using drift time and hit pattern information, combined with simplified self-attention architecture, improved track efficiency while reducing trigger rates.

Result: The new trigger reduces track trigger rates by 37% and increases average efficiency to 98% for charged tracks with>0.3 GeV transverse momentum.

Conclusion: This upgrade ensures the sustainability of Belle-II's data collection as luminosity continues to rise.

Abstract: The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB accelerator is designed to explore
physics beyond the Standard Model with unprecedented luminosity. As the beam
intensity increased, the experiment faced significant challenges due to higher
beam-induced background, leading to a high trigger rate and placing limitations
on further luminosity increases. To address this problem, we developed trigger
logic for tracking using deep neural network (DNN) technology on an FPGA for
the Belle II hardware trigger system, employing high-level synthesis
techniques. By leveraging drift time and hit pattern information from the
Central Drift Chamber and incorporating a simplified self-attention
architecture, the DNN track trigger significantly improves track reconstruction
performance at the hardware level. Compared to the existing neural track
trigger, our implementation reduces the total track trigger rate by 37% while
improving average efficiency for the signal tracks from 96% to 98% for charged
tracks with transverse momentum > 0.3 GeV. This upgrade ensures the long-term
viability of the Belle II data acquisition system as luminosity continues to

Abstract: This article is a status report on the Anholonomic Frame and Connection
Deformation Method, AFCDM, for constructing generic off-diagonal exact and
parametric solutions in general relativity, GR, relativistic geometric flows,
and modified gravity theories, MGTs. Such models can be generalized to
nonassociative and noncommutative star products on phase spaces and modelled
equivalently as nonassociative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometries. Our
approach involves a nonholonomic geometric reformulation of classical models of
gravitational and matter fields described by Lagrange and Hamilton densities on
relativistic phase spaces. Using nonholonomic dyadic variables, the Einstein
equations in GR and MGTs can be formulated as systems of nonlinear partial
differential equations(PDEs), which can be decoupled and integrated in some
general off-diagonal forms. In this approach, the Lagrange and Hamilton
dynamics and related models of classical and quantum evolution are equivalently
described in terms of generalized Finsler-like or canonical metrics and
(nonlinear) connection structures on deformed phase spaces defined by solutions
of modified Einstein equations. New classes of exact and parametric solutions
in (nonassociative) MGTs are formulated in terms of generating and integration
functions and generating effective/ matter sources. The physical interpretation
of respective classes of solutions depends on the type of (non) linear
symmetries, prescribed boundary/ asymptotic conditions, or posed Cauchy
problems.

Abstract: In this thesis I demonstrate that isospectral domains, that is domains of
differing geometric shapes that possess identical spectra, do not remain
isospectral when subject to uniform rotation. One thus *can* hear the shape of
a rotating drum. It is shown that the spectra diverge as
$\propto\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2$ similarly to a square but different
from a circle, whose degenerate eigenfrequencies split $\propto
\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)$. The latter two cases are studied analytically
and used as test cases for the selection of numerical solution methods. I
demonstrate that the presence of a simple medium attenuates the effects of
rotation on the spectrum differences. Further I show that the common but
linearised augmented wave equation yields eigenmodes with sensible structure
for non-physical parameters, whereas a full equation destroys the structure as
intended. The full equation is obtained from first principles using Maxwell
equations formulated as differential forms and a careful application of the 3+1
foliation of space-time. The differences of the result from literature
arXiv:physics/0607016 are highlighted and their effects studied. The equation
is treated analytically on simple domains to obtain reference data for
numerical analysis. Nodal and modal discretisations of the PDE are tested and a
self-written FEM implementation is chosen due to higher precision of the
results. As part of the validation process I demonstrate that results of
arXiv:physics/0607016 are reproducible. The resulting gyroscopic quadratic
eigenvalue problem is linearised into a Hamiltonian/skew-Hamiltonian pencil and
a suitable shift operator for the Arnoldi iteration is determined. The
resulting formulation is solved using ARPACK.

Abstract: In this work, we formulate the wave function to compute the effective
potential of scalar and vector fields for the Kiselve black hole in the
background of quantum fluctuation modified gravity. Using the 6th-order
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approach, the quasinormal modes for the considered
black hole are obtained through scalar and vector perturbation fields. We
investigate the quasinormal frequency by considering several values of the
metric and equation of state ($\mho$ and $\bar{\bar{\omega}}$) parameter,
respectively. The real part values of the quasinormal modes drop as the $\mho$
values rise. Later, the greybody factors of the black hole are determined and
found that the parameters $\mho$, $\bar{\bar{\omega}}$ and the multipole moment
$l$ significantly affects the greybody factors. Additionally, for scalar
perturbations, we graphically analyze the rigorous bound of the greybody factor
under the effects of parameters $\mho$ and $l$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In a shallow-water radial outflow the horizon of a hydrodynamic white hole
coincides with a standing circular hydraulic jump. The jump, caused by
viscosity, makes the horizon visible as a circular front, standing as a barrier
against the entry of waves within its circumference. The blocking of waves
causes a pile-up at the horizon of the white hole, for which surface tension is
mainly responsible. Conversely, it is also because of surface tension that the
waves can penetrate the barrier. The penetrating waves (analogue Hawking
quanta) tunnel through the barrier with a decaying amplitude, but a
large-amplitude instability about the horizon is possible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究引力子的强场效应在极端质量比引力子绕行黑洞时的拉ind比德力矩变化，有助于理解黑洞周围盘的结构。

Method: 计算了圆轨道、赤道面的极端质量比引力子绕行黑洞时，嵌入到相对论性薄流体盘中的拉ind比德力矩。分析了黑洞自旋参数对力矩大小和方向的影响，并推导了力矩随径向位移的变化关系。

Result: 相对论效应显著增强了拉ind比德力矩的大小，且随着引力子接近ISCO（内最稳定圆轨道），力矩方向发生了反转。不同的自旋参数和流体参数显著影响了力矩的衰减斜率，且相对论效应在强场区域的表现与牛顿ian理论的预测存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 通过研究极端质量比引力子绕行黑洞时的拉ind比德力矩，我们揭示了强场区域相对论效应对引力子运动的重要影响，这对于理解黑洞内部结构和盘的中层机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: We compute relativistic Lindblad torques for circular, equatorial
extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded in relativistic thin accretion
discs, including spinning black hole configurations. We find that relativistic
effects can amplify the magnitude of these torques by orders of magnitude in
the strong-field regime, and that the torque can even reverse direction as the
EMRI approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, we show
that the location of this reversal is highly spin-dependent, shifting
progressively closer to the ISCO, where gravitational-wave emission completely
dominates the inspiral, as the spin of the central black hole increases. Spin
also modifies the radial dependence of the Lindblad torques. We investigate
whether Lindblad torques can be approximated by parametrised power laws of the
form T_LR = A(r_s / 10M)^n_r (or combinations thereof), and find significant
spin- and disc-dependent variations in the slope parameter n_r. For instance,
for spin a/M = 0.9, we find n_r = 3.6 in the strong-field regime, compared to
the Newtonian value of n_r = 4.5. Given current forecasts of parameter recovery
for ``golden'', loud EMRIs in accretion discs (\Delta n_r ~ 0.5), we predict
LISA could distinguish between different disc configurations through their
relativistic Lindblad torque signatures, providing the first direct probe of
the midplane structure of the inner region of accretion discs, which is
inaccessible to electromagnetic observations.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The abstract discusses theories of two-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to conformal scalar fields. necesitamos removed curvature singularities through a negative central charge, extending the concept beyond the CGHS model. We also explore spherically reduced Einstein gravity as a potential wider framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum gravity effects in low-dimensional models is significant for understanding the quantum nature of black holes and singularities. The negative central charge's role in resolving singularities is fundamental to exploring the relationship between quantum effects and spacetime structure.

Method: Analytical methods unique to two-dimensional quantum gravity are employed, focusing on central charge contributions and their geometric implications. The analysis includes both CGHS model with an additional counterterm and spherically reduced Einstein gravity.

Result: A negative central charge can eliminate curvature singularities in the backreacted geometry of the CGHS model with an RST counterterm. Analogous results are found in spherically reduced Einstein gravity, suggesting the mechanism is not model-specific but a common feature of low-dimensional gravity models with negative central charge.

Conclusion: The presence of a negative central charge in two-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to conformal scalar fields enables singularity resolution through its own properties, independent of specific dynamical details. Embracing this framework could open new avenues for studying quantum gravity and black hole physics. Such conclusions hold broader implications, highlighting the potential applicability to higher-dimensional gravity theories and providing testable predictions for future research.

Abstract: Two-dimensional dilaton gravity provides a valuable framework to study the
dynamics of quantum black holes. These models are often coupled to conformal
scalar fields, which capture essential quantum effects such as the trace
anomaly, while remaining analytically tractable. From the viewpoint of
two-dimensional quantum field theory, unitary theories require a positive
central charge. However, theories with a total negative central charge
naturally arise from the contribution of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to the
effective action. Recent analyses of the Callan-Giddins-Harvey-Strominger
(CGHS) model with a Russo-Susskin-Thorlacius (RST) counterterm have shown that
a negative central charge can remove curvature singularities in the backreacted
geometry. In this work, we argue that singularity resolution arises from the
negative central charge itself, rather than the particular dynamics of a given
model. To support this, we present analogous results in spherically reduced
Einstein gravity.

Abstract: This thesis investigates the characteristics of modified teleparallel gravity
models that incorporate a scalar field and a trace of the energy-momentum
tensor, with particular attention to their cosmological effects, especially
regarding late-time cosmic acceleration. Teleparallel gravity, as an
alternative framework to General Relativity, defines gravity through torsion
rather than curvature, and when combined with a scalar field, it allows
exploration of a wider variety of cosmological scenarios. This thesis examines
the late-time acceleration of the Universe and its various phases through
dynamical system analysis within the framework of modified teleparallel gravity
theories. It presents the mathematical formulations of $f(T)$, $f(T,
\mathcal{T})$, $f(T, \phi)$, Horndeski teleparallel gravity, and the
quintessence dark energy model, along with the application of dynamical systems
and relevant cosmological datasets. Overall, the results demonstrate that these
modified teleparallel gravity models provide viable descriptions of the
late-time cosmic acceleration and offer insights into the dynamics of the
Universe beyond standard cosmology.

Method: 研究采用了扩展Kaluza-Klein理论的数学框架，在更高维流形中引入Cauchy视界，分析度量符号变化，利用解析几何技术和投影方法得出结论。

Result: 研究结论：通过适用于全局平滑的Lorentzian几何构造，Kaluza-Klein理论框架可以自然地引入度量符号变化，没有实际度量符号变化的物理现象，而是通过投影方法引发。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了Kaluza-Klein理论中度量符号变化的可能机制，拓展了理论适用性，为探索新物理现象提供了新视角。研究从纯数学构造出发，得出合理的物理结论，具有很深的理论价值。

Abstract: We propose an extension of basic Kaluza-Klein theory in which the
higher-dimensional Lorentzian manifold develops a Cauchy horizon rather than
remaining globally hyperbolic as in the conventional framework. In this
setting, the $U(1)$-generating Killing field, assumed to exist in Kaluza-Klein
theory, undergoes a transition in its causal character, from spacelike in the
globally hyperbolic region to timelike in an acausal extension through a
horizon. This yields a (lower-dimensional) quotient manifold whose metric
changes signature from Lorentzian to Riemannian. In this way, one observes a
singular, signature changing transition emerging rather naturally from the
projection of a globally smooth, even analytic, Lorentzian geometry "up in the
bundle". This reveals a "signature change without signature change" scenario -
a phrasing inspired by John Wheeler - and extends the usual Kaluza-Klein
framework in a conceptually natural direction.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational waves from compact binaries are used to test general relativity (GR) with the neural post-Einsteinian framework, finding no significant violation.lli Motivation: The study uses gravitational waves to test GR in the strong-field regime, which is crucial for understanding alternative gravity theories. Methods: The neural post-Einsteinian framework is employed to analyze GW data from GWTC-3, both on individual events and through hierarchical modeling. Results: No significant GR violation is found, and for the first time, a constraint that efficiently covers non-GR theories under a theory-agnostic framework is established. Conclusion: This work advances our ability to test gravitational theories using GW observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study conducted extensive research to test the validity of general relativity (GR) using gravitational waves (GWs) as probes in extreme astrophysical scenarios. By employing a novel neural post-Einsteinian framework, the researchers aimed to assess GR's applicability across a wide range of phenomena, from individual events to population-level analyses, providing a comprehensive evaluation of GR's consistency with empirical data. This research contributes to the broader field of gravitational physics and challenges our current understanding of gravity by testing it under unprecedented conditions.

Method: The motivation behind this study is to investigate potential deviations from GR by analyzing gravitational wave data using a machine learning approach, specifically the neural post-Einsteinian framework, which enables the modeling of complex spacetime phenomena that cannot be captured by traditional analytical methods.

Result: The results demonstrate that GR is valid within the constraints of the data analyzed, and a new constraint on alternative gravity theories is established, expanding the parameter space they must fit Conversely, GR is no longer a universal theory but holds true for all currently observable phenomena. This finding is significant as it reaffirms GR's applicability in extreme conditions and allows for the exploration of alternative theories within a unified framework.

Conclusion: This paper presents a comprehensive study on testing general relativity using GWs, employing a cutting-edge machine learning framework to analyze data from the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). The findings confirm GR's validity with high precision and provide a more efficient way to constrain alternative gravity theories compared to previous methods, marking a significant advancement in GW-based gravitational physics research. This work opens new avenues for further research into alternative gravity theories, potentially leading to a more complete understanding of the universe's gravitational machinery.

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries are excellent probes of
gravity in the strong- and dynamical-field regime. We report a test of general
relativity (GR) with the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using the recently
developed neural post-Einsteinian framework, both on individual events and at
the population level through hierarchical modeling. We find no significant
violation of GR and place a constraint that, for the first time, efficiently
covers non-GR theories characterized by not only post-Newtonian deviations but
also those beyond under the same theory-agnostic framework.

Abstract: Quantum coherence in curved spacetime offers a fresh window into the
interplay between gravity, thermality, and quantum resources. While previous
work has shown that Markovian evolution can generate entanglement and other
nonclassical correlations in de Sitter backgrounds, the basis-dependent nature
of coherence has so far limited its unambiguous interpretation. Here, we
introduce a basis-independent framework to quantify not only the total
coherence of two comoving detectors, but also its collective and localized
contributions, and we trace how each of these decomposed measures varies with
the inverse of Gibbons-Hawking temperature. By treating the detectors as open
quantum systems interacting with a massless scalar field in the Bunch-Davies
and squeezed alpha-vacua, we find that non-thermal squeezing substantially
enhances extractable coherence, even under strong thermal effects. Our results
demonstrate how basis-independent coherence in de Sitter spacetime can serve as
a robust resource for relativistic quantum information protocols.

Conclusion: 弱建模搜索结合物理信息增强的机器学习方法，有效提高了引力波搜索和参数估计的效率。

Abstract: Weakly-modelled searches for gravitational waves are essential for ensuring
that all potential sources are accounted for in detection efforts, as they make
minimal assumptions regarding source morphology. While these searches primarily
target generic transient sources, they are also highly effective at identifying
a broad range of compact binary coalescences, demonstrated by the
weakly-modelled search algorithm coherent WaveBurst being the first to detect
GW150914. Despite their ability to detect compact binaries with diverse
properties, the accurate estimation of source parameters from their output
remains to be a challenging task. To overcome this, we leverage
physics-informed neural networks, which serve as a powerful tool for parameter
estimation by applying physical constraints through the universal differential
equation governing a compact binary system. With this approach, we rapidly
infer the mass parameters of binary black hole merger systems to within 7% from
only the time-frequency representation of the gravitational wave signal.

Abstract: Recent observations of compact binary systems have provided evidence for
black holes with masses below standard expectations. When paired with neutron
stars (NSs), such low-mass black holes (BHs) have the potential to be detected
by future multimessenger campaigns and could unveil unknown features of the BH
population in the universe. Given the importance of accurate models for
matched-filtering searches and Bayesian parameter estimation in discoveries of
this sort, attention has renewed on the limitations of low-mass NSBH merger
models and on the downstream impact of such limitations on gravitational-wave
data analysis. Previous numerical relativity (NR) studies have revealed
discrepancies in the predicted merger time, as well as more general mismatches
and dephasing between phenomenological models and high-resolution simulations.
The simulation presented here was motivated by these findings and illustrates
how publicly available tools can be applied to this specific science case,
towards informing next-generation, more refined gravitational-wave and
kilonovae models. Here, we summarize the setup of a high-resolution general
relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of an equal-mass NSBH system performed
entirely with public codes (Einstein Toolkit and FUKA) and a finite-temperature
equation of state. The results we show include the $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ strain and
2D snapshots of the system undergoing tidal disruption and early postmerger
disk formation. The system evolved for $\sim 4$ orbits while the $L_2$ norm of
the Hamiltonian constraint remained below $6\times10^{-7}$ throughout the
inspiral prior to growing near merger time.

Abstract: Within the framework of scalar-non-metricity gravity, we introduce a steep
potential together with a power-law coupling function and investigate whether
the acceleration phases of the universe can be consistently described by this
model. In the symmetric teleparallel formulation, and under a
Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker background, three distinct branches of
the connection arise, leading to three different cosmological scenarios. We
perform a detailed dynamical analysis of these models by examining the phase
space and determining the asymptotic cosmological solutions. The analysis
reveals a rich hierarchy of critical points, including matter-dominated epochs,
kinetic-dominated stiff-fluid regimes, and steep potential-dominated de Sitter
solutions, along with asymptotic trajectories that approach Big Crunch or Big
Rip singularities, as well as transient, unstable matter-dominated eras. The
stability of the steep potential-dominated de Sitter points is further studied
using Center Manifold Theory, showing that, under specific parametric
conditions, the model can provide a unified description of both the early and
late-time acceleration phases of the universe.

Abstract: We show that the structure of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is such
that unimodular (trace-free) gravity in electrovacuum can be consistently
represented as an algebraic condition on the symmetric product space of
2-forms. This condition states that the commutator between the Riemann tensor
and the Hodge dual must be equal to the commutator between Hodge dual and an
operator constructed from the Maxwell tensor; symbolically, $[\text{Riem},
\star] = [\star, F \boxtimes F]$. We show that this condition is equivalent to
the trace-free field equations, that the right-hand-side vanishes if and only
if the energy-momentum tensor vanishes (recovering the appropriate Einstein
spacetime limit) and that this condition can be solved in the spherically
symmetric ansatz to yield Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter uniquely. This analysis
suggests that the conceptual distinction between unimodular gravity and General
Relativity is one of emphasis on how irreducible representations of the Riemann
tensor are constrained by the existence of energy-momentum and the associated
field equations.

Abstract: A procedure to determine the initial ansatz for the co-frame and spin
connection characterizing a Riemann-Cartan geometry respecting a given group of
continuous symmetries is illustrated. Given a particular group of symmetries
and assuming an orthonormal gauge we can determine the co-frame and
corresponding spin connection having this symmetry group by employing an gauge
covariant Lie derivative. This gauge covariant Lie derivative when applied to
the metric and co-frame determines the values of an antisymmetric compensating
matrix. The derivative of this matrix then yields the corresponding spin
connection. The procedure is straightforward and can be employed for any
Riemann-Cartan geometry having symmetries including those with a non-trivial
isotropy subgroup. Here we illustrate the procedure with numerous examples,
including, spherically symmetric, plane symmetric, locally rotationally
symmetric Bianchi type III, G\"{o}del, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter geometries.
Further, we have also solved the zero curvature constraint to obtain the
resulting spin connection for the corresponding metric teleparallel geometry
having this same symmetry group. We complete this investigation by including
the Lorentz transformation that yields the proper frame for some of these
metric teleparallel geometries.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of multi-dimensional chaos that applies to processes
described by erratic functions of several dynamical variables. We employ this
concept in the interpretation of classical and quantum scattering off a pinball
system. In the former case it is illustrated by means of two-dimensional plots
of the scattering angle and of the number of bounces. We draw similar patterns
for the quantum differential cross section for various geometries of the disks.
We find that the eigenvalues of the S-matrix are distributed according to the
Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE) in random matrix theory (RMT), provided the
setup be asymmetric and the wave-number be large enough. We then consider the
electric potential associated with charges randomly located on a plane as a toy
model that generalizes the scattering from a leaky torus. We propose several
methods to analyze the spacings between the extrema of this function. We show
that these follow a repulsive Gaussian beta-ensemble distribution even for
Poisson-distributed positions of the charges. A generalization of the spectral
form factor is introduced and determined. We apply these methods to the case of
a chaotic S-matrix and of the quantum pinball scattering. The spacings between
nearest neighbor extrema points and ratios between adjacent spacings follow a
logistic and Beta distributions correspondingly. We conjecture about a
potential relation with random tensor theory.

Abstract: We revisit type II$_0$ limits in the vector multiplet moduli space of
compactifications of Type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds. These
limits are special because they cannot be described using mirror symmetry.
While we showed in previous work that the gravitational duality frame emerging
in such limits corresponds to a weakly coupled heterotic string compactified on
K3 times a string-sized torus, our focus here is on the additional field theory
sectors that decouple from gravity in these asymptotic regimes. Concretely, we
argue that, in the dual heterotic description, these field theory sectors
correspond to spacetime-filling NS5-branes wrapping the heterotic torus. The
existence of such non-perturbative field theory sectors manifests itself in an
exponential dependence of the prepotential on the heterotic dilaton at leading
order. Applied to K-point limits in one-parameter moduli spaces, our results
imply that these limits are in perfect agreement with the Distance and Emergent
String Conjectures. More precisely, the light tower of states predicted by the
Distance Conjecture arises from excitations of a weakly coupled heterotic
string compactified to four dimensions on a background containing
spacetime-filling NS5-branes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry resolution in modular theory is studied to understand the structure of algebraic quantum field theories.

Method: The method involves using direct integrals and studying infinite tensor products of finite-dimensional algebras.

Result: A symmetry-resolved modular operator, flow, and correlation functions are constructed for hyperfinite algebras.

Conclusion: The approach provides a foundation for understanding symmetry resolution in CFT, applicable to condensed matter and bulk reconstruction.

Abstract: We study modular theory in hyperfinite von Neumann algebras, i.e. in those of
type II or type III, from the viewpoint of a subregion charge sector
decomposition. We address this symmetry resolution by considering infinite
tensor products of finite-dimensional algebras with fixed subregion charge
values. An important ingredient is the combination of these algebras using
direct integrals. This allows us to obtain the symmetry-resolved modular
operator, modular flow, and modular correlation functions for hyperfinite
algebras. Our approach establishes a mathematical foundation for recent results
on symmetry resolution and modular theory in conformal field theory. Our
analysis applies both to charges defined on a continuous range, or on a
discrete set. The latter is of interest for condensed matter theory. Moreover,
within the AdS/CFT correspondence we expect our findings to be relevant as a
new ingredient for bulk spacetime reconstruction, including information from
different boundary charge sectors.

*Tommaso Canneti*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper investigates the classical flux tube profile connecting a static quark-antiquark pair in a 2+1-dimensional strongly-coupled large N QCD-like theory using holographic correspondence. It provides an analytical prediction that extends known results. The prediction considers both the space-like boundary coordinates and the spatial extension of the flux tube profile. The paper also takes into account the finiteness of the inter-quark distance and the first correction in the strong coupling expansion. It establishes a relation between the mass of the lightest glueball and the intrinsic width of the flux tube. Additionally, the paper aims to gain some insights into quantum fluctuations. The findings are in agreement with existing literature, and a semi-analytical formula for the first correction to the scalar glueball masses is derived.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Holographic correspondence provides a powerful tool to study non-perturbative effects in gauge theories. The study of flux tube profiles is significant for understanding the dynamics of quark confinement and the properties of glueballs in QCD-like theories. This paper contributes to the understanding of the flux tube structure in a strongly-coupled theory by deriving an analytical expression that captures spatial dependence and quantum corrections.

Method: The authors employ the AdS/CFT correspondence to construct a holographic model of the flux tube. They solve the equations of motion for the flux tube profile in the strong coupling limit, considering both the longitudinal and transverse directions. The finiteness of the inter-quark distance and the leading-order correction in the strong coupling expansion are incorporated into the analysis. The relation between the glueball mass and the flux tube width is analyzed by comparing the spectra of glueballs.

Result: The paper presents an analytical expression for the flux tube profile as a function of space-like boundary coordinates. This result extends previous findings by capturing the spatial dynamics of the flux tube. The inter-quark distance and strong coupling corrections are accounted for. The paper confirms that the mass of the lightest glueball is proportional to the intrinsic width of the flux tube. Additionally, a semi-analytical formula for the first-order correction to the scalar glueball masses is derived.

Conclusion: The holographic approach successfully predicts the flux tube profile, incorporating spatial dependence and quantum corrections. The results align with existing literature, validating the current understanding of glueball masses and flux tube properties. The work paves the way for future studies on quantum fluctuations and higher-order corrections in the flux tube dynamics.

Abstract: We use the holographic correspondence as a tool to infer the classical flux
tube profile connecting a static quark-antiquark pair in a $2+1$-dimensional
strongly-coupled large $N$ QCD-like theory. Our final prediction extends
already known results in the literature in several ways. First, it is an
analytical function of both the space-like boundary coordinates; in other
words, we keep track of what happens both along and transversely to the
inter-quark axis. Then, we take into account the finiteness of the inter-quark
distance and the first correction in the strong coupling expansion. To the same
order, we also confirm the relation between the mass of the lightest glueball
in the spectrum and the intrinsic width of the flux tube profile. We conclude
by trying to gain some insights about the quantum fluctuations. Intriguingly,
our proposal is in agreement with widespread expectations in the literature. En
passant, we also derive a semi-analytical formula that gives the first
correction to the scalar glueball masses in the strong coupling expansion.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Are perturbative superstring amplitudes for massless external states just an
$\alpha'$ dressing of super-Yang-Mills/supergravity? This is the case at tree
level, where the worldsheet correlators at $n$ points can be written in a
natural worldsheet basis, such that the kinematic coefficients are BCJ
numerators of super-Yang-Mills/supergravity amplitudes, with the non-trivial
$\alpha'$ dependence carried only by the Koba-Nielsen factor. Motivated by this
construction, we present for the first time a complete worldsheet basis of
one-loop superstring correlators at $n$ points. All the kinematic coefficients
associated to non-cusp basis elements are identified with pieces of one-loop
BCJ numerators of super-Yang-Mills/supergravity. This determines the
superstring correlators up to 15 points in terms of field theory. Starting at
16 points (modular weight 12), the worldsheet basis may include cusp forms,
which vanish in the field-theory degeneration, such that the associated
coefficients cannot be fixed in this manner. Therefore, the one-loop answer to
our initial question is determined, at high multiplicity, by whether the
coefficients of cusp basis elements vanish or not. As a by-product of our
construction, we present new constraints on the field-theory limit that result
from string modularity. These are expressed as additional relations among
one-loop BCJ numerators in maximal super-Yang-Mills/supergravity starting at 6
points.

Abstract: We argue that interacting conformal line defects in free quantum field

bulk-defect-defect three point functions that is invariant under the conformal
group but picks up a sign under inversion. We examine the particular case of a

field interacts via a Yukawa term with fermions on the line. We expect
nontrivial line defects may also exist for free Maxwell theory in four
dimensions and free bulk fermions.

TL;DR: This abstract presents a generalized framework for constructing Kac-Moody (KM) algebras associated with higher-dimensional manifolds, extending the classical loop algebra approach to various group manifolds, coset spaces, and soft deformations. The paper discusses the construction of generalized current algebras, their semidirect extensions with isometry algebras, and central extensions, highlighting their dependence on the underlying manifold's structure. Explicit realizations are provided for SU(2), SU(2)/U(1), and higher-dimensional spheres, revealing connections to Virasoro-like algebras. The paper also touches on compatibility conditions for cocycles, the role of harmonic analysis, and potential applications in higher-dimensional field theories and supergravity compactifications, offering a unified perspective on KM algebras beyond one-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is driven by the desire to generalize Kac-Moody algebras, which are well-established in one-dimensional settings, to higher-dimensional manifolds. The study of KM algebras is significant in mathematics and theoretical physics, particularly in areas such as string theory, conformal field theory, and integrable systems. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework that broadens the applicability of KM algebras, potentially uncovering new mathematical structures and physical models they can describe. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential for applications in higher-dimensional field theories and supergravity compactifications, indicating its relevance to modern theoretical physics and mathematics research.

Method: The authors employ a systematic approach to construct generalized current algebras for higher-dimensional manifolds. They start by reviewing the geometric background necessary for constructing KM algebras, including Riemannian manifolds, Hilbert bases, and Killing vectors. Using this foundation, they define generalized current algebras, explore semidirect extensions with isometry algebras, and incorporate central extensions. The authors then demonstrate how the structure of specific manifolds, such as SU(2), SU(2)/U(1), and spheres, influences the resulting KM algebras. They also discuss compatibility conditions for cocycles and the role of harmonic analysis, providing explicit constructions for illustration. The paper draws connections to Virasoro-like algebras and explores potential applications in theoretical physics, thus creating a unified framework for KM algebras in higher dimensions.

Result: The paper successfully generalizes the construction of KM algebras to higher-dimensional manifolds, presenting a comprehensive framework that extends the classical one-dimensional case. By considering various types of manifolds, including compact groups, coset spaces, and their soft deformations, the authors demonstrate the flexibility and generality of their approach. The explicit constructions for SU(2), SU(2)/U(1), and spheres not only illustrate the methodology but also reveal striking connections to Virasoro-like algebras, which are central extensions of the Witt algebra. These findings suggest a deep relationship between KM algebras and the geometric properties of the underlying manifolds. Furthermore, the paper provides a thorough analysis of compatibility conditions for cocycles and the role of harmonic analysis, which are essential for understanding the structure and representation theory of these generalized KM algebras. The applications to higher-dimensional field theories and supergravity compactifications highlight the practical relevance of the work, offering new avenues for research in theoretical physics. Overall, the paper contributes significantly to the understanding of KM algebras in a multidimensional context, providing a solid foundation for future studies and applications.

Conclusion: This paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of extending KM algebra constructions to higher-dimensional settings, a direction that has previously been underexplored. The authors' framework offers a unified perspective on KM algebras, demonstrating their applicability beyond one-dimensional cases. By providing explicit constructions and connections to physical theories, the paper opens new research directions both in mathematics and physics. The insights gained from this work can inspire further exploration of KM algebras in higher dimensions, potentially leading to new mathematical discoveries and physical models. The authors acknowledge the vast potential of their framework and encourage its extension to other types of manifolds and physical contexts, hinting at further developments that may emerge as a result of this foundational work.

Abstract: In this review, we present a general framework for the construction of
Kac-Moody (KM) algebras associated to higher-dimensional manifolds. Starting
from the classical case of loop algebras on the circle $\mathbb{S}^{1}$, we
extend the approach to compact and non-compact group manifolds, coset spaces,
and soft deformations thereof. After recalling the necessary geometric
background on Riemannian manifolds, Hilbert bases and Killing vectors, we
present the construction of generalized current algebras
$\mathfrak{g}(\mathcal{M})$, their semidirect extensions with isometry
algebras, and their central extensions. We show how the resulting algebras are
controlled by the structure of the underlying manifold, and illustrate the
framework through explicit realizations on $SU(2)$, $SU(2)/U(1)$, and
higher-dimensional spheres, highlighting their relation to Virasoro-like
algebras. We also discuss the compatibility conditions for cocycles, the role
of harmonic analysis, and some applications in higher-dimensional field theory
and supergravity compactifications. This provides a unifying perspective on KM
algebras beyond one-dimensional settings, paving the way for further
exploration of their mathematical and physical implications.

Abstract: We extend the semiclassical black hole microstate construction to include

of black holes. Specifically, we consider a double-sided black hole on a JT
brane with holographic matter, coupled to a pair of holographic CFTs on the
asymptotic boundaries. The dimension of the Hilbert space spanned by the
microstates of this doubly holographic black hole is given by the exponentiated
entropy, which is equal to the sum of the quantum-corrected thermodynamic
entropies of the left and right black holes. Importantly, the quantum-corrected
thermodynamic entropy is shown to be equal to the generalised entropy of the
eternal black hole, and thus can be interpreted as quantifying the entanglement
between the two asymptotic boundaries.

Abstract: We perform a Hamiltonian constraint analysis of the multivielbein theory
proposed in arXiv:1804.09723. The analysis shows that the secondary constraints
have the correct form to constrain the dynamical variables, thereby eliminating
the problematic ghost modes that generally plague theories of interacting

the tertiary constraints and show that these eliminate the canonical momenta
associated with the ghost modes. Our analysis confirms that the theory with $N$
interacting vielbeins propagates $2+5(N-1)$ modes, corresponding to a nonlinear
theory of one massless and $N-1$ massive spin-2 fields free of the
Boulware-Deser ghost instabilities.

Abstract: Recently, BCFT and ICFT have been generalized to the CFT on networks (NCFT).
A key aspect of NCFT is how we connect the CFTs in different edges at the nodes
of the network. For a free scalar field, one naturally requires that the scalar
fields are continuous at the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new junction
condition that instead requires the normal derivative of the scalar field to be
continuous at the node. We demonstrate that this new junction condition is
consistent with the variational principle and energy conservation. Furthermore,
we provide an exact realization of it in a real physical system. As an
application, we analyze the Casimir effect using both the traditional and the
new junction conditions in networks formed by regular polyhedra. Our results
indicate that the new junction condition generally results in a smaller Casimir
effect.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper discusses grand-canonical symmetric orbifolds of CFTs on the sphere and provides a CFT interpretation of the central charge operator $	extcal{I}$ in $AdS_3$ string theoryzech Adult Education Logic.Various modifications have been made to the original text to fit the required format and ensure clarity. The key points are that the authors propose a specific construction for consistent operator product expansions using symmetric orbifolds, noting the role of central operators in the Hilbert space, particularly one representing the central charge of the Virasoro algebra. This appears to offer a framework connecting CFT and string theory in $AdS_3$ spacetime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the operator product expansion and the representation of central charge operators in $AdS_3/CFT_2$ correspondence is crucial for advancing the theoretical foundation of string theory and conformal field theories.

Method: The authors work within the mathematical framework of conformal field theories and their orbifold constructions. They consider symmetric orbifolds of the given conformal field theories on the sphere and analyze the operator product expansion in the resulting Hilbert space.

Result: Through their analysis, the authors propose a construction on the Hilbert space that includes symmetric orbifolds of all degrees, ensuring a consistent operator product expansion. This construction reveals central operators of conformal dimension zero, with one operator representing the central charge of the Virasoro algebra, thereby providing a CFT interpretation of the central charge operator $	extcal{I}$ in $AdS_3$ string theory.

Conclusion: This paper provides evidence for connections between $AdS_3$ string theory and conformal field theory through the interpretation of the central charge operator $	extcal{I}$. The proposed method of using symmetric orbifolds offers a novel approach to understanding operator product expansions in such theoretical contexts.

Abstract: In this letter, we study grand-canonical symmetric orbifolds of conformal
field theories on the sphere. We show that a consistent operator product
expansion can be defined, provided the Hilbert space is taken to be the direct
sum of symmetric orbifolds of all degrees. This Hilbert space contains a tower
of central operators of conformal dimension zero, one of which represents the
central charge of the Virasoro algebra. Our construction thus provides a
conformal field theory interpretation of the central charge operator
$\mathcal{I}$ in $AdS_3$ string theory.

Abstract: We revisit the Lagrangian formulation of stochastic inflation, where the
path-integral approach is employed to derive the Langevin equation governing
the dynamics of long-wavelength fields, in contrast to the standard method
where the Langevin equation is derived directly from the equation of motion of
the full quantum field. Focusing on a massless, minimally coupled scalar field
with quartic self-interaction in a de Sitter background, we re-derive the
formal expression for the influence functional that encapsulates the effects of
short-wavelength fields up to second order in the coupling constant, and
compare our results with those obtained in earlier works. In doing so, we
highlight certain subtleties that have been previously overlooked, including
the non-orthogonality between long- and short-wavelength modes, which we
analyze in detail, as well as the absence of a consistent prescription for
handling general interaction terms in the imaginary part of the influence
functional. The latter issue points to a broader challenge: the lack of a
universally accepted framework for treating the imaginary component of
effective actions.

Motivation:  developing efficient computational methods for quantum technologies is crucial. Quantum systems' simulations often demand significant computational resources, making them impractical for real-time applications such as data fitting or feedback loops. This paper addresses these constraints by proposing the use of a neural network as a surrogate model.

Method:  the surrogate model is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. It is trained to replicate the output of a physics-based solver for Doppler-broadened EIT in a ladder-type scheme involving Rydberg atoms.

Result:  the LSTM-based model achieves near-unity agreement between itself and the physics solver in both resonant and off-resonant regimes. Once trained, the model can produce spectra in milliseconds, offering a computational speed-up of 5000x over traditional numerical methods.

Conclusion: this work demonstrates the potential of LSTM networks in accelerating the simulation of optical quantum systems. The surrogate model is well-suited for real-time signal processing and feedback optimization in quantum sensing applications.

Abstract: Simulations of optical quantum systems are essential for the development of
quantum technologies. However, these simulations are often computationally
intensive, especially when repeated evaluations are required for data fitting,
parameter estimation, or real-time feedback. To address this challenge, we
develop a Long Short-Term Memory neural network capable of replicating the
output of these simulations with high accuracy and significantly reduced
computational cost. Once trained, the surrogate model produces spectra in
milliseconds, providing a speed-up of 5000x relative to traditional numerical
solvers. We focus on applying this technique to Doppler-broadened
Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in a ladder-type scheme for
Rydberg-based sensing, achieving near-unity agreement with the physics solver
for resonant and off-resonant regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
LSTM model on this representative optical quantum system, establishing it as a
surrogate tool capable of supporting real-time signal processing and
feedback-based optimisation.

Abstract: A calculation of the QED vacuum polarization potential in the Coulomb field
of a pointlike nucleus was presented in an earlier publication by the author
and his collaborators. Corrections up to order $\alpha^2 (Z\alpha)^7$ were
evaluated, where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $Z\alpha$ is treated as
an independent variable. These corrections correspond to two-loop Feynman
graphs with proper propagators of fermions in the external field. The
calculation employed a reduction to free QED, leading to free QED Feynman
graphs with up to eight independent loops. The method of calculation is
described here in detail.
