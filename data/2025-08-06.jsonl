While\nprevious work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned\nreaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast\nparticle exchange, the role of slow inter-compartmental exchange remains poorly\nunderstood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction\ndomains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism:\ndelay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly\nin two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify\nscenarios that maximize yield and minimize assembly time, even under conditions\nwhere isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The\nmechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intra-compartmental\nreactions and inter-compartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of\ngeometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We\ndemonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly\nprocesses through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need\nfor fine-tuning local reaction rates.

Each of\nthese protocols involves square pulses with two driving frequencies which are\ninteger multiples of each other. For the first class of protocols, the duration\nof the pulse is changed randomly by an amplitude $dT$ while for the second\nclass we use a random/quasiperiodic dipolar drive, where the quasiperiodicity\nis implemented using the Thue-Morse (TM) or Fibonacci sequences. For both\nprotocols, we identify parameter regimes for which the thermalization of the\ndriven chain is drastically slowed down due to proximity to a two-rate drive\ninduced exact dynamical freezing. We also study the properties of these driven\nsystem moving slightly away from the freezing limit. For the first type of\nprotocols, we show the existence of special value of $dT$ for which the\nthermalization rate remains small and provide an analytic explanation for such\nslow thermalization. For the second class of protocols, in contrast to\nrandom/quasiperiodic drives involving a single frequency studied earlier, we\nfind that the TM quasiperiodic drive leads to a distinctly slower\nthermalization than that for drive protocols which are either periodic or\nfollow a random or quasiperiodic Fibonacci sequence.

Moving toward fault-tolerant\nquantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step\ntoward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux\ncontrol (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and\ncouplers.

It\nexplores the underlying physics, implementation, and potential uses of this\ninnovative laser system, especially in LIDAR technology. Conventional\ndual-frequency comb systems for metrology use two optical frequency combs\nsynchronised via complex feedback loops, which suffer from phase-locking issues\nand raise system cost and fragility. In contrast, single-cavity dual comb\nsystems generate two combs with slightly different repetition rates in the same\ncavity, ensuring mutual coherence and noise cancellation. However, these\nsystems often display unstable regimes and are typically demonstrated only in\nlaboratories. This thesis aims to design, build, characterise, and optimise a\nsingle-cavity polarisation multiplexed fibre laser that produces dual optical\nfrequency combs with enough stability and precision for dual-comb LIDAR. The\nsystem simplifies generation while enhancing applicability. Secondary goals\ninclude analysing the laser intensity dynamics and collaborating with a company\nto address commercial needs and challenges in LIDAR, particularly under harsh\nconditions. Results show stable dual-comb generation with minimal drift (1 Hz\nper hour) and operation over 250 hours. The system achieves sub-millimetre\nprecision in 5-metre ambiguity ranges with a fundamental frep of 39.25 MHz and\nDelta frep of 869 Hz. The findings confirm the regime's robustness for\nhigh-precision ranging while exposing some limits. The thesis also analyses\nbuild-up and propagation dynamics in a single cavity, showing a two-stage\nprocess and how initial spike energy evolution affects successful separation.\nFinally, it offers mitigation strategies for LIDAR systems in harsh\nenvironments."}

These\nmodels have attracted attention due to the discovery of Mathieu moonshine\nphenomena for the elliptic genera of K3 surfaces, and have played a pivotal\nrole in extending Mukai's theorem on classification of symplectic automorphisms\nof $K3$ surfaces. We report on recent progress (arXiv:2402.08719 [hep-th]) in\ncharacterizing topological defects in $K3$ models, generalizing the notion of\nsymmetries to categories of topological operators supported on arbitrary\ncodimension submanifolds with possibly non-invertible fusion rules. Taking\nadvantage of the interpretation of Mukai lattice as the D-brane charge lattice,\nwe present a number of general results for the category of topological defect\nlines preserving the superconformal algebra and spectral flow, obtained by\nstudying their fusion with boundary states. While for certain K3 models\ninfinitely many simple defects, and even a continuum, can occur, at generic\npoints in the moduli space the category is actually trivial, i.e. it is\ngenerated by the identity defect. Furthermore, if a K3 model is at the\nattractor point for some BPS configuration of D-branes, then all topological\ndefects have integral quantum dimension. We also introduce a conjecture that a\ncontinuum of topological defects arises if and only if the K3 model is a\n(possibly generalized) orbifold of a torus model. These general results are\nconfirmed by the analysis of significant examples. We also point out the\nconnection to recent studies of topological defects in the Conway moonshine\nmodule theory (arXiv:2412.21141 [hep-th],arXiv:2504.18619 [hep-th])."}

In this paper, we\nintroduce CKVQA, a framework that applies circuit knitting to variational\nquantum algorithms (VQAs). By employing a quantum circuit architecture search\nadapted to this scenario, CKVQA aims to minimize the sampling overhead by\nidentifying parameterized quantum circuits that achieve a favorable balance\nbetween algorithmic performance and sampling overhead. Additionally, since\ncircuit knitting generates multiple subcircuits, we have developed a\nsubcircuit-level optimization method to accelerate the training of VQAs and\nreduce overall execution time.

One key ingredient of such\nimprovement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the\nqubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant\nquantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step\ntoward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux\ncontrol (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and\ncouplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein\nmagnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits\nor couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux\nbias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In\nthis study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a\nmultiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout\nfor couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits\nand couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise\ncompensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line\ncrosstalk from 56.5$\\,$permille$\\,$to 0.13$\\,$permille$\\,$ which is close to\nstatistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading\nto a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free\ncalculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a\nnear-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight\nthe effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and\nsupporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors."}
