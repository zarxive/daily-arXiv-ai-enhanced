However, existing tuning pathways\nrely predominantly on fully quantum mechanical effects and are typically\ninefficient, resulting in weak NHE signals that limit further progress. In this\nwork, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire\nsuperlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called\nLorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This\nfield-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a\npronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches\nup to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE\noriginating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a\nrecord-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\\mu}mV-1{\\Omega}-1) near van\nHove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude\nlarger than all previously reported NHEs.

To this\nend, Evangelista's Wick&d equation generator was combined with ORCA's native\nAGE code generator in order to implement the many-body residuals required for\nthe RIC-MRCCSD method. Substantial efficiency gains are realized by deriving a\nspin-free formulation instead of the previously reported spin-orbital version\ndeveloped by some of us. Since AGE produces parallelized code, the resulting\nimplementation can directly be run in parallel with substantial speedups when\nexecuted on multiple cores. In terms of runtime, the cost of RIC-MRCCSD is\nshown to be between single-reference RHF-CCSD and UHF-CCSD, even when active\nspace spaces as large as CAS(14,14) are considered. This achievement is largely\ndue to the fact that no reduced density matrices (RDM) or cumulants higher than\nthree-body enter the formalism. The scalability of the method to large systems\nis furthermore demonstrated by computing the ground-state of a vitamin B12\nmodel comprised of an active space of CAS(12, 12) and 809 orbitals.

This reconstruction\nenables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi\nmode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the\nsingle excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level\nsystem is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying\nthat radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework\nthus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population\nand single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then\npresent concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM\nframeworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify\nnumerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the\ncase of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in\na Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for\nincorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics,\nthereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions."}

Similarly to\nhim, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms. In\ncontrast to him, however, we leverage symmetry-based selection rules to\nsuppress emission of single photons by single atoms. A steady state is\ntherefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective\nsymmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes. The novel non-Markovian,\nnon-perturbative method applied allows us to observe a large quantum state of\nlight form and exhibit drastically non-classical statistics once the system\nundergoes a symmetry-breaking transition."}

In particular, we\ndemonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems\nact as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement\nat zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled\nmodes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts\nand squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in\ndifferent mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one\ndescription manifests as entanglement in another.
