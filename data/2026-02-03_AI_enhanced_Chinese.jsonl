The Dirac interactions are constructed from the real and imaginary parts of breather solutions of the DS II system. In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For Abelian TQFTs, the mass formula for topological boundary conditions reduces to the mass formula for particular families of codes.

Ligaments achieve this balance through a highly nonlinear tensile response characterized by a J-shaped curve, featuring an extended \"toe region\" of low force up to intermediate strains followed by an inflection, called the \"heel region\" which marks the onset of nonlinear stiffening. Here, we present a framework for characterizing the defining features of J-curve behavior.

A simplified mathematical model, supported by experimental validation, reveals the performance advantages of J-curve materials in antagonistic arrangements and highlights their unique design space compared with linear elastic systems.

QSPE is fully automated, requiring no pre-set configurations or domain expertise, and can effectively generate a large set of diverse program variants that comprehensively explore the quantum compilation space. To mitigate the possible false positive reports, we propose statevector-based validation as an alternative to measurement-based validation. In our experiments, the QSPE approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in generating 22,770 program variants across multiple quantum computing platforms. By avoiding $\u03b1$-equivalence at the quantum and classical program wise, QSPE can reduce redundant generation and save more than 90\\% of execution cost. Finally, the statevector-based validation method assists QSPE to reduce false alarms and effectively detects 708 miscompilations across multiple quantum libraries.

We validate this approach across three distinct response network topologies, namely (i) a pair of coupled neurons, (ii) a monolayer network of N coupled neurons and (iii) a two-layer multiplex network each composed of FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal units. The response networks inherently exhibit extreme events. Our results demonstrate that influencing just one neuron in the response network with an appropriately tuned driving signal is sufficient to control extreme events across all three configurations. In the two-neuron case, suppression of extreme events occurs due to the breaking of phase-locking between the driving neuron and the targeted response neuron. In the case of monolayer and multiplex networks, suppression of extreme events results from the disruption of protoevent frequency dynamics and a subsequent frequency decoupling of the driven neuron from the rest of the network. We also observe that when the size of the neurons in response network connected to the drive increases, the onset of control occurs earlier indicating a scaling advantage of the method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9a71\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u4e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u54cd\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3001\u5355\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cc\u5c42\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9a71\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u54cd\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u4e24\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3001\u5355\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f71\u54cd\u54cd\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5373\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u5404\u4e2a\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u9a71\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5931\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\uff1b\u5728\u5355\u5c42\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u524d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9891\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u5176\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8026\u5408\u3002\u968f\u7740\u9a71\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u63d0\u524d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u662f\u751f\u7269\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6750\u6599\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6750\u6599\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Using full 3D simulations in cylindrical coordinates, combined with a semi-analytical energy analysis, we show that the vortex preferentially splits along the long axis of the trap, a direction that minimizes the kinetic-energy cost relative to the initial TQV state. Systematic parameter scans reveal that initial quantum fluctuations increase the splitting time and suppress the transient three-core pattern observed in noise-free simulations, whereas stronger nonlinear interactions accelerate the splitting. When the trap is nearly isotropic, the unstable Bogoliubov modes are dominated by both azimuthal quantum number $l_q=3$ and $l_q=2$; this leads to a dynamical sequence where three daughter vortices first form a triangular arrangement, later evolving into a linear chain. For stronger anisotropy, geometric coupling selectively enhances the $l_q=2$ mode, making it the sole dominant channel and resulting directly in linear vortex alignment -- a clear signature of geometry-induced mode competition explained through combined energy-based and Bogoliubov stability analysis.

However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.\n  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper critiques the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, identifies issues with first-class constraints not properly accounted for, and provides a reassessment of gauge transformations and constrained systems using the Stueckelberg trick.", "motivation": "There is interest in understanding unresolved issues in constrained systems, particularly regarding gauge invariance and their implications for quantum theory.", "method": "The paper reviews the algorithm, analyzes its application to first-class constraints, and demonstrates equivalence to Stueckelberg's method through examples.", "result": "Clarifies that not all first-class constraints are independent gauge generators; shows equivalence between certain formalisms and Stueckelberg's approach, with implications for quantization and gauge theory interpretation.", "conclusion": "Recommends this paper to researchers seeking clarification on constrained systems and gauge invariance in quantum field theory."}}

The availability of large-scale data and advanced computational power enables the development of sophisticated models and training strategies, leading to state-of-the-art performance, but it also introduces substantial challenges. Quantum Computing (QC), which exploits quantum mechanisms for computation, has attracted growing attention and significant global investment as it may address these challenges. Consequently, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the integration of these two fields, has received increasing interest, with a notable rise in related studies in recent years. We are motivated to review these existing contributions regarding quantum circuit-based learning models for classical data analysis and highlight the identified potentials and challenges of this technique. Specifically, we focus not only on QML models, both kernel-based and neural network-based, but also on recent explorations of their integration with classical machine learning layers within hybrid frameworks. Moreover, we examine both theoretical analysis and empirical findings to better understand their capabilities, and we also discuss the efforts on noise-resilient and hardware-efficient QML that could enhance its practicality under current hardware limitations. In addition, we cover several emerging paradigms for advanced quantum circuit design and highlight the adaptability of QML across representative application domains.

Lu et al., Phys. Rev. A 100, 012504 (2019)], indicating that the currently accepted value should be revised and that their result may serve as a new reference. In the present work, we determine the NQM of $^{87}$Sr from the molecular method, by combining the experimentally measured nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (NQCCs) of SrO and SrS with highly accurate relativistic calculations of the electric field gradient (EFG) at the Sr nucleus. Electronic correlation is treated at the CCSD(T), CCSD-T and CCSD$\\tilde{\\text{T}}$ levels. The iterative T contribution of the latter, composite scheme was obtained using a newly implemented parallel scheme where the distributed memory tensor library Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF) was made available to the DIRAC code for relativistic molecular calculations through TAPP, the new community standard for tensor operations. All correlated calculations are performed using the exact two-component molecular mean-field Hamiltonian (X2C$\\mathrm{mmf}$).

The method was previously introduced as a tamper detection method for authenticating a single radiation detector in nuclear safeguards and treaty verification scenarios, and works by randomly sampling detector configuration parameters to produce a sequence of spectra that form a baseline signature of an untampered system. At a later date, after potential tampering, the same random sequence of parameters is used to generate another series of spectra that can be compared against the baseline. Anomalies in the series of comparisons indicate changes in detector behavior, which may be due to tampering. One limitation of this original method is that once the detector has `gone downrange' and may have been tampered with, the original baseline is fixed, and a new trusted baseline can never be established if tests at new parameters are required. In this work, we extend our anti-tamper fuzz testing concept to multiple detector units, such that the downrange detector can be compared against a trusted or `golden copy' detector, even despite normal inter-detector manufacturing variations. We show using three NaI detectors that this inter-detector differential fuzz testing can detect a representative attack, even when the tested and golden copy detectors are from different manufacturers and have different performances. Here, detecting tampering requires visualizing the comparison metric vs. the parameter values and not just the sample number; moreover this baseline is non-linear and may require anomaly detection methods more complex than a simple threshold. Overall, this extension to multiple detectors improves prospects for operationalizing the technique in real-world treaty verification and safeguards contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5fae\u5206\u542b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u4e2a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5355\u5143\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u66f4\u6362\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6838\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b89\u5168\u6838\u68c0\u9a8c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6838\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6838arms\u7684\u4e0d\u6269\u6563\u3002\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u5217\u5149\u8c31\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6307\u6807\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cdNaI\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5e76\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002_base\u7ebf\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5355\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5355\u5143\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6838\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

In this study, we investigate how local flows within the networks branch channels interact to collectively govern the global oscillatory dynamics.We find that the measured flow fluxes at intersection nodes obey Kirchhoff's current law. Phase differences exist among the flows in different branches.At the microscopic scale, flow distribution exhibits only brief periods of traffic congestion, which are resolved by the oscillatory flows. By mapping the flow flux vectors onto the magnetic moment vector of spin ice model, we demonstrate that the flow vectors strictly obey the ice-rule of vertex models in statistical physics.Notably, the three branches converging at a Y-shaped node never become blocked simultaneously, thereby preventing traffic congestion and ensuring efficient transmission of nutrients and signals.This intelligent flow control phenomenon offers novel insights for addressing traffic congestion and advances our understanding of frustrated quantum magnetism.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

According to his proposal, the gravitational field equations are the consequence of the first law of thermodynamics applied, locally, to a Rindler observer. Together with the dynamical laws of black holes, Jacobson's approach has become a very strong piece of evidence supporting the intimate connection between gravity, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. Jacobson's approach being formulated for Riemannian geometries, we have wondered what its consequences would be for non-Riemannian geometries, i.e., those that involve torsion, non metricity, or both. The results of our quest have been particularly appealing: we have found that the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action, arguably ``the simplest one'', does not belong to the pool of gravitational theories available for Nature's selection (except in the Riemannian case). In the search of a unique alternative, we have also considered the hypotheses employed in the formulation of the Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity. Together, the two approaches point towards the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a term quadratic in the torsion vector as the one that would be selected by Nature in the non-Riemannian case without non metricity. The same strategy cannot be followed in the full non-Riemannian case as the two approaches are mutually inconsistent.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a generalized gravitational theory derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action in non-Riemannian geometries, considering torsion but not non-metricity. It modifies the teleparallel theory by adding a quadratic correction to the torsion vector, suggesting the theory is more general than the teleparallel Einstein-Hilbert with quadratic corrections. However, full non-Riemannian cases (including non-metricity) require a separate or different approach beyond what is covered in this paper.", "motivation": "The paper is motivated by the intriguing suggestion that Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of the Einstein equations can be generalized to non-Riemannian geometries, particularly by introducing torsion. The motivation is rooted in the desire to explore whether such a derivation can lead to a broad class of gravitational theories or perhaps just specific modifications like teleparallel gravity.", "method": "The method involves analyzing the Euler-Lagrange equations from the modified Euler density, substituting a general coframe field, and solving for the equations of motion. The analysis focuses on exploring the system's dependence on torsion and non-metricity, seeking consistency and compatibility with thermodynamic principles. The role of the contracted Bianchi identity is examined in this context.", "result": "The paper finds that the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled with a quadratic correction in the torsion vector defines a viable gravitational theory in the presence of torsion. However, if non-metricity is also considered alongside torsion, the approach becomes inconsistent, and a different method must be used. Consequently, the paper suggests that for non-Riemannian geometries which include torsion but not non-metricity, the preferred gravitational theory is the one derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action with a carefully chosen quadratic correction to the torsion tensor. In contrast, when both torsion and non-metricity are present, the method employed or the objectives of the theory may need to be revisited, possibly hinting that this case may require a form of regularization or a different theoretical approach altogether.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from this research is that the current framework supports the dominance of a specific class of gravitational theories based solely on torsion modifications. Nevertheless, the compatibility and applicability of this approach when both torsion and non-metricity are involved need to be better understood. The paper leaves open the possibility that further investigation is necessary to fully comprehend the implications of adding non-Riemannian elements to gravitational theories and their compatibility with thermodynamic principles."}}

These findings delineate previously unexplored operating regimes for large-momentum-transfer beam splitters and open new perspectives for precision atom-interferometric measurements in fundamental physics, gravity gradiometry or gravitational wave detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eFloquet\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5149-\u539f\u5b50\u5f39\u6027\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u675f\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u539f\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5f15\u529b\u68af\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528Floquet\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149-\u539f\u5b50\u5f39\u6027\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u6570\u503c\u89e3Schrodinger\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u5f97\u591a\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5149-\u539f\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5149-\u539f\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Here we reconstruct the relative phase of simulated Airy-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates in free space, a regime approached in microgravity, from interference fringes. The cubic phase dynamics are quantified via windowed polynomial fits with systematics-aware uncertainty estimates that account for window-induced correlations. We compare two experimentally feasible phase-extraction methods - heterodyne-based and density-based - and show that an Airy-Gaussian geometry yields substantially improved robustness to fit-window selection relative to an Airy-Airy collision. In the weakly interacting regime, the extracted cubic coefficient responds linearly to the effective one-dimensional interaction strength.

We compute the static tidal response of unspinning charged black holes at arbitrary radius, using the perturbative formalism developed in 2501.18684. Since the gravitational and electromagnetic tidal responses mix, we generalize the notion of Love numbers to Love matrices. We derive the coupled equations of motion for the metric and electromagnetic fluctuations around purely electric and magnetic backgrounds. For large charged black holes, which are described by the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity, we compute the full set of Love matrices induced by an arbitrary tower of $F^{2n}$ operators. We find that, although quantum corrections break electromagnetic duality, the Love matrices in electric and magnetic backgrounds are related by a $Z_2$ symmetry under electric-magnetic exchange. Going beyond EFT, we compute the Love matrices of small magnetic black holes. We show that the running of the Love matrices is governed by the running of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and we derive the correspondence between Love and $U(1)$ beta functions for arbitrary harmonics. The overall picture that emerges is that the QFT-induced tidal response of magnetic black holes saturates in the strong-field regime.

Here, we show that VHSs in multi-orbital systems can stabilize a variety of competing $\\bm{Q}=0$ magnetic orders, including intrinsic altermagnetism emerging from spontaneous orbital antiferromagnetism. This intrinsic phase, in which antiparallel spins reside on distinct orbitals, is realized across all four 2D Bravais lattices. It is driven by orbital-resolved spin fluctuations enhanced by inter-orbital hopping and favors suppressed Hund's coupling $J_H$, strong inter-orbital hybridization, and filling near a VHS from quadratic band touching. Through Hubbard-$U$-$J_H$ phase diagrams we map several magnetic phase transitions: (i) ferrimagnet to $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet, (ii) $d$-wave intrinsic altermagnet to ferromagnet, and (iii) $g$-wave extrinsic altermagnet to either $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet or ferromagnet.

To extend QKD over long distances, networks of trusted repeater nodes can be used, wherein QKD is executed between neighbouring nodes and messages between non-neighbouring nodes are forwarded using a relay protocol. Although these networks are being deployed worldwide, no protocol exists which provides provable guarantees of integrity against manipulation from both external adversaries and corrupted intermediates. In this work, we present the first protocol that provably provides both confidentiality and integrity. Our protocol combines an existing cryptographic technique, Algebraic Manipulation Detection (AMD) codes, with multi-path relaying over trusted repeater networks. This protocol achieves Information Theoretic Security (ITS) against the detection of manipulation, which we prove formally through a sequence of games.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Nevertheless, getting a template is, by definition, limited to three-dimensional objects, since based on knot theory.

There is no dimensional limitation in the concept of templex. Here, we show that a templex can be automatically reduced into a ``minimal'' form to provide a comprehensive and synthetic view of the main properties of chaotic attractors. This reduction allows for the development of a taxonomy of chaos in terms of two elementary units: the oscillating unit (O-unit) and the switching unit (S-unit). We apply this approach to various well-known attractors (R\u00f6ssler, Lorenz, and Burke-Shaw) as well as a non-trivial four-dimensional attractor. A case of toroidal chaos (Deng) is also treated. This work is dedicated to Otto E.

The absorption lineshape is given by the Fourier transform of the electric dipole autocorrelation function, which is obtained from a real-time simulation. Approximations of the lowest-energy EA- and IP-EOMCC eigenstates, which are required as initial states for the real-time simulation, are generated by propagating a Koopman EA/IP state in imaginary time.

By introducing perturbations, in the form of many-body quantum-jump processes, these higher-order EPs break down, leading to finite Liouvillian gaps with fractional power-law scalings. While the power-law scaling is a signature of the higher-order EP, its explicit form is sensitively dependent on the many-body perturbation.

Gamma spectroscopy survey is further broken down into wide-area search performed with large-volume scintillator-based mobile survey spectrometers which are integrated with geographic position sensors for mapping and identification of hot zones, and high-precision long-dwell measurements using solid state spectrometers for follow-on characterization to establish isotopic content and ratios. While performing well at detecting the presence, quantity and type of radioactivity, all of these methods have limited ability to determine the location of a source of radioactivity. In recent years, technology advances have resulted in gamma imager devices which can create an image of the distribution of radioactive sources using the gamma emissions which accompany radioactive decay, and overlay this on an optical photograph of the environment. These gamma imaging devices have arisen out of methods developed for medical physics, experimental particle physics, and astrophysics, resulting in a proliferation of different technological approaches. Those responsible for establishing a nuclear security concept of operations, require guidance to choose the proper gamma imager for each of the application spaces in a tiered response. Here the results of an intercomparison of two gamma imagers based on two widely different technologies, semiconductor and scintillator detectors, are presented. The optimal utilization of these imaging technologies in a tiered response is discussed based on the results of the trial.

The accuracy of this sensing, for small numbers of molecules, is limited by shot noise. Corresponding theoretical limits on sensing precision, as a function of sensing duration, have been well-studied in the context of quasi-static and randomly fluctuating concentrations. However, during development and in many other cases, concentration profiles are not random but exhibit predictable spatiotemporal patterns. We propose that leveraging prior knowledge of these structured profiles can improve and accelerate concentration sensing by utilizing information from current molecular binding events to predict future concentrations. By framing the constrained sensing problem as Bayesian inference over an allowed class of spatiotemporal profiles, we derive new theoretical limits on sensing accuracy. Our analysis reveals that maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation can outperform the classical Berg-Purcell and maximum-likelihood (Poisson counting) limits, achieving a sensing precision of $\u03b4c/c = 1/\\sqrt{a^2N}$, where $N$ is the number of binding events, and $a > 1$ in certain cases. Thus knowledge of the statistical structure of concentration profiles enhances sensing precision, providing a potential explanation for the rapid yet highly accurate cell fate decisions observed during development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6d53\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d53\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u5173\u952e\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178Berg-Purcell\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u03b4c/c=1/(a\u00b2N)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e86\u89e3\u6d53\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7ec6\u80de\u53d1\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u800c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002"}}

Continuous-wave near-infrared diffuse optical imaging relies on accurate differential pathlength factors (DPFs) for quantitative chromophore estimation. Existing DPF definitions inherit formulation-dependent limitations that can introduce large errors in modified Beer--Lambert law analyses. These errors are significantly higher at smaller source-detector separations in a reflectance mode of measurement. This minimizes their applicability in situations where large area detection is used and also when signal depth is varying. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we derive two distance- and property-dependent DPF models one ideal and one experimentally practical and benchmark them against standard formulations.

The programme measured HTTS, LTTS, and 2 K isothermal/non-isothermal loads under \"standard\", \"linac\", and \"simulated dynamic\" operating modes, recording data both inside the cryomodule and across the bayonet can circuits. Thermal-acoustic oscillations were eliminated by replacing the original G10 cooldown-valve stem with a stainless-steel stem fitted with wipers. A newly developed Python script automated acquisition of ACNET data, performed real-time heat-load calculations, and generated plots and tables that were posted to the electronic logbook within minutes, vastly reducing manual effort and accelerating feedback between SRF and cryogenics teams. Analysis showed that JT heat-exchanger effectiveness and temperature stratification in the two-phase and relief piping strongly influence the observed loads and helped isolate sources of excess heat.

This description provides a clear physical account of how distinguishability gives rise to effective noise in Gaussian boson sampling protocols while enabling a systematic investigation of phase effects arising from the overlap of the internal states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Attractors in state space can be studied using Branched Manifold Analysis through Homologies: this strategy constructs a cell complex from a cloud of points in state space and uses homology groups to characterize its topology. The approach, however, does not consider the action of the flow on the cell complex. The procedure is here extended to take this fundamental property into account, as done with templates. The goal is achieved endowing the cell complex with a directed graph that prescribes the flow direction between its highest dimensional cells. The tandem of cell complex and directed graph, baptized templex, is shown to allow for a sophisticated characterization of chaotic attractors and for an accurate classification of them.

As a decisive factor of the confinement effect, the size of nanocapillary significantly affects the critical crystallization pressure and crystalline structure, especially for multi-layered ices. By choosing square ice as a typical two-dimensional (2D) multi-layered ice pattern and using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we further unveil the variation mechanism of critical crystallization pressure with the nanocapillary size. The results show a strong dependence of the critical crystallization pressure on the size of the graphene sheet for monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer square ice. The quasi-macroscopic crystallization pressure, the actual pressure of water molecules, and the freezable region between them are all strongly dependent on the nanocapillary width. As the size of the capillary becomes larger in all three directions, the critical crystallization pressure converges to the true macroscopic crystallization pressure, which is very close to the value of the crystallization pressure for bulk ice. A direct correlation is established between 2D square ice and three-dimensional (3D) bulk ice by the critical crystallization pressure.

Here, we introduce peripheral surface information (PSI) entropy, a quantitative measure of the statistical variability in apolar and charged non-interacting surface (NIS) proportions across conformational ensembles. Using energy-directed molecular docking via HADDOCK3 and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that favorable binding partners exhibit emergent, low-entropy N-states (discrete macrostates in NIS state space) indicative of preferential apolar/charged surface configurations. Across dozens of peptides and multiple receptor systems (WW, PDZ, and MDM2 domains), dominant N-states persisted under varied docking parameters and initial conditions. An experimental meta-ensemble of WW domains from 36 high-resolution structures confirmed the presence of dominant NIS modes independent of in silico methodology, suggesting an evolutionary selection pressure toward specific NIS fingerprints.

We characterize the efficiencies and fidelities of all these steps and evaluate the sensitivity of this approach to measuring $d_e$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u51b7YbF\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9 $d_e$\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4ece\u51b7\u5374\u5206\u5b50\u5230\u6d4b\u91cf\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9 $d_e$ \u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u7535\u5b50\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9 $d_e$ \u662f\u4e86\u89e3\u539f\u5b50\u6838\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\uff0cOur work\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u51b7YbF\u5206\u5b50\u7684Raman transition\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u6001\u7684\u5236\u5907\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u7535\u573a\u4e2d\u8ba9\u5206\u5b50\u6f14\u8fdb\u800c\u8bfb\u51fa\u76f8\u4f4d\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u6b65\u9aa4\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6805\u6765\u51b7\u5374\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u5904\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0Raman \u8f6c\u6362\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u65cb\u8d85\u7f6e\uff0c\u53d7\u5e73\u884c\u573a\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u518d\u6b21Raman\u8f6c\u6362\u5c06\u76f8\u4f4d\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53cc\u8d85fine\u6001\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u7387\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bfb\u51fa\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f62\u53c2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u7ea6 $10^{-26} e\text{\u00b7cm}$ \u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5fae\u7c92\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u539f\u5b50\u6838\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

A critical step in any genome sequencing technique is genome assembly. However, de novo genome assembly, which involves constructing an entire genome sequence from scratch without a reference genome, presents significant challenges due to its high computational complexity, affecting both time and accuracy. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach utilizing a quantum computing-based optimization algorithm integrated with classical pre-processing to expedite the genome assembly process. Specifically, we present a method to solve the Hamiltonian and Eulerian paths within the genome assembly graph using gate-based quantum computing through a Higher-Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulation with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm (VQE), in addition to a novel bitstring recovery mechanism to improve optimizer traversal of the solution space. A comparative analysis with classical optimization techniques was performed to assess the effectiveness of our quantum-based approach in genome assembly. The results indicate that, as quantum hardware continues to evolve and noise levels diminish, our formulation holds a significant potential to accelerate genome sequencing by offering faster and more accurate solutions to the complex challenges in genomic research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7ec4\u88c5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u9057\u4f20\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4 sequencing \u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u9057\u4f20\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u75be\u75c5\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u7684\u5173\u952e\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7ec4\u88c5\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528Higher-Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) \u548c Variational Quantum Eigensolver\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08VQE\uff09\u6765\u6c42\u89e3\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7ec4\u88c5\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u548c\u6b27\u62c9\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f4d\u4e32\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u904d\u5386\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7ec4\u88c5\u56fe\u5e76\u6c42\u89e3\u5176\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u548c\u6b27\u62c9\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u9057\u4f20\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4 sequencing \u548c\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u4f20\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u671b\u5728\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

One such pattern appears in the frontal aspect ratio. Smaller animals like insects typically adopt a landscape frontal aspect ratio, with a wider side-to-side base of support than center of mass height. Larger animals like elephants, however, are taller than wide with a portrait aspect ratio. Known explanations for postural scaling are restricted to animal groups with similar anatomical and behavioural motifs, but the trend in frontal aspect ratio transcends such commonalities. Here we show that vertebrates and invertebrates with diverse body plans, ranging in mass from 28 mg to 22000 kg, exhibit size-dependent scaling of the frontal aspect ratio driven by the need for lateral stability on uneven natural terrain. Because natural terrain exhibit scale-dependent unevenness, and the frontal aspect ratio is important for lateral stability during locomotion, smaller animals need a wider aspect ratio for stability. This prediction is based on the fractal property of natural terrain unevenness, requires no anatomical or behavioural parameters, and agrees with the measured scaling despite vast anatomical and behavioural differences. Furthermore, a statistical phylogenetic comparative analysis found that shared ancestry and random trait evolution cannot explain the measured scaling. Thus, our findings reveal that terrain roughness, acting through natural selection for stability, likely drove the macroevolution of frontal shape in terrestrial animals.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this regime the only principal difference between the collisions with these atomic systems lies in the masses of their positively charged constituents. We have shown that the corresponding mass effects strongly influence the spectra of the target fragments and the total cross sections. This influence manifests itself via i) the significantly smaller binding energy in positronium resulting in smaller momentum transfers necessary to break the system, ii) a strong constructive interference between the inelastic scattering of the projectile on the electron and the positron in collisions with positronium that also increases the chances for the breakup and iii) the \"passive\" role of the hydrogen nucleus caused by its heavy mass that prohibits hydrogen ionization to proceed via the interaction between the projectile and the nucleus.", "AI": {"tldr": "This abstract discusses the breakup of positronium and the ionization of atomic hydrogen during weak perturbation collisions.

We show that the behaviour can be understood in terms of weakly-interacting repulsively-bound few-body clusters. Signatures of cluster behaviour are observed in the expectation values of observables which oscillate at frequencies characterised by the energies of few-body boundstates. Using a semiclassical theory for interacting clusters, we predict the long-time growth of the cloud width to be a power law in the logarithm of time.

We use food-grade dye Tartrazine as a scatter reducing agent to enhance depth sensitivity and weak-absorber detectability in CW diffuse reflectance measurements. We found that reflectance signal was enhanced when the dye was applied on chicken breast phantom. However, we saw reduced reflectance sensitivity when the dye was uniformly dissolved in intralipid phantom which is a commonly used for NIR imaging studies. This shows that the gradient of refractive index modulation created as the dye diffuses from the top layer allows increased reflectance signal sensitivity of optical photons. However, when the scatter reduction is uniform throughout the phantom (like in intralipid phantom), the improved reflectance sensitivity was not observed. Our study points to significant redistribution of photons with scatter modulation with Tartrazine dye. We show significant improvement in sensitivity to signals with reflectance imaging. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of dye induced scatter reduction in tissue, analytical diffusion models and Monte Carlo simulations were employed. Modeling results show the impact of refractive index gradient created due to dye diffusion in enhancing reflectance sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that dye induced scatter reduction provides a practical, low-complexity approach to improving depth sensitivity in CW diffuse reflectance measurements and extend the functional capabilities of CW-NIRS systems for deep-tissue sensing applications.

In this article, we use an operational work definition that is non-intrusive, applying it to the case of a driven dissipative qubit, where the qubit's initial preparation comprises coherent superposition states, while the driving is coherence-less. We derive an evolution equation for the moment generating function for this work, faithfully capturing the thermodynamic signature of coherent superpositions in the initial ensemble. We demonstrate that different initial ensembles that correspond to the same density matrix upon ensemble average, while having the same average work, display different work fluctuations. For monotonic driving, we show that fluctuations are maximum for coherence-less initial ensembles. As an application, we consider quantum bit-erasure in finite time and demonstrate significantly different work statistics for erasing a classical bit of information versus a Haar random initial ensemble. Our results indicate that coherence in the initial ensemble can be utilized as a resource for thermodynamic precision without incurring additional dissipative work costs. We also obtain a generalized fluctuation theorem that establishes a new quantum lower bound on the mean dissipated work.

Although traditional TS generation methods are computationally expensive, recent generative modeling approaches have enabled chemically meaningful TS prediction for relatively small molecules. However, these methods fail to generalize to practically relevant reaction substrates because of distribution shifts induced by increasing molecular sizes. Furthermore, TS geometries for larger molecules are not available at scale, making it infeasible to train generative models from scratch on such molecules. To address these challenges, we introduce FragmentFlow: a divide-and-conquer approach that trains a generative model to predict TS geometries for the reactive core atoms, which define the reaction mechanism. The full TS structure is then reconstructed by re-attaching substituent fragments to the predicted core. By operating on reactive cores, whose size and composition remain relatively invariant across molecular contexts, FragmentFlow mitigates distribution shifts in generative modeling. Evaluated on a new curated dataset of reactions involving reactants with up to 33 heavy atoms, FragmentFlow correctly identifies 90% of TSs while requiring 30% fewer saddle-point optimization steps than classical initialization schemes. These results point toward scalable TS generation for high-throughput reactivity studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Their performance is, however, limited by radiation induced degradation of the gain layer, primarily driven by acceptor removal. This study presents a systematic comparison of how the degradation evolves with different incident proton energies, using LGADs from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and The Institute of Microelectronics of Barcelona (IMB-CNM) irradiated with 18 MeV, 24 MeV, 400 MeV and 23 GeV protons and fluences up to 2.5x10^15 p/cm2. Electrical characterization is used to extract the acceptor removal coefficients for different proton energies, whereas IR TCT measurements offer complementary insight into the gain evolution in LGADs after irradiation. Across all devices, lower energy protons induce stronger gain layer degradation, confirming expectations. However, 400 MeV protons consistently appear less damaging than both lower and higher energy protons, an unexpected deviation from a monotonic energy trend. Conversion of proton fluences to 1 MeV neutron-equivalent fluences reduces but does not eliminate these differences, indicating that the standard Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) scaling does not fully account for the underlying defect formation mechanisms at different energies and requires revision when considering irradiation fields that contain a broader spectrum of particle types and energies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are prone to degradation due to proton irradiation.

These metabolites cycle between charged (high-energy) and uncharged (low-energy) states to mediate energy transfer.

Thus, their energetic states are generally coupled and influence each other, which would hinder the independent regulation of different currency metabolites. Despite the extensive knowledge of the molecular biology of individual currency metabolites, it remains poorly understood how the coordination of various coupled currency metabolites shapes metabolic regulation, efficiency, and ultimately the evolution of organisms. Here, we present a minimal theoretical model of metabolic currency coupling and reveal a fundamental tradeoff relationship between metabolic controllability and thermodynamic cost: increasing the capacity to independently regulate multiple currency metabolites generally requires comparable abundances of those metabolites, which in turn incurs a higher entropy production rate. The tradeoff suggests that in complex environments, organisms evolutionarily favor an equal abundance of currency metabolites to enhance metabolic controllability at the expense of a higher thermodynamic cost; conversely, in simple environments, organisms evolve to have imbalanced amounts of them to reduce heat dissipation.

We reach the conclusion that solutions which violate the radial and lateral null energy condition in the context of general relativity may still adhere to the energy conditions within the realm of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. To begin with, by utilizing a linear equation of state for radial pressure, we obtain a power-law shape function. Additionally, we investigate solutions defined by a variable equation of state parameter. A broad spectrum of non-exotic wormhole solutions has been identified, contingent upon the particular parameters of the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6269\u5c55 $f(Q,T)$ \u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u866b\u6d1e\u89e3\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b $f(Q,T)=\u03b1Q+ \u03b2T$ \u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e00\u4e9b\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728 $f(Q,T)$ \u5f15\u529b\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u866b\u6d1e\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u7684 $f(Q,T)$ \u5f15\u529b\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5206\u6790 $f(Q,T)$ \u5f15\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u866b\u6d1e\u89e3\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u51fd\u6570", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u866b\u6d1e\u89e3\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u7684 $f(Q,T)$ \u5f15\u529b\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u866b\u6d1e\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027"}}

We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of caesium dimers correlated to 402P3/2 Rydberg states, with an emphasis on decay via autoionisation (associative ionisation). Our model includes a relativistic treatment of electron-atom scattering with spin-orbit coupling, the perturber's hyperfine structure, and coupling of vibrational levels to a continuum of short-range decay channels. Calculated potential-energy curves predict two families of wells: outer wells near the classical outer turning point supporting long-lived states, and inner wells at shorter range whose lifetimes are limited by tunneling and subsequent vibronic decay. Using photoassociation in an ultracold Cs gas and an analysis of pulsed-field-ionisation signals which are highly selective for the detection of molecules, we assign resonances by binding energy and measure lifetimes. The measured lifetimes of inner-well states increase systematically with increasing detuning and agree with calculated lifetimes; detection of Cs2+ product ions supports autoionisation as a dominant channel. We show that the lifetimes are strongly reduced by spin-orbit interactions in the transient Cs-collision complex, which lift the near-degeneracy in Omega observed for states in the outer well and control the inner-well binding. The identified states also provide promising pathways to create ultracold molecules in ion-pair states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u94ef\u539f\u5b50\u4e8c\u805a\u4f53\u5728402P3/2\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u957f\u671f\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u9000\u884c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u6001\u56e0\u80fd\u5792\u8f83\u5bbd\u8f83\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u6001\u56e0\u4e3a\u80fd\u5792\u8f83\u7a84\u4e14\u53d7ique\u6548\u5e94\u9650\u5236\u5bff\u547d\u8f83\u77ed\uff0c\u7528\u5149\u8bf1\u7ed3\u5408\u52bfSie\u65b9\u6cd5\u89c2\u5bdf\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u81ea\u79bb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6001\u5bff\u547d\u53d7\u6001\u6001\u8dc3\u8fc1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u4eba\u5bff\u547d\u548c\u9000\u884c\u673a\u5236\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u6e29\u539f\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6001\u5bff\u547d\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u7740\u5229\u7528\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5b50\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u6001\u80fd\u8c31\u548c\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u7528\u8d85\u51b7\u94ef\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u8bf1\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u5b50\u6001\u548c\u81ea\u79bb\u5316\u79bb\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u6001\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5916\u5c42\u6001\u56e0\u80fd\u5792\u5bbd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u72b6\u6001\u80fd\u7ea7\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u5bff\u547d\u8f83\u957f\uff1b\u5185\u5c42\u6001\u7531\u4e8e\u80fd\u5792\u7a84\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6001\u6001\u8dc3\u8fc1\u4e0b\u5bff\u547d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u7ec6\u8282\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u94ef\u539f\u5b50\u4e8c\u805a\u4f53\u7684\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u6001\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5916\u5c42\u52bf\u5792\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u6001\u7531\u4e8eique\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9650\u5236\u5bff\u547d\u8f83\u77ed\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6001\u65cf\u90fd\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7528\u6765\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\uff0c\u81ea\u79bb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9000\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7ed3\u8bba\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u5b50\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fient\u539f\u5b50\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This reformulation enables explicit construction of Yang-Mills-type interactions and current couplings.

Here, we theoretically investigate the quantum geometry of Dirac EPs realized in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, utilizing fidelity susceptibility as a probe. We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs.

Since the early development of the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology, it has been clear that progress requires detailed knowledge of the momentum- and frequency-dependent charge susceptibility, $\u03c7(\\mathbf{q},\u03c9)$, particularly at large momenta. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $\u03c7(\\mathbf{q},\u03c9)$. However, measurements over the past four decades have yielded conflicting results, with some studies reporting a dispersing RPA-like plasmon and others observing a strongly overdamped, incoherent response.

To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q < 0.15$ \u00c5$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q > 0.15$ \u00c5$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works.

However, real objects deviate from a perfect sphere and may be prolate or oblate. There are several solutions of the EFE that represent the spacetime of deformed objects.

The HT metric has several versions, and two of them were selected to test their validity. The traditional HT version, which contains logarithmic terms, is less accurate than the version with exponential terms.

However, the lack of robust polarization control has remained a critical obstacle to the deployment of gas-based fiber sources. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by demonstrating the generation of highly-polarized Stokes light via stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in a nitrogen-filled polarization-maintaining anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (PM-HCF). By exploiting the strong structural birefringence of the fiber, the Raman interaction becomes polarization-decoupled along the principal birefringence axes, leading to threshold-selective Raman amplification and an intrinsic polarization purification mechanism. As a result, the vibrational Raman Stokes emission exhibits a polarization extinction ratio (PER) of 35 dB, even when the incident pump PER is as low as ~2 dB. Through analytical theory and numerical modeling, we validate the underlying polarization-selective Raman dynamics and identify the fiber platform as the dominant factor governing the observed PER saturation. We further show that this high polarization purity and high conversion efficiency is maintained under tight bending conditions with radii down to 5 cm, in stark contrast to conventional non-PM-HCF. These results establish PM-HCFs as a robust and scalable architecture for generating polarization-stable, frequency-shifted light, and indicate that polarization may be treated as an actively engineerable degree of freedom in gas photonics, paving the way toward deployment-ready gas-based fiber sources for precision metrology, quantum communication, and coherent sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a method to generate highly polarized Stokes light using a nitrogen-filled polarization-maintaining anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (PM-HCF) relying on stimulated Raman scattering (SRS).

Overcoming limitations in polarization control in gas-filled fibers is a significant challenge that this work addresses.", "method": "The researchers used a nitrogen-filled PM-HCF coupled with SRS. The fiber's structural birefringence allows for polarization-decoupled Raman interaction, leading to selective amplification and polarization purification. Analytical theory and numerical modeling were used to validate the polarization dynamics and identify the fiber as the key factor governing the observed polarization performance.", "result": "The fiber demonstrated a high polarization purity (PER of 35 dB) and remained polarization-stable under tight bending. The results outperform conventional non-PM-HCF fibers, establishing PM-HCF as a robust platform for generating highly polarized, frequency-shifted light.", "conclusion": "This work demonstrates that polarization can be actively controlled and optimized in gas photonics using PM-HCF. The findings pave the way for the deployment of gas-based fiber sources for various high-precision applications."}}

Uncertainties in the oscillator strengths of specific lines used for abundance analyses directly translate into uncertainties in the derived elemental abundances; incomplete or biased atomic data sets can impart significant errors in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) modelling. Theoretical calculations of atomic data are therefore crucial to supplement the limited experimental results. In this work, we present extensive atomic data, including oscillator strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes for 1730 electric-dipole (E1) transitions among 107 levels in neutral sulphur (S I) using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic-configuration-interaction (RCI) methods. These levels belong to the configurations $\\mathrm{3p^3np (n=3-7)}$, $\\mathrm{3p^3nf (n=4,5)}$, $\\mathrm{3s3p^5}$, $\\mathrm{3p^3ns (n=4-7)}$, and $\\mathrm{3p^3nd (n=3-6)}$. The accuracy of the computed transition rates is assessed by combining the comparison of the differences in transition rates between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges with a cancellation-factor (CF) analysis. Approximately 16% of the ab initio results achieved an accuracy classification of A-B, corresponding to uncertainties within 10%, as defined by the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST ASD). Applying a fine-tuning technique was found to significantly improve the accuracy of the results in the Coulomb gauge, thereby improving the consistency between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges; about 24% of the fine-tuned transition data are assigned to the accuracy classes A-B.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here we show that this fragility leaves a clear experimental fingerprint in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain of as few as 14 Rydberg atoms. Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features. We establish non-local observables as a sensitive probe of fragile conservation laws in quantum spin chains and Rydberg-atom arrays as a platform to test perturbative descriptions of quantum many-body dynamics with weak integrability breaking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u4e2d\u8106\u5f31\u4fdd\u5b88\u91cf\u7684\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8106\u5f31\u4fdd\u5b88\u91cf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf14\u4e2aRydberg\u539f\u5b50\u6784\u6210\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u4e2d\u5f31\u7834\u574f\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7efc\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f31\u7834\u574f\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7efc\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38\u589e\u957f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u88ab\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0cRydberg\u539f\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8106\u5f31\u4fdd\u5b88\u91cf\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

This distinction is well established in the presence of infrared effects, long-range correlations, and environmental interactions, and becomes particularly relevant in supersymmetric theories, where fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom are constrained at the algebraic level but need not share identical asymptotic behavior. In this work we introduce a minimal and predynamical localization criterion that distinguishes algebraically allowed degrees of freedom from those capable of forming stable, phasecoherent asymptotic states. The criterion is formulated in terms of long-time stability under slow structural fluctuations of an effective background, without modifying the underlying field equations or introducing new physical interactions. We show that fermionic and scalar fields respond qualitatively differently to such structural effects. While fermionic modes may retain asymptotic stability, scalar modes generically exhibit decoherence and damping, preventing their interpretation as localized one-particle states. This provides a conservative and model-independent perspective on how supersymmetric algebraic structures may coexist with an asymmetric observable particle spectrum. The analysis is intentionally non-constructive and does not rely on specific supersymmetrybreaking mechanisms, cosmological assumptions, or new dynamical ingredients. Rather, it clarifies localization as an independent structural requirement for particle existence within standard quantum field theory.", "AI": {"tldr":

The resonant frequency of the ring electrode can be flexibly detuned from the target operation frequency by adjusting its inner and outer radii, while the smooth, edge-free geometry minimizes the lightning-rod effect. These design features collectively lead to a pronounced suppression of localized THz field enhancement. Numerical simulations reveal an 8.48x reduction in the local field strength compared with conventional rod-shaped electrodes. Consistent with this, experimental measurements on graphene-based detectors exhibit a 6.95x decrease in photocurrent for the ring-shaped electrode relative to the rod-shaped configuration. Moreover, the ring geometry effectively reduces the linear polarization ratio of the photocurrent from >3 to <1.4, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating electrode-induced polarization anisotropy.

In this work, we investigate this transition by analyzing the time evolution of the survival probability, the single-site entanglement entropy, and the half-chain imbalance. Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity.

The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in disordered systems such as the diffusion length and the localization length. However, in disordered systems with vanishing or nearly vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain what determines the important length scales in such systems. In this work, we use the 1D Lieb lattice with isolated flat bands as an example to show that the quantum metric length (QML) is a fundamental length scale in the ballistic, diffusive and localization regimes. The QML is defined through the Bloch state wave functions of the flat bands. In the ballistic regime with short junctions, the QML controls the finite energy transport properties. In the localization regime with long junctions, the localization length is determined by the QML and remarkably, independent of disorder strength over a wide range of disorder strength. We call this unconventional localization regime, the quantum metric localization regime. In the diffusive regime, we demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient is linearly proportional to the QML via the wave-packet dynamics numerically. Importantly, the numerical results are consistent with the analytical results obtained through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We conclude that the QML is a fundamentally important length scale governing the properties of disordered flat band materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u957f\u5ea6\uff08QML\uff09\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u672a Anderson \u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7684 1D \u674e\u5e03\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u957f\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0 Anderson \u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u957f\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6ce2\u5305\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d1d\u5854-\u8428\u5c14\u5e15\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0 QML \u5728\u7d27\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5408\u3001\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u522b\u8d77\u63a7\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u957f\u5ea6\u662f\u65e0 Anderson \u5c40\u57df\u5316\u6750\u6599\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5173\u952e\u957f\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002"}}

For Haar random two qubit unitaries, our techniques typically lead to non-trivial lower bounds. Further, we obtain lower bounds on most of the commonly studied two qubit quantum gates, including CNOT, DCNOT, $\\sqrt{\\text{SWAP}}$, and the XX interaction, none of which previously had known lower bounds. For the CNOT gate, one of our techniques gives a tight lower bound, fully resolving its entanglement cost. The resulting lower bounds have parallel repetition properties, and apply in the noisy setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u5e38\u89c1\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5355\u5143\u95e8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u5355\u5143\u95e8\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e24\u6bd4\u7279\u968f\u673a\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u5982CNOT\u7b49\uff0c\u66f4\u5f97\u5230\u7d27\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6210\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In this study, we focus on the quantum nature inherent in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems, which from the perspective of spectral theory corresponds to non-Hermiticity. Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized.

We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $\u03b7$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO.

In the scenario of three physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation disrupts quantum steering, with the maximum steering asymmetry during the two-way steering to one-way steering transition precisely demarcating the phase boundary between these regimes. For two physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation exhibits dual behavior: enhancing the steering from Alice and Bob to anti-Charlie under certain parameters while suppressing it under others, while net strengthening other steering types.

Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature.

At first sight, this embedding suggests that operations acting on the Hawking radiation could modify the information in the code subspace, potentially leading to an apparent violation of causality. Indeed, in previous studies based on the PSSY model, which incorporates only the topological degrees of freedom of gravity, it was shown that when the error is sufficiently large, a violation of causality can arise, as indicated by a nonvanishing mutual information. In this paper, we investigate the situation in which dynamical gravity also acts on the Hawking radiation. In this case, operations on the Hawking radiation induce nontrivial backreaction on the bulk spacetime appearing in the gravitational path integral for the mutual information -- an effect that is absent when the Hawking radiation is non-gravitating.

Here, based on group theory analysis, we present a scheme for rapidly identifying the Weyl-Dirac nodal lines (a complex of Weyl and Dirac nodal lines) in bosonic systems. We find only 5 of the 230 space groups host Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons. Notably, the Dirac nodal line resides along the high-symmetry line, whereas the Weyl nodal line is distributed on the high-symmetry plane and is interconnected with the Dirac nodal line, jointly forming a composite nodal network structure. Unlike traditional nodal nets, this nodal network exhibits markedly distinct surface states on different surfaces, which can be attributed to the fundamental differences in the topological properties between the Weyl and Dirac nodal lines. This unique property thus allows the material to present distinct surface states in a termination-selective manner. Furthermore, by first-principles calculations, we identify the materials NdRhO$_{3}$ and ZnSe$_{2}$O$_{5}$ as candidate examples to elaborate the Weyl-Dirac nodal line and their related topological features.

Topological semimetals are short-range entangled states at weak coupling and their entanglement structure at strong coupling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure of strongly coupled holographic nodal line semimetals. Building on previous studies of entanglement entropy and the holographic c-function, we focus on multipartite entanglement measures, including the conditional mutual information, multi-entropy, and the Markov gap which is based on the entanglement wedge cross section. Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \\to \\infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology.

Inspired by the formalism that connects the star-exponential with the quantum propagator for bosonic systems, this work develops the analogous extension for the fermionic case. A rigorous method, based on Grassmann variables and coherent states, is constructed to obtain a closed-form expression for the fermionic star-exponential from its associated propagator. As a primary application, a fermionic version of the Feynman-Kac formula is derived within this formalism, allowing for the calculation of the ground state energy directly in phase space. Finally, the method is validated by successfully applying it to the simple and driven harmonic oscillators, where it is demonstrated that a simplified (\"naive\") approach (with an ad-hoc \"remediation\") is a valid weak-coupling limit of the rigorous (\"meticulous\") formalism, thereby providing a new and powerful computational tool for the study of fermionic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In the regime where the dot size is comparable to the Fermi wavelength, we identify a clear crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization as the Rashba coupling increases. This transition is accompanied by gate-tunable spin currents of Edelstein and spin Hall type, whose behavior reflects the underlying electron wavefunction interference. Notably, the Edelstein current shows an inflection point at the critical Rashba strength, signaling the crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field we also report a transition in angular periodicity of the magnetoresistance -- from $\u03c0$ to $2\u03c0$ -- arising from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman coupling.

It was originally formulated using the language of quantum correlation functions, making it applicable to different kinds of excitation (electromagnetic, elastic and acoustic fields). EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise. Despite its utility there is no comprehensive overview of electromagnetic EAI. In this paper we describe the theoretical foundations of the method, and present a range of new techniques in areas relating to sampling, phase referencing, mode reconstruction and noise.

By tuning the chemical potential and the pairing imbalance, we find that the eigenenergy spectrum undergoes real-to-complex transitions, and the spectral gap can change from a real to an imaginary line gap. The pairing imbalance significantly enlarges the parameter region supporting a topological superconducting phase. Remarkably, we show that a topologically nontrivial phase hosting Majorana zero modes can be induced by varying the pairing imbalance, even in the regime of strong chemical potential.

In this work, motivated by its phenomenological similarity to GW190521, we test whether GW231123 is compatible with a wormhole-echo scenario by modeling a leading echo pulse with a well-motivated phenomenological sine-Gaussian wavepacket. We perform Bayesian model comparison against a BBH baseline described by the IMRPhenomXPHM-SpinTaylor waveform, and obtain the Bayes factor ratio $\\ln B^{\\rm Echo}_{\\rm BBH} = 1.87$, corresponding to weak-to-moderate support for the echo hypothesis.

These states are often described as Lifshitz tails despite exhibiting energy distributions inconsistent with Lifshitz statistics near the band edge. Here we show that in photonic-crystal waveguides with intentionally engineered anisotropic disorder, the band-edge tail accessible experimentally follows an Urbach law universally, with cumulative statistics $F(\u0394)=\\exp[-(\u0394/\u03b1)^\u03b2]$, where $\u0394$ is the spectral detuning from the band edge, and an exponent $\u03b2\\approx 1$ independent of disorder strength and orientation. In contrast to Lifshitz behavior, the density of states is maximal at the band edge and decays into the gap. Crucially, we find that the Urbach energy $\u03b1$ is anisotropic, with a pronounced directional splitting and qualitatively different scaling for disorder parallel and perpendicular to the waveguide axis. These conclusions are supported by quantitative agreement between optical measurements of GaAs photonic-crystal waveguides and full-vector simulations. The anisotropic Urbach energy emerges as a sensitive probe of disorder-mode coupling and a practical metric to characterize structural disorder in photonic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Anisotropic disorder in photonic crystals leads to unique spectral properties, such as an Urbach tail, rather than Lifshitz tails.

We derive this result analytically through a systematic higher-order matched asymptotic expansion connecting near-horizon and far-region solutions, and we verify it with direct numerical quasinormal mode calculations. Our numerics demonstrate that the first non-hydrodynamic mode is purely imaginary and gapped, following the dispersion relation $\u03c9=-i\u03c9_0-i D k^2$, and that both the hydrodynamic and the first non-hydrodynamic modes pass through pole-skipping points.

On the example of an InAsP quantum dot embedded in an InP matrix, we compute single-particle states using an ab initio-parametrized tight-binding model, then obtain correlated many-body wave functions of neutral excitons, biexcitons, and charged trions via the configuration-interaction method. Using these correlated states, we compute the exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements. The resulting phonon spectral densities for different excitonic complexes are compared with the widely used analytical super-Ohmic form and reveal deviations at higher energies originating from the realistic dot geometry and atomistic wave functions, whereas configuration mixing is found to play only a minor role. Furthermore, we extract radiative lifetimes comparable to values experimentally measured. As a direct application, we simulate the emission brightness of a pulsed-driven quantum dot and demonstrate that the atomistically derived spectral density substantially broadens the region of efficient off-resonant excitation compared to the analytical model. The presented framework provides a nearly parameter-free route to simulate the non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in semiconductor quantum dots.", "AI": {"tldr":

After introducing the canonical variables of the reduced phase space, we derive a discrete spectrum for the surface areas of the BH event horizon (EH) as well as MSH masses.

Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\\%\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\\mathrm{kW}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination. This versatile platform opens new opportunities for sensing, THz generation and detection, and ultrafast electro-optic modulation of nonlinear optical signals.

The resulting generating functional exposes an emergent phase-space description in which the Lanczos coefficients define an effective Hamiltonian governing operator motion along the Krylov chain. In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean.

By contrast, the dynamics of the full system-environment compound is governed by the underlying Hamiltonian spectrum, where bound states in the continuum (BICs) can protect long-lived quantum resources. Despite these parallel perspectives, the relation between LGC and BIC formation has remained largely unexplored. Here we bridge this gap in a paradigmatic giant-atom waveguide platform and show that the occurrence of LGC necessarily benchmarks the presence of a BIC in the full Hamiltonian description. By engineering the giant-atom geometry, we further demonstrate rich dynamical regimes-including Rabi oscillations, fractional decay, and complete exponential relaxation-depending on the number of supported BICs, which can be tuned from three to zero.

Here we study theoretically the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the two-dimensional electron liquid near a quantum point contact (QPC) or a domain wall between spin polarized and unpolarized phases induced by electrostatic gating in the fractional QHE at a filling factor 2/3 and analyze the dependence of the spin transition on temperature and the magnitude of the flowing current. We demonstrate that nearly all nuclear spins in the QPC or in the domain wall can be polarized by the electric current. The Overhauser effective magnetic field from the DNP can be strong enough to induce (or modify) a phase transition between polarized and unpolarized phases. This changes the gate voltages and magnetic fields required for the spin transitions, and leads to the reconstruction of the boundary between two phases and a domain wall and a current path displacement. The spread of nuclear spin polarization and the domain wall displacement are strongly asymmetric with respect to the direction of the current flow. Equilibration due to hyperfine interactions and its role on the nuclear spin polarization, domain wall displacements and spin transitions is studied. Back and forth oscillatory transitions between polarized and unpolarized phases near a source contact are discussed.

Our symmetry analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to monolayers, the reduced symmetry of heterobilayers enables coupling between conduction band spin subbands by an electric field. We establish the optical selection rules for all six high-symmetry stacking configurations. The microscopic mechanism of the effect is identified as the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing of Bloch states from different conduction bands, which generates a non-zero momentum matrix element between the spin-split states. It also leads to the linear-in-wavevector spin-dependent terms in the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., the Rashba effect.

Here, significantly enhanced spectral broadening induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) is experimentally demonstrated in silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides integrated with 2D monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films. Monolayer MoS2 films with ultrahigh optical nonlinearity are synthesized via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and subsequently transferred onto Si3N4 waveguides, with precise control of the film coating length and placement achieved by selectively opening windows on the chip silica upper cladding. Detailed SPM measurements at telecom wavelengths are performed using fabricated waveguides with various MoS2 film coating lengths. Compared to devices without MoS2, increased spectral broadening of sub-picosecond optical pulses is observed for the hybrid devices, achieving a broadening factor of up to ~ 2.4 for a device with a 1.4-mm-long MoS2 film. Theoretical fitting of the experimental results further reveals an increase of up to ~27 fold in the nonlinear parameter (\u03b3) for the hybrid MoS2 / Si3N4 waveguides and an equivalent Kerr coefficient (n2) of MoS2 nearly 5 orders of magnitude higher than Si3N4.

Motivated by string-inspired effective field theories, we study the perturbative stability of the Cho-Maison monopole when the hypercharge kinetic term is regularised by a Born-Infeld extension, which renders the monopole energy finite. Focusing on the bosonic electroweak theory with an unmodified $SU(2)_L$ sector and a Born-Infeld U(1)_Y sector, we analyze linear fluctuations about the regularised monopole background. Using a complex tetrad and a spin-weighted harmonic decomposition, we reduce the fluctuation equations to coupled radial Schroedinger-type eigenvalue problems and examine the spectrum of the resulting operators. We extend the separation-of-variables framework developed by Gervalle and Volkov to this non-linear gauge-field setting. We show that, after appropriate gauge fixing and constraint elimination, the Born-Infeld deformation preserves the angular channel structure of the Maxwell theory and leads to a self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville type problem for the stability of the radial modes, with modified radial coefficients determined by the background Born-Infeld profile.

Under these conditions, the stationary continuity constraint induces a nonlinear amplitude equation of Ermakov Pinney type in each degree of freedom, revealing a hidden invariant structure that is independent of whether the evolution parameter is time or space.\n  By reformulating the separated stationary equations in Sturm Liouville form and applying Liouville normalization, we demonstrate that the quantum potential is encoded as a curvature contribution of the self adjoint operator rather than appearing as an additional dynamical term. This correspondence preserves the standard probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics while yielding exact stationary Bohmian amplitudes and their associated invariants. The resulting invariant-based formulation provides stationary guiding fields and clarifies the ontological status of Bohmian amplitudes as geometrically encoded structures rather than auxiliary dynamical additions. The results further show that stationary constrained Bohm Madelung systems naturally admit variational formulations whose extremals preserve the Ermakov Lewis invariant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u9ad8\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u6210\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bae\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u56fd1996-2017\u5e74\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u8ba1\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u6bcf\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\uff0cGDP\u589e\u52a00.3\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u4e5f\u662f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u5e94\u6ce8\u91cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u6c11\u7d20\u8d28\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4fc3\u8fdb\u52b3\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Here, we resolve this bottleneck by demonstrating a metrology-grade spectroscopic system based on difference frequency generation, driven by widely tunable, near-infrared diode lasers traceable to atomic standards. Our system achieves continuous tunability across the 3-3.7 $\u03bc$m atmospheric window and delivers output power exceeding 45 mW with an absolute frequency accuracy of 7.2 MHz. We harness this convergence to overcome a critical barrier in integrated photonics, unambiguously identifying and eliminating hydrogen-induced absorption in silicon nitride microresonators to achieve an 88-fold reduction in optical loss. We further reveal multi-phonon absorption in the silica cladding as the fundamental limit to mid-infrared integrated photonics. Finally, we demonstrate the system's versatility through scattering-resilient LiDAR capable of penetrating optically dense fog, and dual-modality sensing that simultaneously retrieves target distance and chemical composition.

Finite Ca$_8$F$_{16}$ and Ca$_7$ErF$_{16}$ clusters were constructed from the fluorite structure (a=5.46~$\u00c5$) and treated using density functional theory (DFT) and linear-response time-dependent DFT (LR-TDDFT) within the GPAW code. Geometry optimization was performed in LCAO mode with a DZP basis and PBE exchange-correlation functional, followed by real-space finite-difference ground-state calculations with grid spacing h=0.30~$\u00c5$ and N$_{bands}$=N$_{occ}$+20. Optical excitations up to 10~eV were obtained via the Casida formalism and converted into continuous absorption spectra using Gaussian broadening ($\u03c3$=0.1-0.2~eV). From 1,589 energy-resolved points per system, physically interpretable descriptors including transition energy $E$, extinction coefficient $\u03ba$, and absorption coefficient $\u03b1$ were extracted. A classical RBF-kernel support vector machine (SVM) achieves a test accuracy (ACC) of 0.983 and ROC-AUC of 0.999. Quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) evaluated on statevector and noisy simulators reach accuracies of 0.851 and 0.817, respectively, while execution on IBM quantum hardware yields a test-slice accuracy of 0.733 under finite-shot and decoherence constraints. A hybrid quantum neural network (QNN) with a 3-qubit feature map and depth-4 ansatz achieves a test accuracy of 0.93 and AUC of 0.96.

Here, we propose a photonic spiking twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning architecture for neuromorphic autonomous navigation and experimentally validate it on a distributed feedback laser with a saturable absorber (DFB-SA) array. The hybrid architecture integrates a photonic spiking Actor network with dual continuous-valued Critic networks, where the final nonlinear spiking activation layer of the Actor is deployed on the DFB-SA laser array. In autonomous navigation tasks, the system achieves an average reward of 58.22 plus-minus 17.29 and a success rate of 80% plus-minus 8.3%. Hardware-software co-inference demonstrates an estimated energy consumption of 0.78 nJ/inf and an ultra-low latency of 191.20 ps/inf, with co-inference error rates of 0.051% and 0.059% in task scenarios with and without obstacle interference, respectively. Simulations for error-activated channels show full agreement with the expected responses, validating the dynamic characteristics of the DFB-SA laser.

Kulkarni"], "title": "Entanglement-Dependent Error Bounds for Hamiltonian Simulation", "comment": "35 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure", "summary": "We establish tight connections between entanglement entropy and the approximation error in Trotter-Suzuki product formulas for Hamiltonian simulation. Product formulas remain the workhorse of quantum simulation on near-term devices, yet standard error analyses yield worst-case bounds that can vastly overestimate the resources required for structured problems. For systems governed by geometrically local Hamiltonians with maximum entanglement entropy $S_\\text{max}$ across all bipartitions, we prove that the first-order Trotter error scales as $\\mathcal{O}(t^2 S_\\text{max} \\operatorname{polylog}(n)/r)$ rather than the worst-case $\\mathcal{O}(t^2 n/r)$, where $n$ is the system size and $r$ is the number of Trotter steps. This yields improvements of $\\tilde\u03a9(n^2)$ for one-dimensional area-law systems and $\\tilde\u03a9(n^{3/2})$ for two-dimensional systems. We extend these bounds to higher-order Suzuki formulas, where the improvement factor involves $2^{pS^*/2}$ for the $p$-th order formula. We further establish a separation result demonstrating that volume-law entangled systems fundamentally require $\\tilde\u03a9(n)$ more Trotter steps than area-law systems to achieve the same precision.

However, the extreme miniaturization and high mechanical compliance that make graphene attractive also render it highly susceptible to nonlinearities, degrading frequency stability. Here, we demonstrate that graphene parametric oscillators provide an alternative nonlinear operating regime, where short-term frequency stability can be enhanced despite strong nonlinearity. By operating graphene resonators in a phase-locked loop (PLL), we experimentally demonstrate that parametric oscillations in the post-bifurcation regime achieve lower Allan deviation at fast integration times than Duffing oscillations at identical amplitudes. This improvement originates from strong nonlinear damping inherent to parametric oscillators, which suppresses amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion at large amplitudes. A minimal theoretical model captures observed phase diffusion and identifies nonlinear damping as the dominant mechanism governing phase noise reduction. These results highlight the role of nonlinear dissipation in enabling precision sensing beyond conventional limits of graphene oscillators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In a recent article, the first author demonstrated the existence of developments corresponding to a geometric notion of initial data on a big bang singularity. Moreover, this article, combined with previous articles by the second author, gives a unified and geometric perspective on large classes of seemingly disparate results in the first two categories. Concerning the third category, Oude Groeniger et al recently formulated a general condition on initial data ensuring big bang formation, including curvature blow up. This result, among other things, generalises previous results on stable big bang formation. However, it does not include a statement saying that the solutions induce initial data on the singularity. Here we tie all three categories of results together by demonstrating that the solutions of Oude Groeniger et al induce data on the singularity.

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for intelligent routing, its practical deployment remains constrained by high energy consumption and decision latency. Here, we propose a photonic spiking RL architecture that implements a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based intelligent routing algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach is systematically evaluated on a software-defined network (SDN) with a fat-tree topology. The results demonstrate that, under various baseline traffic rate conditions, the PPO-based routing strategy significantly outperforms the conventional Dijkstra algorithm in several key performance metrics. Furthermore, a hardware-software collaborative framework of the spiking Actor network is realized for three typical baseline traffic rates, utilizing a photonic synapse chip based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) array and a photonic spiking neuron chip based on distributed feedback lasers with a saturable absorber (DFB-SAs). Experimental validation on 640 state-action pairs shows that the inference accuracy of the hardware-software collaborative framework is consistent with that of the pure algorithmic implementation. The impacts of different hidden-layer scales in the spiking Actor network and varying network size of fat-tree topology are further analyzed. The integration of photonic spiking RL with SDN-based routing establishes a novel paradigm for intelligent routing optimization, featuring ultra-low latency and high energy efficiency. This approach exhibits broad application prospects in real-time network optimization scenarios, including large-scale data centers, computing networks, satellite Internet systems, and future 6G networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Firstly, we will show how the intersection matrix can shed some light on the nature of the canonical basis of a Feynman integral family, a concept still not fully understood in the general case. In particular we will show how the intersection matrix can detect hidden linear dependencies of the iterated integrals resulting from an $\\eps$-factorized differential equation, which are difficult to find otherwise. Furthermore, we will explain how the intersection matrix can help in deriving (polynomial) relations between the transcendental functions occurring in the rotation to the canonical basis. This allows us to simplify the rotation, and furthermore leads to simplifications in the final result.

Among the most promising approaches, photoacoustic imaging achieves penetration into deep tissue but with coarse resolution, while fluorescence provides subcellular detail but is confined to shallow depths. This depth-resolution trade-off remains a central barrier to biomedical imaging. To bridge this fundamental gap, we present a hybrid dual-modal strategy that combines the benefits of photoacoustic and fluorescence modalities. Our approach leverages hybrid opto-acoustic feedback for wavefront shaping and computational imaging through scattering media. By combining these complementary signals into a nonlinear feedback metric, we achieve robust optical focusing even under signal degradation. In particular, we show that photoacoustic-guided wavefront shaping inherently generates fluorescence that can be harvested for computational high-resolution imaging even within highly scattering biological tissues, thereby leveraging the complementary strengths of both modalities in a single framework. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate this synergistic approach, paving the way for optical imaging techniques that fully leverage the potential of such dual-modalities for large depth penetration and high resolution in complex biological tissues.", "AI": {"tldr": "A paper proposing a hybrid dual-modal imaging method combining photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging to overcome the challenges of depth resolution in biomedical imaging.", "motivation": "The paper aims to solve the problem of limited depth resolution in biomedical imaging by combining photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging.", "method": "The method involves using photoacoustic imaging for deep tissue penetration and fluorescence imaging for subcellular detail, combined with hybrid opto-acoustic feedback and computational imaging for enhanced resolution in highly scattering tissues.", "result": "The success of the method is demonstrated through proof-of-concept experiments showing improved imaging resolution and depth penetration in complex biological tissues.", "conclusion": "The method provides a novel approach for overcoming the depth resolution limitation in biomedical imaging."}}

Here, we provide a comparative numerical study of single-step-QRC (SS-QRC) and multi-step-QRC (MS-QRC) architectures implemented on a Rydberg atom array. We demonstrate that while MS-QRC performance is highly sensitive to the underlying dynamical phase of matter and decoherence, SS-QRC exhibits greater robustness. Using the randomized measurement toolbox to mitigate measurement overhead, we reveal that sampling noise undermines the convergence property required for MS-QRC.

Recent work on optical skyrmions offers a route to overcoming these limitations by exploiting perturbation-resilient topological invariants assigned to the optical field for computation. However, owing to its relative novelty, an architectural perspective on integrating individual components that manipulate topological charge into a functional system remains an important open goal. In this paper, we take concrete steps toward system-level design by introducing a platform-independent architecture for skyrmion-based logic, built around a modular library of topologically robust optical primitives, including generators, converters, registers, and adders. This framework enables the synthesis and arithmetic manipulation of topological numbers within a unified programmable architecture. We then experimentally validate this approach using multichannel arrays, demonstrating accurate charge readout and high robustness against alignment errors and environmental noise.

But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we introduce a new degree of freedom to manipulate the birefringence of light propagation in optical crystals through programming the spatiotemporal spectral phase of the incident light wave. We demonstrate this approach achieves continuous tuning of birefringence across a spectrum more than 100 times broader than that achievable with conventional birefringence tuning, spanning from positive through zero to negative values, irrespective of the crystal's optical sign and without inherent physical limitations.

Single-NV scanning magnetometry achieves genuine nanoscale resolution, nonetheless requires typically a slow pixel-by-pixel acquisition.

Here, we present a sparse-sampling strategy for reconstructing high-resolution wide-field images from only a small number of measurements. Using simulated NV-ensemble detection of ac magnetic fields, we show that a mean-adjusted Bayesian estimation (MABE) framework can reconstruct 10000-pixel images from only 25 sampling points, achieving SSIM values exceeding 0.999 for representative smooth field distributions, while optimized dynamical-decoupling pulse sequences yield an approximately twofold improvement in magnetic-field sensitivity. The method further clarifies how sampling patterns and sampling density affect reconstruction accuracy and suggests a route toward faster and more scalable magnetic-imaging architectures that may extend to point-scanning NV sensors and other magnetometry platforms, such as SQUIDs, Hall probes, and magnetic tunnel junctions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u78c1\u611f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u7684NV-ensemble\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u5747\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u70b9\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684 wide-field \u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572810000\u50cf\u7d20\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752825\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\u5373\u53ef\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.999\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684SSIM\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea6\u4e24\u500d\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u78c1\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709 broad \u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

The TTL is the coupling of the angular jitter of any optical setup into the optical path length between its input and output pupils. This might be deleterious in laser ranging experiments and must be evaluated for further compensation. The setup is made of two laser beams, one features an angular jitter that mimics the input beam as seen from the jittering bench under test (BUT), the other is aligned to the optical axis of the BUT and provides a phase reference for the jittering beam. The induced phase variations between both beams detected at the BUT's output pupil gives access to the TTL coupling. The ''TTL probe'' must feature a negligible residual TTL coupling which implies a micrometric accuracy in the centering of the setup pupil, the beams and the angular jitter associated pivot point. The setup integrates optical masks as a link between the setup optical reference frame to its mechanical reference frame, together with position memories and servo-loops for the beam's alignment. We show that the stability, the accuracy, and the noise floor of the setup is compliant with the LISA specifications for the TTL mitigation, although it makes use of off-the-shelf components and is operated in a standard environment laboratory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we quantify the entrywise resolvability of the Hessian for Variational Quantum Algorithms at random initialization. By leveraging exact second-order parameter-shift rules, we derive a structural representation that reduces the variance of Hessian entries to a finite covariance quadratic form of shifted cost evaluations. This framework reveals two distinct scaling regimes that govern the sample complexity required to resolve Hessian entries against shot noise. For global objectives, we prove that Hessian variances are exponentially suppressed, implying that the number of measurement shots must scale as $O(e^{\u03b1n})$ with the number of qubits $n$ to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio.

Nonlocal metasurfaces enable high nonlinear conversion efficiency, while the local ones can offer versatile wavefront control, yet achieving both within a single metasurface remains challenging. Here, using a nonlocal phase gradient metasurface, we firstly demonstrate efficient third harmonic generation (THG) with polarization-dependent wavefront control. Leveraging nonlocal nonlinear geometric phase existing at resonance, the third harmonic light with distinct polarizations is deflected into $\\pm$ 2nd and $\\pm$ 4th diffraction orders, simultaneously achieving a conversion efficiency up to $1.45\\times 10^{-4}$ under a pump intensity of $1 GW/cm^{2}$. Then, by introducing a secondary fundamental beam, whose generated third harmonic light overlaps with that of the first beam, the intensity modulation of THG is obtained. The THG efficiency can be tuned from $3.9 \\times 10^{-9}$ to $5.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ by varying the relative phase, polarization and intensity of two fundamental beams.

Mathematically, these devices are described by bistochastic quantum channels, namely completely positive linear maps that are both trace-preserving and identity-preserving. Recently, it has been shown that bidirectional quantum devices can, in principle, be used in ways that are incompatible with a definite input-output direction, giving rise to a new phenomenon called input-output indefiniteness. Here we characterize the most general forms of input-output indefiniteness, associated with a hierarchy of higher-order transformations built from transformations of bistochastic quantum channels. Some levels of the hierarchy correspond to transformations that combine bistochastic channels in a definite causal order, while generally using each channel in an indefinite input-output direction. For other levels of the hierarchy, the indefiniteness can involve both the local input-output direction of each process and the global causal order among the processes. On the foundational side, the hierarchy of higher-order transformations characterized here can be regarded as the largest set of physical processes compatible with a time-symmetric variant of quantum theory, where the possible state transformations are restricted to bistochastic channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While exciton-polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform, their practical utility is often impeded by fixed interaction parameters and an intrinsic trade-off between nonlinearity and oscillator strength. Here, we report electrically tunable dipolar polaritons in a dual-gated bilayer MoS2 microcavity, demonstrating in situ reshaping of the dispersion and modulation of the light-matter coupling strength via the quantum-confined Stark effect. Crucially, this architecture enables a giant polariton-polariton interaction strength tunable by a factor of seven. This nonlinearity enhancement arises from a synergistic interplay, in which the electric field amplifies the microscopic dipolar repulsion while simultaneously optimizing the macroscopic excitonic Hopfield coefficient. Furthermore, electrostatic doping serves as an independent control knob to switch the system between strong and weak coupling regimes.

For metasurfaces made from a periodic or aperiodic arrangement of scatterers, the primary information encoding their response is the optical properties of these individual scatterers. In the linear regime, that response is entirely contained in the transition or T-matrix of the individual scatterer. However, despite the widespread use of these T-matrices in exploring advanced photonic materials within the larger community, there is no common infrastructure for distributing them with consistent metadata and a standard representation. That would be important to avoid the repetitive, resource-intensive computation of these T-matrices by researchers worldwide and to enable data-driven research. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Daphona T-matrix portal at https://tmatrix.scc.kit.edu/, a web-based platform for interactive searching, filtering, and exporting standardized data containing structure-property relations for a wide range of scatterers, as expressed by their T-matrices. Besides introducing this infrastructure, we demonstrate how the available data enables addressing scientific questions in the broader context of information-driven research. The multiple illustrative examples in our contribution cover both surrogate forward models and inverse design models, and operate either directly on the T-matrix or alternatively on optical observables of metasurfaces made from these scatterers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u81f4\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u793a\u7684T-\u77e9\u9635\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6563\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u5149\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u5143\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0cT-\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u4e86\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Daphona T-\u77e9\u9635\u95e8\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u5bfc\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8868\u793a\u6563\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784-\u6027\u8d28\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDaphona T-\u77e9\u9635\u95e8\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u7528T-\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684T-\u77e9\u9635\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this work, we establish a direct connection between symmetry properties of a many-body model and measures of quantum asymmetry, showing that asymmetry monotones provide a robust and physically transparent indicator of dynamical quantum criticality. Focusing on the quenched Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we demonstrate that asymmetry measures associated with collective spin generators faithfully capture the onset of DQPTs, reflecting the dynamical restoration or breaking of underlying symmetries. Remarkably, the time-averaged asymmetry exhibits clear signatures of the dynamical critical point, in close correspondence with both the dynamical order parameter and the behavior of entropy production. We further uncover a quantitative link between asymmetry generation and thermodynamic irreversibility, showing that peaks in asymmetry coincide with maximal entropy production across the transition. Our results position asymmetry as a unifying concept bridging symmetry, information-theoretic quantifiers, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics in dynamical quantum phase transitions, providing a powerful framework for understanding critical dynamics beyond traditional order parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\uff08DQPTs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u523b\u753b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4f53\u81ea\u65cb\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4e86DQPT\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u5cf0\u503c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3DQPT\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5bf9\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u5230\u8fd9\u7c7b\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u91cf\uff0c\u5982\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u7b49\u3002\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u524d\u540e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u662f\u8861\u91cfDQPT\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5230\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u5cf0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u6709\u5173\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3DQPT\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, prior analyses assumed idealized channels, neglecting realistic noise sources. We extend the 1SDI-QKD framework to include amplitude damping, dephasing, and depolarizing noise, quantifying their impact on secure key rates and efficiency requirements. Our results reveal a clear noise hierarchy: dephasing is most tolerable (secure keys achievable at 70\\% efficiency with 30\\% noise), while amplitude damping and depolarizing noise dramatically elevate requirements to over 90\\%. Crucially, we find that security is lost while substantial entanglement remains (concurrence $C \\approx 0.7$--$0.8$), demonstrating that steering violation, not merely entanglement, determines 1SDI-QKD security. To mitigate noise effects, we integrate the BBPSSW entanglement purification protocol, showing that 2--4 rounds can restore positive key rates in otherwise insecure regimes.

Focusing on qubits coupled to non-Hermitian spin chains and interacting ultracold Fermi gases, we find that approaching exceptional points can either enhance or strongly suppress decoherence, depending on the balance between Hermitian and non-Hermitian system-environment couplings. In particular, when these couplings are comparable, decoherence is dramatically suppressed at exceptional transitions. We trace this behavior to the distinct response of the environmental ground state near non-Hermitian degeneracies and demonstrate the robustness of the effect across multiple models.

Here we introduce HSQD, a novel half-qubit SQD approach that halves the qubit requirement for simulating a chemical system and drastically reduces overall circuit depth and gate counts, suppressing hardware noise. When modeling the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule with a (10e, 26o) active space, HSQD matches the accuracy of SQD on IBM quantum hardware using only half the number of qubits and 40% fewer measurements.\n  We further enhance HSQD with a heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI) inspired selection of the samples, forming HCI-HSQD. This yields sub-millihartree accuracy across the N2 potential energy surface and produces subspaces up to 39% smaller than those from classical HCI, showing a significant improvement in the compactness of the ground-state representation.\n  Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of HCI-HSQD using iron-sulfur clusters, reaching active spaces of up to (54e, 36o) while using only half as many qubits as the original SQD. For these systems, HCI-HSQD reduces SQD energy errors by up to 76% for [2Fe-2S] and 26% for [4Fe-4S], while also reducing subspace sizes, halving measurement requirements, and eliminating expensive post-processing.\n  Together, these results establish half-qubit SQD as a noise-resilient and resource-efficient pathway toward practical quantum advantage in strongly correlated chemistry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Analysis of the learned mixing weights indicates that quantum contributions dominate below 128 features, while classical contributions become increasingly important beyond 128, suggesting that the classical kernel provides a stabilizing anchor against concentration effects and hardware noise while preserving quantum gains at lower dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e86\u968f\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u8fbe784\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u53cc\u91cd\u6838\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u53cc\u91cd\u6838\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6838\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u589e\u5927\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4f4e\u4e8e128\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u5178\u8d21\u732e\u5728128\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6570\u636e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u6a21\u62df\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u7535\u8def\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Fashion-MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u53cc\u91cd\u6838\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6838\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u65e0\u8bba\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u8fd8\u662f\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53cc\u91cd\u6838\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u5230\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u540e\uff0c\u53cc\u91cd\u6838\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5360\u636e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65f6\u91cf\u5b50\u8d21\u732e\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u968f\u7740\u7ef4\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u8d21\u732e\u9010\u6e10\u5360\u636e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5927\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we show that requiring the entropy production rate to take the conventional form as the sum of the entropy change and the heat flow constrains the effective temperature to be either constant or equal to a specific energy-matching effective temperature.

This task is typically performed through iterative algorithms to find the energy eigenstates of a Hamiltonian, which are usually computationally expensive and suffer from convergence issues. In this work, we develop and implement the Quantum Jacobi-Davidson (QJD) method and its quantum diagonalization variant, the Sample-Based Quantum Jacobi-Davidson (SBQJD) method, and demonstrate their fast convergence for ground state energy estimation. We assess the intrinsic algorithmic performance of our methods through exact numerical simulations on a variety of quantum systems, including 8-qubit diagonally dominant matrices, 12-qubit one-dimensional Ising models, and a 10-qubit water molecule (H$_2$O) Hamiltonian. Our results show that both QJD and SBQJD achieve significantly faster convergence and require fewer Pauli measurements compared to the recently reported Quantum Davidson method, with SBQJD further benefiting from optimized reference state preparation. These findings establish the QJD framework as an efficient general-purpose subspace-based technique for solving quantum eigenvalue problems, providing a promising foundation for sparse Hamiltonian calculations on future fault-tolerant quantum hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4-\u6234\u7ef4\u68ee\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u3001\u56fa\u6001\u7269\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4-\u6234\u7ef4\u68ee(QJD)\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316(SBQJD)\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "QJD\u548cSBQJD\u6bd4\u91cf\u5b50\u6234\u7ef4\u68ee\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5c24\u5176SBQJD\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u6001\u51c6\u5907\u3002", "conclusion": "QJD\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u3002"}}

While control theories in the rapid-driving and slow-driving limits have been developed, to the best of our knowledge there is no general optimization method applicable to intermediate timescales. We introduce an optimal-control framework to minimize dissipated work and work variance, defined via the two-point measurement scheme, in open quantum systems governed by time-dependent Lindblad master equations. By introducing an auxiliary operator, we convert the history-dependent work variance into a time-local integral, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization beyond slow or rapid driving regimes. Applying our method, we find that in the coherent spin-boson model the optimized protocol can switch discontinuously between distinct locally optimal solutions as the relative weight between dissipation and fluctuations is varied. Moreover, for a single-level quantum dot coupled to a fermionic reservoir, the optimized fluctuation-minimizing protocol develops a qualitatively different multi-step structure that is not captured by approaches based on slow- or rapid-driving limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6162\u901f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ecb\u4e8e\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6563\u9038\u529f\u548c\u529f\u65b9\u5dee\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u70b9\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\u5b9a\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7531\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684 Lindblad \u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u529f\u65b9\u5dee\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8d85\u8d8a\u6162\u6216\u5feb\u901f\u9a71\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5c06\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u5e73\u8861\u8017\u6563\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u534f\u8bae\u4f1a\u7a81\u7136\u5207\u6362\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u80fd\u7ea7\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u5f0f\u4ecb\u5b50 reservoir \u76f8\u8fde\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u534f\u8bae\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8d28\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6162\u6216\u5feb\u901f\u9a71\u52a8\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6563\u9038\u529f\u548c\u529f\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684 Lindblad \u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u7b97\u7b26\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u529f\u65b9\u5dee\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u5e72\u81ea\u65cb-\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u8017\u6563\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u65f6\u4f1a\u7a81\u7136\u5207\u6362\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u80fd\u7ea7\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u5f0f\u4ecb\u5b50 reservoir \u76f8\u8fde\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u534f\u8bae\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d28\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ecb\u4e8e\u5feb\u6162\u9a71\u52a8\u6781\u9650\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

These results establish secure position-based authentication as a practical possibility, paving the way for applications in financial transactions, disaster response, and authenticated secure communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e24\u4f4d\u5206\u88c2\u57282\u516c\u91cc\u5916\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd475\u7c73\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u8005\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u4ea4\u6613\u7b49\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u53d8\u5f97\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u4f4d\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7684\u5f31\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u5f00\u53d1\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u4f4d\u76f8\u8ddd2\u516c\u91cc\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd475\u7c73\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u8005\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u4ea4\u6613\u3001\u707e\u96be\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9ETH\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9a8c\u8bc1ETH\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u70ed\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u901a\u8fc7ETH\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u63a2\u8ba8\u91cf\u5b50\u53efthermalization\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u7cfb\u7efc\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9ETH\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6da8\u843d\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u80fd\u91cf\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u90e8\u6da8\u843d\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u80fd\u91cf\u6da8\u843d\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u6da8\u843d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fee\u6b63\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u5c0f\u5f02\u5e38\u589e\u957f\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1ETH\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Remarkably, the same functions also arise in spin models, including the Ising and Heisenberg models, where distinct interaction structures correspond to different matrix functions. This correspondence has been used to establish the classical hardness of simulating interacting spin systems by relating their output distributions to #P-hard quantities. Previous works, however, have largely been restricted to bipartite spin interactions, where transition amplitudes, which provide the leading-order contribution to the output probabilities, are proportional to the permanent. In this work, we extend the Ising model construction to arbitrary interaction networks and show that transition amplitudes of the Ising Hamiltonian are proportional to the hafnian and the loop-hafnian. The loop-hafnian generalizes both the permanent and hafnian, but unlike these cases, loop-hafnian-based states require Dicke-like superpositions, making the design of corresponding quantum circuits non-trivial. Our results establish a unified framework linking bosonic networks of single photons and Gaussian states with quantum spin dynamics and matrix functions.

In this structure, the number of repetitions of the basic circuit pattern is associated to convergence parameters. This iterative structure behaves similarly to function approximation by series expansion: the higher the truncation order, the better the target gate (i.e. operation) approximation. The asymptotic convergence of the gate error with respect to the number of basic pattern repetitions is known. It is referred to as the query complexity. The underlying convergence law is bounded, but not in an explicit fashion. Upper bounds are generally too pessimistic to be useful in practice. The actual convergence law contains constants that depend on the joint properties of the matrix encoded by the query and the initial state vector, which are difficult to compute classically. This paper proposes a strategy to study this convergence law and extract the associated constants from the gate (operation) approximation at different accuracy (convergence parameter) constructed directly on a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU).

We measure background quasiparticle tunneling rates at the single-hertz level, with temporal resolution of tens of microseconds.

This task has recently attracted significant attention, as the secure instantiation of many isogeny-based cryptographic protocols relies on the ability to sample such ``hard'' curves.

We present the first provable quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples a random hard supersingular elliptic curve with high probability.Our algorithm runs heuristically in $\\tilde{O}\\!\\left(\\log^{4}p\\right)$ quantum gate complexity and in $\\tilde{O}\\!\\left(\\log^{13} p\\right)$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. As a consequence, our algorithm gives a secure instantiation of the CGL hash function and other cryptographic primitives.\n  Our analysis relies on a new spectral delocalization result for supersingular $\\ell$-isogeny graphs: we prove the Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture, and we further provide numerical evidence for complete eigenvector delocalization; this theoretical result may be of independent interest.

To this end, we use a fluctuation-regularized quantum master equation that predicts dipolar relaxation and drive-induced dissipation, in addition to the standard environmental dissipation channels.

Although quantum noise is often viewed as a major challenge in quantum computing, it also offers a unique opportunity to enhance privacy. In particular, intrinsic quantum noise provides a natural stochastic resource that, when rigorously analyzed within the differential privacy (DP) framework and composed with classical mechanisms, can satisfy formal $(\\varepsilon, \u03b4)$-DP guarantees. This enables a reduction in the required classical perturbation without compromising the privacy budget, potentially improving model utility. However, the integration of classical and quantum noise for privacy preservation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a hybrid noise-added mechanism, HYPER-Q, that combines classical and quantum noise to protect the privacy of QML models. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its privacy guarantees and establish theoretical bounds on its utility. Empirically, we demonstrate that HYPER-Q outperforms existing classical noise-based mechanisms in terms of adversarial robustness across multiple real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hybrid noise-addition mechanism for QML privacy.", "motivation": "Privacy preservation in ML/quantum computing.", "method": "Combines classical and quantum noise with differential privacy.", "result": "Improved adversarial robustness as demonstrated experimentally.", "conclusion": "New method enhances privacy with better utility and robustness."}}

For this purpose, exact discrete versions of the path integral are constructed for three different orderings of the Hamiltonian: normal, anti-normal and symmetric (Weyl order). Subsequently, their different continuum versions are checked on the harmonic oscillator, to choose the symmetric ordering as a possibly correct choice for all Hamiltonians. Spotted mathematical subtleties in the simple case serve as a clue to the general solution. Finally, a general justification for the symmetric order is provided by deriving the continuum path integral starting from the exact discrete case by a renormalization procedure in the imaginary time frequency domain. While the role of Weyl order has already been found, the paper provides the missing proof of its suitability for every Hamiltonian and simplifies the previously established construction by referring only to creation and annihilation operators (without position and momentum operators).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
