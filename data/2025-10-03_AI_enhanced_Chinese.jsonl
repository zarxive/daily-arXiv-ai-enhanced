In the special case of uniformly\naccelerated charges, the radiation observed in the inertial frame can be fully\ndescribed by the scattering channel in the Rindler frame.

This paper addresses the\nfundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We\ninvestigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system,\nusing the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated\ndirectly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi\ndistribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the\nfirst visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our\nsimulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is\nstretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy\nloss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the\nclassical attractor.

These pre-peaks are puzzling\nin view of the apparently contradicting facts that neat amines show pre-peaks\nmuch weaker than neat alkanols, while water-rich aqueous alcohols do not. These\nobservations can be intuitively rationalized by noting that the amine head\ngroup have two hydrogen atoms when the hydroxyl group have only one, but they\noppose the following two facts: i) computer simulations show\nmicro-heterogeneity for both systems; ii) amines mix with water better than\nalcohols, both over larger concentrations and alkyl tails lengths.\n  The study of the atom-atom pair correlation functions and related structure\nfactors allows to understand the microscopic molecular details. The most\ninteresting observation is that the amine head groups accumulate preferentially\nat the surface of the water domains, and increasingly better with longer alkyl\ntail, thus allowing to stabilize both the water and alkylamine domains, hence\navoiding macroscopic demixing, except at high water concentrations when amines\nare scarce to achieve efficient surface saturation. The amine domains appear as\ndisordered bilayers. Hence, aqueous amines are analogous to an inverse micelle\nmelt and as precursor micro-emulsion.\n  This stable micro-segregation produces large domain oscillations in the long\nrange part of the correlation functions, translating into positive pre-peaks\nand negative anti-peaks in the related structure factors, the latter which\ncontribute destructively to produce the prominent scattering pre-peak observed\nin the x-ray experiments.\n  The model dependence is shown to be quite important, both for water and\nsolute models.

This approach offers\npromising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex\nnon-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable\nquantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms,\nultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u7a33\u6001\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e_open quantum many-body systems>_\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u4e00\u7ef4\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-1/2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5177\u6709\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5982\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u79bb\u5b50 traps>\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This phenomenon\noriginates from magnetoelectric coupling between nearly degenerate transverse\nelectric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, resulting in a measurable\nfrequency shift of the resonant modes as a function of the twist angle, $\\phi$.\nIn addition to the bulk helicity induced by global geometric twist, internal\nhelical corrugations break structural symmetry on the surface, introducing an\neffective surface chirality $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$, which perturbs the resonant\nconditions and contributes to asymmetric frequency tuning.

Furthermore, we investigate\nthe underlying mode-coupling dynamics of the system, highlighting strong\nphoton-photon interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b64\u8bba\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5728\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u5171\u632f\u5668\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u78c1\u87ba\u65cb\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002 \u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u7531\u5bfc\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684controller\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7535\u78c1\u87ba\u65cb\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u7535\u573a\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u53e0\u3002 \u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8e\u4ecb\u7535\u548c\u78c1\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u6a21\u5f0f\u9891\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u3002 \u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5947\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u4efd\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u4e2d\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u87ba\u65cb\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u78c1\u65cb\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7535\u78c1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5bfc\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u7535\u573a\u7684\u975e\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u53e0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u7535\u78c1\u65cb\u5ea6\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9891\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u78c1\u65cb\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7535\u78c1\u87ba\u65cb\u8f90\u5c04\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5149\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u8c03\u63a7\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Here, we propose a spin and valley\nversion of EHE. We demonstrate that the transverse spin and valley currents can\nbe generated in an all-in-one tunnel junction based on a buckled 2D hexagonal\nmaterial in response to a perpendicular electric field, referred to as the\nelectric spin Hall effect and electric valley Hall effect, respectively. These\neffects arise from the perpendicular-electric-field-induced backreflection\nphase of electrons in the junction spacer, independent of Berry curvature. The\nvalley Hall conductance exhibits an odd response to the perpendicular electric\nfield, whereas the spin Hall conductance shows an even one. The predicted\neffects can further enable the transverse separation of a pair of pure\nspin-valley-locked states with full spin-valley polarization while preserving\ntime-reversal symmetry, as manifested by equal spin and valley Hall angles.

These hybrid architectures\ncombine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate\ncollective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong\nshort-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering\nmany-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely\ndifferent length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable\nmodel for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we\nrestrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a\nkinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This\napproach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime\nof strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent\nframework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range\ninteractions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and N\\'eel-ordered\nphases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase,\ndistinct from the conventional superradiant phase.

Abouraddy"], "title": "Broadband entangled-photon omni-resonance in a planar optical cavity", "comment": null, "summary": "Resonant field enhancement in an optical cavity is a promising pathway\ntowards realizing optical nonlinearities at the few-photon level. This quest is\nhampered by inevitable narrowing of the resonant linewidth as the cavity\nfinesse is increased, which necessitates striking a compromise between the\nmagnitude of the field enhancement and the bandwidth over which it is\nharnessed. This difficulty is exacerbated for broadband entangled-photon pairs,\nwhich are typically frequency-anticorrelated, so that the two photons cannot be\nsimultaneously admitted to a cavity except when the degenerate wavelength\ncoincides with a cavity resonance. Here we show that introducing judicious\nangular dispersion into single-photon and entangled-photon states before\nincidence on a planar Fabry-P{\\'e}rot (FP) cavity renders these non-classical\nfields omni-resonant: the entire spectrum is coupled to a single longitudinal\ncavity mode. Making use of a planar FP cavity of finesse $\\approx100$, resonant\nlinewidth $\\approx0.3$~nm, and free spectral range $\\approx22$~nm in the\nnear-infrared, we couple single-photon states and frequency-anticorrelated\nentangled-photon states of 20-nm bandwidth to a broadband achromatic resonance\nassociated with a single underlying narrowband longitudinal FP-cavity mode --\nthereby preserving the entangled spectral structure.

A comparison\nstudy demonstrates that the 4-row structure, with large $J_\\mathrm{OFF}$ and\nrestricted operation range, is inappropriate for realistic FET applications.\nThe pristine structure has a high $V_g^\\mathrm{OFF}$ ($\\sim$1.1 V) makes it\nless practical, since such a large threshold voltage may promote time-dependent\ndielectric breakdown (TDDB) of the oxide layer, reducing device dependability.\nThe 6-row and 8-row structures exhibit more favorable $V_g^\\mathrm{OFF}$ values\n($\\sim$0.75 V), achieving compromise, making them more promising candidates for\nfuture FET integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76WSe\u2082\u5355\u5c42\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u6c2e\u5468\u671f\u63ba\u6742\u5bf9\u80fd\u5e26\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u548c optoelectronic \u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u63ba\u6742\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u80fd\u9699\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002\u66ff\u6362\u5c42\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9 Spin \u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u5bf9\u5668\u4ef6\u5207\u6362\u7535\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86 2D \u692d\u5706 Fermi \u8868\u9762\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u3002\u7535\u7279\u6027\u8868\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u975e ': : 2D \u692d\u5706 Fermi \u8868\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u3002 \u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6211\u4eec\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684 2D \u692d\u5706 Fermi \u8868\u9762\uff0c \u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u80fd\u9699\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bf9\u7535\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Understanding the electronic properties of transition metal dichlorides (TMDs) through their structural and chemical modifications is critical for advancing the field of materials science and nanotechnology.", "method": "X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis, and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) were used to characterize the structural and electronic properties of the materials.

Application of external magnetic\nfields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered\nphases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak\ncoupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been\nproposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to\nfeature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the\nzero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific\nfamily of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite\nvalue in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis\n(arXiv:2501.18591).

The use of phase-retrieval algorithms to probe topological charge represents a sophisticated approach, highlighting advancements in experimental techniques. Overall, the study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on topological effects in optics and opens up new avenues for research in nonlinear optical phenomena.", "method": "The study was conducted experimentally with a pump laser beam undergoing a parametric interaction with toluene, followed by off-resonant laser probing of the resulting spatial magnetization textures. Phase-retrieval algorithms were employed to analyze the probe beam's phase profile, which was used to assess the topological charge. A paraxial approximation-based theoretical model was used to model the third-order nonlinearity and relate it to Berry's curvature, allowing for the calculation of topological invariants. The experiment involved significant manipulation of light-matter interactions to induce and probe the topological properties. While the exact steps of the method are unclear at first glance, the integration of experimental and theoretical approaches strengthens the conclusion. The experimental setup likely involved generating a spatially structured pump beam to induce the necessary optical textures, which were then probed using off-resonant techniques to minimize interference. Proper alignment and precise control over the laser parameters are likely essential for the observed results. The calculation of Berry's curvature suggests a strong reliance on quantum mechanics principles. To improve reproducibility and robustness, the authors may have used multiple seeds or averaged results, ensuring statistical significance. However, the brief description leaves some aspects of the experimental setup and data analysis unclear. The phase-retrieval algorithms typically involve complex iterative mathematical processing to reconstruct the phase information, which adds another layer of technical detail to the methodology. The theoretical modeling involved a paraxial approximation, which simplifies the nonlinear interaction term but may limit the accuracy in certain scenarios where higher-order effects become significant. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results strengthens the validity of the findings. The probe beam's transmission through the nonlinear medium was measured, and the phase profile extracted using phase-retrieval techniques, which is a standard method in wavefront analysis. The calculation of the topological charge, which is quantized and relates to Berry's curvature, is a rigorous approach to establishing the topological nature of the observed effect. The experiment demonstrates that the induced textures indeed carry nontrivial topological charges, confirming the theoretical predictions. However, the reliance on theory in both the method and the interpretation of results suggests that the experiment could benefit from a more direct observation method. Additionally, the optical configuration requires precise alignment of the pump beam with the solvent and the probe beam, ensuring that the nonlinear interaction occurs in the desired region. The use of off-resonant probing might be intentional to minimize crosstalk with other modes and to clearly extract the interaction-induced effects. This approach would have prevented potential interference from other optical pathways, making the results clearer. The integration of these techniques shows a progression in the experimental methods for exploring topological states in optics but may depend on further validation with additional experimental parameters or systematic error checks.", "result": "The experiment reports the successful observation of topological Hall effect in an all-optical third-order nonlinear optical process. The pump laser beam with spatially structured patterns creates pseudo-spin textures, leading to a nontrivial Berry's curvature and, consequently, the topological Hall effect in the transmitted probe beam. The phase profile obtained through phase-retrieval algorithms is consistent with the theoretical calculations of Berry's curvature, establishing a direct link between the observed topological charge and the predicted behavior. This result validates the theoretical framework of topological magnon systems and opens new possibilities for exploiting topological properties in unconventional optical devices. The fact that the probe beam, which was off-resonant, still captured the relevant topological information suggests that robust, controllable topological states can be induced and observed in such systems.

Extracted phase information and calculated Berry curvature support the link between the observed topological charge and intrinsic properties of the system. This research extends the understanding of nontrivial topological states in light-matter interactions and paves the way for potential applications in areas like optical switching and all-optical signal processing. The methodology, which combines phase-retrieval techniques with theoretical modeling, offers a robust framework for analyzing and predicting topological phenomena in complex optical systems. Future work could aim to utilize these findings for the design of novel optical devices that leverage the topological properties to enhance functionality and robustness against interference.", "conclusion": "This paper reports the first experimental evidence of the topological Hall effect in an all-optical third-order nonlinear process. By generating and manipulating pseudo-spin textures through a spatially structured pump laser beam, the probe beam's phase profile is determined to carry a quantized topological charge. This charge corresponds to the Berry curvature of the third-order interaction, providing direct evidence of topological charge quantization in such systems. The experiment successfully demonstrates that the observed topological properties are consistent across theoretical predictions and experimental measurements, establishing a fundamental link between topological magnon systems and nonlinear optical phenomena. This breakthrough in understanding topological effects in nonlinear optics opens the door for future research and applications in areas such as all-optical switching, optical computing, and the development of highly efficient optical devices."}}

This generalizes results of\nFriedrich, who constructed spacetimes with a smooth conformal compactification\nin the case when the initial data is identical to Kerr initial data on the\ncomplement of a compact set. Our results rely on a novel formulation of the\nEinstein equations about Minkowski spacetime introduced by the author, that\nallows one to formulate the dynamic problem as a quasilinear, symmetric\nhyperbolic PDE that is regular at null infinity and with null infinity being at\na fixed locus. It is not regular at spacelike infinity, due to the asymptotics\nof Kerr. Thus the main technical task is the construction of solutions near\nspacelike infinity, using tailored energy estimates. To accomplish this, we\norganize the equations according to homogeneity with respect to scaling about\nspacelike infinity, which identifies terms that are leading, respectively lower\norder, near spacelike infinity, with contributions from Kerr being lower order.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper studies perturbations of Minkowski spacetime in general relativity with specific decay rate towards Kerr data.

Our analysis of the\nquasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum identifies two distinct families of modes: the\nphoton sphere (PS) family, arising from delocalized scattering resonances, and\nthe echo family, corresponding to highly localized quasi-bound states. We then\ndevelop a windowed energy analysis framework in the time domain, which\ndiscloses a dynamic competition for dominance between these families.

We study the interaction between two test\nparticles, subject to deformed Galilean relativity, and a classical, undeformed\ngravitational source, the Earth.

For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a\nlinear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from\nlevel repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we\nidentify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor\nabove its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is\neffective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves\ncontributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many\nuncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form\nfactor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\\ln L)^2$. Besides being\nexact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural\napproximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite\ncoupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an\nearly-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively\nsimilar to that in our solvable model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728Minimal\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u89e3\u6790\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u8fbe\u4e86\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u7ad9\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4e24\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u975e\u5e38\u543b\u5408\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eL\u7ad9\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u540e\uff0c\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u51fa\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6df7\u6c8c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u5c42\u6392\u65a5\u7279\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5728\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d21\u732e\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u6240\u8003\u8651\u7684\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u975e\u5e38\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u4e5f\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8eMinimal\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684Minimal\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u548c\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u7ad9\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6c42\u5f97\u7cbe\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5b8c\u5168\u543b\u5408\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927L\u7ad9\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u5728Minimal\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u5f97\u4e86\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u7ad9\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e24\u70b9\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927L\u7ad9\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8c31\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728Minimal\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u5c40\u90e8Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u4f53\u7cfb\u548c\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation\nalgorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and\nsystematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical\nframework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical\nmechanics to devise a \\emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the\nBP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially\nfast if an object called the \\emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast\nwith the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a\nsimple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary\norder. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising\nmodel, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and\nexisting corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion.
