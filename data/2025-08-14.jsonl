We meticulously construct\na net of local observable C*-algebras, generated by gauge-invariant composite\noperators such as color-singlet currents and traces of non-Abelian electric\nfields, with the non-Abelian Gauss's law rigorously enforced as an operator\nconstraint. Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate that no\nDoplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) superselection sectors carry nonzero color charge,\nthereby providing a precise and mathematically robust characterization of\nconfinement in these theories. To fully capture the global gauge structure, we\nextend the observable net by incorporating nonlocal Wilson line operators,\nwhich encode string-like color flux configurations essential to the theory's\ntopological properties. We further establish a structural violation of Haag\nduality, showing that certain operators, such as Wilson lines, reside in the\ncommutant of a local algebra but cannot be localized within the algebra of the\ncausal complement, a phenomenon driven by nontrivial topological degrees of\nfreedom.

In this paper, we\ncalculate the average subsystem Bures distance in the spin-1/2 transverse-field\nIsing chain. We develop an efficient algorithm to evaluate the Bures distance\nbetween two Gaussian states, which allows us to access larger system sizes. To\naddress the degeneracy issue, we consider simultaneous eigenstates of all local\nconserved charges and use these charges to systematically order degenerate\nstates. The results align with the conjectured linear increase with subsystem\nsize. We demonstrate that the distinct scaling behaviors of the average\nsubsystem trace and Bures distances in chaotic versus integrable systems stem\nfrom discontinuities of local conserved charges across the spectrum in\nintegrable systems.

In leading atomic systems, control is optical: UV-NIR beams\nmust be fanned out over numerous spatial channels and modulated to implement\ngates. While photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a potentially scalable\nsolution, they also need to simultaneously feature high-speed and\nhigh-extinction modulation, strong inter-channel isolation, and broad\nwavelength compatibility. Here, we introduce and experimentally validate a\nfoundry-fabricated PIC platform that overcomes these limitations. Designed for\nRubidium-87 neutral atom quantum computers, our 8-channel PICs, fabricated on a\n200-mm wafer process, demonstrate an advanced combination of performance\nmetrics. At the 795 nm single-qubit gate wavelength, we achieve a mean\nextinction ratio (ER) of 71.4 $\\pm$ 1.1 dB, nearest-neighbor on-chip crosstalk\nof -68.0 $\\pm$ 1.0 dB, and -50.8 $\\pm$ 0.2 dB after parallel beam delivery in\nfree-space. This high-performance operation extends to the 420 nm and 1013 nm\nwavelengths for two-qubit Rydberg gates, showing ERs of 42.4 dB\n(detector-limited) and 61.5 dB, respectively. The devices exhibit 10-90% rise\ntimes of 26 $\\pm$ 7 ns, achieve dynamic switching to -60 dB levels within\nmicrosecond timescales, and show pulse stability errors at the $10^{-3}$ level.\nThis work establishes a scalable platform for developing advanced large-scale\noptical control required in fault-tolerant quantum computers and other\nprecision technologies."}

In order to run computations reliably on such devices, a fully\nfault-tolerant scheme is needed for state preparation, gates, and measurements.\nHowever, current fault-tolerant schemes have either been limited to specific\ncode families or have not been developed fully. In this work, we develop a\ngeneral framework for fault-tolerant computation with logical degrees encoded\ninto Majorana hardware. We emphasize the division between even and odd Majorana\ncodes and how it manifests when constructing fault tolerant gadgets for these\nfamilies. We provide transversal constructions and supplement them with\nmeasurements to obtain several examples of fault tolerant Clifford gadgets. For\nthe case of odd codes, we give a novel construction for gadgets using quantum\nreference frames, that allows to implement operations that are forbidden due to\nparity superselection. We also provide a fault-tolerant measurement scheme for\nMajorana codes inspired by Steane error correction, enabling state preparation,\nmeasurement of logical operations and error correction. We also point out a\nconstruction for odd Majorana codes with transversal T gates. Finally, we\nconstruct an asympotically good quantum LDPC Majorana code with qubit degrees\nof freedom. Our work shows that all necessary elements of fault-tolerant\nquantum computation can be consistently implemented in fermionic hardware such\nas Majorana nanowires and fermionic neutral atoms."}

An analogous behavior occurs in\ncertain quantum systems where quantum states can recur after sufficiently long\nunitary evolution, a phenomenon known as quantum recurrence. Periodically\ndriven (i.e. Floquet) quantum systems in particular exhibit complex dynamics\neven in small dimensions, motivating the study of how interactions and\nHamiltonian structure affect recurrence behavior. While most existing studies\ntreat recurrence in an approximate, distance-based sense, here we address the\nproblem of exact, state-independent recurrences in a broad class of\nfinite-dimensional Floquet systems, spanning both integrable and non-integrable\nmodels. Leveraging techniques from algebraic field theory, we construct an\narithmetic framework that identifies all possible recurrence times by analyzing\nthe cyclotomic structure of the Floquet unitary's spectrum. This\ncomputationally efficient approach yields both positive results, enumerating\nall candidate recurrence times and definitive negative results, rigorously\nruling out exact recurrences for given Hamiltonian parameters. We further prove\nthat rational Hamiltonian parameters do not, in general, guarantee exact\nrecurrence, revealing a subtle interplay between system parameters and\nlong-time dynamics. Our findings sharpen the theoretical understanding of\nquantum recurrences, clarify their relationship to quantum chaos, and highlight\nparameter regimes of special interest for quantum metrology and control."}

We focus in\nparticular on parametrized families of quantum channels and aim to improve\nbounds on their quantum capacity threshold, defined as the lowest noise level\nat which the quantum capacity of the channel family vanishes. These thresholds\nare important quantities as they mark the noise level up to which faithful\nquantum communication is theoretically possible. Our method exploits the fact\nthat independent and identically distributed quantum channels preserve any\npermutation symmetry present at the input. The resulting symmetric output\nstates can be described succinctly using the representation theory of the\nsymmetric and general linear groups, which we use to derive an efficient\nalgorithm for computing the channel coherent information of a\npermutation-invariant code. Our approach allows us to evaluate coherent\ninformation values for a large number of channel copies, e.g., at least 100\nchannel copies for qubit channels. We apply this method to various physically\nrelevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure\nchannel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing\nchannel. For each channel family we obtain improved lower bounds on their\nquantum capacities. For example, for the 2-Pauli and BB84 channel families we\nsignificantly improve the best known quantum capacity thresholds derived in\n[Fern, Whaley 2008]. These threshold improvements are achieved using a\nrepetition code-like input state with non-orthogonal code states, which we\nfurther analyze in our representation-theoretic framework."}

We analyze and compare four different definitions of\nentropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD\nentropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each\nentropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB\nentropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement\nbetween the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix.\nCombining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent\nnon-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged,\nwhereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further\napply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several\nensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal\neigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in\n$PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases\nconsidered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror\nthe behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in\ncontrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can be unbounded or fails to\nscale with system size."}

Benchmark simulations on\none-dimensional Tully models and multidimensional spin-boson Hamiltonians\ndemonstrate that SLED reproduces electronic populations and captures the\nessential features of coherence decay. The tests, however, also revealed that\naccurate treatment will require generalizing the localization kernel\ncontrolling the electron-nucleus coupling strength, from a constant into a\nfunction of time and phase space coordinates.

We performed thermal conductivity\nmeasurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice\nnanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a\nminimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to\nroom temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from\ncoherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed\nby surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is\nalso observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab\ninitio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics\ncalculations.
