An illustrative example\nis the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to\nlead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we\npropose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the\nstationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance\nunder null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions,\nthe classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence\nis covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields\nan axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave\ndisplays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the\nexterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a\nspecial case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild\nblack hole.

Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of\ntheir behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In\nthis Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding\nbased on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we\ninvestigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$\nladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we\nfind that the dopant is \\emph{localized} for all investigated \\emph{nonzero}\ntemperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization\nlength controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice,\nwhereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This\ngreatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert\nspace fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant\ndelocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive\nfor weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough\nexchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite\ntemperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative\ndifferences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows\nself-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian\nbehavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient\nfollows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially\ndecreases for decreasing temperatures."}

At 3,000 K, 10%\nethanol addition and 10% methanol addition reduced the production of NOx by\napproximately 39.6% and 30.1%, respectively, compared with the base fuel. This\nsuppression is attributed to the charge redistribution and the redirection of\nnitrogen intermediates through stabilising pathways such as HNO, HNO2, and N2O.\nSimulation-derived descriptors served as the training data for machine learning\n(ML) models, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector\nRegression (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and Fully Connected\nNeural Networks (FCNN). RFR achieved superior performance compared with other\nmodels with an R2 of 0.993 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.661. The trained\nML models successfully predicted NOx emissions for both simulated alcohol\nratios (0%, 5% and 12%), and non-simulated alcohol ratios (2%, 7%, and 12%)\nwhich demonstrating how hybrid physics-informed ML algorithms can extrapolate\ncomplex chemical behaviours, along with prediction errors under 5% for most\nextrapolated ethanol cases.

Metal-organic frameworks\n(MOFs) are one of the most versatile classes of porous crystals. So far only\ntwo-photon upconverting processes have been realized in MOFs both by ligand\nbased triplet-triplet annihilation and directly in lanthanide ions. Here we\nreport on Yb3+/Er3+-trimesate-based MOFs that exhibit photon avalanche (PA)\ncharacteristics. The PA process conventionally occurs through cross-relaxation\nwithin the lanthanide emitter manifold. In contrast, here PA proceeds in the\norganic molecule part and relies on a cooperative process, involving multiple\nemission centers. The IR photons are first absorbed and upconverted into high\nenergy electronic population by the action of the lanthanide ions (Yb3+ and\nEr3+ are the sensitizer and the activator, respectively). Subsequently, the\nelectrons are funneled into electronically coupled triplet states of the\ntrimesate ligand, enabling accumulation in the organic matrix. This reservoir\nacts as source for a highly nonlinear spectrally broadband emission, arising\nmainly from ligand triplet states. The nonlinearity factor is comparable with\nthe well-established PA inorganic nanoparticles.

Generalizing the quasiclassical theory of non-adiabatic tunneling\ndriven by classical light, a single tunneling event is described by a bundle of\ntunneling solutions, each driven by a classical field corresponding to one\nrealization in the ensemble. Quantum statistics of light are thus imprinted on\nthe measured current. Fully quantum description of light via the Bohmian\ntrajectories of its field provides a perfect fit to the description of the\nelectron (under-) above-barrier dynamics in terms of (complex quasiclassical)\nreal classical trajectories, resulting in a consistent and elegant theoretical\napproach. To illustrate this, we consider BSV-induced electron transport from\nthe tip to the surface in the tunneling microscope configuration demonstrating\nthe transition from the multiphoton to the direct tunneling regime."}

In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant\ndelocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive\nfor weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough\nexchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite\ntemperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative\ndifferences.

Our\nresults uncover distinct relaxation regimes, transitioning from\nspin-spin-interaction-driven and disorder-induced stretched exponential\ndynamics at low temperatures and fields to relaxation dominated by\nsingle-phonon processes at elevated magnetic fields. We extract temperature-\nand magnetic-field-dependent scaling behaviors of the relaxation rate to\nprovide a quantitative picture of the interactions between $\\mathrm{V_B^-}$\ncenters and their environment.

Homological products of classical codes\noffer a versatile framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes\nwith desirable properties, especially quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC)\ncodes. Based on extensions of the Bravyi--K\\\"{o}nig theorem that encompass\ncodes without geometric locality, we establish a series of general no-go\ntheorems for fault-tolerant logical gates supported by hypergraph product\ncodes. Specifically, we show that non-Clifford logical gates cannot be\nimplemented transversally on hypergraph product codes of all product\ndimensions, and that the dimensions impose various limitations on the\naccessible level of the Clifford hierarchy gates by constant-depth local\ncircuits. We also discuss examples both with and without geometric locality\nwhich attain the Clifford hierarchy bounds.

In this work, we show that if the limits of integration in the path\nintegral are finite, the perturbative series is remarkably an absolutely\nconvergent series which works well at strong coupling. For now, we apply this\nperturbative approach to $\\lambda \\,\\phi^4$ theory in 0+0 dimensions (a basic\nintegral) and 0+1 dimensions (quantum anharmonic oscillator). For the basic\nintegral, we show that finite integral limits yields a convergent series whose\nvalues are in agreement with exact analytical results at any coupling. This\nworked even when the asymptotic series was not Borel summable. It is well known\nthat the perturbative series expansion in powers of the coupling for the energy\nof the anhaorminic oscillator yields an asymptotic series and hence fails at\nstrong coupling. In quantum mechanics, if one is interested in the energy, it\nis often easier to use Schr\\\"odinger's equation to develop a perturbative\nseries than path integrals. Finite path integral limits are then equivalent to\nplacing infinite walls at positions -L and L in the potential where L is\npositive, finite and can be arbitrarily large. With walls, the series expansion\nfor the energy is now convergent and approaches the energy of the anharmonic\noscillator as the walls are moved further apart. We use the convergent series\nto calculate the ground state energy at weak, intermediate and strong coupling.\nAt strong coupling, the result from the series agrees with the exact (correct)\nenergy to within 0.1 %, a remarkable result in light of the fact that at strong\ncoupling the usual perturbative series diverges badly right from the start."}
