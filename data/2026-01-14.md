Abstract: Many experimental methods in physics require understanding radiation from single particles into non-trivial electromagnetic mode structures. Such characterization is critical for Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), an advancing new measurement technique that has the potential to greatly benefit fundamental physics measurements. In CRES, charged particles emit cyclotron radiation at frequencies that provide their energy measurement. As a notable example, the Project 8 experiment aims to kinematically infer the neutrino mass by measuring the energies of electrons emitted in tritium beta decay using CRES. In near-term realizations of Project 8, resonant cylindrical cavities will be used for CRES readout, in a configuration with a magnetic field oriented along the symmetry axis, and electrons following helical cyclotron trajectories confined to the cavity interior. The physics of electromagnetic radiation in these environments is complicated, since it involves both the motion of the emitting particle and the mode structure imposed by the cavity. In this work, we derive and validate an analytic model for how an oscillating, trapped electron radiates into cavity modes, and the power and frequency content of the radiation that can be read out from these events. These results can be used to guide the design of cavities for future CRES and other experiments.

Abstract: In this work, we present a conditional denoising-diffusion surrogate for electromagnetic calorimeter showers that is trained to generate high-fidelity energy-deposition maps conditioned on key detector and beam parameters. The model employs efficient inference using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model sampling and is pre-trained on GEANT4 simulations before being adapted to a new calorimeter geometry through Low-Rank Adaptation, requiring only a small post-training dataset. We evaluate physically meaningful observables, including total deposited energy, energy-weighted radius, and shower dispersion, obtaining relative root mean square error values below 2% for representative high-energy cases. This is in line with state-of-the-art calorimeter surrogates which report comparable fidelity on high-level observables. Furthermore, we compare gradients of a reconstruction-based utility function with respect to design parameters between the surrogate and finite-difference references. The diffusion surrogate reproduces the qualitative structure and directional trends of the true utility landscape, providing usable sensitivities for gradient-based optimization. These results show that diffusion-based surrogates can accelerate simulation-driven detector design while enabling differentiable, gradient-informed analysis.

Motivation: A dedicated RIXS spectrometer with $hν^2$ concept improves resolution and efficiency.

Method: A 2D-RIXS spectrometer utilizing $hν^2$ and dispersive X-ray techniques was built and optimized for high-resolution X-ray scattering analysis.

Result: 

Conclusion: A high-performance, energy-resolved X-ray scattering instrument capable of achieving sub-10 meV resolution with good throughput has been successfully developed.

Abstract: A state-of-the-art Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) facility, composed of a dedicated beamline and a 2D-RIXS spectrometer, has been constructed and commissioned at BL02U in NanoTerasu, Japan. This paper reports the optical design and optimization of this spectrometer, aiming for an ultrahigh energy resolution of <10 meV in the soft X-ray range. Conventional RIXS spectrometers using monochromatic incident X-rays suffer from a severe trade-off between energy resolution and measurement efficiency, which makes achieving resolutions of <10 meV practically unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we adopted the $hν^2$ concept using dispersive incident X-rays, based on a comparative study. This approach decouples the energy resolution from the incident bandwidth. We estimate that our 2D-RIXS spectrometer improves efficiency by more than a factor of 10 compared to conventional spectrometers. The 2D-RIXS spectrometer has been successfully commissioned, demonstrating that sub-10 meV resolution measurement is achievable with practical throughput. While development continues towards the ultimate design resolution, the successful implementation validates the design strategy and offers a pathway for future high-performance RIXS instrumentation.

### [4] [A New Beam Monitor at NFS/SPIRAL2 Based on Position-Sensitive PPACs Detecting Fission Fragments from ${}^{238}$U$(n,f)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07896)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to enhance neutron beam monitoring capabilities at NFS for better neutron intensity measurement in in-beam experiments.

Method: The setup uses an array of PS-PPACs to detect fission fragments simultaneously and employs the Time-of-Flight method to determine neutron energy. The setup operates in parallel with other experiments for concurrent monitoring.

Result: The setup effectively measures neutron beam flux and profile with high accuracy, enabling in situ neutron intensity monitoring. Early results with the high-intensity white-spectrum neutron beam show successful operation and precise measurements.

Conclusion: This innovative neutron beam monitor setup enhances the facility's ability to conduct precise and real-time neutron beam monitoring, supporting advanced in-beam experiments.

Abstract: A new experimental setup has been installed at the Time-Of-Flight area of the Neutrons For Science facility (NFS) at GANIL/SPIRAL2 for neutron beam monitoring. This setup consists of an array of Position-Sensitive Parallel-Plate Avalanche Counters (PS-PPACs) that detects both fission fragments in coincidence from secondary neutron-induced fission reactions in several ${}^{238}$U targets. The neutron energy is determined on an event-by-event basis using the Time-of-Flight method, and the reaction point within the U targets is reconstructed, enabling the measurement of the neutron beam flux and beam profile. The high transparency of the setup allows it to operate in parallel with other experiments running at NFS, thus providing an in-beam monitor of the neutron intensity. In this work, we report on the characteristics of this new setup, its operating principle, and the first results obtained using the high-intensity white-spectrum neutron beam at NFS. This beam is produced via reactions between a primary 40-MeV deuteron beam, accelerated in the SPIRAL2 LINAC, and a 8 mm-thick rotating beryllium converter target.

Abstract: We report on the design, development, and installation of the ALPS Cryo-Platform Subcooler Box (ACPS), which is part of the cryogenic platform being established in the HERA North Hall at DESY to supply helium for cooling large-scale dark-matter and gravitational-wave experiments with very high heat loads. The ACPS is capable of subcooling supercritical helium supplied via the 1.6-km-long HERA transfer line by means of a pipe heat exchanger immersed in a subcooler bath filled with liquid helium produced through Joule-Thomson valves. It is also equipped with numerous cryogenic components, including control valves, flow meters, and safety valves, enabling experimental operation to be carried out directly by the ACPS itself and thereby reducing the cryogenic requirements imposed on the experiments. To support a wide range of experiments, the ACPS provides three transfer lines that deliver different levels of cooling power.

TL;DR: An improved cryogenic phonon detector design enhances responsivity by utilizing dedicated phonon collectors that trapped quasi-particles after phonon scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low energy threshold detection for dark matter searches and neutrino scattering experiments requires sensitive and responsive phonon detectors. Enhancing detector performance through innovative design is crucial.

Method: The detector uses a 77nm trilayer Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum structure as the KID sensor, coupled with 100nm Aluminum phonon collectors. The separation between components increases quasi-particle density within the device, facilitating enhanced responsivity.

Result: The improved setup achieves a 5-fold increase in detector responsivity compared to a standard phonon-mediated KID.

Conclusion: The advanced phonon collector design significantly boosts the detector’s sensitivity and performance for low energy particle detection applications.

Abstract: Cryogenic phonon detectors are adopted in light dark matter searches and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments as they can achieve low energy thresholds. The phonon mediated sensing of silicon particle absorbers has already been proved with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), acting both as sensors and athermal phonon absorbers at the same time. In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five.

Abstract: This article presents an evaluation of off-the-shelf commercial accelerometers at the mixing chamber stage of a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator at temperatures down to 8 mK. In addition, we present results of radioassay of accelerometer samples using a high purity germanium detector counting setup. Cryogen-free dilution refrigerators using pulse-tube cryocoolers (PTs)-due to recent advances in their cooling capacity, long-term stability, and operational costs-have become ubiquitous tools in a wide range of fields ranging from experimental particle physics to quantum information sciences. However, vibrations induced by PTs can negatively impact the experimental payload in these applications. This work demonstrates that commercially available accelerometers can not only measure vibrations at millikelvin cryogenic temperatures but also pave the way for continuous, in situ, real-time vibration monitoring of dry dilution refrigerators.

Result: 结果表明，在有限状态条件下，小时钟的振荡频率受驱动力和环境因素的共同影响。当驱动频率与内部驱动力匹配时，系统达到最佳协调状态。此外，系统的准确性和能量消耗之间存在权衡，最佳状态数通常在5到15之间。

Conclusion: 结论是小时钟机制通过在有限状态数的情况下实现最佳的精确性和能量效率平衡，这种设计在自然界中是普遍适用的。

Abstract: Hour-glass clocks do not free-run; they keep time by riding an external rhythm. Motivated by the primordial KaiBC system in cyanobacteria, we study a driven, finite-state molecular clock that advances through a small number of biochemical states under an intrinsic driving energy and a rotating energy landscape set by day-night metabolism. In the continuum limit, coherence is maximized at a resonant operating point where the intrinsic drift matches the driving frequency. In realistic clocks with a finite number of states, discreteness matters: as the rotating landscape sweeps over a lattice of states, it generates a small and high frequency vibration of the collective phase that makes timing inaccurate. Combining the resonant cost with this discreteness penalty yields a trade-off in the number of states: few states are energetically cheap but noisy; many states are precise but costly. The optimum lies at moderate discretization (typically five to fifteen states) and an environmental coupling that is strong enough for responsiveness yet weak enough to avoid large discrete-state vibrations. These design rules rationalize why KaiC's hexameric architecture falls near the predicted optimum and suggest a general principle for hour-glass clocks across organisms.

Abstract: RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a molecular machine that reads information encoded in the base sequence of a DNA template while producing mechanical motion (transcription elongation; forward/backward stepping; backtracking) through chemical-potential differences of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and fluctuations under external conditions. A prior work formulated a mismatch in free-energy accounting as the involvement of a term originating from genetic information (e.g.\ $k_BT\log P(N)$), and interpreted RNAP as a Maxwell's demon / Szilard-engine-like device that converts information into motion. However, in information thermodynamics, the bookkeeping of information and dissipation can depend on how one partitions the composite system into a device and a target (observer/observed labeling).

Abstract: This work demonstrates efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between ensembles of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers located 7 nm and 9 nm below a single-crystal diamond surface and a naturally occurring fluorophore, namely a mixture of chlorophyll a and b molecules extracted from Arabidopsis thaliana. The broad fluorescence band of NV centers spectrally overlaps with the absorption of chlorophyll molecules, enabling FRET. As a result, depositing a chlorophyll layer on the diamond surface reduces the NV fluorescence lifetime from approximately 14 ns to below 4 ns, indicating efficient energy transfer. Laser-induced photobleaching of chlorophyll restores the unquenched NV lifetime. In contrast, NV centers located deeper within the diamond at depths of 40 nm and 72 nm remain unaffected, confirming that the observed quenching originates from a short-range FRET mechanism. The NV ensembles retain their optically detected magnetic resonance contrast while FRET is observed, demonstrating preservation of their spin properties. These proof-of-principle experiments establish the feasibility of combining FRET-based distance measurements with magnetic sensing using optically readable spins.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of drones poses significant challenges for airspace management, security, and surveillance. Current detection and classification technologies, including cameras, LiDAR, and conventional radar systems, often struggle to reliably identify and differentiate drones, especially those of similar models, under diverse environmental conditions and at extended ranges. Moreover, low radar cross sections and clutter further complicate accurate drone identification. To address these limitations, we propose a novel drone classification method based on artificial micro-Doppler signatures encoded by resonant electromagnetic stickers attached to drone blades. These tags generate distinctive, configuration-specific radar returns, enabling robust identification. We develop a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of processing raw radar signals, achieving high classification accuracy. Extensive experiments were conducted both in anechoic chambers with 43 tag configurations and outdoors under realistic flight trajectories and noise conditions. Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), provided insight into code separability and robustness. Our results demonstrate reliable drone classification performance at signal-to-noise ratios as low as 7 dB, indicating the feasibility of long-range detection with advanced surveillance radar systems. Preliminary range estimations indicate potential operational distances of several kilometers, suitable for critical applications such as airport airspace monitoring. The integration of electromagnetic tagging with machine learning enables scalable and efficient drone identification, paving the way for enhanced aerial traffic management and security in increasingly congested airspaces.

Abstract: High-resolution imaging of magnetic nanostructures is essential for understanding fundamental spin phenomena and designing advanced devices. Recent developments in three-dimensional (3D) nanomagnetism have highlighted the growing need for imaging techniques that can capture magnetic structures across curved or tilted surfaces with high sensitivity. Though widely used as a powerful technique for imaging magnetization states, conventional magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy faces inherent limitations in measuring non-planar systems due to its shallow depth of field (DOF). Here, we present an extended depth of field MOKE imaging approach, combining through-focus scanning with image-stitching-based reconstruction, to obtain sharp and well-resolved magnetic domain images across non-planar sample geometries. The method is validated on both perpendicularly and in-plane magnetized films tilted on purpose for this study, enabling quantitative analysis of domain morphology and detection sensitivity. This laboratory-accessible technique provides a fast and versatile route for 3D magnetic imaging, complementing large-scale X-ray-based methods and offering a practical tool for investigating non-planar magnetic samples with tilted or curved 3D geometries.

Motivation: The increasing use of LIBs has led to a need for better monitoring techniques that can provide insights into complex electrochemical processes, and UT is emerging as a valuable non-invasive method for this purpose.

Method: The paper reviews existing UT methods for LIBs at various stages of their lifecycle, discusses both physics-based and data-driven modeling approaches, and identifies challenges and opportunities for future research.

Result: The review synthesizes current UT techniques, their effectiveness, and their limitations, while emphasizing the potential of UT when integrated with electrochemical modeling.

Conclusion: This paper underscores the importance of advancing UT techniques to complement electrochemical understanding, thereby improving battery monitoring and management systems.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the leading technology used in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and grid-level electrochemical energy storage applications. The ever-increasing use of LIBs has highlighted a gap in understanding of their behavior throughout their life-cycle. Current monitoring systems rely on electrical and sometimes temperature measurements to assess the internal state which limits information about complex electrochemical processes. In response, ultrasonic testing (UT) has shown promise for non-invasive assessment due to its ease of use and sensitivity to mechanical changes which are correlated with electrochemical changes within the battery. We summarize the research in UT methods applied to LIBs throughout their life-cycle and the relevant techniques at each stage. We also discuss physics-based and data-driven modeling approaches used to interpret ultrasonic signals in the context of LIBs, with an emphasis on the existing challenge of establishing rigorous links between electrochemical behavior and elastic and poroelastic wave physics to gain insight regarding physical changes in the LIB that can be directly measured using UT. Finally, we discuss the challenges of implementing UT across the LIB life-cycle and identify opportunities for further research. This review aims to provide helpful guidance to researchers and practitioners of UT in the growing field of UT for electrochemical battery systems.

Abstract: We present a compact slit-based interface that enables reflection mode conversion in an elastic plate by transforming an incident lowest-order antisymmetric Lamb mode into a reflected lowest-order symmetric Lamb mode. The interface is realized by introducing inclined vacuum slits along the lateral sides of the plate. This geometry intentionally breaks symmetry and produces a strongly localized, vortex-like deformation near the slit tips, which provides an efficient coupling pathway from the antisymmetric incident response to a symmetric reflected component. The conversion is quantified in a consistent, field-based manner by extracting the reflected antisymmetric level from the standing-wave envelope on a probe line placed sufficiently far from the slits, and then inferring the converted symmetric energy under a lossless assumption with only two reflected propagating channels. The proposed design delivers strong low-frequency conversion and sustains broadband half-power operation, while parametric studies confirm that the performance is tunable and robust over a wide range of slit angles and widths.

Abstract: A major unaddressed challenge for food science remains the accurate characterisation of contents in sealed containers with a non-invasive method. This issue is particularly pressing for tackling fraud in the red wine industry, valued at billions of dollars globally, where product authenticity, brand reputation, and consumer trust are paramount. Whilst many techniques exist for authenticating wine externally, to date performing accurate classification of the contents within unopened bottles remains elusive. Using only a single near-infrared optical excitation source operating at a wavelength of 785 nm, in combination with a bespoke geometry to circumvent the confounding signal of the glass, we demonstrate that through-bottle fluorescence spectra can distinguish between twenty different red wines in their original, intact bottles. All twenty wine bottles were correctly classified with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed strong varietal grouping. This non-invasive and rapid technique has the potential to enable on-site, routine wine authentication to combat the growing issue of wine fraud. The geometry itself is applicable across multiple fields for the analysis of other high-value products through their packaging, where authenticity verification is critical.

Abstract: A periodically patterned free surface with inclined slits can convert an incident compressional wave into a reflected shear wave with nearly complete efficiency at very low frequency. The system is described by two-dimensional in-plane linear elasticity, and the slits are treated as voids. The conversion is quantified by the ratio between the reflected shear-wave energy and the incident compressional-wave energy, obtained from mode decomposition and energy-flux evaluation below the surface. The results indicate that the inclined geometry introduces strong coupling between normal and tangential motions at the boundary, enabling suppression of the ordinary compressional reflection while redirecting the reflected energy into the shear channel. This simple, geometry-controlled mechanism provides a compact route for low-frequency elastic-wave polarization control.

Abstract: Illuminating disordered samples with waveforms matched to transmission-matrix eigenchannels produces transmission ranging from complete to vanishing with strong variations in internal energy density, enabling the control of wave propagation for applications in imaging and communications. The origin of these departures from diffusive transport has remained a puzzle since phase coherence is rapidly lost due to scattering. We show here that coherence among waveguide modes grows with sample depth, shaping flux, energy density, and velocity in transmission eigenchannels throughout the sample.

Abstract: Self-imaging represents a core hallmark of paraxial (quadratic)-wave evolution; yet, across its many realizations and generalizations over the past two centuries, the uniformity of recurrence planes along the propagation axis has been considered fundamental. However, by reframing the general phenomenon of self-imaging within its natural symplectic framework, we show that all self-imaging effects are necessarily tied to uniformly periodic recurrences in the canonical evolution coordinate -- metaplectic time -- and that the correspondence of that coordinate to the physical propagation axis represents an unexplored degree of freedom, which can be engineered arbitrarily by the initial transverse phase structure. Using a single programmable spatial light modulator, we demonstrate the construction of Talbot carpets characterized by recurrence spacings that accelerate and decelerate along the propagation axis, as well as those that follow polynomial, exponential, and sinusoidal axial trajectories, all of which preserve exact reconstruction in the canonical metaplectic time. These results establish metaplectic time as the fundamental invariant of self-imaging and reveal a regime of controllable axial dynamics previously thought to be fixed.

Motivation: Modelling of vacuum-induced physical effects is a key area of inquiry for understanding quantum-field theories within confined systems. The possible applications in cavity-based physics, such as nanotechnology, quantum computation, and metrology, create a pronounced desire to comprehend this phenomenon.

Method: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy was employed to analyze the optical conductivity of niobium nitride thin films both in free space and within high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavities. A theoretical model was then used to interpret the observed data in terms of changes in superconducting parameters such as superfluid density and superconducting energy gap.

Result: The research demonstrate that within high-quality factor cavities, there is a significant ($	ext{∼}13	ext{ }	ext{	extperthousand}$) reduction in superfluid density and a minor ($	ext{∼}2	ext{ }	ext{	extperthousand}$) reduction in superconducting gap, both attributed to the impact of cavity-induced vacuum fluctuations. The solid-state response within the cavity differs significantly from the response in free space, highlighting the potential of optical cavities as ultra-sensitive tools for studying material properties related to vacuum interaction.

Conclusion: These findings not only validate theoretical predictions concerning vacuum-induced modifications of physical properties but alsopresent fundamental implications for cavity QED. The results reveal the potential of optical cavities as a powerful platform to probe quantum vacuum effects on matter,with far-reaching possibilities for manipulating and controlling fundamental material properties.

Abstract: Emerging theoretical frameworks suggest that physical properties of matter can be altered within an optical cavity by harnessing quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations, even in the total absence of external driving fields. Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\sim13\,\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\sim2\,\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science.

Abstract: All-dielectric effective-medium-clad waveguides have been widely exploited in terahertz communications owing to their extremely low loss, low dispersion, and broad bandwidth. In this work, we propose a substrateless effective-medium-slot waveguide. Additionally, we introduce a taper-free interface that allows terahertz waves to directly couple from a metallic hollow waveguide without requiring dielectric insertion. By engineering slot couplers with an effectivemedium channel for impedance and modal matching, the waveguide achieves a fractional 3-dB bandwidth of 40% with a maximum coupling efficiency of 90% in the WR-2.2 band (330-500 GHz). By employing a broadband uni-traveling-carrier photodiode transmitter and sub-harmonic mixer receivers, we achieve an aggregated data rate of 0.8 Tbit/s with quadrature amplitude modulation schemes across 14 channels from 330-600 GHz. The effective-medium-slot waveguide platform yields robust broadband coupling with enhanced mechanical protection, offering reliable interconnects for ultra-high-speed terahertz integrated systems.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the correlation functions of the phase of a light wave propagating through a turbulent medium. We use an equation for the logarithm of a wave packet envelope, which includes a second-order nonlinear term. Based on this equation, we develop a diagrammatic technique to calculate corrections to the correlation function obtained in the linear approximation. We calculate the first corrections determined by one-loop diagrams and find its asymptotic behaviors. Some non-perturbative conclusions are made using the symmetry properties of the equation. These results allow us to conclude that the applicability condition for the perturbation theory is the smallness of the Rytov dispersion, $σ_R^2$, and this condition holds uniformly over the distances between observation points.

Abstract: The ability to observe rotational dynamics and measure underlying torques is a crucial component in understanding the function and mechanics of nanoscale systems. Yet, direct observation of rotational dynamics at the single-molecule level in liquids remains challenging due to the trade-off between optical detectability and hydrodynamic responsiveness. Labels that are bright enough for rapid readout typically introduce excessive drag, while minimally perturbing probes are difficult to detect at high speed. This limits access to fast rotational dynamics required for direct torque measurements. Here, we introduce cylindrical-polarization-based interferometric scattering microscopy (cypiSCAT), a method encoding the orientation of anisotropic scatterers directly into a single interferometric point spread function, while intrinsically suppressing the isotropic background. We achieve rotational tracking of low-drag orientation labels based on DNA origami-attached gold nanorods with sub-degree angular precision and microsecond temporal resolution, allowing quantitative characterization of nanoscale rotational dynamics. This capability provides direct access to torque metrology at the single-molecule level, here demonstrated through the extraction of optically induced torques as small as ~1 pN nm. Relying on elastic scattering, cypiSCAT combines ultrafast temporal resolution with long observation times, making it well-suited for capturing rapid and rare rotational events and reaction steps in nanoscale biomolecular systems.

Abstract: Wavelength widely tunable infrared fiber lasers that simultaneously deliver high pulse energies with narrow linewidths are critical for applications ranging from spectroscopy to nonlinear optics, yet achieving this combination has remained a long-standing challenge.

This performance arises from a unique pump laser design together with an optimized selection of gas-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fibers, opening a promising pathway toward compact, high-performance tunable infrared fiber-based sources.

Abstract: Modern Quantum optics largely remains quasi-stationary, far from intrinsic optical field timescales. Ultrafast quantum optics seeks to generate, shape, and measure quantum states of light on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. Here we introduce a quantum light field squeezer (QLFS) that enables the generation and attosecond control of ultrafast broadband squeezed light. Using degenerate four-wave mixing in a quasi-collinear focusing geometry, our approach overcomes conventional broadband phase-matching limits, producing intensity- and phase-squeezed states directly from few-cycle laser pulses. Our ultrafast quantum optical metrology reveals a time-dependent squeezing distribution across individual half-cycles of the electric field. Incorporating this time-dependent squeezing into strong-field simulations shows that the temporal redistribution of quantum uncertainty reshapes the high-harmonic emission. Moreover, by tuning the relative pulse delay and phase-matching angle, we achieve attosecond precision in controlling the squeezing characteristics by visualizing inferred effective Wigner representations of the quantum light field. Beyond characterization, we demonstrate that the quantum light-induced tunneling-current noise is sensitive to the nonclassical intensity-noise statistics of the driving squeezed light, with sub-femtosecond control. Together, these results extend the generation, control, and effective phase-space representation of squeezed light into the ultrafast and attosecond regime, opening new avenues for quantum optics in strong-field and solid-state systems.

Abstract: Virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) spectrometers provide high resolution and fast acquisition in a compact design, but their performance as dispersive instruments is sensitive to fabrication tolerances, component dimensions, and alignment. Here, leveraging numerical simulations validated by experimental data, we present a framework to identify the parameters that limit VIPA spectrometer resolution. This framework is applied to the construction of a new mid infrared VIPA spectrometer, tested at wavelengths near 4.6 um with both continuous-wave and frequency-comb laser sources, with a resolving power predicted by analytical expressions to be as high as RP = 830 000 (corresponding to a resolution of 78 MHz). Validated numerical simulations, however, provided a more realistic estimate that captures limits set by all the optical components. By correcting aberrations and optimizing alignment, a resolving power of RP = 440 000 (150 MHz) was experimentally achieved, corresponding to 80% of the value predicted by numerical simulation of the entire spectrometer. These results bridge the gap between analytical design expressions and experimental results for compact, high-resolution VIPA spectrometers to enable more efficient fabrication and advanced design across critical areas like applied space optics, line-by-line pulse shaping, and broadband spectral sensors.

Abstract: We investigated the modulation in the polarization-dependent optical behaviour of the waveguiding plasmonic crystal by varying the illumination and detection geometry. We employed the finite element method-based COMSOL simulation and Jones-Mueller formalisms to probe the variations in optical parameters by systematically varying the angle of incidence and azimuthal angle of the incident plane wave source, thereby quantifying the variations in the polarization anisotropy parameters. The enhancement of optical properties at various resonances and the tunability of the hybridized modes are discussed. Importantly, our study reveals that despite the system being perfectly inversion-symmetric and achiral, it exhibits circular polarization anisotropy effects for non-zero finite azimuthal angles, manifested in the off-block-diagonal elements of the constructed Mueller matrices. The origin of this intriguing circular anisotropy effect is unravelled using the sequential linear birefringence and linear diattenuation effects arising from geometrical polarization transformation. Its implications in the spin-orbit interaction of light in the plasmonic crystal system are discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the excitonic properties of TMDs is essential for advancing optoelectronic and quantum devices, as TMDs exhibit unique optical and electronic characteristics.

Method: The study integrates experimental techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements with first-principles theoretical computations, particularly GW-BSE calculations, to comprehensively analyze the excitons in single-layer TMDs under varying strain conditions.

Result: The research provides a unified framework for interpreting experimental results, identifies the causes of discrepancies in literature, and demonstrates the potential of strain engineering to tailor excitonic properties for applications in optoelectronic devices.

Conclusion: This work offers a critical assessment of the current state of knowledge on excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs and provides a systematic approach to understanding and engineering these properties for practical applications.

Abstract: Excitons in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention because of their large binding energies due to weakly screened Coulomb interaction, and direct bandgap at the K/K$^\prime$ point in the hexagonal Brillouin zone featuring spin-polarised bands due to spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry. This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, despite the intense research activity, the reported values for exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps, and spectral features exhibit substantial variation across both experimental and theoretical studies. In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison and reconciliation of discrepancies observed across different experimental setups and sample qualities. Furthermore, we highlight our state-of-the-art GW-BSE calculations, which include both equilibrium and laterally strained systems, to systematically analyse the behaviour of direct and indirect excitons. By evaluating the effect of strain as a tunable control variable, we demonstrate its potential to engineer excitonic properties, supported by cross-validation against prior theoretical predictions and experimental findings. In doing so, we clarify the sources of discrepancies in the literature and offer a unified perspective on excited-state engineering strategies in two-dimensional TMDs.

Experimental reflection spectra measured under normal incidence in a circular polarization basis demonstrate a more than 100-nm-wide reflection band in which more than 98% of the reflected light preserves its handedness. The total reflection coefficient reached 80%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fabricated mirror maintains high performance even under oblique incidence for angles up to $\pm 15^\circ$. Owing to these unique characteristics, this mirror can serve as a reflective phase plate, making it an excellent candidate for the creation of a Fabry-Pérot resonator for chiral light.

Abstract: This perspective introduces attosecond path qubits: measurement-defined two-level subsystems that arise naturally in strong-field physics from the coherent interference of distinguishable quantum pathways. These effective qubits are dynamical superposition states formed during laser-driven sub-cycle electron motion and appear in diverse settings, including short-long trajectories in high-harmonic generation (HHG), early-late ionization bursts in multicolor fields, polarization-selective recombination channels, and momentum or energy-bin interference in above-threshold ionization (ATI). Attosecond qubits can be prepared, coherently manipulated, and read out using existing attosecond techniques, providing a compact Hilbert-space description of strong-field dynamics beyond semiclassical trajectory pictures. A density-matrix formulation makes explicit the roles of coherence, dephasing, and decoherence, arising from continuum propagation, Coulomb interaction, infrared dressing, and macroscopic averaging, within a reduced description that remains far from thermalization. The attosecond qubits framework identifies new opportunities for ultrafast coherence metrology and for probing open quantum dynamics in strongly driven, time-dependent Hamiltonians.

Abstract: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators like NVIDIA Tensor Cores offers new opportunities to speed up tensor-heavy scientific computations. However, applying them to quantum chemistry is challenging due to strict accuracy demands and irregular data patterns. We propose an adaptive precision algorithm to accelerate the density fitting (DF) method with Gaussian basis sets on AI accelerators using 8-bit integer (INT8) arithmetics. Implemented in the GPU-accelerated PySCF package, the algorithm is tested on more than twenty molecular systems with different NVIDIA GPUs. Compared to the standard FP64 code, our algorithm is up to 204\% faster on a RTX 4090 gaming GPU and up to 364\% faster on a RTX 6000 Ada workstation GPU without compromising the converged energy. This work demonstrates a practical approach to use AI hardware for reliable quantum chemistry simulations.

Abstract: The spectroscopic fingerprints of vibrationally excited states of astronomical molecules are interesting for multiple reasons. They are excellent temperature probes of the corresponding astronomical regions and are thought to be the origin of many unknown lines in astronomical survey spectra. Rovibrational spectra provide accurate vibrational energies and can guide subsequent pure rotational studies. The Automated Spectral Assignment Procedure (ASAP) greatly simplifies the rovibrational analysis when the rotational spectrum of either the upper or lower vibrational state is known with a high degree of accuracy (e.g., from a rotational analysis). Here, we present a new implementation of ASAP for the analysis of cyclopentadiene, a cyclic pure hydrocarbon that has already been detected astronomically toward the cold core of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. Using the synchrotron radiation extracted by the AILES beamline of the SOLEIL facility, we recorded mid- and far-infrared high-resolution spectra of cyclopentadiene. We analyzed the rovibrational spectrum of the $ν_{21}$ fundamental (961 cm$^{-1}$) with ASAP and used ASAP$^2$ to determine the vibrational energies of the eight vibrational modes below 860 cm$^{-1}$. ASAP$^2$ is an extension of ASAP for rovibrational bands where the rotational structures of the lower and upper states are known with high accuracy, leaving only the vibrational band center to be determined. The presented rovibrational fingerprints agree with the results from pure rotational spectroscopy, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of our new ASAP implementation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of polaritons and their role in energy transport is important for advancing our understanding of molecular photophysics and related phenomena.

Method: The authors developed a microscopic model for polariton annihilation based on exciton-exciton annihilation and proposed exciton-photon annihilation as a competing process. They analyzed the interplay between these processes to explain experimental results.

Result: The model explains recent experimental findings and suggests that increased annihilation rates can help distinguish polaritons from other effects.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of polariton behavior and provides a theoretical framework for analyzing their annihilation dynamics, which is crucial for optimizing energy transport in polaritonic systems.

Abstract: Strong light--matter interactions forming hybrid quasiparticles termed polaritons can specifically tailor molecular photophysics. In this spirit, enhancing energy transport has recently been of special interest. Exciton--exciton annihilation is commonly used to quantify energy transfer in excitonic systems, and has been recently applied to investigate transport dynamics in polaritonic systems. However, the interpretation of experimental findings is challenging without a microscopic theory that accounts for the various nonradiative relaxation channels determining the quasiparticle diffusion length. In this work, we develop a microscopic model for polariton annihilation based on exciton--exciton annihilation and propose an exciton--photon annihilation as the decisive process that competes with exciton--exciton annihilation. The interplay between exciton--exciton and exciton--photon annihilation ultimately governs the annihilation dynamics and sets the fundamental limit to the transport efficiency. Our model explains recent experimental results and demonstrates that increased annihilation rates might serve as an explicit fingerprint to differentiate between the response of polaritons and other untargeted effects.

Abstract: In transitions between different environmental settings, a molecular system inevitably undergoes a range of detectable changes, and the ability to accurately simulate such responses, e.g., in the form of shifts to molecular energies, remains an important challenge across physical chemistry. Based on an exact decomposition of total energies from Kohn--Sham density functional theory in a basis of spatially localized molecular orbitals, the present work outlines a robust protocol for sampling the effect of solvation within homogeneous condensed phases by focusing on perturbations to local electronic structures only. We report chemically intuitive results for binding energies of water, ethanol, and acetonitrile that all display fast convergence with respect to the bulk size. Results stay largely invariant with respect to the choice of basis set while reflecting differences in density functional approximations, and our protocol thus allows for a physically sound and efficient estimation of general effects related to bulk solvation.

Abstract: We explore the sum over topologies in AdS$_3$ quantum gravity and its relationship with the statistical interpretation of the boundary theory. We formulate a statistical version of the conformal bootstrap that systematizes the universal statistical properties of high-energy CFT$_2$ data. We identify a series of surgery moves on bulk manifolds that precisely reflect the requirements of typicality and crossing symmetry of the boundary ensemble. These surgery moves generate a large number of bulk manifolds that have to be included in any reasonable definition of the gravitational path integral. We show that this procedure generates only on-shell (hyperbolic) manifolds, although it does not produce all of them. These proofs rely on structure theorems of 3-manifolds, which non-trivially interact with the requirements of the statistical boundary ensemble. We illustrate the application of this procedure with many examples, such as Euclidean wormholes, twisted $I$-bundles and handlebody-knots. Our findings reveal a large space of possible choices of which manifolds can be included in the gravitational path integral, reflecting a wide range of possible statistical ensembles consistent with crossing symmetry and typicality.

Abstract: We consider the algebra of observables of perturbative quantum gravity in the exterior of a stationary black hole or the static patch of de Sitter spacetime. It was previously argued that the backreaction of gravitons on the spacetime perturbs the area of the horizon at second-order which gives rise to a non-trivial constraint on the algebra of physical observables in the subregion. The corresponding "dressed" algebra including fluctuations of the total horizon area admits a well-defined trace and is Type II. In this paper we show that, at the same perturbative order at which the horizon area (and angular momentum) fluctuates, gravitational backreaction also perturbs the horizon area in an angle-dependent way. These fluctuations are encoded in horizon charges -- i.e., "edge modes" -- which are related to an infinite dimensional "boost supertranslation" symmetry of the horizon. Together, these charges impose an infinite family of nontrivial constraints on the gravitational algebra. We construct the full algebra of observables which satisfies these constraints. We argue that the resulting algebra is Type II and its trace is shown to take a universal form. The entropy of any "semiclassical state" is the generalized entropy with an additional "edge mode" contribution as well as a state-independent constant. For any black hole spacetime, the algebra has no maximum entropy state and is Type II$_{\infty}$. In de Sitter, the static patch is defined relative to the worldline of a localized "observer". We show that a consistent quantization of the static-patch algebra requires a more realistic model of the observer, in which higher multipole moments perturb the "shape" of the cosmological horizon. We argue that a proper account of the observer's rotational kinetic energy and (non-gravitational) binding energy implies that the algebra is of Type II$_{1}$ and thereby admits a maximum entropy state.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: How is a ''bulk clock'' encoded holographically? We address this in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where a natural physical clock emerges by promoting the vacuum energy to a dynamical variable: the vacuum cosmological constant becomes a top form degree of freedom conjugate to spacetime volume, thereby defining a notion of bulk physical time. This construction is naturally formulated in the Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) framework. We show that the boundary dynamics is the Schwarzian mode coupled to a free particle on $U(1)$, matching the universal low-energy effective action of the complex SYK model. By further clarifying the role of the vacuum cosmological constant as a top form, we establish the equivalence between JT gravity coupled to two-dimensional Maxwell theory and 2d HT gravity via an explicit field redefinition. The initial question is addressed: we show that the resulting boundary theory can itself be rewritten as an observer action, equivalently a $(0+1)$-dimensional HT theory. This yields a direct identification of the boundary clock with the $U(1)$ phase mode, and makes its relation to the bulk clock explicit.

Abstract: We study the kinematics and dynamics of subregion algebras in classical and perturbative quantum gravity associated with portions of null surfaces such as event horizons and finite causal diamonds. We construct half-sided supertranslation generators by extending subregion phase spaces of the event horizon to include doubled pairs of corner edge modes obtained from splitting the horizon, namely relative boosts and null translations of the respective corners. These edge modes carry a corner symplectic form and give rise to canonical charges generating half-sided boosts and translations. We show that the null translation generator is necessarily two-sided in the complementary translation edge modes. The charges act nontrivially on gravitationally dressed local observables on the horizon, such that the horizon subalgebra naturally takes the form of a crossed product by the associated automorphism group. Quantizing the extended phase space after linearizing around a black hole background, we obtain for each horizon cut a Type II$_{\infty}$ von Neumann algebra equipped with a trace, whose von Neumann entropy coincides with the generalized entropy of that cut. The integrability of the half-sided null translation generator lifts to the existence of a self-adjoint operator that implements null time evolution on the Type II$_\infty$ horizon subalgebras. The area operator is identified as the bulk implementation of the Connes cocycle flow for one-sided observables in excited states. The nesting property of the resulting one-parameter family of horizon subalgebras implies a generalized second law for non-stationary linearized perturbations of Killing horizons. Lastly, we use gravitational half-sided modular inclusion algebras to prove the quantum focusing conjecture in the perturbative quantum gravity regime.

Abstract: In this note we explore computational algebraic geometry techniques to compute $14^{th}$ Helicity Trace Index of 4--charge, $\frac{1}{8}$--BPS, $\mathcal{N}=8$ pure D-brane configurations dual to D1--D5--P--KK monopole dyonic black holes. We extend the analysis of our previous work \cite{Chowdhury:2023wss} to higher values of charges and fix subtleties involving compatible gauge choices for $(1,1,1,N)$ charge configurations. For explicit SUSY state counting, we use a parametric monodromy method for the 4--charge $(1,1,1,5)$ and $(1,1,1,6)$ configurations and find that the results match the U--dual picture. By a different choice of the R--symmetry representations, it is possible to explicitly break all supersymmetry and study (non--)abelian static matrix models versions as 4--charge non--BPS pure D-brane systems \cite{Mondal:2024qyn}. Using analytical Gröbner bases we show that the potential has no zero energy configuration. The higher end of the spectrum asymptotes towards the Coulomb branch local minima manifold representing unbounded D--brane configurations, and the Mixed branch global minima represent bound states at parametrically lower values of the potential. We developed physics--inspired computational techniques to deform the potentials and lift the flat directions, thereby counting the low--energy states with degeneracy.

Abstract: We give a detailed and mathematically rigorous analysis of the path integrals of chiral fermions supported on holomorphic curves on $T^* \mathbb{C}$ in a general noncommutative instanton background. It is shown that such path integrals can be interpreted as computing instanton analogs of matrix coefficients of monopole scattering matrices. Generalizing the known relation between monopole scattering matrices and $R$-matrices of (shifted) Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$, our formalism gives rise to a novel geometric method to calculate $R$-matrices of (shifted) affine Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_r)$. This may also be viewed as an explicit description of double affine Grassmannian slices by $\infty \times \infty$ matrices, compatible with factorization. Our approach unifies a number of earlier results in the literature, and also leads to interesting new results and conjectures.

Abstract: A new family of maximal supergravities in four dimensions, involving gaugings of the trombone scaling symmetry, has been recently introduced. Using exceptional generalised geometry, we show some supergravities in this class to arise by consistent truncation of $D=11$ supergravity. The seven-dimensional reduction manifold is locally equivalent to the topologically-twisted internal manifold of the AdS$_4$ geometries that arise near the horizon of M5-branes wrapped on supersymmetric three-cycles of special holonomy manifolds. The dimensional reduction involves a mixture of conventional and generalised Scherk-Schwarz prescriptions, and provides the first maximally supersymmetric consistent truncation to four dimensions in the context of the M5-brane.

Abstract: We develop a formalism to compute non-perturbative 5-point scattering amplitudes and apply it to gravitational waveforms in the two-body problem for arbitrary trajectories. Drawing inspiration from Feshbach's projector formalism in nuclear physics, we introduce effective potentials governing graviton emission and relate them to perturbative scattering amplitudes at arbitrary order in the gravitational coupling and mass ratio. Once these potentials are determined, the corresponding non-perturbative amplitudes in the classical limit are obtained by iterative insertions and subsequently translated into gravitational waveforms using the KMOC formalism. As an application, we compute the gravitational waveform emitted by a two-body system moving along a generic, potentially highly bent, trajectory. Importantly, our formalism extends effective field theory matching of the gravitational two-body potential to radiative phenomena, enabling the extraction of gravitational-wave source terms directly from perturbative on-shell scattering amplitudes.

Abstract: We reconsider the detailed structure of the topological character of the instantons in pure Yang-Mills theory on $S^1\times\mathbb{R}^3$, so-called calorons. The claim is that the standard formula for the topological character, the second Chern number, requires some modification through analytic consideration. For concreteness, we explicitly calculate the second Chern number of the gauge configuration of the Harrington-Shepard type with unit topological charge of the gauge group $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ in several gauges. The genuine formula is shown to be applicable even though the gauge connection is in singular gauge. The gauge dependence of the magnetic charge is also discussed.

Abstract: In arXiv:2211.09069, significant progress was made in decomposing simple products of fermion correlation functions, and in summing over spin structures of superstring amplitudes in genus two under cyclic constraints. In this manuscript we consider part of the same subject using a framework in which one of the branch points of the genus two curve is fixed at infinity. This framework is a direct generalization of the popular one in the case of genus one. We address some of the issues that remained unresolved in our previous paper arXiv:2209.14633. We show that the spin structures of the simple products of fermion correlation functions with cyclic conditions depend only on the Pe-function values at the half-periods of the genus two surface, for any number of factors in the products. Similar to the genus one case, we can provide basis functions to decompose the product. Consequently, the trilinear relations found in arXiv:2211.09069 can be derived from the known set of differential equations of genus two Pe-functions by simply setting the variables equal to the half-periods of the non-singular and even spin structures, as is the case for genus one. The focus of this manuscript is on the procedures for expressing the results of decomposed formulae in terms of the unique genus two theta function. At present we cannot provide a procedure for deriving the general form of the decomposed formula totally expressed in terms of the theta functions for an arbitrary number of the fermion correlation functions in the product, by the reason described in the text. We present some general results and demonstrate that concrete expressions of both the spin structure dependent and independent parts will be derived and simplified to analyze using the logic of the derivations of the classical solutions to Jacobi inversion problem and their modifications which will be given in this manuscript.

Abstract: Computing functional determinants of differential operators is central to any field-theoretical calculation relying on a saddle-point expansion. A variety of approaches is available for the computation that avoid having to know the eigenspectrum of the operator, and in particular the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem and the Green's function method. In this note, we show how both approaches can be constructed using a contour integral argument and conclude that these are completely equivalent for computing ratios of determinants of one-dimensional operators. Furthermore, we comment on the presence of vanishing as well as negative eigenvalues and show how the Green's function method provides a natural prescription for handling them.

Abstract: We study Krylov complexity for quantum systems whose Hamiltonians factorise as tensor products. We prove that complexity is superadditive under tensor products, $C_{12}\ge C_1+C_2$, and identify a positive operator that quantifies the resulting excess complexity. The underlying mechanism is made transparent by introducing a Krylov graph representation in which tensor products generate a higher-dimensional lattice whose diagonal shells encode operator growth and binomial path multiplicities. In the continuum limit, Krylov dynamics reduces to diffusion on this graph, with superadditivity arising from geometric broadening across shells. Explicit examples illustrate how deviations from synchronous evolution generate bounded, oscillatory excess complexity.

Abstract: We extend the Lorentzian replica framework for computing entanglement entropy to fully time-dependent gravitational settings, with emphasis on cosmological spacetimes without boundaries and gravitational theories lacking a dual quantum field theory description. Our approach constructs the replica path integral directly in real time, avoiding reliance on Euclidean continuation or time-reflection symmetry, and identifies the geometric conditions under which Lorentzian replica saddles appear in dynamical backgrounds. We analyze replica wormholes in both contexts, recovering a generalized version of the island rule. For completeness, we provide a concise review of the existing Lorentzian replica construction for quantum field theories and their holographic duals, which forms the foundation for our generalization.

Abstract: The exact localization result for the expectation value of the $1\over 2$ BPS circular Wilson loop in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory is given in the planar limit by the famous Bessel function expression: $\langle W\rangle = {2N\over \sqrt λ} I_1 ( \sqrt λ)$. Expanded in large $λ$ and expressed in terms of the AdS$_5 \times $S$^5$ string tension $T= {\sqrt λ\over 2π}$ this gives $\langle W\rangle = {\sqrt T\over 2πg_s} e^{2πT} (1- {3\over 16 π} T^{-1} + ...)$.The exponential is matched by the value of the action of the string with the AdS$_2$ world volume while the prefactor comes from the 1-loop GS string correction. Here we address the question of how the subleading $T^{-1}$ term could be reproduced by the 2-loop correction in the corresponding partition function of the AdS$_5 \times $S$^5$ GS string expanded near the AdS$_2$ minimal surface. We find that the string correction contains a non-zero UV logarithmic divergence implying that comparison with the SYM result requires a particular subtraction prescription. We discuss implications of this conclusion for checking the AdS/CFT duality at strong coupling.

### [53] [Chiral Two-Body Bound States from Berry Curvature and Chiral Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08055)
*Daniil Karuzin,Leonid Levitov*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses chiral, non-s-wave superconducting states in electronic systems with Berry curvature, showing how interactions lead to multiple time-reversal-symmetry-breaking phases forming a cascade of chiral topological states with angular momentum differing by 2π increments based on Berry-curvature flux. The transitions between these phases mimic geometric oscillations in critical temperature akin to the Little-Parks effect, providing an observable hallmark of chiral superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, prompting a study of the two-body problem in systems with Berry curvature to uncover possible topological superconducting phases and transitions.

Method: The study employs theoretical analysis of electronic bands with Berry curvature, examining interactions under the formation of chiral pairing and analyzing phase transitions as a function of Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi surface to deduce the chiral topological states and associated transitions.

Result: The paper reveals the existence of multiple chiral superconducting phases with varying angular momentum that break time-reversal symmetry, forming a cascade of chiral topological states. The transitions between these phases are governed by the Berry-curvature flux, resembling geometric Little-Parks oscillations, offering a clear experimental signature of chiral superconductivity.

Conclusion: This research establishes a framework for understanding how Berry curvature in electronic systems can lead to complex chiral superconducting states with distinct angular momentum, transitioning through phases as a function of flux, providing a new avenue for studying topological superconductivity and its applications.

Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2πm$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi surface area, $Φ= b k_F^2/2$. As $Φ$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring whenever $Φ$ crosses integer values. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little--Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.

Abstract: Discrete charge fluctuations, routinely observed in semiconductor quantum dot devices, may contribute significantly to device drift and errors resulting from qubit miscalibration. Understanding the nature and origins of these discrete charge fluctuations may provide insights into material improvements or means of mitigating charge noise in semiconductor quantum dot devices. In this work, we measure multi-level charge fluctuations present in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device over a range of device operating voltages and temperatures. To characterize the parameter-dependent dynamics of the underlying fluctuating degrees of freedom, we perform a detailed analysis of the measured noise timeseries. We perform algorithmically assisted drift detection and change point detection to detrend the data and remove a slow fluctuator component, as a preprocessing step. We perform model comparison on the post-processed time series between different $n$-level fluctuator ($n$LF) factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), finding that although at most sweep values the independent pair of 2LFs model would be preferred, in a particular region of voltage space the 4LF model outperforms the other models, indicating a conditional rate dependence between the two fluctuators. By tracking fluctuator transition rates, biases, and weights over a range of different device configurations, we estimate gate voltage and conductivity sensitivity. In particular, we fit a phenomenological, detailed balance model to the extracted independent 2LFs rate data, yielding lever arm estimates in the range of $-2 μ$eV/mV up to $4 μ$eV/mV between the two 2LFs and nearby gate electrodes. We expect that these characterization results may aid in subsequent spatial triangulation of the charge fluctuators.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates the intrinsic anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects in NbMnP, a parity-mixed antiferromagnetic metal, using first-principles calculations and Wannier interpolation. The effects originate from the quantum geometry of the Bloch bands, particularly emphasized by spin-orbit-induced gap openings along nodal lines and mirror symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) has been extensively studied, yet understanding its intrinsic mechanisms in noncollinear antiferromagnets remains challenging. This paper provides a computational framework to explore the role of parity-mixed magnetic states in AHE.

Method: The authors employ first-principles calculations (DFT) and Wannier interpolation to analyze the Berry curvature and Berry-connection-polarization dipole in the Bloch bands of NbMnP.

Result: The study reveals that the strong AHE and NLHE in NbMnP are driven by enhanced Berry curvature and Berry-connection polarization, originating from gap-less nodal lines modulated by spin-orbit coupling. The results suggest that parity-mixed antiferromagnets can serve as a model system for studying nodal-line-related transport phenomena.

Conclusion: By identifying the nodal contributions to the Hall response, the findings offer new insights into the geometric origin of AHE and NLHE in noncollinear magnets, paving the way for exploring similar effects in other spin-textured materials.

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect has been understood in terms of the geometric nature of Bloch bands and impurity scattering, and has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic materials such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Recently, a large anomalous Hall effect was reported in the noncollinear antiferromagnetic metal NbMnP whose magnetic order is a mixture of the even-parity and the odd-parity magnetic components. Such a magnetic structure is expected to exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect from the symmetry breaking of the antiferromagnet ordering. Here, we theoretically investigate the intrinsic anomalous and nonlinear Hall effect of NbMnP induced by the quantum geometry of Bloch band using the first-principles calculation and the Wannier interpolation method. We found that the intrinsic Hall response of NbMnP is predominantly governed by the strongly enhanced Berry curvature and Berry-connection-polarization dipole on a specific mirror plane. These enhanced geometric quantities originate from the spin-orbit-coupling-induced gap openings along the nodal lines. Our results indicate that NbMnP serves as a model system for investigating transport phenomena originating from nodal-lines in parity-mixed antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Double-helix (DH) nanowires provide a platform to study the influence of geometric chirality on spin chirality. Their three-dimensional (3D) helical architecture and tunable inter-strand coupling enable control of spin chirality, including the stabilization of topological 3D magnetic states such as helical domains and domain walls, topological stray fields, and extended helical vortex/skyrmion tubes. So far, the study of these and other 3D nanostructures is usually confined to a limited number of magnetic microscopy experiments in large facilities. Here, we investigate the reversal mechanism of a single DH nanowire using Dark-Field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry under external 3D magnetic fields. By analyzing the angular dependence of the DF-MOKE signal, we fit the reversal process using established models for domain-wall nucleation and propagation, finding a characteristic behavior similar to that reported for cylindrical nanowires. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the reversal process goes through nucleation of the helical vortex tube in a curling manner while ptychographic X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data reveal that this helical vortex tube state forms through a mixed nucleation-propagation process. These observations provide a consistent microscopic picture of reversal mediated by a helical vortex tube extending along the nanowire. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of magnetization reversal in DH nanowires and demonstrates that DF-MOKE magnetometry is effective for probing reversal mechanisms in single 3D nanostructures. This lab-based approach expands the range of accessible experiments beyond large-scale facilities, enabling extensive exploration of the rich spin states supported by 3D nano-geometries.

Motivation: The paper's motivation centers on exploring STTs for nano-scale spintronic applications and understanding magnetisation dynamics in thin films.

Method: The study employs a growth-annealing protocol for CoFeB thin films, combining microstructural analysis with magnetisation studies.

Result: The protocol enables STT effects, leading to nearly isotropic magnets with unique spin dynamics under external fields and currents.

Conclusion: The research opens new avenues for spintronic devices and unconventional computing by leveraging the unique properties of isotropic CoFeB films.

Abstract: Spin transfer torques (STTs) control magnetisation by electric currents, enabling a range of nano-scale spintronic applications. They can destabilise the equilibrium magnetisation state by counteracting magnetic relaxation. Here, we maximise the STT effect through a dedicated growth-annealing protocol for CoFeB thin films, such that magnetic anisotropies originating from the interface and shape almost cancel each other. The nearly isotropic magnets enable low-current dynamical stabilisation of the magnetisation in the direction opposite to an applied magnetic field, thereby realising a spintronic analogue of the Kapitza pendulum. In an intermediate current regime, the STT drives large magnetisation vector fluctuations that cover the entire Bloch sphere. The continuous variable associated with the stochastic magnetisation direction may serve as a resource for probabilistic computing and neuromorphic hardware. Our results establish isotropic magnets as a platform to study as-yet-uncharted, far-from-equilibrium spin dynamics including anti-magnonics, with promising implications for unconventional computing paradigms.

Abstract: Magnetic phases are commonly identified through macroscopic magnetization, yet many ordered states, including antiferromagnets and altermagnets, possess a vanishing net moment despite distinct local spin structure. We show that such an order can be accessed through the measurement-induced steady state of a single primary qubit locally coupled to a spin lattice. Using a controlled primary-ancillary qubit protocol, we derive analytically that the steady state \emph{encodes} a locally weighted exchange field in a signed observable that is linear in the weak-coupling regime. Numerical simulations demonstrate lattice-scale resolution of antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic textures and robustness against short-correlated noise. Our results establish measurement-induced dissipation as a resource for detecting magnetic order through microscopic structure rather than through global moments.

Abstract: Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states can be viewed as topological superconductors of composite fermions, supporting a charged chiral mode and $|\mathcal{C}_{cf}|$ neutral Majorana modes set by the Chern number $\mathcal{C}_{cf}$. Despite ongoing efforts, distinguishing the many competing paired phases remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a unified theory of charge transport across a quantum point contact (QPC) for general paired FQH states described by an $so(N)_1 \times u(1)$ conformal field theory. We derive the boundary effective action for an arbitrary number of Majorana fermions $N=|\mathcal{C}_{cf}|$ and develop a non-perturbative instanton approximation to describe tunneling processes. We establish a weak-strong duality relating strong quasiparticle tunneling to weak electron tunneling. We calculate the scaling dimensions of the tunneling operators and demonstrate that while the weak-coupling fixed point is generally unstable, the strong-coupling fixed point is stable for physically relevant filling fractions and number of Majorana fermions. These transport exponents provide a distinct experimental fingerprint to identify the topological phases of even-denominator FQH states.

TL;DR:  researchers introduce a new homodyne detection method that circumvents the symmetry-imposed limits of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in centrosymmetric 2D crystals like graphene and h-BN. They successfully observe SHG in pristine materials without external symmetry-breaking fields, enabling polarization-resolved measurements and applications like strain detection and quantum sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: understanding and overcoming fundamental limitations in nonlinear optical spectroscopy for 2D materials, particularly those without inversion symmetry but with centrosymmetric properties.

Method:  developed a homodyne detection technique to observe SHG in materials like bilayer h-BN, 2H-WSe₂, and Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, even without symmetry-breaking fields.

Result: Evidence of SHG in pristine centrosymmetric materials, specifically h-BN, 2H-WSe₂, and bilayer graphene, through the new homodyne technique. SHG is attributed to quadrupole second-order nonlinearity, not inversion symmetry.

Conclusion: The new homodyne detection technique expands the capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to measure SHG in materials that were previously unobservable due to symmetry constraints, opening new avenues for quantum sensing and material characterization.

Abstract: Optical spectroscopy based on second-order nonlinearity is a critical technique for characterizing two-dimensional (2D) crystals as well as bioimaging and quantum optics. It is generally believed that second-harmonic generation (SHG) in centrosymmetric crystals, such as graphene and other bilayer 2D crystals, is negligible without externally breaking the inversion symmetry. Here, we show that with a new homodyne detection technique, we can apparently circumvent this symmetry-imposed constraint and observe robust SHG in pristine centrosymmetric crystals, without any symmetry-breaking field. With its exceptional sensitivity, we resolve polarization-resolved SHG in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), bilayer 2H-WSe$_2$, and remarkably, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, allowing us to unambiguously identify the crystallographic orientation in these crystals via SHG for the first time. We also demonstrate that the new technique can be used to non-invasively detect uniaxial strain and optical geometric phase in these crystals. The observed SHG in our experiments is attributed to second-order nonlinearity in the quadrupole channel, which is controlled by the presence of the $C_2$ symmetry instead of the inversion symmetry. Our new technique expands the capability of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to encompass a large class of centrosymmetric materials that could never be measured before, and can be used for quantum sensing of moiré materials and twisted epitaxial films.

Abstract: The sudden approximation is a fundamental tool for describing ultrafast quantum transitions, yet the relationship between the initial 3D wavefunction and the final kinetic energy release (KER) remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that the observed fragment energy distribution $P(E)$ following a sudden Coulomb explosion is a direct manifestation of the initial state's 3D radial geometry. By applying a Bohmian-inspired local energy framework to Slater-type orbitals, we identify a universal \textbf{``0.5 Rule''}: for ground-state configurations, the ratio of the peak detected energy to the integrated average energy ($R_E = E_{peak}/\langle E \rangle$) is strictly bounded below 0.5. Our systematic parametric study reveals that this ratio is highly sensitive to the orbital exponent $ζ$ and the principal quantum number $n$. Specifically, $R_E$ decreases significantly as $ζ$ increases, suggesting that the kinetic energy of fragments from inner-shell orbitals is far more suppressed than that of valence electrons. We further show that for excited states ($n > 1$), the emergence of secondary high-energy peaks provides a theoretical explanation for the structured KER spectra observed in $H_2^+$ ionization experiments. Finally, we propose that this geometric energy shift offers a new perspective on the ``missing energy'' problem in particle physics. Our findings suggest that a detected energy peak lower than the statistical mean may be an intrinsic signature of 3D quantum-spatial distribution ($r^2|ψ|^2$) rather than proof of undetected particles. This work provides a rigorous framework for recalibrating experimental energy signals across atomic, molecular, and subatomic scales.

Motivation: 光离化是一个基本的原子过程， Understanding its ultrafast dynamics is essential for both fundamental science and applications in quantum technology, 如光谱操控和量子计算等。通过研究光离性中的因果关系和静电很强的电子电子关联效应，这可以帮助开发更高效的原子和分子光离化方法。

Method: 使用基于密度矩阵计算的量子理论方法，包括相对论性时变长度（LG）和速度（VG）的方法。

Result: 两个光速下的Wigner延迟和Wigner分布显示出质urally不同的离域动力学。在VG下找到的延迟为几个飞秒，这在光脉冲极短的情况下可能导致对因果性的担忧。然而，数值模拟显示波包行为是因果性的。通过加权延迟和波包模型，得到了与理论一致的数值结果。此外，电子自旋轨道耦合对超快离域动力学表现出强烈的效应，并达成了Schrodinger猫态和猫态。

Abstract: We study real-time photoionization flux at the $3s$ Amusia-Cooper minimum (ACM) in argon using \textit{ab initio} simulations with the relativistic time-dependent configuration-interaction singles (RTDCIS) method in length (LG) and velocity (VG) gauges. A simple analytical model is used to interpret the results, and to construct Wigner delays and Wigner distributions for both gauges and relativistic channels of the photoelectron ($εp_j$ with $j=1/2$ and $3/2$). The two gauges are found to produce qualitatively different ionization dynamics, with LG having positive and VG having negative Wigner delays. The advancement of several femtoseconds, found for Wigner delays in VG, raises some concern for causality when atoms are ionized by attosecond pulses that are shorter than the absolute value of the Wigner delay. Reassuringly, numerical simulations of wave packets with RTDCIS show that the electrons behave in a causal way in both gauges. Weighted delays that take into account the temporal window of excitation (or the bandwidth of the pulses) are constructed from the Wigner distribution to reach agreement between the numerical simulations and our simple wave packet model. Furthermore, a strong effect of spin-orbit coupling of the photoelectron ($j$) is reported for ultrafast photoionization dynamics, and Schrödinger kitten and cat states are identified in the Wigner distributions as a result of the ACM. Our work paves the way for a deeper understanding of ultrafast photoionization and the role of causality in systems with strong electron-electron correlation effects.

Abstract: We present precision spectroscopy and isotope shift measurement of the ${}^1S_0 \leftrightarrow {}^3P_2$ clock transition in neutral ytterbium ($\mathrm{Yb}$) atoms. By revealing a magic wavelength at $905.4(2)$ nm, we successfully achieve the atomic spectrum narrower than $100$ Hz. The interleaved clock operation between isotopes allows us to determine isotope shifts of four bosonic isotope pairs at Hz-level uncertainties, which is combined with those of other four ultra-narrow transitions in $\mathrm{Yb}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^+$ to construct the King plot. Importantly, the new isotope shift data reported in this work is a key to exclude the possibility of attributing the observed nonlinearity of the three-dimensional King plot solely to the new physics, while the previous works rely on the other terrestrial bound set by the neutron scattering and $(g-2)_e$ measurements. This work paves the way for the effective use of precision isotope shift data in the King plot analysis and stimulates further measurements in $\mathrm{Yb}$ and other elements.

Abstract: Optically pumped atomic magnetometers (OPAMs) offer high sensitivity at room temperature and are increasingly considered for portable magnetic sensing in geomagnetic-field environments. Here we report a handheld-scale, single-beam scalar $^{87}$Rb OPAM with a sensor-head volume of approximately 110 mL. The device operates in an all-optical Bell-Bloom configuration and uses digital lock-in, dispersive tracking of the $^{87}$Rb Larmor resonance, implemented with a hybrid electronics stack that combines in-house control hardware with commercial modules. A single frequency-modulated laser beam performs both pumping and probing without RF coils. In an unshielded indoor environment, the magnetometer exhibits a noise floor below 6 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ near 80 Hz and a measurement bandwidth of 200 Hz. In an unshielded Earth-field deployment, we detect repeatable transient magnetic signatures from a controlled elevator motion sequence and quantify standoff observability over sensor-elevator distances from 1.25 m to 10 m. These results show that compact scalar OPAMs can provide bandwidth and range-resolved event sensitivity suitable for field-deployable magnetic anomaly detection and infrastructure monitoring in realistic geomagnetic environments.

Abstract: The attractive and repulsive linear Hookean form of gravity is known to allow for analytic solutions to N-body systems for arbitrary masses and initial conditions. This linear system is very well suited for use in the advanced undergraduate classroom with the position of every particle rj(t) known analytically in terms of only sine, cosine, and exponential functions. Here it is shown that simple analytic solutions are also possible when linear wind resistance is included, provided that the force due to wind resistance force on each particle is proportional to the mass of that particle. Surprising analytic expressions for the behavior of the system if only a single particle in the system is subject to a linear wind resistance are also presented.

Abstract: This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the physical behavior of adiabatic modes in inhomogeneous elastic plates, particularly their remarkable capacity to adapt to gradual perturbations. The study investigates the propagation characteristics of higher-order adiabatic Lamb modes in waveguides with linearly varying thickness, with a focus on the influence of critical thicknesses on their propagation. This is achieved by leveraging the broadband excitation capabilities of a pulsed laser generating higher order Lamb modes to reveal various critical thicknesses, such as the cut-off and Zero-Group Velocity (ZGV) thicknesses. Remarkably, ZGV resonances can be induced at locations well beyond the laser source. Moreover, the mode's behavior is strongly influenced by thickness variations in all directions, imparting the plate an anisotropic-like behavior. Additionally, based on the observed effects, our experimental approach enables precise reconstruction of elastic waveguide profiles in additively manufactured aluminum plates with such thickness variations. The reconstructed profiles show a strong correlation with reference measurements across the scanned area.

Abstract: We describe a geometric phenomenon in which a traveling wave made of degenerate Goldstone modes leaves behind a transformed ground state. In a triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet, a pulse of circularly polarized spin waves rotates the spins within their plane. An exact solution of the nonlinear equations of motion demonstrates that the accumulated rotation is a geometric phase related to parallel transport of the order parameter. We point out a curious analogy between the motion of the magnetic order parameter and that of a wobbling coin. This phenomenon opens a new route for controlling antiferromagnetic order by spin waves and may extend to other frustrated magnets as well as other physical systems with noncommuting broken-symmetry generators.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing appreciation for the effects of quantum critical fluctuations on gapless boundary degrees of freedom. Here we consider the boundary dynamics of the non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ (NCCP$^{N-1}$) model in two spatial dimensions, with $N$ complex boson species coupled to a fluctuating $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge field. These models describe quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm, such as the deconfined quantum critical point between superconducting (SC) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) phases. We show that, in a large-$N$ limit and with the bulk tuned to criticality, boundaries of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model display logarithmically decaying, or ``extraordinary-log,'' correlations. In particular, when monopole operators exhibit quasi-long-ranged order at the boundary, we find that the extraordinary-log exponent of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model in the large-$N$ limit is $q=N/4$, signifying a new family of boundary universality classes parameterized by $N$. In the context of the QSH -- SC transition, the quantum critical point inherits helical edge modes from the QSH phase, and this extraordinary-log behavior manifests in their Cooper pair correlations.

Motivation: The study of thermoelectric properties in magnetic materials, particularly in systems like the kagome lattice, could lead to new materials for efficient energy conversion.

Method: The researchers used inelastic neutron scattering experiments to study the spin structure and magnetic properties of ErMn6Sn6.

Result: They observed large room-temperature anomalous Nernst effects and temperature-dependent behavior linked to spin chirality.

Conclusion: This material offers a promising platform for room-temperature thermoelectric applications, while its properties hint at broader insights for other incommensurate antiferromagnetic systems.

Abstract: Kagome magnets exhibit a range of novel and nontrivial topological properties due to the strong interplay between topology and magnetism, which also extends to their thermoelectric applications. Recent advances in the study of magnetic topological materials have highlighted their intriguing anomalous Hall and thermoelectric effects, arising primarily from large intrinsic Berry curvature. Here, we report observation of a large room-temperature (RT) anomalous Nernst effects (ANE) of S_xy^A ~ 1.3 μV K^(-1) in the kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) ErMn6Sn6, which is comparable to the largest signals observed in known magnetic materials. Surprisingly, we further found that a significant topological Nernst signal at RT and peaking a maximum of approximately 0.2 μV K^(-1) at 180 K, exactly coupling with ANE in the spiral AFM state, originates from the real-space nonzero spin chirality caused by incommensurate spin structure. This study demonstrates a potential room-temperature thermoelectric application platform based on Nernst effect, and provides insights for discovering significant anomalous and topological transverse transport effects in the incommensurate AFM system.

Abstract: The magnetic structure of EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions form a diamond network, was investigated using neutron and resonant X-ray diffraction on powder and single-crystal samples. The propagation vector was determined to be $\textbf{\textit{q}}_{\rm m}=(1,0,0)$~r.l.u. from these diffraction measurements. All possible magnetic structures in the space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ with this propagation vector were examined using the irreducible representation method and magnetic space group analysis. This magnetic structure was identified as a collinear antiferromagnetic structure with the magnetic space group $P_Inna$ (\#52.320) or $P_Inn2$ (\#34.164) under zero magnetic field. In these magnetic structure, frustration arises from competing magnetic interactions on the diamond network. These findings provide a concrete experimental reference for assessing the role of competing interactions in diamond-network magnets and motivate further studies of interaction-driven quantum states.

Abstract: We present a finite-temperature canonical-ensemble determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that enforces an exact fermion number and enables stable simulations of correlated lattice electrons. We propose a stabilized QR update that reduces the computational complexity from standard cubic scaling $O(βN^3)$ to linear scaling $O(βN N_e^2)$ with respect to the system size $N$, where $N_e$ is the particle number. This yields a dramatic speedup in dilute regimes ($N_e \ll N$), opening unbiased access to large-scale simulations of strongly correlated low-density phases. We validate the method on the dilute electron gas with onsite Hubbard interactions, observing the suppression of the fermion sign problem in the dilute limit. Furthermore, we apply this approach to an one-dimensional flat-band system, where the canonical ensemble allows for precise control over filling. We reveal a ferromagnetic instability at low temperatures in the half-filling regime. Our linear-scaling approach provides a powerful tool for investigating emergent phenomena in dilute quantum matter.

Abstract: We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.

Abstract: We construct a $G$-cluster Hamiltonian in 2+1 dimensions and analyze its properties. This model exhibits a $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, where the $2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ sector realizes a non-invertible symmetry obtained by condensing appropriate algebra objects in $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Using the symmetry interpolation method, we construct $S^1$- and $S^2$-parameterized families of short-range-entangled (SRE) states by interpolating an either invertible $0$-form or $1$-form symmetry contained in $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Applying an adiabatic evolution argument to this family, we analyze the pumped interface mode generated by this adiabatic process. We then explicitly construct the symmetry operator acting on the interface and show that the interface mode carries a nontrivial charge under this symmetry, thereby demonstrating the nontriviality of the parameterized family.

Abstract: For antiferromagnets composed of spin five-half ions, the moments of these ions in the ordered antiferromagnetic state can be significantly smaller than 5 BM (i.e., 1.56 - 4.48 BM) if these ions form quantum fluctuating entities (QFEs), for example, quasi one-dimensional uniform antiferromagnetic chains or quasi zero-spin antiferromagnetic spin dimers. It is reasonable to suppose that the stronger the quantum fluctuation in such an antiferromagnet, the greater the reduction in its ordered moment would become, but this supposition has not yet been confirmed because quantifying the strength of quantum fluctuation is not a straightforward matter. Here we show that the local magnetic excitations involving the QFEs can be used to quantify the strength of quantum fluctuation by analyzing six antiferromagnets showing significant reduction in their ordered spin moments.

Abstract: We study an open quantum spin chain with non-reciprocal dissipation using a theoretical approach known as time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble. In the regime of weak dissipation the system is fully characterized by its rapidity distribution and we derive a closed set of coupled differential equations governing their time evolution. We check the accuracy of this theory by benchmarking the results against numerical simulations. Using this framework we are able to compute both the magnetization density and current dynamics, identifying some relations between the two. The problem of the anomalous power-law exponents identified in a previous work is discussed. Our work constitutes a theoretical approach that is able to describe the physics of non-reciprocal open quantum spin chains beyond analyses based on non-interacting fermions.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LOTUS (Layer-Ordered Temporally-Unified Schedules), which is a framework that restructures QAOA from a high-dimensional, chaotic search into a low-dimensional dynamical system. By replacing independent layer-wise angles with a Hybrid Fourier-Autoregressive (HFA) mapping, LOTUS enforces global temporal coherence while maintaining local flexibility. LOTUS consistently outperforms standard optimizers, achieving up to a $27.2\%$ improvement in expectation values over L-BFGS-B and $20.8\%$ compared with COBYLA. Besides, our proposed method drastically reduces computational costs, requiring over $90\%$ fewer iterations than methods like Powell or SLSQP.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to enhance perceptual and decision-making capabilities by integrating information from diverse sources. However, classical deep learning approaches face a critical trade-off between the high accuracy of black-box feature-level fusion and the interpretability of less outstanding decision-level fusion, alongside the challenges of parameter explosion and complexity. This paper discusses the accuracy-interpretablity-complexity dilemma under the quantum computation framework and propose a feature entanglement-based quantum multimodal fusion neural network. The model is composed of three core components: a classical feed-forward module for unimodal processing, an interpretable quantum fusion block, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for deep feature extraction. By leveraging the strong expressive power of quantum, we have reduced the complexity of multimodal fusion and post-processing to linear, and the fusion process also possesses the interpretability of decision-level fusion. The simulation results demonstrate that our model achieves classification accuracy comparable to classical networks with dozens of times of parameters, exhibiting notable stability and performance across multimodal image datasets.

Result: The strategies reduce logical error rates by up to 2.4x compared to standard approaches and maintain near-unity fidelity for deep circuits. Threshold analysis shows robust performance scaling from distance-3 to distance-13 codes.

Conclusion: The research provides practical tools for near-term quantum devices and establishes principles for scaling to fault-tolerant quantum computers

Abstract: Building reliable quantum computers requires protecting fragile quantum states from inevitable environmental noise and operational errors. While quantum error correction codes like the Steane $[\![7,1,3]\!]$ code provide elegant theoretical solutions, their practical success hinges critically on how we measure errors - a process called syndrome extraction. The challenge lies in the ancilla qubits used for measurement: when they fail, errors can cascade across the entire quantum system, destroying the very information we're trying to protect. We address this fundamental problem by implementing and comparing three sophisticated syndrome measurement strategies: Shor's cat-state approach, which distributes measurements across multiple entangled ancillas achieving 85-92% preparation success; Steane's encoded-ancilla method using complete error-corrected logical qubits reaching 97.8% syndrome fidelity; and a flexible unified framework that adapts strategies based on hardware capabilities. Through extensive simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform spanning randomized benchmarking and T-heavy circuits, we demonstrate that intelligent ancilla management improves error suppression by up to 2.4$\times$ compared to standard approaches. Our implementations achieve logical error rates as low as $5.1 \times 10^{-5}$ under realistic noise conditions with physical error rates of $10^{-3}$, while maintaining near-unity logical fidelity (0.99997) even for deep circuits. The threshold analysis reveals robust performance across distance-3 to distance-13 codes with characteristic threshold curves showing exponential error suppression below the critical physical error rate. These results provide immediately deployable tools for near-term quantum devices and establish practical design principles for scaling toward fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) emerges as a powerful technique that combines quantum computing with federated learning to efficiently process complex data across distributed quantum devices while ensuring data privacy in quantum networks. Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements. Extensive simulation results in real-world datasets also illustrate that the proposed SPQFL approach yields significant improvements in terms of training performance and convergence stability compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567. We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $α_S$. The minuteness of $α_S$ relative to $α$ ($α_S/α\sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^6 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.

Motivation: Exploring the evolution and integration of Bohmian mechanics in modern physics education and applications.

Method: Analyzes historical reception, shifts in perspective, and draws conclusions based on re-examining primary sources and literature.

Result: Demonstrated a gradual acceptance of Bohmian mechanics as a valuable tool despite initial resistance.

Conclusion: Offers insights into the teaching value and applicability of Bohmian mechanics beyond traditional quantum mechanics contexts.

Abstract: Since its inception, Bohmian mechanics has been surrounded by a halo of controversy. Originally proposed to bypass the limitations imposed by von Neumann's theorem on the impossibility of hidden-variable models in quantum mechanics, it faced strong opposition from the outset. Over time, however, its use in tackling specific problems across various branches of physics has led to a gradual shift in attitude, turning the early resistance into a more moderate acceptance. A plausible explanation for this change may be that, since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bohmian mechanics has been taking on a more operational and practical role. The original hidden-variable idea has gradually faded from its framework, giving way to a more pragmatic approach that treats it as a suitable analytical and computational tool. This discussion explores how and why such a shift in perspective has occurred and, therefore, answers questions such as whether Bohmian mechanics should be considered once and for all a legitimate quantum representation (i.e., worth being taught in elementary quantum mechanics courses) or, by extension, whether these ideas can be transferred to and benefit other fields. Here, the Schrödinger equation and several specific numerical examples are re-examined in the light of a less restrictive view than the standard one usually adopted in quantum mechanics.

*Prosanta Pal,Shubhanshu Karoliya,Gargee Sharma,Ramakrishna Podila*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  contemporary quantum processors may have preparation nonstationarity leading to preparation-dependent loopholes in Bell tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  the paper addresses the critical issue of preparation nonstationarity in quantum processors, which can undermine the validity of Bell test results. It introduces a novel framework to detect and quantify such nonstationarity, emphasizing the need for prepare-aware protocols in quantum certification.

Method:  the authors propose an ensemble-divergence framework where slow temporal drift causes context-dependent effective ensembles. They develop a witness metric (δ_ens) and use bin-resolved outcome statistics to identify operational drift. Their analysis of IBM quantum devices demonstrates significant drift affecting Bell test outcomes.

Result:  statistical drift negatively impacts Bell test results on contemporary quantum hardware, with observed violations possibly linked to preparation drift rather than other factors. The study highlights the necessity of considering temporal drift in quantum experiments.

Conclusion:  the paper identifies a pressing issue in quantum computing—preparation nonstationarity—and provides tools to detect and mitigate it. This is essential for advancing reliable quantum technologies and maintaining confidence in experimental results.

Abstract: Bell or Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) tests on superconducting quantum processors are commonly interpreted under the assumption that repeated circuit executions sample a single, stationary preparation ensemble. Here we show that this assumption can be violated on contemporary hardware, with direct implications for the interpretation of observed Bell violations. We introduce an ensemble-divergence framework in which slow temporal drift of the preparation process induces context-dependent effective ensembles, even when measurement independence and locality are preserved. This leads to a relaxed Bell bound $|S| \le 2 + 6δ_{\mathrm{ens}}$, where $δ_{\mathrm{ens}}$ quantifies preparation nonstationarity. Because $δ_{\mathrm{ens}}$ is not directly observable, we develop an operational witness $δ_{\mathrm{op}}$ based on bin-resolved outcome statistics for fixed measurement channels. Using Pauli-axis measurements on IBM superconducting processors, we observe statistically significant operational drift that persists after full two-qubit readout mitigation, ruling out measurement artifacts. In contrast, drift extracted from CHSH-optimal measurements is eliminated by mitigation, demonstrating that such settings are unsuitable for diagnosing preparation nonstationarity. We further show that the observed Bell violations imply only modest ensemble divergences, comparable in scale to those required in Hall-type measurement-dependence models, but arising here solely from preparation drift combined with experimental scheduling. Our results identify a preparation-dependent loophole relevant to Bell tests on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and highlight the necessity of drift-aware protocols for reliable quantum certification.

*Samuel Goodwin,Brian K. McFarland,Manuel H. Muñoz-Arias,Edward C. Tortorici,Melissa C. Revelle,Christopher G. Yale,Daniel S. Lobser,Susan M. Clark,Mohan Sarovar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of characterizing quantum gates with precision by developing a data-driven learning protocol based on the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig (NMZ) formulation. This approach allows for the learning of quantum evolution operators, including non-Markovian dynamics, from time series data of qubit systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires precise control of qubit dynamics during gate application. Existing methods for characterizing quantum gates often assume Markovian dynamics, which may not hold in realistic scenarios where noise is non-Markovian or characterized after the fact.

Method: The authors build upon previous work using the NMZ formulation to model open system dynamics. They apply this approach to three different systems: a purely Markovian qubit simulation, a driven qubit with noise from an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and experimental data from trapped-ion qubits. The method involves learning the NMZ operators (generators of time evolution) from the time series data.

Result: The protocol successfully learns the generators of time evolution in all three cases, enabling the identification of non-Markovian dynamics in the qubit systems. The technique provides insight into the timescale beyond which purely Markovian models no longer suffice to describe the qubit dynamics.

Conclusion: This data-driven approach enhances the characterization of quantum gates by explicitly accounting for non-Markovianity, offering a more comprehensive method for diagnosing noise sources and improving the reliability of quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires extremely precise knowledge and control of qubit dynamics during the application of a gate. We develop a data-driven learning protocol for characterizing quantum gates that builds off previous work on learning the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig (NMZ) formulation of open system dynamics from time series data, which allows detailed reconstruction of quantum evolution, including non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate this learning technique on three different systems: a simulation of a qubit whose dynamics are purely Markovian, a simulation of a driven qubit coupled to stochastic noise produced by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and trapped-ion experimental data of a driven qubit whose noise environment is not characterized ahead of time. Our technique is able to learn the generators of time evolution, or the NMZ operators, in all three cases and can learn the timescale in which the qubit dynamics can no longer be accurately described by a purely Markovian model. Our technique complements existing quantum gate characterization methods such as gate set tomography by explicitly capturing non-Markovianity in the gate generator, thus allowing for more thorough diagnosis of noise sources.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A protocol for ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain is developed using a dissipative approach. The protocol is robust against noise and can handle a large number of entangling gates. Hardware noise is mitigated through zero-noise extrapolation, achieving results consistent with noiseless simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum many-body systems are challenging to simulate and analyze, especially with a large number of qubits. Efficient ground-state preparation is essential for understanding these systems.

Method: A dissipative protocol is developed, incorporating a Kraus representation of a dissipation channel. The protocol is applicable beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime and works for arbitrary temporal discretization steps. The method ensures monotonic increase in fidelity with the ground state under repeated applications.

Result: The protocol successfully prepares the ground state of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Despite hardware noise, the system converges to a low-energy state. Zero-noise extrapolation further improves the energy expectation values, aligning them with noiseless simulations.

Conclusion: This protocol demonstrates robust and efficient preparation of the ground state for quantum spin chains, highlighting its potential for practical applications in quantum computing.

Abstract: We demonstrate a dissipative protocol for ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a first step, we derive a Kraus representation of a dissipation channel for the protocol recently proposed by Ding et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033147 (2024)] that still holds for arbitrary temporal discretization steps, extending the analysis beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime. The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol. By applying zero-noise extrapolation, the resulting energy expectation values are systematically improved to agree with noiseless simulations within statistical uncertainties.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了机器学习在量子系统研究中的强大潜力，尤其是在预测和重建量子动力学行为方面。

Abstract: The Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis formulates time evolution of operators through Lanczos coefficients. In practice, however, numerical instability and memory cost limit the number of coefficients that can be computed exactly. In response to these challenges, the standard approach relies on fitting early coefficients to asymptotic forms, but such procedures can miss subleading, history-dependent structures in the coefficients that subsequently affect reconstructed observables. In this work, we treat the Lanczos coefficients as a causal time sequence and introduce a transformer-based model to autoregressively predict future Lanczos coefficients from short prefixes. For both classical and quantum systems, our machine-learning model outperforms asymptotic fits, in both coefficient extrapolation and physical observable reconstruction, by achieving an order-of-magnitude reduction in error. Our model also transfers across system sizes: it can be trained on smaller systems and then be used to extrapolate coefficients on a larger system without retraining. By probing the learned attention patterns and performing targeted attention ablations, we identify which portions of the coefficient history are most influential for accurate forecasts.

Abstract: Automated theorem proving, or more broadly automated reasoning, aims at using computer programs to automatically prove or disprove mathematical theorems and logical statements. It takes on an essential role across a vast array of applications and the quest for enhanced theorem-proving capabilities remains a prominent pursuit in artificial intelligence. Here, we propose a generic framework for quantum automated theorem proving, where the intrinsic quantum superposition and entanglement features would lead to potential advantages. In particular, we introduce quantum representations of knowledge bases and propose corresponding reasoning algorithms for a variety of tasks. We show how automated reasoning can be achieved with quantum resolution in both propositional and first-order logic with quadratically reduced query complexity. In addition, we propose the quantum algebraic proving method for geometric theorems, extending Wu's algebraic approach beyond the classical setting. Through concrete examples, including geometry problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad, we demonstrate how a quantum computer may prove geometric theorems with quadratic better query complexity. Our results establish a primary approach towards building quantum automatic theorem provers, which would be crucial for practical applications of both near-term and future quantum technologies.

Motivation: Understanding wave-particle duality and interference phenomena in quantum mechanics is important for exploring the boundary between quantum and classical physics.

Method: The analysis is based on the Schrödinger equation and the Klein-Gordon equation, comparing the predictions for wave and particle behavior in a beamsplitter setup.

Result: The Schrödinger equation predicts interference when the beamsplitter's speed exceeds the phase velocity of a free particle, which is not possible for electromagnetic waves or momentum eigenstates in the Klein-Gordon framework.

Conclusion: The result suggests that quantum particles exhibit interference not observed in classical wave systems, supporting the principles of wave-particle duality.

Abstract: The Schrödinger equation predicts interference when a beamsplitter's trajectory includes a segment where its speed exceeds the phase velocity of a free non-zero rest mass particle that is in a momentum eigenstate. Such interference is neither possible for electromagnetic waves nor for eigenstates of momentum in the non-relativistic limit of the Klein-Gordon equation since the speed of the beamsplitter cannot exceed the phase velocity of the wave. The dual behavior of reflection and transmission in this case is discussed for dielectric and diffracting beamsplitters.

Abstract: Variational quantum circuits have become a widely used tool for performing quantum machine learning (QML) tasks on labeled quantum states. In some specific tasks or for specific variational ansätze, one may perform measurements on a restricted part of the overall input state. This is the case for, e.g., quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), where after each layer of the circuit a subset of qubits of the processed state is measured or traced out, and at the end of the network one typically measures a local observable. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring observables with restricted support results in larger label prediction variance in regression QML tasks. We show that the reason for this is, essentially, the number of distinct eigenvalues of the observable one measures after the application of a variational circuit.

Abstract: Understanding the energetic efficiency of quantum computers is essential for assessing their scalability and for determining whether quantum technologies can outperform classical computation beyond runtime alone. In this work, we analyze the energy required to solve the Boson Sampling problem, a paradigmatic task for quantum advantage, using a realistic photonic quantum computing architecture. Using the Metric-Noise-Resource methodology, we establish a quantitative connection between experimental control parameters, dominant noise processes, and energetic resources through a performance metric tailored to Boson Sampling. We estimate the energy cost per sample and identify operating regimes that optimize energetic efficiency. By comparing the energy consumption of quantum and state-of-the-art classical implementations, we demonstrate the existence of a quantum energetic advantage -- defined as a lower energy cost per sample compared to the best-known classical implementation -- that emerges before the onset of computational advantage, even in regimes where classical algorithms remain faster. Finally, we propose an experimentally feasible Boson Sampling architecture, including a complete noise and loss budget, that enables a near-term observation of quantum energetic advantage.

Abstract: Feedback-based quantum algorithms (FQAs) operate by iteratively growing a quantum circuit to optimize a given task. At each step, feedback from qubit measurements is used to inform the next quantum circuit update. In practice, the sampling cost associated with these measurements can be significant. Here, we ask whether FQA parameter sequences can be predicted using classical machine learning, obviating the need for qubit measurements altogether. To this end, we train a teacher-student model to map a MaxCut problem instance to an associated FQA parameter curve in a single classical inference step. Numerical experiments show that this model can accurately predict FQA parameter curves across a range of problem sizes, including problem sizes not seen during model training. To evaluate performance, we compare the predicted parameter curves in simulation against FQA reference curves and linear quantum annealing schedules. We observe similar results to the former and performance improvements over the latter. These results suggest that machine learning can offer a heuristic, practical path to reducing sampling costs and resource overheads in quantum algorithms.

Abstract: It is commonly thought that observers in distinct branches of an Everettian multiverse cannot communicate without violating the linearity of quantum theory. Here we show a counterexample, demonstrating that inter-branch communication is in fact possible, entirely within standard quantum theory. We do this by considering a Wigner's-friend scenario, where an observer (Wigner) can have quantum control over another observer (the friend). We present a thought experiment where the friend in superposition can receive a message written by a distinct copy of themselves in the multiverse, with the aid of Wigner. To maintain the unitarity of quantum theory, the observers must have no memory of the message that they sent. Our thought experiment challenges conventional wisdom regarding the ultimate limits of what is possible in an Everettian multiverse. It has a surprising potential application which involves using knowledge-creation paradoxes for testing Everettian quantum theory against single-world theories.

Motivation: 研究TTNS和MPS在强相互作用量子多体系统中的应用，以及不同维度下的效率对比。

Method: 分析了DD>1维系统中TTNS和MPS的计算成本，假设系统服从纠缠（对数）面积律，并对比了不同边界条件下的标量。

Result: 对于D=2和3，MPS在低能量态上的效率优于TTNS。

Conclusion: 在二维及以上维数下，MPS在低能量态模拟中更具优势。

Abstract: Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.

Abstract: Identifying the state of a quantum bit (qubit), known as quantum state discrimination, is a crucial operation in quantum computing. However, it has been the most error-prone and time-consuming operation on superconducting quantum processors. Due to stringent timing constraints and algorithmic complexity, most qubit state discrimination methods are executed offline. In this work, we present an enhanced real-time quantum state discrimination system leveraging FPGA-based AI Engine technology. A multi-layer neural network has been developed and implemented on the AMD Xilinx VCK190 FPGA platform, enabling accurate in-situ state discrimination and supporting mid-circuit measurement experiments for multiple qubits. Our approach leverages recent advancements in architecture research and design, utilizing specialized AI/ML accelerators to optimize quantum experiments and reduce the use of FPGA resources.

Result: 在10 dB信噪比下（对应25 km通信距离），当β分别为0°和45°时，密钥速率分别为8.765×10⁻⁶ bit/pulse和4.150×10⁻⁶ bit/pulse。与基于单光子的QSDC相比，通信距离分别增加了约155.9%和149.7%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了参考系无关QSDC协议在通信距离上的显著优势， applicable in mobile通信场景中。

Abstract: Current quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocols guarantee communication security by estimating the error rates of photons in the X and Z bases. This take the reference frame calibration between communicating parties as a necessary prerequisite. However, in mobile communications scenarios, achieving continuous and accurate reference frame calibration poses significant challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reference-frame-independent (RFI) QSDC protocol. This protocol only requires ensuring the calibration accuracy of one direction of the reference frame, while allowing a misalignment angle $β$ in the other two directions. To improve the protocol's robustness against reference frame fluctuations, we introduce a $β$-independent parameter C into the security analysis framework and rederive the protocol's security bounds. Additionally, we construct a system model and optimize the pulse intensity of the signal states, enabling the protocol to achieve optimal performance under each level of channel attenuation. At an attenuation of 10 dB (corresponding to a communication distance of 25 km), the secrecy message capacities for $β= 0^{ \circ} $ and $45^{ \circ} $ are $8.765 \times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse and $4.150 \times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse, respectively. Compared with the single-photon-based QSDC, the communication distance of the protocol proposed in this paper is significantly extended. When $β= 0^{ \circ} $ and $45^{ \circ} $, the maximum transmission distances of the RFI QSDC protocol are 27.875 km and 26.750 km, which is about 155.9 % and 149.7 % of that of the single-photon-based QSDC protocol.

Abstract: The exploration of photonic systems for quantum information processing has generated widespread interest in multiple cutting-edge research fields. Photonic frequency encoding stands out as an especially viable approach, given its natural alignment with established optical communication technologies, including fiber networks and wavelength-division multiplexing systems. Substantial reductions in hardware resources and improvements in quantum performance can be expected by utilizing multiple frequency modes. The integration of nonlinear photonics with microresonators provides a compelling way for generating frequency-correlated photon pairs across discrete spectral modes. Here, by leveraging the high material nonlinearity and low nonlinear loss, we demonstrate an efficient chip-scale multi-wavelength quantum light source based on AlGaAs-on-insulator, featuring a free spectral range of approximately 200 GHz at telecom wavelengths. The optimized submicron waveguide geometry provides both high effective nonlinearity (~550 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$) and broad generation bandwidth, producing eleven distinct wavelength pairs across a 35.2 nm bandwidth with an average spectral brightness of 2.64 GHz mW$^{-2}$nm$^{-1}$. The generation of energy-time entanglement for each pair of frequency modes is verified through Franson interferometry, yielding an average net visibility of 93.1%. With its exceptional optical gain and lasing capabilities, the AlGaAs-on-insulator platform developed here shows outstanding potential for realizing fully integrated, ready-to-deploy quantum photonic systems on chip.

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) and bath engineering are two parallel techniques employed to mitigate qubit decoherence resulting from their unavoidable coupling to the environment. Here, we present a hybrid DD approach that integrates pulsed DD with bath spin polarization to enhance qubit coherence within the central spin model. This model, which can be realized using GaAs semiconductor quantum dots or analogous quantum simulators, demonstrates a significant extension of the central spin's coherence time by approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude that compared with the free-induced decay time, where the dominant contribution from DD and a moderate improvement from spin-bath polarization. This study, which integrates uniaxial dynamical decoupling and auxiliary bath-spin engineering, paves the way for prolonging coherence times in various practical quantum systems, including GaAs/AlGaAs, silicon and Si/SiGe. And this advancement holds substantial promise for applications in quantum information processing.

Conclusion: 临界点明确了两种机制的界限，对量子计算和实验都具有指导意义。

Abstract: The limit between the two regimes of spontaneous-parametric down-conversion (SPDC) or four-wave-mixing (FWM) regarding the pump intensity has been theoretically investigated using a semi-classical model and analytical calculations. A unitless quantity has been defined, corresponding to the photon-pairs flux per frequency unit: it has been found equal to 0.369 at this limit. The ratio between the magnitudes of the electric fields of the generated photons and of vacuum has been also calculated, equal to 1.718, and the pump intensity has been plotted as a function of the interaction length for different values of the second-order electric susceptibility in the case of SPDC and of the third-order electric susceptibility for FWM. These quantitative results confirm that below the limit, the nonlinear process can be truly considered as spontaneous, i.e. mainly seeded by the quantum fluctuations of vacuum, while the generated photons mainly govern the pump photon splitting above the limit, which corresponds more to an optical parametric amplification / difference frequency generation regime. Knowing quantitatively the limit between the two regimes thanks to the present calculations will be a useful guide for further quantum calculations and measurements from either side of the limit in order to catch the full quantum picture of SPDC and FWM from low to high pump intensities.

Abstract: In quantum software engineering (QSE), quantum software testing (QST) has attracted increasing attention as quantum software systems grow in scale and complexity. Since QST evaluates quantum programs through execution under designed test inputs, empirical studies are widely used to assess the effectiveness of testing approaches. However, the design and reporting of empirical studies in QST remain highly diverse, and a shared methodological understanding has yet to emerge, making it difficult to interpret results and compare findings across studies. This paper presents a methodological analysis of empirical studies in QST through a systematic examination of 59 primary studies identified from a literature pool of size 384. We organize our analysis around ten research questions that cover key methodological dimensions of QST empirical studies, including objects under test, baseline comparison, testing setup, experimental configuration, and tool and artifact support. Through cross-study analysis along these dimensions, we characterize current empirical practices in QST, identify recurring limitations and inconsistencies, and highlight open methodological challenges. Based on our findings, we derive insights and recommendations to inform the design, execution, and reporting of future empirical studies in QST.

Abstract: Photonic systems offer a promising platform for interconnecting quantum processors and enabling scalable, networked architectures. Designing and verifying such architectures requires a unified formalism that integrates linear algebraic reasoning with probabilistic and control-flow structures. In this work, we introduce a graphical framework for distributed quantum computing that brings together linear optics, the ZX-calculus, and dataflow programming. Our language supports the formal analysis and optimization of distributed protocols involving both qubits and photonic modes, with explicit interfaces for classical control and feedforward, all expressed within a synchronous dataflow model with discrete-time dynamics. Within this setting, we classify entangling photonic fusion measurements, show how their induced Pauli errors can be corrected via a novel flow structure for fusion networks, and establish correctness proofs for new repeat-until-success protocols enabling arbitrary fusions. Layer by layer, we construct qubit architectures incorporating practical optical components such as beam splitters, switches, and photon sources, with graphical proofs that they are deterministic and support universal quantum computation. Together, these results establish a foundation for verifiable compilation and automated optimization in networked quantum computing.

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发通用且不可信的量子随机数生成器提供了切实可行的路线，特别是在集成型光子量子网络中的应用前景广阔。

Abstract: We present a semi-device-independent quantum random number generator (QRNG) based on the violation of a contextuality inequality, implemented by the integration of two silicon photonic chips. Our system combines a heralded single-photon source with a reconfigurable interferometric mesh to implement qutrit state preparation, transformations, and measurements suitable for testing a KCBS contextuality inequality. This architecture enables the generation of random numbers from the intrinsic randomness of single-photon interference in a complex optical network, while simultaneously allowing a quantitative certification of their security without requiring entanglement. We observe a contextuality violation exceeding the classical bound by more than 10σ, unambiguously confirming non-classical behavior. From this violation, we certify a conditional min-entropy per experimental round of Hmin = 0.077 +- 0.002, derived via a tailored semidefinite-programming-based security analysis. Each measurement outcome therefore contains at least 0.077 +- 0.002 bits of extractable genuine randomness, corresponding to an asymptotic generation rate of 21.7 +- 0.5 bits/s. These results establish a viable route towards general-purpose, untrusted quantum random number generators compatible with practical integrated photonic quantum networks.

Conclusion: This toolchain enhances the design and validation of transport protocols for future trapped-ion processors.

Abstract: Scalable trapped-ion quantum computing requires fast and reliable transport of ions through complex, segmented radiofrequency trap architectures without inducing excessive motional excitation. We present a numerical toolchain for the systematic generation of time-dependent electrode voltages enabling fast, low-excitation ion shuttling in segmented radiofrequency traps. Based on a model of the trap electrode geometry, the framework combines an electrostatic field solver, efficient unconstrained optimization, waveform postprocessing, and dynamical simulations of ion motion to compute voltage waveforms that realize prescribed transport trajectories while respecting experimental constraints such as voltage limits and bandwidth. The toolchain supports arbitrary trap geometries, including junctions and multi-zone layouts, and allows for the flexible incorporation of optimization objectives. We provide a detailed assessment of the accuracy of the framework by investigating its numerical stability and by comparing measured and predicted secular frequencies. The framework is optimized for numerical performance, enabling rapid numerical prototyping of trap architectures of increasing complexity. As application examples, we apply the framework to the transport of a potential well along a linear, uniformly segmented trap, and we compute a solution for shuttling a potential well around the corner of an X-type trap junction. The presented approach provides an extensible and highly efficient numerical foundation for designing and validating transport protocols in current and next-generation trapped-ion processors.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiQ, a system that enables concurrent execution of multiple quantum circuits on neutral atom Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), significantly increasing their throughput and resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for high-throughput quantum computing, especially with large-scale quantum applications, has necessitated research into more efficient resource management and execution strategies for QPUs.

Method: The authors propose a hardware-agnostic system that integrates a compiler, controller, and checker. The compiler generates 'virtual zone layouts' to optimize spatio-temporal hardware utilization. The controller efficiently maps these layouts onto hardware and resolves conflicts. An independent checker ensures functional independence of bundled circuits.

Result: MultiQ achieved a throughput increase of 3.8× to 12.3× when executing 4 to 14 circuits simultaneously, with fidelity maintained at between 1.3% and 3.5% improvement.

Conclusion: MultiQ represents a novel architecture for efficient concurrent execution on neutral atom QPUs, addressing current limitations in scalability while maintaining fidelity.)

Abstract: Neutral atom Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are emerging as a popular quantum computing technology due to their large qubit counts and flexible connectivity. However, performance challenges arise as large circuits experience significant fidelity drops, while small circuits underutilize hardware and face initialization latency issues. To tackle these problems, we propose $\textit{multi-programming on neutral atom QPUs}$, allowing the co-execution of multiple circuits by logically partitioning the qubit array. This approach increases resource utilization and mitigates initialization latency while maintaining result fidelity. Currently, state-of-the-art compilers for neutral atom architectures do not support multi-programming.
  To fill this gap, we introduce MultiQ, the first system designed for this purpose. MultiQ addresses three main challenges: (i) it compiles circuits into a $\textit{virtual zone layout}$ to optimize spatio-temporal hardware utilization; (ii) it parallelizes the execution of co-located circuits, allowing single hardware instructions to operate on different circuits; and (iii) it includes an algorithm to verify the functional independence of the bundled circuits. MultiQ functions as a cross-layer system comprising a compiler, controller, and checker. Our compiler generates \emph{virtual zone layouts} to enhance performance, while the controller efficiently maps these layouts onto the hardware and resolves any conflicts. The checker ensures the correct bundling of circuits.
  Experimental results show a throughput increase from 3.8$\times$ to 12.3$\times$ when multi-programming 4 to 14 circuits, with fidelity largely maintained, ranging from a 1.3% improvement for four circuits to only a 3.5% loss for fourteen circuits. Overall, MultiQ facilitates concurrent execution of multiple quantum circuits, boosting throughput and hardware utilization.

Abstract: We present systematic and resource-efficient constructions of continuous symmetry projectors, particularly $U(1)$ particle number and $SU(2)$ total spin, tailored for fault-tolerant quantum computations. Our approach employs a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) as well as generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP and GQSVT) to implement projectors. These projectors can then be coherently applied as state filters prior to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We analyze their asymptotic gate complexities for explicit circuit realizations. For the particle number and $S_z$ symmetries, GQSP offers favorable resource usage features owing to its low ancilla qubit requirements and robustness to finite precision rotation gate synthesis. For the total spin projection, the structured decomposition of $\hat{P}_{S,M_S}$ reduces the projector T gate count. Numerical simulations show that symmetry filtering substantially increases the QPE success probability, leading to a lower overall cost compared to that of unfiltered approaches across representative molecular systems. Resource estimates further indicate that the cost of symmetry filtering is $3$ to $4$ orders of magnitude lower than that of the subsequent phase estimation step This advantage is especially relevant in large, strongly correlated systems, such as FeMoco, a standard strongly correlated open-shell benchmark. For FeMoco, the QPE cost is estimated at ${\sim}10^{10}$ T gates, while our symmetry projector requires only ${\sim}10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ T gates. These results establish continuous-symmetry projectors as practical and scalable tools for state preparation in quantum chemistry and provide a pathway toward realizing more efficient fault-tolerant quantum simulations.

Furthermore, investigating CSS-T codes, we: (a) demonstrate asymptotically good CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ realizes the logical transversal $S^{\dagger}$; (b) show that the condition $C_2 \ast C_1 \subseteq C_1^{\perp}$ is necessary but not sufficient for CSS-T codes; and (c) revise the characterizations of CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ implements the logical identity and the logical transversal $T$, respectively.

Abstract: This whitepaper surveys the current landscape and short- to mid-term prospects for quantum-enabled optimization and machine learning use cases in industrial settings. Grounded in the QCHALLenge program, it synthesizes hardware trajectories from different quantum architectures and providers, and assesses their maturity and potential for real-world use cases under a standardized traffic-light evaluation framework. We provide a concise summary of relevant hardware roadmaps, distinguishing superconducting and ion-trap technologies, their current states, modalities, and projected scaling trajectories. The core of the presented work are the use case evaluations in the domains of optimization problems and machine learning applications. For the conducted experiments, we apply a consistent set of evaluation criteria (model formulation, scalability, solution quality, runtime, and transferability) which are assessed in a shared system of three categories, ranging from optimistic (solutions produced by quantum computers are competitive with classical methods and/or a clear path to a quantum advantage is shown) to pessimistic (significant hurdles prevent practical application of quantum solutions now and potentially in the future). The resulting verdicts illuminate where quantum approaches currently offer promise, where hybrid classical-quantum strategies are most viable, and where classical methods are expected to remain superior.

Abstract: Although the principle of superposition lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and is the root of almost all quantum phenomena such as coherence and entanglement, its quantification, except for that related to the resource theory of coherence and interference, remains relatively less studied. In this work, we address quantification of superposition from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a family of quantifiers of superposition, the phase-sensitive superposition, by taking into account the phases of amplitudes in the superposition of a fixed basis states (e.g., computational basis states). We establish a conservation relation for the phase-sensitive superposition, which is a kind of complementary relation and is reminiscent of wave-particle duality. We evaluate explicitly the second moment of phase-sensitive superposition and show that it is intrinsically related to the $l^2$-norm coherence. We characterize the dephasing channel induced by the maximally superposed states. We investigate the minimum and maximum superpositions, reveal their basic properties, and illustrate them through various examples. We further explore the dynamics of superposition in the Grover search algorithm, and demonstrate a complementary relation between superposition and success probability of the search algorithm. These results and quantifiers offer tools for analyzing structural features and implications of quantum superposition.

*Mir Alimuddin,Jaemin Kim,Antonio Acín,Leonardo Zambrano*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses entanglement swapping in quantum networks and presents deterministic measurement methods for this process, which eliminate the need for post-selection. These methods work for arbitrary dimensions and are particularly optimal when complex Hadamard matrices are involved. The research also shows that deterministic protocols are dimension-dependent and can be classified into specific classes depending on the architecture of the quantum network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for distributed quantum networks has led to a need for reliable and deterministic entanglement swapping methods. Ensuring that entanglement can be reliably distributed across different dimensions and network architectures without relying on post-selection is crucial for robust quantum networks.

Method: The paper characterizes the conditions under which entanglement swapping becomes deterministic, demonstrating that for arbitrary pure inputs, every measurement outcome produces equivalent states. It also identifies an optimal measurement based on complex Hadamard matrices and provides a classification of these measurements depending on the dimensions of the quantum system.

Result: The key results include a full characterization of deterministic entanglement-swapping measurements for any dimension. The classification shows that deterministic protocols are unique for dimensions 2 and 3, infinite for dimension 4, and fall into 72 inequivalent classes for dimension 5. Additionally, the paper extends these findings to networks with multiple swapping nodes, revealing that the optimal measurements are order-independent for dimensions 2 and 3.

Conclusion: The research provides optimal, deterministic entanglement-swapping schemes that are independent of post-selection, making them valuable for the construction of robust quantum networks across various dimensions and architectures.

Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a key primitive for distributing entanglement across nodes in quantum networks. In standard protocols, the outcome of the intermediate measurement determines the resulting state, making the process inherently probabilistic and requiring postselection. In this work, we fully characterize those measurements under which entanglement swapping becomes deterministic: for arbitrary pure inputs, every measurement outcome produces local-unitarily equivalent states. We also show that an optimal measurement, maximizing a concurrence-type entanglement measure, is built from complex Hadamard matrices. For this optimal protocol, we provide a complete, dimension-dependent classification of deterministic entanglement-swapping measurements: unique in dimensions $d=2,3$, infinite for $d=4$, and comprising $72$ inequivalent classes for $d=5$. We further consider a general network with multiple swapping nodes and show that, for $d=2,3$ the resulting end-to-end state is independent of the order in which the repeaters perform the optimal measurements. Our results establish optimal entanglement-swapping schemes that are post-selection free, in the sense that they distribute entanglement across generic quantum network architectures without unfavorable measurement outcomes.

Abstract: This paper investigates symmetric composite binary quantum hypothesis testing (QHT), where the goal is to determine which of two uncertainty sets contains an unknown quantum state. While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.

Abstract: For a given quantum state used in sensing, the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable by an unbiased estimator of an unknown parameter, determined by the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI serves as an upper bound on the classical Fisher information (CFI), representing the maximum extractable information about the unknown parameter from measurements on a physical system. Thus, a central goal in quantum parameter estimation is to find a measurement, described by a POVM, that saturates the QFI (achieves maximum CFI), and thereby achieves the QCRB. In the idealization that one uses pure states and unitary encodings for sensing, discontinuities can appear in the CFI but not the QFI. In this article, we demonstrate that these discontinuities are important features, quantifying how much Fisher information is lost in the presence of noise. We refer to this as the Fisher information "fragility". We present a simple framework for understanding how discontinuities increase fragility through Jensen's inequality, and demonstrate how one can use this framework to design more robust POVMs for quantum advantage in metrology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While quantum annealing (QA) has been developed for combinatorial optimization, practical QA devices operate at finite temperature and under noise, and their outputs can be regarded as stochastic samples close to a Gibbs--Boltzmann distribution. In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\cos(\bmω^{\top}Δ\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\bm{x}_i,\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights. The kernel parameters are trained by minimizing the leave-one-out NW mean squared error, and we additionally evaluate local linear regression with the same squared-kernel weights at inference. Experiments on multiple benchmark regression datasets demonstrate a decrease in training loss, accompanied by structural changes in the kernel matrix, and show that the learned kernel tends to improve $R^2$ and RMSE over the baseline Gaussian-kernel NW. Increasing the number of random features at inference further enhances accuracy.

Abstract: As quantum devices continue to improve in scale and precision, a central challenge is how to effectively utilize noisy hardware for meaningful computation. Most existing approaches aim to recover noiseless circuit outputs from noisy ones through error mitigation or correction. Here, we show that noisy quantum devices can be directly leveraged as computational resources to enhance the classical simulation of quantum circuits. We introduce the Noisy-device-enhanced Classical Simulation (NDE-CS) protocol, which improves stabilizer-based classical Monte Carlo simulation methods by incorporating data obtained from noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, NDE-CS uses noisy executions of a target circuit together with noisy Clifford circuits to learn how the target circuit can be expressed in terms of Clifford circuits under realistic noise. The same learned relation can then be reused in the noiseless Clifford limit, enabling accurate estimation of ideal expectation values with substantially reduced sampling cost. Numerical simulations on Trotterized Ising circuits demonstrate that NDE-CS achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in sampling cost compared to the underlying purely classical Monte Carlo approaches from which it is derived, while maintaining the same accuracy. We also compare NDE-CS with Sparse Pauli Dynamics (SPD), a powerful classical framework capable of simulating quantum circuits at previously inaccessible scales, and provide an example where the cost of SPD scales exponentially with system size, while NDE-CS scales much more favorably. These results establish NDE-CS as a scalable hybrid simulation approach for quantum circuits, where noise can be harnessed as a computational asset.

Abstract: Bosonic codes constitute a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum computing. {Existing Floquet protocols enable analytical construction of bosonic codes but typically rely on slow adiabatic ramps with thousands of driving periods.} In this work, we circumvent this bottleneck by introducing an analytical and deterministic Floquet method that directly synthesizes arbitrary unitaries within a single period. The phase-space unitary ensembles generated by our approach reproduce the Haar-random statistics, enabling practical pseudorandom unitaries in continuous-variable systems. We prepare various prototypical bosonic codes from vacuum and implement single-qubit logical gates with high fidelities using quantum lattice gates. By harnessing the full intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions, quantum lattice gates decompose quantum circuits into primitive operations for efficient continuous-variable quantum computing.

Abstract: Bell measurements (BMs) are ubiquitous in quantum information and technology. They are basic elements for quantum commmunication, computation, and error correction. In particular, when performed on logical qubits encoded in physical photonic qubits, they allow for a read-out of stabilizer syndrome information to enhance loss tolerance in qubit-state transmission and fusion. However, even in an ideal setting without photon loss, BMs cannot be done perfectly based on the simplest experimental toolbox of linear optics. Here we demonstrate that any logical BM on stabilizer codes can always be mapped onto a single physical BM perfomed on any qubit pair from the two codes. As a necessary condition for the success of a logical BM, this provides a general upper bound on its success probability, especially ruling out the possibility that the stabilizer information obtainable from only partially succeeding, physical linear-optics BMs could be combined into the full logical stabilizer information. We formulate sufficient criteria to find schemes for which a single successful BM on the physical level will always allow to obtain the full logical information by suitably adapting the subsequent physical measurements. Our approach based on stabilizer group theory is generally applicable to any stabilizer code, which we demonstrate for quantum parity, five-qubit, standard and rotated planar surface, tree, and seven-qubit Steane codes. Our schemes attain the general upper bound for all these codes, while this bound had previously only been reached for the quantum parity code.

Abstract: Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.
  In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \%$.

Abstract: We study wave turbulence in one-dimensional (1-D) bidirectional shallow water waves described by the Kaup-Boussinesq (KB) equation, which is known to be an integrable system. In contrast to the generally accepted empirical belief that an integrable system yields no kinetic theory, we derive and validate a non-trivial wave kinetic equation (WKE) for the KB system with a non-zero interaction coefficient on the four-wave resonant manifold. This WKE is non-homogeneous in nature due to the non-homogeneity in the dispersion relation of the KB system; however, approximate Kolomogrov-Zakharov (KZ) solutions can be derived in a novel way under certain approximations. We numerically verify the theoretical findings in two cases: (i) In free-evolution cases, although the discrete (nonlinear) spectrum remains unchanged as guaranteed by an integrable system's isospectrality, an initial arbitrary wavenumber spectrum quickly evolves into a thermo-equilibrium state, demonstrating the kinetic aspect of the system; (ii) in forced-dissipated cases, we find stationary power-law spectra that agree with the theoretical predictions.

TL;DR: We propose a novel Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN architecture to address the challenge of identifying and controlling spatiotemporal chaos in reaction-diffusion systems with complex catalytic surfaces. Our approach leverages sinusoidal activations to overcome spectral bias in traditional PINNs, enabling accurate modeling of high-frequency dynamics and effective control of chaotic systems by reconstructing curvature fields from partial observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to control and predict spatiotemporal chaos in complex systems, particularly in chemical engineering contexts where surface topography is unknown, is crucial for advancing technology in areas like catalysis and reactor design.

Method: We developed a Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN architecture with periodic sinusoidal activations and frequency-diverse initialization, specifically designed to handle the high-frequency gradients and complex geometries encountered in spatiotemporal chaos.

Result: The proposed architecture achieved state-of-the-art performance, with a relative state prediction error of approximately 1.92% and successfully maintained topological invariants, demonstrating its effectiveness in controlling chaotic systems.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step forward in the field of geometric control of chaos, offering a powerful new tool for designing catalysts and controlling turbulent chemical reactors with greater precision and efficiency.

Abstract: The accurate identification and control of spatiotemporal chaos in reaction-diffusion systems remains a grand challenge in chemical engineering, particularly when the underlying catalytic surface possesses complex, unknown topography. In the \textit{Defect Turbulence} regime, system dynamics are governed by topological phase singularities (spiral waves) whose motion couples to manifold curvature via geometric pinning. Conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using ReLU or Tanh activations suffer from fundamental \textit{spectral bias}, failing to resolve high-frequency gradients and causing amplitude collapse or phase drift. We propose a Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN architecture leveraging periodic sinusoidal activations with frequency-diverse initialization, embedding the appropriate inductive bias for wave-like physics directly into the network structure. This enables simultaneous resolution of macroscopic wave envelopes and microscopic defect cores. Validated on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation evolving on latent Riemannian manifolds, our architecture achieves relative state prediction error $ε_{L_2} \approx 1.92 \times 10^{-2}$, outperforming standard baselines by an order of magnitude while preserving topological invariants ($|ΔN_{defects}| < 1$). We solve the ill-posed \textit{inverse pinning problem}, reconstructing hidden Gaussian curvature fields solely from partial observations of chaotic wave dynamics (Pearson correlation $ρ= 0.965$). Training dynamics reveal a distinctive Spectral Phase Transition at epoch $\sim 2,100$, where cooperative minimization of physics and geometry losses drives the solver to Pareto-optimal solutions. This work establishes a new paradigm for Geometric Catalyst Design, offering a mesh-free, data-driven tool for identifying surface heterogeneity and engineering passive control strategies in turbulent chemical reactors.

Also, we show that the resulting theory can be cast in terms of an $F(R,φ)$ theory of gravity. We analyze two models of non-local $F(R)$ gravity, one power-law and the $R^2$ model, and we show that both models can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  papers presents a scalar realization of Machian program within scalar-tensor gravity, formulating a causal determination of inertial scale that aligns with weak-field tests while implementing Machian physics through retarded couplings in FLRW universe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  the paper aims to merge Machian principles with modern gravity theories, addressing how inertial frames emerge in scalar-tensor frameworks and ensuring consistency with established weak-field tests.

Method:  the research starts with universally conformally coupled matter, redefines field equations using invariant scalars, and applies causal postulate through retarded responses to matter distribution. It uses FLRW universe models and asymptotic expansions to derive explicit causal kernels.

Result:  the analysis shows that the theory successfully implements a causal Machian inertial scale. In spatially flat FLRW universes, it connects background evolution to matter content, producing expected scalings. Test body couplings lead to vanishing Eotvos parameter, ensuring compatibility with Eotvos experiments. The theory accommodates nonuniversal effects only when gravitational binding energy is significant, consistent with observations in compact objects.

Conclusion:  the scalar theory bridges Machian physics with scalar-tensor gravity, offering a consistent framework that respects weak-field experiments while incorporating Machian causal principles. The causal prescription for inertial determination aligns with observations and theoretical expectations.

Abstract: We formulate a scalar realization of Sciama's Machian programme within the general Bergmann-Wagoner class of scalar--tensor gravity. Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\{{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_3,\hat g_{μν}\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the Eötvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests.

Abstract: Repeated black-hole mergers in dense stellar clusters are a plausible mechanism to populate the predicted gap in black hole masses due to the pair-instability process. These hierarchical mergers carry distinct spin and tilt features relative to first-generation black holes, for which previous studies have found evidence at a population level by interpreting features in the effective inspiral spin domain. We introduce an astrophysically-motivated model in the joint space of effective inspiral and precessing spins, which captures the dominant spin dynamics expected for hierarchical mergers. We find decisive evidence both for a population transition above $\sim 45M_\odot$, consistent with the anticipated onset of the pair-instability gap, as well as a peak at $\sim 15 M_\odot$, which we interpret as the global peak in the hierarchical merger rate. The existence of low- and high-mass subpopulations of higher-generation black holes suggests the contribution of both near-solar-metallicity and metal-poor star clusters to the hierarchical merger population. Our results reinforce the growing evidence for detailed, mass-dependent substructure in the spin distribution of the binary black hole population.

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of curvature invariants for a large ensemble of neutron stars built with equations of state (EOSs) that satisfy constraints from nuclear theory and perturbative QCD, as well as measurements of neutron-star masses, radii, and gravitational waves from binary neutron-star mergers. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that stars with negative Ricci scalar $\mathcal{R}$ are rather common and about $\sim 50\%$ of our EOSs produce one or more stars with Ricci curvature that is negative somewhere inside the star. The negative curvature is found mostly but not exclusively at the highest densities and pressures, and predominantly for stiff EOSs and for the most compact and most massive stars. Furthermore, we improve the quasi-universal relation between the stellar gravitational mass $M$ and the baryonic mass $M_\mathrm{b}$, which allows us to express analytically one in terms of the other with a maximum variance of only $\sim 3\%$. Finally, using the relation between the Ricci scalar and the trace anomaly $Δ$, we determine the conditions under which $Δ$ vanishes or becomes negative in neutron stars.

Abstract: In this work, the Darmois-Israel junction formalism is extended to the case of discontinuous metrics within the framework of Colombeau algebras of generalized functions. This formulation provides a mathematically consistent treatment of nonlinear operations involving singular quantities, such as products and derivatives of distributions. By relaxing the usual continuity condition on the metric, the generalized junction conditions naturally include higher-order singular terms in the curvature and in the surface energy-momentum tensor. These additional contributions represent new geometric degrees of freedom associated with genuine discontinuities in the space-time geometry. The resulting formalism recovers the traditional Darmois-Israel conditions as a limiting case, while offering a coherent extension applicable to geometric boundaries and abrupt transitions in space-time.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the possibility that the large-scale magnetic fields observed in galaxies, of the order of microgauss, arise naturally from a complex Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) halo charged under a local $U(1)$ symmetry. Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms'' capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of black hole interiors in Horava-Lifshitz gravity by analyzing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace. Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.

### [131] [An Explicit Kaluza-Klein Reduction of Einstein's Gravity in $6D$ on $S^2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08443)
*Tekin Dereli,Yorgo Senikoglu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究六维的Kaluza-Klein理论，具有时空拓扑$M_4 	imes S^2$，关注降维后规范场的行为。通过使用$S^2$上的归一化Killing向量，明确构造了约化后的杨米尔斯作用量，并确定了对应的规范动能矩阵。尽管$S^2$具有$SO(3)$等距，但只在四维中有两个物理规范场传播。规范动能矩阵的秩为2，仅有一个零特征值。我们证明这种退化是由于余切空间结构$S^2 acksimeq SO(3)/SO(2)$，反映了非动力学规范方向，而非降维过程中的不一致。结果澄清了Kaluza-Klein降低在余切空间上的规范自由度的几何来源。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文研究了六维Kaluza-Klein理论中通过降维获得的规范场行为，焦点在于$S^2$余切空间上的规范自由度。通过归一化Killing向量的构造，明确规范场的行为，特别是规范动能矩阵的秩及其退化原因。这些结果有助于理解Kaluza-Klein理论在余切空间上的规范自由度来源及其几何结构。

Method: 在研究该论文的方法时，首先确定了研究目标是六维Kaluza-Klein理论，目标是分析通过降维获得的规范场行为。进而，论文采用了规范的方法，即首先描述六维时空$M_4 	imes S^2$，然后使用$S^2$上的归一化Killing向量来明确构造降维后的作用量和规范动能矩阵。之后，论文分析了$S^2$的对称群$SO(3)$及其 isotropy subgroup $SO(2)$，并利用余切结构$S^2 acksimeq SO(3)/SO(2)$来解释结果。最后，论文总结了这些结果对规范自由度来源的理解。

Result: 论文的主要结果是，在六维的Kaluza-Klein理论中，当时空为$M_4 	imes S^2$时，降维后仅在四维中有两个物理规范场传播。归一化Killing向量的使用使得规范场的行为得以明确，而规范动能矩阵的秩为2，仅有一个零特征值。这两个结果表明，规范场的退化是由于余切空间$S^2$的结构决定的。规范动能矩阵的秩为2表明只有两个规范场可以传递信息，而唯一的零特征值表明该方向是规范非动力学的。

Conclusion: 总体来说，论文研究了六维Kaluza-Klein理论的降维行为，并通过构造规范场的行为及其动能矩阵，得出在四维中仅存在两个物理规范场的结论。这结论反映了在余切空间$S^2$下规范自由度的直接来源，表明非动力学规范方向的存在是由于余切空间的结构而非降维过程中的不一致。因此，论文澄清了Kaluza-Klein降低在余切空间上的规范自由度的几何来源。

Abstract: We study a six-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory with spacetime topology $M_4 \times S^2$ and analyze the gauge sector arising from dimensional reduction. Using normalized Killing vectors on $S^2$, we explicitly construct the reduced Yang-Mills action and determine the corresponding gauge kinetic matrix. Despite the $SO(3)$ isometry of $S^2$, we show that only two physical gauge fields propagate in four dimensions. The gauge kinetic matrix therefore has rank two and possesses a single zero eigenvalue. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is a direct consequence of the coset structure $S^2 \simeq SO(3)/SO(2)$ and reflects a non-dynamical gauge direction rather than an inconsistency of the reduction. Our results clarify the geometric origin of gauge degrees of freedom in Kaluza-Klein reductions on coset spaces.

Conclusion: 通过这次研究，作者扩展了对时空曲率演化理解的能力，尤其是当时空允许 torsion 和非度量化性时。

Abstract: Geometry is wavy: even at the purely geometric level (no particular theory chosen), curvature satisfies a covariant quasilinear wave equation. In Riemannian geometry equipped with the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor obeys a wave equation of the schematic form \[ \Box Riem=\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem), \] where $\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem)$ denotes the terms quadratic in the curvature arising from the Bianchi identities. In this work, we generalize this curvature wave equation to spacetimes endowed with a generic affine connection possessing torsion and nonmetricity. Working within the metric-affine framework, we derive the corresponding wave equation for the Riemann tensor and analyze its structure in several geometrically and physically distinguished settings, including Einstein spaces, teleparallel gravity, and Einstein-Cartan theory.

Motivation: 建立更真实的分析黑洞模型并不容易。引入动态的宇宙背景和外部电磁场的非线性效应是突破传统精确解的关键。通过利用缩子和 Forrest 对称性，在动态设置下引入时空渐变的电磁场，丰富了时空结构和多样性。

Method: 我们通过在施瓦茨希德黑洞的基础上结合缩子和 Forrest 对称性，构建了一个动态的、渐缩且带有外部电磁场的时空解。这一方法允许我们探讨带有渐变电磁场的黑洞行为，同时可在更高维度进行推广。所以我们采用这种方法通过对施瓦茨希德解决方案的非线性推广，得到了我们的精确解。

Result: 该解提供了时间依赖的、带有渐缩和外部电磁场的黑洞模型。时空结构包括渐缩的 Event Horizon 以及渐化的电磁场。外力电磁场的出现使得渐近几何严格依赖于 Friedmann 和 列维-Civita 几何的混合。这是首次在精确解框架下同时考虑时间依赖的宇宙背景及其对外部电磁场的作用。

Conclusion: 这一精确解为研究渐缩和动态的黑洞行为及其外部电磁场提供了简单的理论模型。发现了渐近和结构性质的丰富性，包括渐近混合和黑洞隐性奇点的隐藏情况。我们得到了在静态情况下 Singularity 显性失效的新机制，并对其天体物理和早先的宇宙模型可能应用进行了展望。

Abstract: We construct a novel exact solution of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell equations describing a dynamical black hole immersed in an external, time-dependent electromagnetic field. Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon. Possible implications for primordial black holes and some astrophysical applications, as well as extensions to higher dimensions, are also discussed.

Abstract: We obtain the metric which describes the spacetime corresponding to the Frolov black hole in the presence of a cloud of strings and discuss how this cloud affects the regularity of the solution and the energy conditions. In addition, we analyze geodesics, effective potential, and several thermodynamic aspects. Finally, we compare our results with the corresponding findings in the literature for the original Frolov black hole, that is, in the absence of a cloud of strings

Conclusion: 给出了量子态相变模型，为后续研究黑洞振动量子化提供了基础

Abstract: As is well known, near-horizon (equivalently high acceleration) observers in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes have a particularly simple form of the quasi-local energy. Using this energy and indistinguishable area quanta satisfying quantum statistics a statistical mechanical description of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry for uniformly accelerating observers is developed. The resulting model has several phases including one with highly excited states, Bose-Einstein condensates, condensates distinct from the usual Bose gas, and degenerate Fermi gases. In the large area limit, relevant for comparison to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the new condensed state is favored over Bose-Einstein condensation and the degenerate Fermi gas. The entropies of the phases, and the entropy of mixing, are computed. The resulting low-entropic condensed state, where the quanta are essentially all in the lowest Bose energy state, provides the framework for the quantization of near-horizon geometric fluctuations, which is explored in a companion paper.

Abstract: Black hole entropy is identified with the counting of the dynamical degrees of freedom of trapped gravitational modes continually sourced by the Hawking-Unruh process. In the context of linear perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime the density of states is derived from the orthogonality of states in the solution space of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. The otherwise divergent energy and entropy is cutoff by the Planck scale closest approach of constantly accelerating observers near the horizon. The thermal distribution of the trapped modes, which represent shape fluctuations in the near horizon geometry, store a significant fraction of the spacetime mass as observed from far away. Unlike quasi-normal modes the modes are not directly observable outside of $\sim 3 M$ but, being external to the horizon, they affect the propagation of null rays near the black hole. The characteristic frequencies, around 100 Hz for solar mass black holes, are discussed in relation to possible observations.
