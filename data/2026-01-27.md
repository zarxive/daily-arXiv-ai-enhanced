Abstract: The evolution of modal crosstalk in multimode fibers is investigated using four different experimental and numerical approaches. Results converge to demonstrate that the fiber disorder alone is capable of generating steady states characterized by non-uniform modal power distributions, which promote the lower-order modes at the expenses of the higher-order ones and are properly described by a weighted Bose-Einstein law.

TL;DR: This paper junctions a new method for pulse characterization using transformer neural networks, achieving accurate field retrieval with fewer measurements than traditional methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate characterization of electric fields is crucial for ultrafast applications, and this work addresses the need with a novel method.

Method: Remote dispersion scan with transformer neural networks is used for pulse characterization, combining local spectral phase analysis with linear and nonlinear processes.

Result: The method achieves comparable accuracy to full two-dimensional scans with just a single fundamental and second harmonic measurement.

Conclusion: The technique offers a simple, robust, and alignment-insensitive solution for real-time pulse reconstruction.

Abstract: Accurate and rapid characterization of broadband electric fields is essential for all ultrafast applications and remains an active field of research. In this work, we introduce remote dispersion scan, a transformer neural network enabled dispersion scan based pulse characterization method that can characterize femtosecond laser pulses. A local scan of the non-linear spectral phase before several linear and nonlinear processes, including amplification, compression, and self phase modulation, allows for the field retrieval remotely at the interaction region. We show that the reconstruction accuracy obtained from a single measurement of the fundamental and second harmonic is comparable to that of a full two dimensional scan. We confirm the technique experimentally by compressing a 300 W, 1.3 ps, 1030 nm pulse in a hollow core fiber to 100 fs and measuring the fundamental and second harmonic spectra while scanning the second order phase in a pulse shaper before power amplification. These results establish a simple, robust, alignment insensitive live-view pulse reconstruction modality.

Abstract: Optical chaotic synchronization between coupled nonlinear lasers underpins most chaos-based applications, including complex laser network dynamics, secure communication, key distribution, and reinforcement learning. In free-space links, however, chaotic synchronization is highly vulnerable to stochastic fluctuation induced by atmospheric turbulence, which results in temporal injection imbalances at symmetric receivers and triggers intermittent desynchronization. Here, we introduce a full Poincaré vector beam-enabled balanced-injection synchronization (BIS) mechanism, which passively mitigates coupling fluctuations and preserves injection symmetry through a complementary metasurface pair, without requiring any channel estimation or active control. Over a 3.2 km urban link under moderately strong turbulence, BIS suppresses coupling power fluctuations by a factor of 4.6 (from 0.4511 to 0.0975). It eliminates desynchronization events and increases the high-quality synchronization probability from 58.6% to 91.0%. This enables a record-high bit rate-distance product of 720 Gbps \cdot km, reducing communication interruption probability by up to 77% compared to Gaussian beam transmission. Our innovative strategy bridges the gap between nanophotonics and engineering optics, offering a new insight into advancing next-generation LiDAR, secure communication, and integrated sensing and communication systems in turbulent environments.

Abstract: A non-Hermitian system at an exceptional point (EP), a specific critical point (CP) associated with the parity-time symmetric phase transition, exhibits a sublinear response to perturbation and promise unprecedented sensitivity beyond the linear-response Hermitian sensors, so far operating at the diabolic points (DP). Despite great advancements, its sensitivity enhancement is fundamentally limited by the divergent Petermann factor, intrinsically rooted in the non-Hermitian eigenvector degeneracy, and practically by the system complexity. Here, we report the CP-resulting square-root response to the refractive index change and enhanced sensitivity in a simple chiral Hermitian cavity without phase transitions. Because of the inherent eigenvector orthogonality, this CP-based Hermitian sensor exhibits an EP-like response and enhanced sensitivity, breaking the Petermann-factor limit of sensitivity in non-Hermitian counterparts. This work paves the way towards exploring the Hermitian CPs for ultrasensitive sensing outperforming both the EP- and DP-based sensors.

Abstract: Circular dichroism (CD) sensing plays a pivotal role in probing molecular chirality in biomedical sciences. However, engineering superchiral electromagnetic fields that can reliably amplify the faint signatures of chiral analytes remains profoundly challenging. Central to this difficulty is the need to balance two competing demands: maximizing the enhancement of chiral fields while maintaining a sufficiently large interaction volume for effective molecular interrogation. Here, we introduce a figure of merit (FOM) that captures the enhancement and spatial coverage of superchiral fields to benchmark different chiral-field configurations. We examine the effects of helix-geometry evolution on the FOM, including 2D to 3D chirality induction, winding-number escalation, helical-order enhancement, and transverse dilation. By tuning these structural degrees of freedom, the sensing volume can be enlarged without compromising the distribution and enhancement strength of fields. The optimized triple-strand helix markedly enhanced the analyte CD signal, yielding a FOM of 2.43*10^10 nm3, which surpassed prior 2D and 3D configurations by over an order of magnitude. The proposed FOM exhibits a strong linear correlation (R^2 = 0.9256) with the analyte CD signal. Our findings provide a systematic design framework for 3D chiral structures and a robust metric for assessing their chiroptical sensing performance, particularly in scenarios involving clusters of randomly oriented small molecules or a large chiral molecule.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exploration of photonic time crystals offers potential for designing novel quantum systems and applications in quantum information processing.

Method: The authors conducted theoretical analysis using the Floquet Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework, supported by computational and experimental validation.

Result: Classical parameters like the Petermann factor determine quantum noise and squeezing properties, varying with momentum in the system.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for practical implementations of parametric amplifiers in quantum optics and related fields.

Abstract: Photonic time crystals realize a continuum of momentum-resolved SU(1,1) parametric amplifiers. We show that a classical quantity, the Petermann factor of the effective Floquet Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) dynamical matrix, sets the scale of their quantum noise. In stable bands it fixes the Bogoliubov mixing and the vacuum quasiparticle population, while in momentum gaps it sets the photon-number prefactor and enhances the squeezing dynamics, with the Floquet growth rate setting the time scale. This converts classical measurements of mode nonorthogonality into quantitative predictions for squeezing and photon generation, and offers a compact design parameter for engineering quantum resources in two-mode BdG platforms.

Abstract: The mid-infrared (MIR) spectral regime is central to applications including remote sensing, precision spectroscopy, higher harmonic generation, and free-space optical communication. However, coherent and broadband MIR modulation remains challenging owing to high optical loss, limited bandwidth, and large drive voltages in existing platforms. Here, we overcome these challenges by deploying a suspended thin-film lithium-niobate (TFLN) based electro-optic (EO) platform co-designed with high-performance traveling-wave microwave (MW) electrodes. We demonstrate a record-low Vpi,DC of 2.3 to 4.3 V over a broadband MIR bandwidth from 2.4 to 3.6 um, and a 2.7 dB EO bandwidth of 40 GHz (extracted 3 dB bandwidth of 50 GHz), yielding a figure of merit of 17.4 GHz/V, more than an order of magnitude higher than the state of the art. We demonstrate, for the first time, high-frequency Vpi,MW of 4.5 to 6.5 V in the 25 to 35 GHz range, and frequency-agile MIR EO frequency comb generation with a 10 dB optical bandwidth over 0.8 THz using a suspended phase modulator of 4 cm active modulation length. We further validate the platform in a free-space optical communication link. Our results establish a monolithic MIR photonic platform capable of powerful EO modulation and spectral synthesis, and represent a significant step toward reconfigurable MIR sensing and communication systems on chip.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other van der Waals semiconductors enable transfer-printed, lattice-mismatch--free stacking of many photovoltaic junctions (N), motivating a re-examination of multijunction detailed-balance limits under realistic material and optical constraints. Here we develop an unlimited-junction detailed-balance framework for split-spectrum, multi-terminal vdW multijunction solar cells and apply it to a conservative TMD bandgap window (1.0-2.1 eV). Dynamic-programming optimization shows that the accessible bandgap window imposes a large-N efficiency limit: under full concentration, unconstrained ladders approach 84.5% at N=50, whereas the TMD window plateaus near 63.4%. This plateau is set by photons outside the gaps, so radiative quality and optics dominate beyond five junctions for realistic transfer-printed stacks. We identify an experimentally achievable N=5 ladder Eg~(2.10,1.78,1.50,1.24,1.00) eV and map each rung to candidate vdW/TMD absorbers. Using reciprocity and luminescence thermodynamics, we quantify penalties from finite external radiative efficiency, two-sided emission, and luminescent coupling, and we introduce the upward-emitted luminescence power as a computable entropy-loss proxy. Incorporating excitonic absorptance and nanophotonic thickness bounds yields practical thickness and light-management targets for transfer-printed stacks. Finally, inserting an idealized nonreciprocal multijunction model into the reciprocity-optimized ladders provides conservative headroom estimates, consistent with negligible benefit for single junctions but measurable gains for multijunction TMD stacks.

Abstract: As the ability to integrate single photon emitters into photonic architectures improves, so does the need to characterize and understand their interaction. Here, we use a scanning diamond nanocrystal to investigate the interplay between the emission of room-temperature nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and a proximal topological waveguide. In our experiments, NVs serve as local, spectrally broad light sources which we exploit to characterize the waveguide bandwidth as well as the correspondence between light injection site and directionality of wave propagation. Further, we find that near-field coupling to the waveguide influences the spectral shape and ellipticity of the NV photoluminescence, hence allowing us to reveal nanostructured light fields with a spatial resolution defined by the nanoparticle size. Our results expand on the sensing modalities afforded by color centers, and portend novel opportunities in the development of on-chip, quantum optics devices leveraging topological photonics to best manipulate and readout single-photon emitters.

Abstract: We report on the first experimental realization of multi-material dielectric mirror coatings designed through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to simultaneously minimize thermal noise and optical losses. We validate this design strategy by fabricating and characterizing two distinct ternary systems: a SiNx -based proof-of-concept and a Ti:GeO2 -based system targeting lower optical losses. The performance of the SiN x coating shows remarkable agreement with predictions, demonstrating a noise amplitude spectral density reduction of 0.82 with respect to current reference coatings, and validating our design-to-fabrication pipeline. The Ti:GeO2 -based system achieves the crucial goal of sub-ppm absorption; its measured thermal noise, however, is higher than the theoretically predicted level of 0.71, extrapolated from single-layer material characterization. A dedicated tolerance analysis confirms that this discrepancy is not attributable to random thickness errors, emphasizing that further studies of the manufacturing process are needed to fully exploit this combination of materials. This work establishes a robust methodology for producing complex, high-performance optical coatings tailored for precision experiments.

### [11] [Dual Flat-Bands of Bound State in the Continuum and Radiative Mode via TE-TM Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17653)
*Jiayao Liu,Zimeng Zeng,Zhuoyang Li,Zelong He,Zhaona Wang*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A symmetry-controlled mechanism in photonic crystal slabs enables the creation of dual flat-bands supporting bound states in the continuum with high angular bandwidths, offering a robust platform for angle-tolerant photonic functionalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores symmetry-controlled mechanisms in photonic materials to achieve specific optical functionalities, such as bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are desired for various applications in photonics.

Method: The researchers propose a mechanism involving breaking vertical mirror symmetry in photonic crystal slabs. By activating inter-polarization coupling between TE-like and TM-like modes while preserving intra-polarization couplings, they achieve dual flat-bands. They construct an effective two-step coupling model to analyze the mechanism, showing that the flat bands emerge due to geometric tuning.

Result: The mechanism allows for the simultaneous flattening of both the BIC-hosting band and the radiative band, creating a dual flat-band system with contrasting quality factors. The mechanism is shown to be generic with respect to polarization and material platforms, enabling dual flat-band states in both low- and high-index systems, with enhanced angular bandwidths in high-index systems.

Conclusion: This symmetry-controlled mechanism provides a unified route for designing flat-band photonic states, offering a foundation for advancing angle-tolerant photonic functionalities in photonic crystals.

Abstract: A general symmetry-controlled mechanism is proposed for realizing dual flat-bands of bound state in the continuum (BIC) and its radiative counterpart in photonic crystal slabs. By breaking the vertical mirror symmetry of slab, inter-polarization coupling between TE-like and TM-like modes is activated, while intra-polarization coupling among modes within the same polarization class is simultaneously preserved. The cooperative action of these two coupling channels gives rise to the concurrent flattening of both the BIC-hosting band and the radiative band, resulting in a dual flat-band system with strongly contrasting quality (Q) factors. An effective two-step coupling model is constructed to capture the essential physics and show that the emergence of the flat bands is governed by geometric tuning rather than accidental degeneracies. The mechanism is shown to be generic with respect to polarization and material platform, enabling dual flat-band states in both low- and high-index systems, with substantially enhanced angular bandwidths in the latter. These finding establish a unified route for flat-band photonic engineering and provide a robust platform for angle-tolerant resonant photonic functionalities.

TL;DR: We developed a physics-integrated inference framework to improve room-temperature sensitivity in spintronic devices by reducing noise equivalent differential temperature by a factor of six.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving high-performance room-temperature sensing in spintronic devices is crucial for various applications, but non-stationary 1/f fluctuations and non-Gaussian stochasticity often limit sensitivity. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel framework that enhances sensitivity by a significant margin.

Method: Our method involves a hierarchical 1D CNN-GRU topology integrated with physical models of thermally activated Néel switching. This architecture allows us to decouple signal morphology from stochastic transients, effectively mitigating noise and improving detection limits.

Result: Our framework successfully reduces NEDT by a factor of six, demonstrating a significant improvement in room-temperature sensitivity toward cryogenic limits. Additionally, we show the framework's versatility across different domains, achieving substantial reductions in noise-related uncertainties and enhancing signal detection in noisy environments.

Conclusion: This work represents a substantial advancement in the field of room-temperature sensing, offering a robust solution to the challenges posed by non-Gaussian noise and non-stationary fluctuations. The integration of physical models with advanced machine learning architectures opens new possibilities for noise mitigation in various sensing applications.

Abstract: High-performance room-temperature sensing is often limited by non-stationary $1/f$ fluctuations and non-Gaussian stochasticity. In spintronic devices, thermally activated Néel switching creates heavy-tailed noise that masks weak signals, defeating linear filters optimized for Gaussian statistics. Here, we introduce a physics-integrated inference framework that decouples signal morphology from stochastic transients using a hierarchical 1D CNN-GRU topology. By learning the temporal signatures of Néel relaxation, this architecture reduces the Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT) of spintronic Poisson bolometers by a factor of six (233.78 mK to 40.44 mK), effectively elevating room-temperature sensitivity toward cryogenic limits. We demonstrate the framework's universality across the electromagnetic and biological spectrum, achieving a 9-fold error suppression in Radar tracking, a 40\% uncertainty reduction in LiDAR, and a 15.56 dB SNR enhancement in ECG. This hardware-inference coupling recovers deterministic signals from fluctuation-dominated regimes, enabling near-ideal detection limits in noisy edge environments.

Conclusion: 该框架为电磁频段的高通量、低剂量消影摄影提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Ptychography spans from sub-angstrom to meter scales yet suffers from convergence instability and excessive data redundancy. Here we introduce self-correcting residual neural fields as a dose-efficient framework for electron, X-ray, and optical ptychography. Unlike approaches that split complex fields, our complex-valued architecture employs holomorphic phasor activation e^iωz to preserve intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling. We reformulate reconstruction as residual learning, where the network learns only corrections to physical priors rather than complete wavefields. By embedding the physical model as a differentiable layer within the network, we enable end-to-end automatic differentiation where experimental parameters are jointly corrected alongside the neural fields. We validate our scheme across conventional, near-field, coded, and Fourier ptychography and achieve record-breaking lensless resolution of 244-nm linewidth with visible light. Extending to electron wavelengths, we reveal synaptic connectivity in brain sections with superior performance over conventional approaches. Our framework provides a solution for high-throughput, dose-efficient nanoscopy across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Abstract: Event-based vision provides high-speed, energy-efficient sensing for applications such as autonomous navigation and motion tracking. However, implementing this technology in the long-wave infrared remains a significant challenge. Traditional infrared sensors are hindered by slow thermal response times or the heavy power requirements of cryogenic cooling. Here, we introduce the first event-based infrared detector operating in a Poisson-counting regime. This is realized with a spintronic Poisson bolometer capable of broadband detection from 0.8-14$μ\text{m}$. In this regime, infrared signals are detected through statistically resolvable changes in stochastic switching events. This approach enables room-temperature operation with high timing resolution. Our device achieves a maximum event rate of 1,250 Hz, surpassing the temporal resolution of conventional uncooled microbolometers by a factor of 4. Power consumption is kept low at 0.2$μ$W per pixel. This work establishes an operating principle for infrared sensing and demonstrates a pathway toward high-speed, energy-efficient, event-driven thermal imaging.

TL;DR: We experimentally demonstrated a topological antilaser that maintains near-unity absorption under disorder, unlike conventional antilasers, and remains functional regardless of where dissipation is placed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding topological protection in optical systems, especially absorption, is crucial for robust energy dissipation and wave control.

Method: Utilized a nonreciprocal microwave network with low loss to demonstrate the topological antilaser's functionality under strong disorder.

Result: The antilaser showed stable performance with disorder, enabling topologically protected absorption which was previously unknown.

Conclusion: The discovery validates the concept of topological antilaser and opens new possibilities in coherent absorption-based technologies for dissipation and detection.

Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA)-the time-reversed operation of lasing at threshold-relies on finely tuned interference and is intrinsically fragile to disorder and structural imperfections. Whether absorption can be endowed with topological protection, by analogy to topological lasing, has remained an open question. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a topological antilaser: the time-reversed counterpart of a topological laser, in which chiral edge modes of a photonic lattice enable perfect light absorption protected by topology. Using a nonreciprocal microwave network with low intrinsic loss, we show that the topological antilaser preserves near-unity absorption under strong disorder, and, unlike conventional antilasers, remains functional for arbitrary placements of dissipation and input ports, even when the lattice is strongly perturbed. This robustness arises from the disorder-immune propagation and stable spatial profile of the topological edge modes. Our results establish topologically protected absorption as the missing counterpart of topological lasing, opening new directions for studying robust energy dissipation, wave control, and coherent-absorption-based detection technologies.

Abstract: Diffractive neural network (DNN), which can perform machine learning tasks based on the light propagation and diffraction, has recently emerged as a promising optical computing paradigm due to its high parallel processing speed and low power consumption nature. However, existing diffractive network architectures face challenges in implementing functional reconfiguration. Once a diffractive neural network is fabricated, its functionality is fixed. Deploying such systems for different tasks typically requires reconstructing the entire physical setup, which significantly compromises hardware efficiency in practical applications. In this work, we propose the multifunctional partitionable diffractive neural networks (PDNNs) that can generate networks with additional capabilities by stacking multiple sub-modules with independent functions in the horizontal direction. Each submodule functions as an independent diffractive network capable of performing specific imaging or classification tasks. When these submodules are combined, they can form a new network with additional functionalities. Moreover, assembling these submodules in different configurations enables structures with diverse functions. This powerful PDNN framework demonstrates remarkable advantages in flexibility and reconfigurability for multitask operations, opening a new pathway for realizing multifunctional and integrated optical artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Extended Self-Similarity (ESS) is a widely used tool for uncovering universal power-law scaling in systems dominated by nonlinear interactions. This work demonstrates that ESS scaling can also emerge in a system governed by purely linear physics: the propagation of coherent light in a multimode fiber. The system produces complex speckle patterns arising solely from deterministic linear mode interference. We analyze the intensity structure functions of these speckles and observe a robust extended scaling range. The measured scaling exponents align with the classical Kolmogorov scaling exponents. This finding establishes that the statistical signatures captured by ESS are not exclusive to nonlinear systems, revealing a broader applicability of this scaling framework to complex linear systems.

Abstract: High-resolution lithographic techniques are often limited by low volumetric throughput, since there is no universal and scalable manufacturing process that can produce 3D metasurfaces. In this work, we demonstrate a high-speed holographic 3D printing platform based on spatiotemporal beam shaping, exceeding the repetition rate while keeping the resolution high. The system integrates a femtosecond laser source with a spectral pulse compressor and a beam shaper to project uniform, axially confined light fields to project patterns directly on the advanced photoresists using a Digital Micromirror Device DMD. We investigate the process window for rapid polymerization, optimizing the photoinitiator choice to eliminate thermal crosstalk at high repetition rates. Using this setup, we achieve a production throughput of more than a million voxels per second with sub-micron resolution below 400 nm. The system's reliability is validated through the fabrication of large-area woodpile-like lattices and uniform micropillar arrays, establishing a workflow for scalable manufacturing of micro-optical components.

Abstract: Non-degenerate two-photon absorption (NTA) offers an attractive route for wide-field mid-infrared (MIR) imaging by mapping long wavelength information into the spectral detection windows of mature near-infrared detector technologies. However, existing NTA implementations rely almost exclusively on complex, large-footprint femtosecond laser systems, severely limiting practicality and scalability. Here, we demonstrate an NTA imaging platform that replaces the ultrafast laser with a compact nanosecond mid-IR source coupled to a high-definition indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) camera. Operating in the nanosecond regime removes stringent temporal-overlap requirements, dramatically simplifying system architecture while preserving high nonlinear sensitivity. Using this approach, we achieve chemically selective, wide-field imaging deep into the mid-IR molecular fingerprint region and demonstrate, for the first time, video-rate NTA imaging in this spectrally rich regime. By combining relaxed alignment constraints, compact excitation, and high-speed fingerprint-region imaging, this work establishes nanosecond NTA as a practical and scalable foundation for next-generation mid-IR chemical imaging.

Abstract: We present a method for implementing an optical neural network using only linear optical resources, namely field displacement and interferometry applied to coherent states of light. The nonlinearity required for learning in a neural network is realized via an encoding of the input into phase shifts allowing for far more straightforward experimental implementation compared to previous proposals for, and demonstrations of, $\textit{in situ}$ inference. Beyond $\textit{in situ}$ inference, the method enables $\textit{in situ}$ training by utilizing established techniques like parameter shift rules or physical backpropagation to extract gradients directly from measurements of the linear optical circuit. We also investigate the effect of photon losses and find the model to be very resilient to these.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop energy-efficient photonic systems that can emulate complex dynamic processes typically requiring high-speed, continuous modulation.

Method: They used ultrafast pulse modulation and tailored the system's properties through dispersion engineering in metasurfaces.

Result: This method allows for nonreciprocal light behavior, which could be applied in optical computing and signal processing.

Conclusion: This approach avoids the energy and rate challenges of traditional methods, opening new possibilities for dynamic photonic systems.

Abstract: Time-varying photonic systems open new possibilities for controlling light, enabling photonic time crystals, time reflection and refraction, frequency conversion, synthetic gauge fields, optical nonreciprocity, among others. These effects emerge from the dynamic modulation of optical properties, which can mediate photonic transitions between eigenstates of different frequencies and/or wavevectors. To achieve such transitions, conventional approaches rely on periodic modulation schemes that demand ultrafast modulation rates and continuous energy input, posing significant practical challenges at optical frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that periodic-modulation-driven photonic transitions within the radiation continuum can be effectively mimicked using a single-period ultrafast pulse modulation, eliminating the need for sustained continuous modulation. By leveraging dispersion engineering in metasurfaces to tailor the density of states in the radiation continuum, we achieve controlled frequency transitions and theoretically demonstrate strong nonreciprocity for free-space waves as a key application. Our findings may guide future experimental research on time-varying photonics using materials such as transparent conductive oxides and semiconductors, expanding the possibilities for ultrafast and reconfigurable optical technologies. More broadly, our work may establish a practical and energy-efficient framework for dynamic photonic systems, with potential applications ranging from spatio-temporal wavefront manipulation to photonic computing and ultrafast signal processing.

Abstract: In neural-network surrogate solvers for electromagnetic simulations, accurately modeling resonant phenomena remains a central challenge. High-amplitude resonances generate strongly localized field patterns that appear as outlier samples, deviating significantly from the general distribution of non-resonant cases, leading to instability and degraded predictive performance. To address this, we introduce dissipative relaxation transfer learning (DIRTL), a data-efficient training framework that integrates transfer learning with loss-regularized optimization principles from high-Q photonics. DIRTL first pretrains the model on data generated with a small fictitious material loss, which broadens sharp resonant modes and suppresses extreme field amplitudes. This smoothing of the response landscape enables the model to learn global modal features more effectively. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned on the target lossless dataset containing the true high-amplitude resonances, allowing stable adaptation based on the pretrained information. Applied to both the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and UNet architectures, DIRTL yields substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, including up to a two-fold error reduction for the FNO variant. Furthermore, DIRTL exhibits robustness across diverse training conditions and supports strong multi-task performance, underscoring the generalizability and flexibility of the pretrained core. Altogether, these results establish DIRTL as a physically grounded and architecture-agnostic curriculum for enhancing the reliability of machine-learning-based electromagnetic surrogate solvers.

Abstract: To address the difficulty of characterizing the surface layer rigorously, especially the thickness and refractive index (RI) in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, we propose a field-weighted analysis method. This approach enables simultaneous quantitative determination of RI for the bulk solution and the surface layer. This study utilizes the aluminum-based Kretschmann structure with the intensity interrogation technique. We construct the field-weighted model governed by the evanescent field penetration depth to decompose the SPR reflected intensity into the bulk and surface responses. Experiments are conducted using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution to form a surface adsorbed protein layer, and different concentrations of BSA are tested. Results show that the separated surface response fits well with the Langmuir formula, representing a significant improvement over the untreated SPR signal. The bulk and surface responses are then incorporated into the field-weighted model to determine the RI values of the bulk BSA solution and the surface adsorbed BSA layer at various concentrations. The experimental results of BSA solution match the Abbe refractometer measurements with a maximum error 0.0004 in RI, while the results of the adsorbed BSA layer, both the RI and thickness, aligned well with reported parameters for a single BSA layer. This method eliminates the stage rotation in the common angular interrogation SPR technique and complicated optical design and nano-fabrication in the nano-optics sensing schemes, making it suitable for compact, low-cost SPR platforms for practical applications needing surface layer characterization.

Abstract: High-power narrow-linewidth fiber lasers are fundamentally limited by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), which constrains further power scaling while maintaining spectral linewidth. Traditional mitigation techniques, such as active phase modulation, often introduce trade-offs among complexity, cost, and spectral brightness. In this study, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel all-optical approach for spectral linewidth manipulation and SBS suppression using optical phase conjugation (OPC). By leveraging nonlinear spectral broadening followed by phase conjugation, this method enables sophisticated linewidth narrowing in fiber amplifier, resulting in narrow linewidth output and enhanced SBS threshold. Using a low-cost fiber oscillator as the seed source, we achieve a spectral compression ratio exceeding 3 times. This method not only eliminates the need for complex electro-optic modulation systems but also provides a pathway toward simpler, high-brightness fiber laser systems. Our findings underscore the viability of OPC as a transformative tool for nonlinearity management and power scaling in high-performance fiber laser architectures.

Abstract: This computational study investigates lateral optical forces in asymmetric dielectric nanostructures, focusing on their connection to resonant light-matter interactions. We examine isosceles triangular motifs that exhibit two distinct types of optical force response under plane wave illumination. Through parameter-space analysis, we identify stable zones where optical forces remain consistent and switching bands where forces change abruptly as parameters are altered. The observed force spectra show characteristic asymmetric lineshapes, suggesting Fano-resonance behavior. Eigenfrequency analysis confirms these effects arise from interference between discrete eigenmodes and continuum propagation states, with the eigenmode Q-factors correlating with transition sharpness. These findings provide insights into how structural geometry influences optical forces through resonant effects, offering guidance for designing optically-driven systems where controlled optical force responses are desired.

Abstract: Self-organizations of ordered patterns in far-from-equilibrium many-body systems host fundamental importance in many disciplines. Meanwhile, complex systems often feature hierarchical structures with distinct scales for different layers, enabling high-level effective dynamics without exhaustive tracking of all possible degrees of freedoms. In this work, we report a study of the self-organization dynamics of highly-ordered soliton ensembles in a high-harmonic mode-locked fiber lasers through collective motions driven by nonlocal optomechanical interactions and local collisions, which exhibit a series of universal characteristics reminiscent of phase transitions. Moreover, the multi-soliton laser-field can be coarsely grained as a granular ensemble of limit-cycle oscillators with simple interaction rules derived from fine-scale physics. The self-organization of the multitude of solitons in the mode-locked laser cavity can then be mapped into a low-dimensional dynamic model that essentially reproduced the emergent process. Our work affords a conceptual framework for understanding the complex structure formation in nonlinear laser systems, and may help to design ultrafast lasers by exploiting universal principles of collective motions.

TL;DR:  paper discusses a method to narrow intrinsic laser linewidths using external optical feedback and surface radiation in waveguides. Experiments show a 1.5kHz linewidth improvement in a hybrid integrated laser compared to single-mode fibers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  lasers with narrow linewidths are useful for applications like optical clocks and coherent light sources, but achieving these is challenging with integrated optical fibers due to length requirements. This paper proposes an alternative approach using surface radiation in waveguides.

Method:  the researchers designed an integrated scheme that utilizes distributed feedback, specifically surface radiation in a silicon waveguide. They performed numerical analysis by introducing a collection coefficient to optimize waveguide width for feedback signal amplification. Experimental results were obtained using optical frequency-domain reflectometry.

Result:  successful demonstration of a hybrid integrated laser with 1.52 kHz intrinsic linewidth, 74.71 dB side-mode suppression ratio, and 24.44 Hz2/Hz frequency noise. The linewidth narrowing ratio is insensitive to wavelength within a 2.342 nm tuning range.

Conclusion:  This study presents a feasible solution to the challenge of integrating narrow linewidth lasers using surface radiation in waveguides, offering advantages over traditional optical fibers in terms of integration and performance.

Abstract: External optical feedback via Rayleigh scattering from an integrated microresonator or an optical fiber has been demonstrated to significantly narrow the intrinsic linewidth of semiconductor lasers. Wavelength matching between the lasing cavity and the external high-Q microresonator is required to accumulate Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback. Optical fiber can provide Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback for any lasing wavelength. However, optical fibers hundreds of meters or even kilometers long are required for the accumulation of Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback, hindering the integration of narrow linewidth lasers. Here, we present an integrated scheme that collects distributed feedback signal with weak wavelength dependence by exploiting surface radiation in a silicon waveguide. The effects of waveguide width on the intensities of the surface radiation and distributed optical feedback signal are first numerically analyzed by introducing a collection coefficient. Numerical calculations show that a 1 μm-wide strip waveguide yields optimal performance for excitation and collection of distributed optical feedback, which is also experimentally verified by measuring the feedback signal with an optical frequency-domain reflectometry. Benefitting from the enhanced distributed optical feedback that is 34.72 dB higher than that in a single-mode fiber, the hybrid integrated laser demonstrates an intrinsic linewidth of 1.52 kHz, a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 74.71 dB, and a frequency noise of 24.44 Hz2/Hz. Furthermore, within a maximum allowable wavelength tuning range of 2.342 nm, the linewidth narrowing ratio depends little on the wavelength for all the waveguides with different widths.

Abstract: This work demonstrates a broadband tunable narrow-linewidth laser based on scattering-enhanced fiber, covering the E-S-C-L wavelength bands from 1337.47 nm to 1631.39 nm, with a total tuning span of 293.92 nm. The laser employs two semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) centered at 1420 nm and 1550 nm, which are connected into a single ring resonator via polarization multiplexing. Wavelength selection and tunability is realized using an ultra-broadband tunable filter based on a blazed grating. To suppress side longitude modes, an 18-meter-long femtosecond-laser-empowered random scattering fiber is utilized inside the cavity as a feedback medium, yielding an output linewidths between 1.54 kHz and 2.61 kHz. Benefited from the fast response of the galvanometer mirror and short relaxation time of SOAs, wavelength switching time is less than 1 ms under different tuning channels among the wavelength range of near 300 nm. The stable single-longitude-mode operation is maintained across the entire tuning range. The exceptionally broad tuning range and high spectral purity of the laser endow it with significant application potentials across a wide range of fields.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the Berry phase mechanism and its applications in various physical systems is crucial.

Method: Theoretical analysis of plasma dynamics and spin evolution, combined with experimental demonstration in a moving plasma.

Result: The discovery of spin-redirection Berry phase along planar rays and its relation to finite transverse spin.

Conclusion: New possibilities for exploring Spin-Orbit Interaction (SOI) in different media and applications in light control.

Abstract: Geometric or Berry phases are fundamental manifestations that appear in many areas of physics. They arise from the geometry of the space describing the properties of multi-component wave fields. An important example for electromagnetic waves is the spin-redirection Berry phase associated with the evolution of the spin direction. Because this effect has traditionally been studied in isotropic media where the spin is aligned with the ray trajectory, it has become commonly assumed that this spin-redirection Berry phase requires nonplanar rays. Here we show that a spin-redirection phase can in fact arise along a planar ray if the spin evolves along the ray. We expose this effect through the singular example of a moving unmagnetized plasma, and demonstrate how this behavior can more generally arise from a finite transverse spin. In identifying this new spin-redirection mechanism our work not only provides the tools to discover additional manifestations of SOIs in nature, but also uncovers supplemental degrees of freedom to harness SOIs to control light.

Abstract: Genuine quantum interference between independent nonlinear processes of different order provides a route to coherent control that cannot be reduced to a classical field interference. Here we present an all-optical analogue of coherent carrier injection by exploiting interference between second- and third-order quantum nonlinear processes in an integrated photonic platform. Photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing coherently contribute to the same final two-photon state, resulting in a phase-dependent modulation of both the generation rate and the spectral structure of the emitted biphoton state. We illustrate the features of such interference and how it can be used to shape biphoton wavefunctions and their quantum correlations. These results identify interference between nonlinear processes of different order as a distinct form of coherent quantum control within quantum nonlinear optics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to leverage partially coherent light's advantages, such as improved security in optical communications, by developing scalable on-chip processing platforms.

Method: They use a hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers to control coherence rank, tune field entropy, and reconstruct coherence matrices by measuring modal Stokes parameters.

Result: The setup successfully manipulates and reconstructs four-mode partially coherent light, validating the scalability of 2x2 on-chip building blocks for high-dimensional coherence matrices.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for large-scale, stable, and efficient processing of complex optical states for advanced information processing tasks.

Abstract: Partially coherent light offers salutary capabilities in optical information processing that cannot be matched by coherent light. To date, this `coherence advantage' has been confirmed in proof-of-principle optical communications protocols using bulk optics. Taking full advantage of such opportunities necessitates processing multimode partially coherent light in integrated photonics platforms that alone provide the requisite stability for cascaded operations on a large scale. Here we demonstrate on-chip manipulation of four-mode partially coherent light described by a $4\times4$ Hermitian coherence matrix. Starting with generic maximally incoherent light, we utilize an on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform all the unitary and non-unitary tasks that are critical for realizing structured coherence: controlling the coherence rank (the number of non-zero eigenvalues of the coherence matrix); tuning the field entropy; molding the structure of the coherence matrix via $4\times4$ unitary transformations constructed out of sequences of $2\times2$ unitaries acting on pairs of modes; and tomographic reconstruction of the coherence matrix by measuring the modal Stokes parameters associated with Kronecker Pauli matrices. These results confirm the scalability of utilizing $2\times2$ on-chip building blocks for the synthesis and reconstruction of high-dimensional coherence matrices, and provide a decisive step towards large-scale on-chip manipulation of massively moded partially coherent light for applications in optical information processing.

### [36] [Finite-scale geometric invariants for chaotic and weakly chaotic dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17370)
*Vinesh Vijayan*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: We introduce a finite scale geometric observable that quantifies the growth rate of localized sets under time evolution in dissipative dynamical systems. This observable converges, in uniformly hyperbolic systems, to a resolution dependent plateau whose logarithmic scaling coefficient equals the Kolmogorov Sinai entropy. In merely hyperbolic systems, it decays to zero, reflecting the absence of entropy production, while remaining well defined at finite scales. Numerical results for the Henon map and Feigenbaum point illustrate these behaviors. Our findings yield a finite scale geometric characterization of chaotic dynamics, consistent with classical entropy theory where applicable. We further demonstrate that the observable remains well defined in open intermittent systems, where trajectories escape and classical asymptotic invariants fail, revealing finite scale signatures of transient weak chaos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is likely driven by the need to understand and characterize chaotic dynamics in dissipative systems. The Kolmogorov Sinai entropy is a fundamental concept in dynamical systems theory, and the ability to measure the growth rate of localized sets under time evolution provides a geometric characterization of entropy production.

Method: The method described in the paper involves the introduction of a finite scale geometric observable that quantifies the growth rate of localized sets. The observable is defined at finite time and resolution without reference to symbolic dynamics or Markov partitions. The analysis is carried out in uniformly hyperbolic systems, where the observable converges to a resolution-dependent plateau. The decay of the observable in merely hyperbolic systems is explained in terms of the absence of entropy production. The paper also demonstrates that the observable remains well-defined in open intermittent systems, where classical asymptotic invariants fail.

Result: The results of the paper show that in uniformly hyperbolic systems, the introduced observable converges to a resolution-dependent plateau, with the logarithmic scaling coefficient equal to the Kolmogorov Sinai entropy. In merely hyperbolic systems, the observable decays to zero, reflecting the absence of entropy production. Numerical results for the Henon map and Feigenbaum point support these findings. Furthermore, the observable is shown to remain well-defined in open intermittent systems, revealing finite scale signatures of transient weak chaos.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel finite scale geometric observable for quantifying the growth rate of localized sets in dissipative dynamical systems. The observable provides a consistent geometric characterization of chaotic dynamics in both uniformly hyperbolic and merely hyperbolic systems, aligning with classical entropy theory in applicable cases. Additionally, the finite scale nature of the observable extends its applicability to open intermittent systems, offering insights into transient weak chaos where classical asymptotic invariants are insufficient.

Abstract: Contradictory experimental reports on the relationship between efficiency and stimulation frequency have hindered mechanistic understanding in converting neural activity into mechanical work during muscle contraction. To resolve this issue, we develop a biophysical model integrating calcium-mediated excitation with a detailed cross-bridge cycle to enable single-fiber simulations. Our model demonstrates that shortening velocity is the primary determinant of cross-bridge efficiency: efficiency peaks at an optimal velocity and declines at higher or lower velocities, while frequency exerts secondary influence. Critically, the velocity yielding peak efficiency remains consistent across frequencies, with a slight upward shift at higher frequencies. Elevated inorganic phosphate ([Pi]) appears to amplify the efficiency disparity between high- and low-frequency regimes in our analysis. Our work suggests that stimulation frequency modulates efficiency predominantly through its regulation of shortening velocity, which primarily governs the kinetics of the myosin power stroke. This work may help clarify neural control of muscle energetics, and provide a quantitative foundation for studying muscle function in physiological and pathological contexts.

Abstract: Cell motility underlies many biological processes, including cancer metastasis, bacterial infection, and evolutionary adaptation. We introduce a non-equilibrium single-cell motility model inspired by the generalized Langevin equation, which accounts for hydrodynamic friction and correlated propulsion force. From video microscopy of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae and Salmonella typhimurium bacteria we extract the propulsion-force dynamics on the single-cell level, which we find to exhibit multi-exponential correlations, not captured by literature non-equilibrium cell-motility models. Based on our data-driven model, we predict the effective cell diffusivities beyond experimentally resolved timescales and demonstrate a diffusivity maximum at intermediate solvent viscosity for both cell types. This means that cells adapt their propulsion-force characteristics according to the solvent viscosity. In addition, our model predicts the power output of single cells, which is on the order of aW for the salmonella and fW for the algae.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime and signal pile-up, leading to systematic inefficiencies in conventional coincidence-based trigger systems. Such triggers typically rely on binary temporal windows and assume continuous sensor availability, causing partial or complete loss of correlated signal information during non-live intervals. We introduce Recursive Manifold Coherence (RMC), a geometric framework that reformulates distributed trigger logic as a continuous state estimation problem in a low-dimensional information space defined by correlated charge and timing observables. Instead of applying hard vetoes during deadtime, the proposed method employs a recursive update rule that propagates a coherence state across sensor nodes, allowing partially obscured signals to be retained and evaluated consistently. Using simulation studies representative of large optical detector arrays, we demonstrate that RMC successfully recovers event-level coherence for high-multiplicity topologies even when direct coincidence chains are broken. By treating the detector response as a smooth manifold rather than discrete hits, the framework achieves superior robustness against data fragmentation compared to standard binary logic. The framework is detector-agnostic and compatible with software-defined trigger pipelines, providing a flexible foundation for deadtime-aware analysis and triggering strategies in future distributed detector systems.

Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) Phase-II Far Detector is considering an unprecedentedly large-area ~2000 m$^2$ photon detection system to achieve a target mean light yield of 180 PE/MeV. Meeting this requirement demands scalable, cost-effective, and high-quality wavelength-shifter (WLS) coatings capable of converting 127 nm liquid-argon scintillation light into visible photons with high efficiency. We report on the successful realization of an industrial physical vapor deposition (PVD) process for \textit{p}-terphenyl (pTP) coatings, adapted from vacuum deposition techniques developed for OLED display manufacturing, to produce uniform WLS layers on large-area inorganic substrates, a task traditionally challenged by adhesion and uniformity issues at organic--inorganic interfaces. Surface characterization by profilometry and spectroscopic measurements confirms sub-10% thickness uniformity for 1-2 $μ$m films and emission spectra consistent with high-quality pTP reference samples. The industrial process demonstrates reproducibility, scalability, and significantly reduced production time compared to laboratory-based methods, while maintaining the optical quality required for large-scale liquid-argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) photon detection systems. These results establish a viable pathway for mass production of high-performance pTP coatings for DUNE FD3 and future neutrino experiments.

Abstract: Water Cherenkov detectors offer a robust and economical solution for real-time radiation monitoring by detecting Cherenkov light from charged particles moving faster than light in water. This work presents a novel two-stage classification framework for gamma-neutron discrimination: an initial physics-based energy threshold filters unambiguous low-energy gamma sources, followed by a machine learning ensemble that resolves ambiguities at higher energies. The detector response was characterized using $^{60}$Co (1.17/1.33~MeV), $^{137}$Cs (0.66~MeV), and a shielded $^{241}$AmBe source, with lead, paraffin, and cadmium shielding employed to isolate neutron and gamma interactions. Energy calibration established a linear ADU to MeV conversion ($R^2 = 0.966$), enabling identification of a neutron detection threshold at $2.62 \pm 0.77$~MeV via a $3σ$ significance analysis. Stage one categorizes sources as pure gamma (below threshold) or neutron-emitting (at threshold). For ambiguous cases above threshold, a machine learning pipeline utilizing pulse shape analysis was developed. A soft voting ensemble (Bagging, CatBoost, and MLP) achieved an accuracy of 0.816 and an AUC of 0.921. This hybrid scheme combines physics-based filtering with ML refinement, offering an interpretable and scalable solution for nuclear security, nonproliferation monitoring, and fundamental radiation research.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The study assesses the depolarization of the HJET at the EIC due to the EIC beam's time-dependent magnetic field and finds it negligible, well below 0.01%, regardless of beam parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the planned upgrades at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), such as increased beam current and shorter bunch length, which necessitate a reassessment of possible beam-induced depolarization.

Method: The research employs a four-level hyperfine system model for hydrogen atoms in a magnetic field, evaluates the effects of harmonic constituents of the bunch-induced magnetic field through time-dependent quantum-mechanical simulations specific to the beam region, and employs nominal EIC beam parameters in these models.

Result: Results indicate that the depolarization of the hydrogen jet target caused by the EIC beam is negligible, at or below 0.01%, which is well within the accuracy requirements for EIC.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the depolarization effect is sufficiently insignificant to not impact the EIC's beam polarization studies, emphasizing the importance of such studies in ensuring the reliability of the EIC's scientific outcomes.

Abstract: The Polarized Atomic Hydrogen Gas Jet Target (HJET) has played a central role in the absolute calibration of proton beam polarization at RHIC and is foreseen as a key element of the hadron polarimetry program at the future Electron--Ion Collider (EIC). The substantially higher beam current, reduced bunch spacing, and shorter bunch length planned for EIC operation motivate a careful reassessment of possible beam-induced depolarization of the jet target. In this paper, the depolarization of ground-state hydrogen atoms caused by the time-dependent magnetic field of the circulating polarized proton beam is quantitatively evaluated. The hydrogen atom is treated as a four-level hyperfine system in a holding magnetic field, and transitions driven by harmonic components of the bunch-induced magnetic field are analyzed using time-dependent quantum-mechanical evolution along atomic trajectories. Numerical tracking of hydrogen atoms through the beam region is performed using nominal EIC beam parameters. It is shown that, for a holding field of $120\,\mathrm{mT}$ (as used at RHIC), the resulting depolarization of the jet target at the EIC is negligibly small, $\lesssim 0.01\%$, and well below the level relevant for EIC polarization accuracy requirements. The stability of this result with respect to plausible variations of the EIC proton beam parameters is also evaluated.

TL;DR: Ce-doped silica scintillating fibers are used as external fiber monitors (EFMs) in low-energy medical cyclotrons to detect secondary radiation. The EFM shows linear dependence on beam intensity, scaled beam loss, and decoupled sensitivity to horizontal and vertical beam displacements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-destructive beam monitoring is crucial for maintaining beam quality in cyclotrons, particularly in low-energy medical setups. The development of EFM technology provides a reliable method for monitoring secondary radiation without interfering with beam operation.

Method: CE-doped silica scintillating fibers are attached externally to cyclotron components, capturing secondary radiation. Three use cases are studied: beam intensity monitoring near disabled beam dumps, beam loss monitoring around a collimator, and beam displacement monitoring using opposing fiber ratios.

Result: The EFM provides a robust and accurate monitoring system, showing linear and monotonic relationships for intensity, beam loss, and decoupled sensitivity to beam displacements.

Conclusion: This paper presents a successful implementation of external fiber monitors for monitoring secondary radiation in cyclotrons, with promising results for maintaining beam quality in medical applications.

Abstract: Non-destructive beam diagnostics are essential for low-energy medical cyclotrons, where even thin interceptive devices can severely degrade beam quality. We investigate an external fiber monitor (EFM) based on Ce-doped silica scintillating fibers that detects secondary radiation generated at existing beamline components of the 18 MeV Bern Medical Cyclotron beam transfer line (BTL). Three use cases were studied: (i) beam intensity monitoring around an electrically isolated, water-cooled beam dump; (ii) beam-loss monitoring around a 10 mm collimator under varying the beam focusing; and (iii) by steering a 6.5 mm $\times$ 6.5 mm beam spot on a beam dump. For case (i), the summed EFM signal exhibits a linear dependence on the current on target over nearly three orders of magnitude. In case (ii), a normalized EFM-based beam-loss proxy scales monotonically with an electrical loss proxy across several focusing settings. Furthermore, opposing-fiber signal ratios provide decoupled, monotonic sensitivity to horizontal and vertical beam displacements.

Motivation: The development of efficient and reliable scintillators is crucial for applications in medical and industrial settings, particularly where detection of gamma rays and neutrons is essential.

Method: The study compares M600 vs M700 materials alongside EJ-276D and EJ-200. They used small samples under specific neutron and gamma ray exposure, measuring light yield, pulse shape discrimination, and pulse decay over time.

Result: M700 demonstrated superior pulse shape discrimination and comparable light yield to EJ-276D, with shorter pulse decay. EJ-200 and EJ-276D showed some optical degradation, while PU-based materials exhibited negligible optical degradation despite the same test conditions.

Conclusion: PU-based polyurethane scintillators promise significant advantages for medical and industrial applications due to their robustness and efficiency in detecting gamma rays and neutrons, with M700 showing particularly superior performance.

Abstract: Organic scintillators using a solid polyurethane (PU) matrix have been introduced to combine the robustness of a construction material with scintillating properties that allow gamma rays and fast neutrons to be detected efficiently and at low cost. This work compares two corresponding materials, the older M600 and the more recent M700, with EJ-276D and EJ-200 representing common plastic scintillators with and without pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) capabilities, respectively. Characterization measurements were performed with small samples of 26 mm diameter and 10 mm height, which were coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and simultaneously exposed to 252Cf fission neutrons and 137Cs gamma rays. M700 turned out to provide the best PSD performance and about the same light yield as EJ-276D, while its light pulses exhibit a shorter pulse decay. An accelerated ageing process applied in between two test campaigns was too short to trigger distinct performance degradation in any of the materials, though optical degradation was visible in EJ-276D and in EJ-200 but not in the PU-based materials. Nevertheless, the extremely robust polyurethane matrix promises advantages in medical and industrial applications where resilience and long-term stability are of crucial importance.

Conclusion: 该算法展示了机器学习在实验分析中的巨大潜力，有望显著提升 LHC 实验效率。

Abstract: The particle-flow (PF) algorithm constructs a global description of each particle collision by producing a comprehensive list of final-state particles, and is central to event reconstruction in the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The existing PF implementation relies on physics-motivated heuristics and assumptions that can be replaced by machine-learning (ML) models trained directly on simulated data and naturally suited to modern graphics processing units (GPUs). A state-of-the-art ML-based PF (MLPF) reconstruction algorithm, implemented within the CMS software framework, is presented. The MLPF algorithm performs a learnable full-event reconstruction on GPUs, generalizes across detector conditions and collision energies, and replaces multiple modular reconstruction steps with a single unified model. Physics performance comparable to standard PF reconstruction is achieved in both simulation and data, with improved jet energy resolution and inference time. In simulated top quark-antiquark events under LHC Run-3 (2023$-$2024) conditions, the jet energy resolution improves by 10$-$20% for jets with transverse momentum between 30$-$100 GeV. Inference time is evaluated using simulated multijet events, with a median of 20 ms per event on an Nvidia L4 GPU, compared to approximately 110 ms for the standard CMS PF reconstruction.

A key innovation through the miniaturization of the Kibble balance from a large-scale instrument into a tabletop device is making the quantum-based realization of mass accessible to a wider range of calibration laboratories and industries. This paper presents a tabletop Kibble balance design at Tsinghua University targeting E2-accuracy class mass calibrations from 1 g to 1 kg. For calibrating a mass of 1 kg, for instance, the required relative standard measurement uncertainty must be below 0.27 ppm to meet E2-accuracy class. Major components and features of the proposed system are discussed. A novel method of multi-harmonic excitation is proposed to improve the coil-motion linearity during velocity measurement. We show that injecting odd-order harmonics into the motion-driving current can significantly improve the uniformity of the coil's moving velocity, while the second-order component can address the asymmetry between upward and downward movements. This achieves a flat velocity $Δv/v< 5\%$ over 60% of the motion cycle.

Abstract: Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime arising from photomultiplier saturation, digitizer limits, and front-end readout constraints. Conventional coincidence-based trigger logic implicitly assumes continuous sensor availability and therefore suffers systematic efficiency loss when channels become temporarily non-live. This work presents the design of a liveness-aware trigger architecture targeting low-latency FPGA deployment in distributed optical arrays. We introduce a recursive Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) update law implemented as a fully synthesizable pipeline that constructs a continuity-preserving effective observable at each sensor node. Rather than collapsing during non-liveness intervals, the observable decays smoothly while retaining phase and amplitude information relevant for network-level coherence estimation. By explicitly separating continuous measurement construction from discrete trigger decision logic, the proposed architecture enables graceful degradation under partial channel non-liveness. Performance is evaluated using a hybrid validation framework that combines representative event topologies derived from IceCube Open Data with a hardware-accurate signal and noise model spanning a wide dynamic range. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed trigger sustains high event recovery efficiency in regimes of elevated deadtime probability, where conventional coincidence logic degrades substantially. Furthermore, the continuity-preserving observable yields up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in effective signal-to-noise ratio, enabling robust detection under strong saturation and non-ideal operating conditions. This method provides a robust foundation for next-generation firmware-level trigger strategies in large-scale, noise-dominated detector systems.

Motivation: Improving the SuperFGD detector's performance for better experimental outcomes and scalability for the T2K upgrade.

Conclusion: Excellent performance and scalability confirmed, supporting simulation and upgrade in T2K.

Abstract: A detailed study of a $5\times5\times5$ cube prototype of the SuperFGD detector was performed using a 730 MeV/$c$ pion beam at the SC-1000 synchrocyclotron (PNPI, Gatchina, Russia). The detector, based on plastic scintillation cubes with orthogonal wavelength-shifting (WLS) fiber readout and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), was tested to evaluate its performance in terms of light yield, spatial uniformity, and optical crosstalk. Using high-resolution tracking, the spatial distribution of light yield was mapped with a granularity of 0.5 mm. An average light response map was obtained by combining data from 27 cubes. Optical crosstalk between adjacent cubes was also measured and characterized in four directions (left, right, up, down). Position-dependent crosstalk values ranged from 2% to 6%, with the highest levels observed near cube interfaces. These results confirm the excellent performance and scalability of the SuperFGD design, and provide valuable input for simulation tuning and reconstruction algorithms in the ND280 upgrade of the T2K experiment. The obtained result on the response uniformity and crosstalk are reasonably well described by simple MC model of the setup.

TL;DR: Generative AI models can simulate and predict optical photon transport within matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate simulation methods for large-scale optical systems.

Method: Developed a conditional generative adversarial network (optiGAN) replacing Monte Carlo simulations for scintillator arrays.

Result: Successfully predicted photon transport in a 3x3 BGO array with accuracy comparable to Monte Carlo simulations.

Conclusion: Generative AI offers a viable alternative to computationally expensive simulation methods for optical photon transport.

Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations of optical photon transport are computationally prohibitive for large-scale optical systems including detector arrays and PET systems, restricting practical use to single-crystal studies. This work presents an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network (optiGAN) replacing optical simulations at the crystal array level, extending our single-crystal approach to a 3x3 BGO array. We enhance the Wasserstein-GAN framework with Fourier feature encoding, a learnable latent mapping network, and a physics-informed loss enforcing momentum conservation. Training data is reduced eight-fold by exploiting symmetry. Evaluation employs three studies: a full array evaluation testing generalization from the fundamental domain to the complete geometry, a high-resolution study probing out-of-distribution generalization to untrained positions, and a pencil beam $γ$-photon study assessing practical applicability for experimental detector characterization. Performance is benchmarked against GATE10/Geant4 ground truth, using intrinsic fluctuations between independent Monte Carlo runs as baseline. OptiGAN achieves sliced Wasserstein similarity within 3$σ$-agreement of the baseline across all conditions, demonstrating successful generalization to the full array. The model transitions from electron-emission training data to realistic $γ$-photon interactions, producing flood maps that reproduce characteristic patterns including photopeak clusters and inter-crystal scatter lines. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that physics-informed generative models can accurately simulate optical photon transport in segmented scintillator arrays. The reproduction of experimentally relevant flood map features validates optiGAN for PET detector development and establishes a foundation for models generalizing across diverse array configurations.

Abstract: This article presents a concrete mathematical framework for the generation of entangled quantum states from classical stochastic processes. We demonstrate that any density operator $ρ_{AB}$ of a composite system can be derived from the correlations between two underlying stochastic processes, $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$, representing the random fluctuations of its subsystems. This construction utilizes a two-scale temporal scheme - micro and macro time - where quantum correlations emerge as macro-correlations derived from underlying micro-correlations. We propose the Double Covariance Model (DCM), which reproduces the fundamental properties of quantum theory by treating the quantum state as the fourth-order moment structure of an underlying classical probability space.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Decoherence is often modeled using Markovian master equations that predict exponential suppression of coherence and are frequently used as effective bounds on quantum behavior in complex environments. Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case.
  For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel.
  These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit.
  Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data.

TL;DR: A graybox quantumsensormodel improves magnetic field estimation with orders of magnitude better accuracy than physics-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum sensors have potential in various applications but are limited by unmodelled effects. This work aims to address this limitation by introducing a graybox modelling strategy.

Method: The researchers developed a graybox model that combines physics-based system models with data-driven descriptions of experimental imperfections. They trained this model on prior experimental data and used it to estimate a static magnetic field with a single-spin quantum sensor.

Result: The graybox model achieved significantly better accuracy (several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error) compared to physics-only models, even with a relatively small dataset of 10,000 training datapoints.

Conclusion: This advancement in quantum sensing technology offers a more efficient and accurate approach for real-time applications, enhancing performance beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Quantum sensors offer significant advantages over classical devices in spatial resolution and sensitivity, enabling transformative applications across materials science, healthcare, and beyond. Their practical performance, however, is often constrained by unmodelled effects, including noise, imperfect state preparation, and non-ideal control fields.
  In this work, we report the first experimental implementation of a graybox modelling strategy for a solid-state open quantum system. The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model. These results are broadly applicable to a wide range of quantum sensing platforms, not limited to single-spin systems, and are particularly valuable for real-time adaptive protocols, where model inaccuracies can otherwise lead to suboptimal control and degraded performance.

Abstract: Quantum voting protocols aim to offer ballot secrecy and publicly verifiable tallies using physical guarantees from quantum mechanics, rather than relying solely on computational hardness. This article surveys whether such quantum voting protocols are practical. We begin by outlining core mathematical ideas such as the superposition principle, the no-cloning theorem, and quantum entanglement. We then define a common system and threat model, identifying key actors, trust assumptions, and security goals. Representative protocol families are reviewed, including entanglement-based schemes with central tallying, self-tallying designs that enable public verification, and authority-minimized approaches that certify untrusted devices through observable correlations. Finally, we evaluate implementation challenges, including loss, noise, device imperfections, scalability, and coercion resistance, and discuss realistic near-term deployment scenarios for small-scale elections.

TL;DR: The paper examines ground state properties and quantum critical dynamics of a 1D transverse field Ising model using exact diagonalization, VQE, and quantum device simulations. The study highlights the current capabilities and limitations of NISQ devices in modeling quantum phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum phase transitions and developing quantum computational tools to model them are key motivations in quantum many-body physics.

Method: The research employs exact diagonalization, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and quantum device simulations. The model focuses on a four-spin lattice, utilizing symmetry-conserving exact diagonalization as a benchmark and a two-layer VQE for approximations. Optimized quantum circuits are implemented on the IQM Garnet processor using a resource-efficient batched protocol.

Result: The study finds that VQE captures ground-state energies well, while correlation observables and magnetization are more susceptible to noise. Hardware noise leads to the broadening of critical crossover points, indicating limitations in modeling long-range correlations on NISQ devices.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive assessment of NISQ device capabilities and challenges in simulating quantum critical phenomena, offering insights for future quantum hardware and algorithms development.

Abstract: The quantum phase transitions provide a paradigm for studying collective quantum phenomena that are a result of competing non-commuting interactions. This paper will study the ground state properties and quantum critical dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model through a combined perspective that includes exact diagonalisation, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulations, and simulations on realistic physical quantum devices. We focus on a lattice of four spins, where we calculate the ground-state energies, magnetic order parameters and correlation functions at uniformly applied conditions, which is repeated by all systems. Precise diagonalisation provides both a benchmark, which is symmetry-conserving, and a depth-two, physics inspired variational approximation, which provides simulations accessible to hardware. The circuits that have been optimised identically are then placed on the IQM Garnet quantum processor, using a resource-efficient batched protocol. We find that the ground-state energies of shallow variational circuits are reliably captured by the circuit over the entire parameter space; the magnetic arrangement parameters and observables sensitive to correlation signal significantly more noise. The error analysis of quantitative analysis reveals a strong broadening of critical crossover on hardware, which is consistent with the noise attenuation of long-range correlations. These findings highlight the current capabilities as well as the fundamental limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum systems in modelling quantum critical phenomena as a benchmark to future enhancements in obtaining quantum hardware and quantum algorithms development.

Abstract: Levitated nanodiamonds hosting a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center provide an ultra-low-frequency mechanical mode with widely tunable dissipation and spin backaction under microwave dressing and optical pumping. We demonstrate that the driven NV spin can be tuned to act as an inverted gain medium for the center-of-mass motion, thereby stabilizing an autonomous phonon maser. In the separation-of-timescales regime where spin dynamics is fast, adiabatic elimination yields a reduced mechanical master equation with closed-form, detuning-dependent transition rates and a sharp threshold given by the sign change of the phonon-number damping. For representative levitated-NV parameters, we find that a percent-level dressed-basis inversion is sufficient to reach the threshold, and the small-signal gain can exceed the intrinsic mechanical loss by orders of magnitude. Full master-equation simulations confirm above-threshold self-oscillation and a phase-diffusing, coherent steady state, whose saturation follows the Maxwell-Bloch prediction.

Abstract: Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) relies on Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes to reach error rates necessary for large scale quantum applications. At a physical level, QEC codes perform parity checks on data qubits, producing syndrome information, through Syndrome Measurement (SM) circuits. These circuits define a code's logical error rate and must be run repeatedly throughout the entire program. The performance of SM circuits is therefore critical to the success of a FTQC system.
  While ultimately implemented as physical circuits, SM circuits have challenges that are not addressed by existing circuit optimization tools. Importantly, inside SM circuits themselves errors are expected to occur, and how errors propagate through SM circuits directly impacts which errors are detectable and correctable, defining the code's logical error rate. This is not modeled in NISQ-era tools, which instead optimize for targets such as gate depth or gate count to mitigate the chance that any error occurs. This gap leaves key questions unanswered about the expected real-world effectiveness of QEC codes.
  In this work we address this gap and present PropHunt, an automated tool for optimizing SM circuits for CSS codes. We evaluate PropHunt on a suite of relevant QEC codes and demonstrate PropHunt's ability to iteratively improve performance and recover existing hand-designed circuits automatically. We also propose a near-term QEC application, Hook-ZNE, which leverages PropHunt's fine-grained control over logical error rate to improve Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), a promising error mitigation strategy.

Result: The protocol demonstrates that the sensitivity of the interferometer scales favorably with the lifetime of the quantum memory. This advancement could pave the way for more efficient and scalable quantum networks and sensors.

Conclusion: The success of this protocol offers a promising pathway to improve atom-light interferometers, leveraging quantum memory capabilities for enhanced sensitivity and more efficient quantum network implementations.

Abstract: Quantum memories feature a reversible conversion of optical fields into long-lived atomic spin waves, and are therefore ideal for operating as sensitive atomic sensors. However, up to now, atom-light interferometers have lacked an efficient approach to exploit their ultimate atomic sensing performance, since an extra optical delay line is required to compensate for the memory time. Here, we report a new protocol that records the photocurrent via heterodyne mixing with a stable local oscillator. The obtained complex quadrature amplitude that carries information imprinted on its phase by an external magnetic field, is successfully recovered from the interference patterns between the light and the atomic spin wave, without the stringent requirement of having them overlap in time. Our results reveal that the sensitivity scales favorably with the lifetime of the quantum memory. Our work may have important applications in building distributed quantum networks through quantum memory-assisted atom-light interferometers.

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of dephasing-induced decoherence in continuous-variable quantum systems using non-Gaussian probe states. By purifying the open system, we identify optimal probes, specifically squeezed cat and symmetric squeezed compass states, via quantum Fisher information. These results are in agreement with numerical simulation. In settings where the intra-cavity field is inaccessible and standard measurements are impractical, utilizing an ancilla approach where a qubit traverses or interacts with the cavity field, leading to measurement of the qubit, hence allowing estimation of the dephasing rate via Wigner function reconstruction or less costly marginal distribution.

Abstract: Ensembles of atoms interacting via their Rydberg levels, known as "superatoms" for their ability to encode qubits and to emit single photons, attract increasing attention as building blocks for quantum network nodes. Assessing their performance requires an accurate, physically informative and numerically scalable description of interactions in a large and disordered ensemble. We derive such a description from first principles and successfully test it against brute-force numerics and experimental data. This model proves essential to make quantitative predictions about gate fidelities or photon emission efficiencies, and to guide experiments towards large-scale superatom-based systems.

Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect highlights the fundamental role of electromagnetic potentials in quantum mechanics, manifesting as a phase shift for a charged particle in field-free regions. While well-established for static magnetic fluxes, the effect's behavior under time-varying fluxes remains an open and debated question. Employing the WKB method, we derive the AB phase shift for a time-dependent magnetic vector potential, demonstrating that for circular paths in the quasistatic regime, it is proportional to the time-averaged enclosed magnetic flux, \(Δφ_{\rm AB} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T e Φ(t) \, dt\), with the total phase shift, including kinetic contributions, equaling \(e Φ(0)\). For non-circular paths, the phase shift depends on both the flux history and path geometry, revealing the effect's hybrid nature involving gauge potentials and induced electric fields. We verify the consistency of our gauge choice with Maxwell's equations and discuss the implications for local versus nonlocal interpretations of the AB effect. We also generalize the results to scenarios with nonzero external magnetic fields, where the enclosed flux is through the actual electron paths, and for circular paths of radius $R$, the AB phase shift is also proportional to the time average of the enclosed flux \(Φ_{\rm enc}(R,t)\), with the total phase shift depending only on the initial enclosed flux \(e Φ_{\rm enc}(R,0)\); for general non-circular paths, the external magnetic field affects trajectories and phase accumulation through the Lorentz force, leading to additional path dependence. These findings clarify the role of gauge-dependent potentials and induced fields in the generalized AB effect, offering new theoretical insights and potential applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) strongly affect the safety and efficacy of combination therapies. Despite the availability of large DDI databases, selecting optimal multi-drug combinations that balance safety, therapeutic benefit, and regimen size remains a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. Here, we present a quantum-control-based framework for DDI-aware drug combination optimization, in which known harmful and synergistic interactions are encoded into Ising Hamiltonians as penalties and rewards, respectively. The optimization is performed using the feedback-based quantum algorithm FALQON, a gradient-free variational approach. We study two clinically motivated tasks: the Maximum Safe Subset problem and the Synergy-Constrained Optimization problem. Numerical simulations using interaction data from Drugs.com and SYNERGxDB demonstrate efficient convergence and high-quality solutions for clinically relevant drug sets, including COVID-19 case studies.

Motivation: Understanding the implications of the PBR theorem for $ψ$-ontology is crucial for addressing foundational questions in quantum mechanics about reality and information.

Method: The paper utilizes algebraic graph theory to analyze quantum states, tensor products, and the implications for $ψ$-epistemic models.

Result: The main finding confirms that the tensor-product structure of quantum mechanics, combined with the PBR theorem, solidifies $ψ$-onticity for composite systems, thus resolving a loophole in maintaining $ψ$-epistemic models.

Conclusion: This study provides a deeper understanding of $ψ$-ontology, moving closer to establishing whether quantum states represent objective reality or information states. The results strengthen quantum foundations and inform the development of quantum information theories.

Abstract: The Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) theorem establishes $ψ$-onticity for individual quantum systems, but its standard formulation relies on the Preparation Independence Postulate (PIP). This has led to a prevalent view that rejecting PIP leaves open the possibility of $ψ$-epistemic models for individual systems. In this work, we show that this understanding is incomplete: once the PBR theorem establishes $ψ$-onticity for composite systems prepared in product states, the $ψ$-onticity of the individual subsystems follows directly from the tensor-product structure of quantum mechanics, without invoking PIP or any further auxiliary assumptions. This result removes a key auxiliary assumption from the PBR theorem, closes a persistent loophole for preserving $ψ$-epistemic models, and strengthens the conceptual foundations of $ψ$-ontology.

*Shan Gao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The authors argue that the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase is locally mediated by entanglement between a charged particle and the quantized electromagnetic field, but they are shown to be incorrect. The AB phase arises from interaction with the vector potential A, not entanglement, which is a byproduct of QED. Their field-based energy formulation is mathematically flawed, and the AB phase is gauge-dependent for non-closed paths, contrary to their claim.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the origin of the AB phase and challenges the conventional understanding of its mechanism.

Method: The authors critique the proposed model by Marletto and Vedral, demonstrating the flaws in their field-based energy formulation and showing that the AB phase is gauge-dependent.

Result: The AB phase is not locally mediated by entanglement, and it is gauge-dependent for non-closed paths.

Conclusion: The AB phase is driven by the vector potential A, not entanglement, and it depends on the gauge for non-closed paths.

Abstract: Marletto and Vedral [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 040401 (2020)] propose that the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase is locally mediated by entanglement between a charged particle and the quantized electromagnetic field, asserting gauge independence for non-closed paths. In this Comment, we critically analyze their model and demonstrate that the AB phase arises from the interaction with the vector potential \(\mathbf{A}\), not from entanglement, which is a byproduct of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework. We show that their field-based energy formulation, intended to reflect local electromagnetic interactions, is mathematically flawed due to an incorrect prefactor and yields \( +q \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{s}} \) in the Coulomb gauge, conflicting with QED's \( -q \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{s}} \). This equivalence to \( q \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{s}} \) holds only approximately in the Coulomb gauge under static conditions, failing for time-dependent fields and other gauges, undermining their claim of a gauge-independent local mechanism. Furthermore, we confirm that the AB phase is gauge-dependent for non-closed paths, contradicting their assertion. Our analysis reaffirms the conventional explanation in the semi-classical picture, where the AB phase is driven by the vector potential \(\mathbf{A}\), with entanglement playing no causal role in its generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of nonlinear optical systems for quantum information processing is motivated by the desire to leverage quantum systems for fault-tolerant computation through phase space protection.

Method: The system under study employs Kerr nonlinear optical media, multi-photon transitions, and specific wavefunction measurements to engineer a qutrit system. The implementation involves generating three-photon states and analyzing their phase space dynamics.

Result: The research successfully demonstrates the generation of three-photon Rabi oscillations, direct Wigner function measurements showing cat-like states, and observed breathing-like phase space dynamics. Additionally, the energy gap determines interference frequencies, and a higher-order pump term is identified as a suppressive mechanism for photon occupation.

Conclusion: This work advances experimental approaches for tailored and robustly protected qutrit systems, with the findings suggesting potential applications in quantum information processing based on phase space protection mechanisms.

Abstract: Engineering quantum tunnelling in phase space has emerged as a viable method for creating a protected qubit with biased-noise properties. A promising approach is to combine a Kerr nonlinearity with multi-photon transitions, resulting in a system known as a Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO). In this work, we implement a three-photon KPO and explore its potential as a protected qutrit. We confirm quantum coherence by demonstrating three-photon Rabi oscillations and performing direct Wigner function measurements that reveal three-component cat-like states. We observe breathing-like dynamics in phase space, arising from exotic temporal interference between the qutrit and excited states. The frequency of this interference corresponds to the energy gap between the qutrit and excited manifolds, thereby providing an experimental hallmark of qutrit space protection. We also identify a higher-order pump term as the main mechanism suppressing photon occupation; mitigating this term is necessary to maximize protection. Our findings elucidate the basic quantum properties of the three-photon KPO and establish the first step toward its use as an alternative qutrit platform.

Abstract: Establishing quantum speedup for computationally hard problems of practical relevance, particularly combinatorial optimization problems, remains a central challenge in quantum computation. In this work, we identify a structurally defined family of classically hard maximum independent set (MIS) instances, and design and analyze a non-stoquastic adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm that exploits this structure. The algorithm runs in polynomial time and achieves an exponential speedup over both transverse-field quantum annealing and state-of-the-art classical solvers on these instances, under assumptions supported by analytical and numerical evidence. We identify the essential quantum mechanism enabling the speedup as the use of a non-stoquastic XX-driver to access a larger sign-structured admissible subspace beyond the stoquastic regime, which allows sign-generating quantum interference to create smooth evolution paths that bypass tunneling. This identifies a distinctive quantum mechanism underlying the speedup and explains why no efficient classical analogue is likely to exist. In addition, our analysis produces scalable small-scale models, derived from our structural reduction, that capture the essential dynamics of the algorithm. These models provide a concrete opportunity for verification of the quantum advantage mechanism on currently available universal quantum computers.

Motivation: This paper is significant as it connects PT symmetry and non-unitary processes to quantum communication, offering insights into robust signal amplification in noisy quantum systems.

Method: The authors model the system using coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, introduce PT-symmetric gain and loss terms, and analyze the system's phase transition via spectral exceptional points and a statistical study of disorder realizations.

Result: The results reveal that PT-symmetry enables signal amplification up to a critical non-Hermiticity threshold, which varies according to the system's microscopic level spacing. Additionally, the PT-broken phase exhibits a 'purification' effect, improving teleportation fidelity.

Conclusion: The study suggests that non-Hermitian topology can be harnessed to enhance holographic quantum communication, providing a robust mechanism for signal amplification in noisy, minimal quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Holography-inspired teleportation has recently emerged as a significant area of research in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we investigate the effects of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric non-unitary deformations on the traversability of the wormhole-inspired teleportation protocol modeled by coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev systems prepared in a Thermofield Double state bath. By introducing balanced gain and loss terms to the boundary Hamiltonians, we identify a phase transition driven by spectral exceptional points, where the real energy eigenvalues of the effective Hamiltonian coalesce and bifurcate into complex conjugate pairs. We demonstrate that the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase acts as an amplifier, enabling exponential growth in the norm of the teleported signal while preserving the causal time window for the wormhole's traversability. A statistical study of disorder realizations reveals that the critical non-Hermiticity threshold $γ_c$ follows a log-normal distribution, reflecting the sensitivity of the transition to the microscopic level spacing of the chaotic SYK spectrum. Furthermore, we observe a ``Purification" effect deep in the broken phase, where the teleportation channel acts as an entanglement distiller, yielding near-perfect teleportation fidelity for post-selected states. Our results suggest that the non-Hermitian topology can be harnessed to enhance holographic quantum communication, providing a robust mechanism for signal amplification in noisy, minimal quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Quantum-inspired algorithms can deliver substantial speedups over classical state-of-the-art methods by executing quantum algorithms with tensor networks on conventional hardware. Unlike circuit models restricted to unitary gates, tensor networks naturally accommodate non-unitary maps. This flexibility lets us design quantum-inspired methods that start from a quantum algorithmic structure, yet go beyond unitarity to achieve speedups. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach to compute the discrete Laplace transform, a non-unitary, aperiodic transform (in contrast to the Fourier transform). We encode a length-$N$ signal on two paired $n$-qubit registers and decompose the overall map into a non-unitary exponential Damping Transform followed by a Quantum Fourier Transform, both compressed in a single matrix-product operator. This decomposition admits strong MPO compression to low bond dimension resulting in significant acceleration. We demonstrate simulations up to $N=2^{30}$ input data points, with up to $2^{60}$ output data points, and quantify how bond dimension controls runtime and accuracy, including precise and efficient pole identification.

Conclusion: 论文的结论是，对于需要处理大搜索空间的问题，采用基于约束的初始化方式可以显著提高Grover算法的效率。尽管这增加了初始化阶段的电路成本，但在总资源方面，该方法确实提供了更好的优化。

Abstract: Grover's search algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over classical brute-force search in terms of query complexity and is widely used as a versatile subroutine in numerous quantum algorithms, including those for combinatorial problems with large search spaces. For such problems, it is natural to reduce the effective search space by incorporating problem constraints at the initialization step, which in Grover's algorithm can be achieved by preparing structured initial states that encode constraint information. In this work, we present a systematic framework with a simple preprocessing procedure for constraint-aware initialization in Grover's algorithm, focusing on problems with linear constraints. While such structured initial states can reduce the number of oracle queries required to obtain a solution, their preparation incurs additional circuit-level costs. We therefore offer a conservative circuit-level resource analysis, showing that the resulting constraint-aware initialization can improve resource efficiency in terms of gate counts and circuit depth. The validity of the framework is further demonstrated numerically using the exact-cover problem. Overall, our results indicate that this approach serves as a practical baseline for achieving more resource-efficient implementations of Grover's algorithm compared to the standard uniform initialization.

Under mild regularity assumptions on the Hamiltonian and uniform operator-norm bounds on the local measurement operators, there exist positive constants $C$ and $μ$ (determined by the spectral gap, interaction range and local operator norms) such that for any local measurement performed in a region $A$ and any outcome-dependent local unitaries implemented in a disjoint region $B$ separated by distance $d=\operatorname{dist}(A,B)$ one has $|E_A-E_B|\le C\,e^{-μd}.$ The bound is nonperturbative, explicit up to model-dependent constants, and follows from the variational characterization of the ground state combined with exponential clustering implied by the spectral gap.

Abstract: Simulating interactions between fermions and bosons is central to understanding correlated phenomena, yet these systems are inherently difficult to treat classically. Previous quantum algorithms for fermion-boson models exhibit computation costs that scale polynomially with the bosonic truncation parameter, $Λ$. In this work we identify the efficient unitary transformation enabling fast-forwarded evolution of the fermion-boson interaction term, yielding an interaction-picture based simulation algorithm with complexity polylogarithmic in $Λ$. We apply this transformation to explicitly construct an efficient quantum algorithm for the Hubbard-Holstein model and discuss its generalisation to other fermion-boson interacting models. This approach yields an important asymptotic improvement in the dependence on the bosonic cutoff and establishes that, for certain models, fermion-boson interactions can be simulated with resources comparable to those required for purely fermionic systems.

TL;DR: A new framework is introduced to construct efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes for simulating long-time dynamics of many-body systems. The framework directly optimizes the parameters of the schemes over a high-dimensional space, enabling the discovery of new efficient methods. Two novel schemes at 4th and 6th order are recommended, which are more efficient than traditional methods, even when using large time steps. The practical performance of these decompositions is better across computational costs. The choice of recommended schemes includes decompositions with more uniform coefficients, which tend to have improved error accumulation over long times.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient simulation of many-body systems is a fundamental challenge in both classical and quantum computing. The accumulation of errors in time evolution simulations can limit the simulation of long-time dynamics. This paper addresses the challenge of constructing high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes to improve the efficiency and accuracy of such simulations.

Method: The authors present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes. This involves direct optimization of the parameters of these schemes over a high-dimensional space. The method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiencies compared to traditional constructions.

Result: The framework results in the identification of two new highly efficient Trotter-Suzuki schemes at 4th and 6th order. The paper demonstrates through extensive testing on the Heisenberg model and the quantum harmonic oscillator that these schemes perform better across computational costs. Even when using large time steps, the new schemes surpass established low-order schemes like the Leapfrog. The practical performance of the decompositions is compared, suggesting that schemes with more uniform coefficients have better error accumulation over long times.

Conclusion: This paper provides a novel and effective framework for constructing high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes, which significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of simulating long-time dynamics in many-body systems. The recommended 4th and 6th order schemes offer superior performance, making them valuable tools for future research in this area.

Abstract: Accurately simulating long-time dynamics of many-body systems is a challenge in both classical and quantum computing due to the accumulation of Trotter errors. While low-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are straightforward to implement, their rapidly growing error limits access to long-time observables. We present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes by identifying their structure and directly optimizing their parameters over a high-dimensional space. This method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiency compared to traditional constructions, such as those by Suzuki and Yoshida. Based on the theoretical efficiency and practical performance, we recommend two novel highly efficient schemes at $4^{\textrm{th}}$ and $6^{\textrm{th}}$ order. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of these decompositions on the Heisenberg model and the quantum harmonic oscillator, and find that for a fixed final time they perform better across the computational cost. Even when using large time steps, they surpass established low-order schemes like the Leapfrog. Finally, we investigate the in-practice performance of different Trotter schemes and find the decompositions with more uniform coefficients tend to feature improved error accumulation over long times. We have included this observation into our choice of recommended schemes.

Abstract: Quantum error correction is indispensable for scalable quantum computation. Although encoding logical qubits substantially enhances noise resilience, achieving logical error rates low enough for practical algorithms remains challenging on existing hardware. Here we introduce argument reweighting, a simple and broadly applicable post-selection decoding strategy that boosts the performance of maximum-likelihood-type decoders, including minimum-weight perfect matching and belief-propagation families. The method suppresses logical errors by performing additional decoding rounds under reweighted error models, enabling acceptance of high-confidence syndrome outcomes. Circuit-level simulations across multiple decoders and qLDPC codes show that argument reweighting substantially suppresses logical errors, requiring a rejection rate of only $1.44\times10^{-5}$ to reduce the logical error rate by almost two orders of magnitude for the $[[144,12,12]]$ bivariate bicycle code. These results establish argument reweighting as a practical and resource-efficient approach for enhancing quantum fault tolerance.

Abstract: The question of when the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability serves as the most appropriate description for quantum measurements has remained unresolved, particularly across different measurement strengths. While known to generate anomalous weak values in the weak measurement regime and to reduce to classical probabilities under projective measurement, the physical mechanism governing its continuous transformation has been lacking. Here we demonstrate that the KD quasiprobability provides a general framework for all measurement regimes by identifying pointer-induced decoherence as the universal mechanism controlling this transition. We show that the decoherence factor F(t) simultaneously quantifies the loss of quantum coherence and interpolates the measurement strength from weak to strong. Within this framework, the KD quasiprobability naturally deforms from its full complex form-governing weak values-to the real, non-negative Wigner formula describing projective measurements, while maintaining informational completeness throughout the transition. Our work resolves the fundamental question of the KD distribution's applicability by establishing it as the universal framework that seamlessly connects all quantum measurement regimes through a physically transparent decoherence pathway.

Abstract: Quantum cryptographic conferencing (QCC) allows multiple parties to establish common secure keys in quantum networks with information-theoretic security. However, the secure transmission distances of current QCC implementations are still limited to the metropolitan areas. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the three-intensity phase-matching (PM) QCC protocol considering finite-size effects by employing frequency-locking and phase-tracking techniques for three parties. The key distribution capability of the PM QCC protocol is demonstrated in the symmetric fiber channels with the distance from each party to the measurement site up to 100 km. The network adaptability of the PM QCC protocol is demonstrated in asymmetric fiber channels used to simulate fiber channel configurations in real networks. Thus, the feasibility of applying the PM QCC protocol to practical intercity quantum networks with both symmetric and asymmetric channels is verified.

Abstract: We provide an operational interpretation of the multivariate Rényi divergence in terms of economic-theoretic tasks based on betting, risk aversion, and multiple lotteries. We show that the multivariate Rényi divergence $D_{\underlineα}(\vec{P}_X)$ of probability distributions $\vec{P}_X =(p^{(0)}_X,\dots,p^{(d)}_X)$ and real-valued orders $\underlineα = (α_0, \dots, α_d)$ quantifies the economic-theoretic value that a rational agent assigns to $d$ lotteries with odds $o^{(k)}_X \propto (p_X^{(k)})^{-1}$ ($k=1,\dots,d$) on a random event described by $p^{(0)}_X$. In particular, when the odds are fair and the rational agent maximises over all betting strategies, the economic-theoretic value (the isoelastic certainty equivalent) that the agent assigns to the lotteries is exactly given by $w^{\mathrm{ICE}}_{\underline{R}}=\exp[D_{\underlineα}(\vec{P}_X)]$, where $\underline{R}=(R_1,\dots,R_d)$ is a risk-aversion vector with $R_k = 1+α_k/α_0$ being the risk-aversion parameter for lottery $k$. Furthermore, we introduce a new conditional multivariate Rényi divergence that characterises a generalised scenario where the agent uses side information. We prove that this new quantity satisfies a data processing inequality which can be interpreted as the increment in the economic-theoretic value provided by side information; crucially, such a data processing inequality is a consequence of the agent's economic-theoretically consistent risk-averse attitude towards every lottery and vice versa. Finally, we apply these results to the resource theory of informative measurements in general probabilistic theories (GPTs). By establishing quantitative connections between information theory, physics, and economics, our framework provides a novel operational foundation for quantum state betting games with multiple lotteries in the realm of quantum resource theories.

Abstract: Prompted by the longstanding interpretational controversy in quantum mechanics, quantum tunneling is heuristically addressed within the Everettian quantum multiverse. In this framework, the universal wavefunction splits into decohered reflected and transmitted branches under the environmetal effect after encountring a potential barrier. The observed tunneling is then experienced by the observer located in a tunneled world. The tunneling probability and the tunneling time are investigated in terms of the tunneled world relative weights and the branching duration, respectively. The macroscopic quantum tunneling, recently honored, is also discussed and the corresponding macroscopic tunneling time is approached based on the obtained results and known data.

Abstract: Quantum interferometers offer phase measurement capabilities that surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), with phase sensitivity and quantum enhancement factor serving as key performance metrics. However, practical implementations face severe degradation of both metrics due to unavoidable losses, representing the foremost challenge in advancing quantum interferometry toward real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent-amplifier-empowered quantum interferometer. The coherent amplifier dramatically suppresses the decay of both sensitivity and quantum enhancement under high-loss conditions, maintaining phase sensitivity beyond the original SQL even for losses exceeding 90%. Using an injected 4.2 dB squeezed-vacuum state in experimental demonstration, our scheme reduces the quantum enhancement degradation under 90% loss from 3.7 dB in a conventional quantum interferometer (CQI) to only 1.5 dB. More importantly, the phase sensitivity degradation under the same loss is limited to 4.0 dB, markedly outperforming the 11.2 dB degradation observed in a CQI. This improvement is enabled by the coherent amplifier's phase-sensitive photon amplification and its protection of the quantum state. This breakthrough in amplifier-empowered quantum interferometry overcomes the critical barrier to practical deployment, enabling robust quantum-enhanced measurements in lossy environments.

Abstract: Colour centres in silicon have great potential as single photon sources for quantum technologies.

Abstract: The entanglement entropy (EE) of any bipartition of a pure state can be approximately expressed as a sum of entanglement links (ELs). In this work, we introduce their exact extension, i.e. the entanglement hyperlinks (EHLs), a type of generalized mutual informations defined through the inclusion-exclusion principle, each of which captures contributions to the multipartite entanglement that are not reducible to lower-order terms. We show that any EHL crossing a factorized partition must vanish, and that the EHLs between any set of blocks can be expressed as a sum of all the EHLs that join all of them. This last result allows us to provide an exact representation of the EE of any block of a pure state, from the sum of the EHLs which cross its boundary. In order to illustrate their rich structure, we discuss some explicit numerical examples using ground states of local Hamiltonians. The EHLs thus provide a remarkable tool to characterize multipartite entanglement in quantum information theory and quantum many-body physics.

Abstract: Preparing quantum states whose amplitudes encode classical probability distributions is a fundamental primitive in quantum algorithms based on amplitude encoding and amplitude estimation. Given a probability distribution $\{p_k\}_{k=0}^{2^n-1}$, the Grover--Rudolph procedure constructs an $n$-qubit state $\ketψ=\sum_{k=0}^{2^n-1}\sqrt{p_k}\ket{k}$ by recursively applying families of controlled one-qubit rotations determined by a dyadic refinement of the target distribution. Despite its widespread use, the algorithm is often presented with informal correctness arguments and implicit conventions on the underlying dyadic tree. In this work we give a rigorous and self-contained analysis of the Grover--Rudolph construction: we formalize the dyadic probability tree, define the associated angle map via conditional masses, derive the resulting trigonometric factorizations, and prove by induction that the circuit prepares exactly the desired measurement law in the computational basis. As a complementary circuit-theoretic contribution, we show that each Grover--Rudolph stage is a uniformly controlled $\RY$ rotation on an active register and provide an explicit ancilla-free transpilation into the gate dictionary $\{\RY(\cdot),X,\CNOT(\cdot\to\cdot)\}$ using Gray-code ladders and a Walsh--Hadamard angle transform.

### [88] [Elementary Quantum Gates from Lie Group Embeddings in $U(2^n)$: Geometry, Universality, and Discretization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17936)
*Antonio Falco,Daniela Falco-Pomares,Hermann G. Matthies*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper constructs a phase-free SU(n) circuit basis within U(N) via primitive elements from multiple SU(2) copies, proving universality in SU(N) using two-level factorizations and dihedral embeddings. The construction leverages a novel descriptor within U(N), with enhancements to the SU(2) variant for phase-inclusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The whole field of quantum circuit synthesis is focused on creating efficient representations of gates PARTICULARLY in SU(2) which is the building block for larger quantum systems. This paper addresses an open question about surpassing previous results by creating a basis for SU(n) via multiple embedded SU(2) subgroups, providing a promising new direction in quantum circuit design.

Method: The authors introduce a phase-free basis layer within U(N) by considering the union of all SU(2) embeddings, φ(SU(2)), and they decompose the manifold of these embeddings into homogeneous strata. They employ two-level QR/Givens factorization and dihedral symmetry properties to establish universality in SU(N), later extending this to the full U(N) group by including U(1) diagonal factors.

Result: The authors achieve qubit-efficient universality in SU(N) and U(N) gate sets. Specifically, they prove that the group generated by their two-level embedded SU(2) elements coincides with SU(N), and by incorporating abelian U(1) factors, they realize U(N) universality. Moreover, they introduce a modular finite-alphabet interface through Solovay-Kitaev approximation adapted to their two-level setup.

Conclusion: This paper advances quantum circuit synthesis by constructively addressing the role of embedded SU(2) subgroups within U(N) and demonstrating that a finite basis for SU(N) can indeed be achieved via multiple such primitive elements. The authors' approach opens new possibilities for synthesizing quantum circuits with potentially fewer qubits and more efficient operations, while their two-level embedding strategy paves the way for scalable quantum algorithms.

Abstract: In the standard circuit model, elementary gates are specified relative to a chosen tensor factorization and are therefore extrinsic to the ambient group $U(2^n)$. Writing $N=2^n$, we introduce an intrinsic descriptor layer in $U(N)$ by declaring as primitive the motions inside faithful embedded copies of $SU(2)$, leading to the phase-free dictionary $\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\mathrm{elem}}(n)=\bigcup_{φ\in\Emb(SU(2),U(N))}φ(SU(2))$, and we also discuss the phase-inclusive $U(2)$ variant. We show that $\Emb(SU(2),U(N))$ decomposes into finitely many $U(N)$-homogeneous strata indexed by isotypic multiplicities, with stabilizers given by centralizers; the canonical two-level sector is organized by $\Gr_2(\C^N)$ up to a $PSU(2)$ gauge. Equipping $U(N)$ with the Hilbert--Schmidt bi-invariant metric, each embedded subgroup is totally geodesic. Using two-level QR/Givens factorization together with an explicit generation of diagonal tori by two-level phase rotations, we prove phase-free universality $\langle\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\mathrm{2lvl}}(n)\rangle=SU(N)$ and hence $\langle\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\mathrm{elem}}(n)\rangle=SU(N)$. Full universality in $U(N)$ follows by adjoining the abelian diagonal/global $U(1)$ factors (equivalently, by passing to the $U(2)$ two-level dictionary). Finally, we record a modular finite-alphabet interface by lifting Solovay--Kitaev approximation in $SU(2)$ through two-level embeddings.

Abstract: The paper relates to a quantum radar deployment by the Born-Feynman path integrals approach based on quantum dots. The radar system comprises a quantum dot-based entangled photon generator, a transmission module, a delay line, a detection module, and a signal processing unit. The quantum dot-based entangled photon generator produces entangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion or stimulated emission. The signal transmission module, equipped with a microwave antenna and beamforming elements, directs the signal photon toward a target. The delay line module synchronizes the retained idler photon with the returning signal photon, preserving quantum coherence. The detection module collects the reflected signal photon and uses a cryogenically cooled superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) for detection. Finally, the signal processing unit analyzes the quantum correlation between the scattered and idler photons to enable precise quantum state comparison.

TL;DR: This paper shows that QKD protocols proven secure under idealized authentication can still be secure under practical, asymmetric authentication relaxations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) security proofs often rely on idealized assumptions about classical communication. This paper addresses the gap between theoretical assumptions and practical implementations by demonstrating how QKD protocols can remain secure under more realistic authentication conditions.

Method: The authors propose a reduction theorem that allows QKD protocols to be proven secure under standard, practical authentication settings by modifying existing proofs.

Result: The main result is a proof that under mild conditions, QKD protocols remain secure even if classical communication channels exhibit asymmetric behavior and timing distortions.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between theoretical QKD security proofs and real-world implementations, showing that security can be maintained with minor protocol adjustments.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols rely on authenticated classical communication. Typical QKD security proofs are carried out in an idealized setting where authentication is assumed to behave honestly: it never aborts, and all classical messages are delivered faithfully with their original timing preserved. Authenticated channels that can be constructed in practice have different properties. Most critically, such channels may abort asymmetrically, such that only the receiving party may detect an authentication failure while the sending party remains unaware. Furthermore, an adversary may delay, reorder, or block classical messages. This discrepancy renders the standard QKD security definition and existing QKD security proofs invalid in the practical authentication setting. In this work we resolve this issue. Our main result is a reduction theorem showing that, under mild and easily satisfied protocol conditions, any QKD protocol proven secure under the honest authentication setting remains secure under a practical authentication setting. This result allows all existing QKD proofs to be retroactively lifted to the practical authentication setting with a minor protocol tweak.

Abstract: We develop a dynamical framework for quantum measurement based on stochastic but unitary evolution in projective state space. Random Hamiltonians drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble generate stochastic unitary dynamics of the quantum state, while equivalence classes reflecting finite detector resolution define classical observables as well as classical configuration-space and phase-space submanifolds. When the evolution is constrained to the phase-space submanifold, free Schrödinger dynamics reduces to Newtonian motion, while stochastic motion constrained to the classical configuration-space submanifold yields ordinary Brownian motion in classical space. Transition probabilities under the stochastic dynamics satisfy the Born rule, whereas the constrained classical evolution produces the normal probability distributions characteristic of classical measurements. We show that, in this setting, measurement, state reduction, and the quantum-classical transition emerge from unitary dynamics alone, without invoking nonunitary collapse or additional postulates. Entanglement and EPR correlations arise geometrically from the evolution of joint states in composite state space, preserving locality in spacetime. The framework provides a unified dynamical account of measurement and classicality compatible with the structure of quantum mechanics.

Abstract: We present a general method for decomposing non-unitary operators into a linear combination of unitary operators, where the approximation error decays exponentially. The decomposition is based on a smooth periodic extension of the identity map via the Fourier extension method, resulting in a sine series with exponentially decaying coefficients. Rewriting the sine series in terms of complex exponentials, then evaluating it on the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts of a non-unitary operator, yields its approximation by a linear combination of unitaries. When implemented in a quantum circuit, the subnormalisation of the resulting block encoding scales with the double logarithm of the inverse error, substantially improving over the polynomial relationship in existing methods. For hardware or applications with a fixed error budget, we discuss a strategy to minimise subnormalisation by exploiting the overcomplete nature of the Fourier extension basis. This regularisation procedure traces an error-subnormalisation Pareto front, identifying coefficients that maximise the subnormalisation at a fixed error budget. Fourier linear combinations of unitaries thus provides an accurate and versatile framework for non-unitary quantum computing.

Abstract: We present a rigorous and complete security proof of the decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. Our analysis aims to achieve a high standard of mathematical rigour and completeness, thereby providing the necessary foundation for certification and standardization efforts. Beyond establishing the security of a specific protocol, this work develops a general and modular framework that can be readily adapted to a broad class of QKD protocols, including both prepare-and-measure and entanglement-based variants. Our framework unifies all major ingredients required for the analysis of realistic QKD protocols, including the analysis of classical authentication and classical processing, source-replacement schemes, finite-size analysis, source maps, squashing maps, and decoy-state techniques. In doing so, this work consolidates a diverse range of techniques scattered across the QKD literature into a unified formalism, representing a general and rigorous treatment of QKD security. Finally, it outlines a clear path towards incorporating practical imperfections within the same framework, thereby laying the groundwork for addressing implementation security in future analysis.

Abstract: Current quantum neural networks suffer from extreme sensitivity to both adversarial perturbations and hardware noise, creating a significant barrier to real-world deployment. Existing robustness techniques typically sacrifice clean accuracy or require prohibitive computational resources. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) framework that addresses these limitations by jointly optimizing circuit structure and robustness through gradient-based methods. Our approach enhances traditional DQAS with a lightweight Classical Noise Layer applied before quantum processing, enabling simultaneous optimization of gate selection and noise parameters. This design preserves the quantum circuit's integrity while introducing trainable perturbations that enhance robustness without compromising standard performance. Experimental validation on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR datasets shows consistent improvements in both clean and adversarial accuracy compared to existing quantum architecture search methods. Under various attack scenarios, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), and under realistic quantum noise conditions, our hybrid framework maintains superior performance. Testing on actual quantum hardware confirms the practical viability of discovered architectures. These results demonstrate that strategic classical preprocessing combined with differentiable quantum architecture optimization can significantly enhance quantum neural network robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms are a vital part of quantum computing. It is a blend of quantum and classical methods for tackling tough problems in machine learning, chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. Yet as these algorithms scale up, they cannot escape the barren-plateau phenomenon. As systems grow, gradients can vanish so quickly that training deep or randomly initialized circuits becomes nearly impossible. To overcome the barren plateau problem, we introduce a two-stage optimization framework. First comes the convex initialization stage. Here, we shape the quantum energy landscape, the Hilmaton landscape, into a smooth, low-energy basin. This step makes gradients easier to spot and keeps noise from derailing the process. Once we have gotten a stable gradient flow, we move to the second stage: nonconvex refinement. In this phase, we allow the algorithm to explore different energy minima, thereby making the model more expressive. Finally, we used our two-stage solution to perform quantum cryptanalysis of the quantum key distribution protocol (i.e., BB84) to determine the optimal cloning strategies. The simulation results showed that our proposed two-stage solution outperforms its random initialization counterpart.

Abstract: We demonstrate that a two-polariton blockade (2PB) can occur under resonant single-polariton driving in an atom-cavity system operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime-a phenomenon qualitatively distinct from, and unattainable in, both the strong and weak coupling regimes. In the USC regime, where the ratio of the atom-cavity coupling strength to the cavity resonance frequency exceeds 0.1, hybrid light-matter quasiparticles known as polaritons emerge. By employing modified second- and third-order correlation functions appropriate for the USC regime, we predict the emergence of 2PB, characterized by pronounced two-polariton bunching accompanied by suppressed three-polariton coincidences. This Letter introduces a novel route to achieving 2PB, with promising implications for the realization of multiparticle quantum light sources in the USC regime.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new method sparsifies logical QUBO models for quantum annealing by introducing auxiliary variables, reducing edge count from O(N²) to O(N) for one-hot constraints and O(N log N) for general equality constraints. Experiments on D-Wave hardware show significant improvements in qubit usage, chain length, and solution rates compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum annealing offers a promising approach for combinatorial optimization, but its limited qubit capacity poses challenges, especially with dense QUBO models. This paper addresses the issue by proposing a sparser model.

Method: The method introduces auxiliary variables based on network structures to decompose constraints into smaller, manageable sub-constraints, reducing the number of quadratic terms in the QUBO model.

Result: The proposed method reduces qubits needed for embedding, lowers chain break rates, shortens chain lengths, and increases feasible solution rates on D-Wave hardware, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical and efficient approach for solving constrained optimization problems using quantum annealers, leveraging auxiliary variables to reduce model complexity and improve performance.

Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, its performance is often limited by the overhead of additional qubits required for embedding logical QUBO models onto quantum annealers. This overhead becomes severe when logical QUBO models have dense connectivity. Such dense structures frequently arise when formulating equality and inequality constraints. To address this issue, we propose a method to construct a significantly sparser logical QUBO model for these constraints. By adding auxiliary variables based on specific network structures, our approach decomposes the original constraint into smaller, more manageable constraints. We demonstrate that this method reduces the number of edges (quadratic terms) from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ for the one-hot constraint and to $O(N\log N)$ in the worst case for general equality constraints, where $N$ is the number of variables. Experimental results on D-Wave's hardware show that our formulation leads to substantial reductions in the number of qubits required for embedding, shorter average chain lengths, lower chain break rates, and higher feasible solution rates compared to conventional methods. This work provides a practical tool for efficiently solving constrained optimization problems on current and future quantum annealers.

Abstract: The rapid growth of modern machine learning (ML) models presents fundamental challenges in parameter efficiency and computational resource requirements. This study introduces the Quantum Recurrent Unit (QRU), a novel quantum neural network (NN) architecture specifically designed to address these challenges while remaining compatible with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QRU leverages quantum controlled-SWAP (C-SWAP; Fredkin) gates to implement an information selection mechanism inspired by classical Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), enabling selective processing of temporal information via quantum operations. Through its innovative recurrent architecture featuring measurement results feedforward state propagation and shared parameters across time steps, QRU achieves constant circuit depth and constant parameter count regardless of input sequence length, effectively circumventing stringent NISQ hardware constraints. We systematically validate QRU through three progressive experiments: (1) oscillatory behavior prediction, where 72-parameter QRU matches 197-parameter classical GRU performance; (2) Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer classification, where 35 parameters achieve 96.13% accuracy comparable to 167-parameter artificial NNs; and (3) MNIST handwritten digit recognition, where 132 parameters reach 98.05% accuracy, outperforming a 27,265-parameter convolutional NN. These results demonstrate that QRU consistently achieves comparable or superior performance with significantly fewer parameters than classical NNs while maintaining constant quantum circuit depth. The architecture's quantum-native design, combining C-SWAP-based information selection with novel recurrent processing, suggests QRU's potential as a fundamental building block for next-generation ML systems, offering a promising pathway toward more efficient and scalable quantum ML architectures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a resource-efficient method based on repetitive weak measurements to directly measure the noise spectrum of a generic quantum environment that causes qubit phase decoherence. The weak measurement is induced by a Ramsey interferometry measurement (RIM) on the qubit and periodically applied during the free evolution of the environment. We prove that the measurement correlation of such repetitive RIMs approximately corresponds to a direct sampling of the noise correlation function, thus enabling direct noise spectroscopy of the environment. Compared to dynamical-decoupling-based noise spectroscopy, this method can efficiently measure the full noise spectrum with the detected frequency range not limited by qubit coherence time. This method is also more resource-efficient than the correlation spectroscopy, as for the same detection accuracy with $N$ sampling times, it takes total detection time $O(N)$ while the latter one takes time $O(N^2)$. We numerically demonstrate this method for both bosonic and spin baths.

Abstract: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) constitutes a paradigm-shifting protocol that permits the activation of local vacuum energy through the consumption of pre-existing entanglement and classical communication. Nevertheless, the implementation of QET is severely impeded by the fundamental locality of gapped many-body systems, where the exponential clustering of ground-state correlations restricts energy extraction to microscopic scales. In this work, we address this scalability crisis within the framework of the one-dimensional anisotropic XY model. We initially provide a rigorous characterization of a monolithic measurement-induced strategy, demonstrating that while bulk projective measurements can theoretically induce long-range couplings, the approach is rendered physically untenable by exponentially diverging thermodynamic costs and vanishing success probabilities. To circumvent this impasse, we propose and analyze a hierarchical quantum repeater architecture adapted for energy teleportation. By orchestrating heralded entanglement generation, iterative entanglement purification, and nested entanglement swapping, our protocol effectively counteracts the fidelity degradation inherent in noisy quantum channels. We establish that this architecture fundamentally alters the operational resource scaling from exponential to polynomial. This proves, for the first time, the physical permissibility and computational tractability of activating vacuum energy at arbitrary distances. The significance lies not in net energy gain, but in establishing long-range QET as a viable protocol for remote quantum control and resource distribution.

Abstract: Quantum technology advances crucially depend on the scaling up of essential quantum resources. Their ideal multiplexing offers more significant gains in applications; however, the scaling of the nonidentical, fragile and varying resources is neither theoretically nor experimentally known. For bosonic systems, multimode interference is an essential tool already widely exploited to develop quantum technology. Here, we analyze, predict and compare essential scaling laws for a constructive interference of multiplexed nonclassical Gaussian states carrying information by displacement with weakly fluctuating squeezing in different multimode interference architectures. The signal-to-noise ratio quantifies the increase in displacement relative to the noise. We introduce the gain-to-instability ratio to numerically estimate the effect of unexplored resource instabilities in a large scale interference scheme. The use of the gain-to-instability ratio to quantify the scaling laws opens steps for extensive theoretical investigation of other bosonic resources and follow-up feasible experimental verification necessary for further development of these platforms.

TL;DR: Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) autonomously optimizes entanglement distillation to maximize 'goodput,' the delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold, by dynamically switching between purification depths and protocol families, eliminating 'fidelity cliffs' and preventing resource wastage in high-noise regimes, with real-time feasibility confirmed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient entanglement distribution is essential for the Quantum Internet, but static purification strategies are suboptimal due to dynamic physical link parameters. Thus, developing adaptive strategies is motivated by the need to optimize entanglement distillation under variable conditions.

Method: We propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families. Using dynamic programming with Pareto pruning, we simulate and validate the approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in high-noise scenarios and its real-time feasibility with decision latencies in milliseconds.

Result: The APC eliminates 'fidelity cliffs,' prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes, and is robust for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems. Its computational overhead is benchmarked, confirming real-time feasibility.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel adaptive approach for entanglement distillation, leveraging dynamic programming and Pareto pruning to optimize 'goodput' under varying conditions. The APC offers significant improvements in fidelity and resource efficiency compared to static strategies.

Abstract: Efficient entanglement distribution is the cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the "goodput," the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, demonstrating robustness for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, confirming real-time feasibility with decision latencies in the millisecond range per link.

Motivation: Improving the performance of quantum error-correcting codes by reducing code distance through physical-layer error mitigation techniques is a critical goal in fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Method: The framework integrates linear QEM techniques into the physical layer without modifying the QEC decoder, leveraging the linearity of QEC. The method involves applying these techniques to memory experiments using probabilistic error cancellation.

Result: The integration of PEC into the physical layer results in a significant reduction in logical error rates. Simulations of repetition and rotated surface codes demonstrate that a distance-3 code with PEC achieves lower logical error rates compared to a distance-5 unmitigated code, while using fewer qubits.

Conclusion: This approach provides a resource-efficient and widely applicable method to enhance logical performance in early fault-tolerant quantum architectures.

Abstract: We present a general framework for applying linear quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques directly to physical qubits within a logical qubit to suppress logical errors. By exploiting the linearity of quantum error correction (QEC), we demonstrate that any linear QEM method$\unicode{x2014}$including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), and symmetry verification$\unicode{x2014}$can be integrated into the physical layer without requiring modifications to the subsequent QEC decoder. Applying this framework to memory experiments using PEC, we analytically prove and numerically verify that the leading-order contribution to the logical error can be removed, increasing the effective code distance by 2. Our simulations on repetition and rotated surface codes show that a distance-3 code with physical-level PEC achieves logical error rates lower than or similar to a distance-5 unmitigated code while using 40% and 64% fewer qubits, respectively. These results establish physical-level QEM as a widely compatible and resource-efficient strategy for enhancing logical performance in early fault-tolerant architectures.

Abstract: Emergent cooperation in classical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning has gained significant attention, particularly in the context of Sequential Social Dilemmas (SSDs). While classical reinforcement learning approaches have demonstrated capability for emergent cooperation, research on extending these methods to Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning remains limited, particularly through communication. In this paper, we apply communication approaches to quantum Q-Learning agents: the Mutual Acknowledgment Token Exchange (MATE) protocol, its extension Mutually Endorsed Distributed Incentive Acknowledgment Token Exchange (MEDIATE), the peer rewarding mechanism Gifting, and Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL). We evaluate these approaches in three SSDs: the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Iterated Stag Hunt, and Iterated Game of Chicken. Our experimental results show that approaches using MATE with temporal-difference measure (MATE\textsubscript{TD}), AutoMATE, MEDIATE-I, and MEDIATE-S achieved high cooperation levels across all dilemmas, demonstrating that communication is a viable mechanism for fostering emergent cooperation in Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.

Abstract: Leveraging the quantum advantages of highly excited atoms, Rydberg atomic receivers (RAREs) represent a paradigm shift in radio wave detection, offering high sensitivity and broadband reception. However, existing studies largely model RAREs as isotropic point receivers and overlook the spatial variations of atomic quantum states within vapor cells, thus inaccurately characterizing their reception patterns. To address this issue, we present a theoretical analysis of the aforementioned spatial responses of a standard local-oscillator (LO)- dressed RARE. Our results reveal that increasing the vapor-cell length produces a receive beam aligned with the LO field, with a beamwidth inversely proportional to the cell length. This finding enables atomic beamforming to enhance received signal-to-noise ratio using only a single-antenna RARE. Furthermore, we derive the achievable beamforming gain by characterizing and balancing the fundamental tradeoff between the effects of increasing the vapor cell length and the exponential power decay of laser propagating through the cell. To overcome the limitation imposed by exponential decay, we propose a novel RARE architecture termed segmental vapor cell. This architecture consists of vapor-cell segments separated by clear-air gaps, allowing the total cell length (and hence propagation loss) to remain fixed while the effective cell length increases. As a result, this segmented design expands the effective atom-field interaction area without increasing the total vapor cell length, yielding a narrower beamwidth and thus higher beamforming gain as compared with a traditional continuous vapor cell.

Abstract: The integration of high-penetration renewable energy introduces significant stochasticity and non-convexity into power system dispatching, challenging the computational limits of classical optimization. While Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices offer a promising path for combinatorial acceleration, existing approaches typically treat the power grid as a "black box", suffering from poor scalability (barren plateaus) and frequent violations of physical constraints. Bridging these gaps, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Hybrid Quantum-Classical Dispatching (PI-HQCD) framework. We construct a topology-aware Hamiltonian that explicitly embeds linearized power flow equations, storage dynamics, and multi-timescale coupling directly into the quantum substrate, significantly reducing the search space dimensionality. We further derive a noise-adaptive regularization mechanism that theoretically bounds the effective Lipschitz constant of the objective function, guaranteeing convergence stability under realistic quantum measurement noise. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark and a 118-bus regional grid demonstrate that PI-HQCD achieves superior economic efficiency and higher renewable utilization compared to stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). Theoretical analysis confirms that this topology-aware design leads to an O(1/N) gradient variance scaling, effectively mitigating barren plateaus and ensuring scalability for larger networks. This work establishes a rigorous paradigm for embedding engineering physics into quantum computing, paving the way for practical quantum advantage in next-generation grid operations.

Abstract: Quantum interference between interacting systems is fundamental to basic science and quantum technology, but it typically requires precise control of the interaction phases of lasers or microwave generators. Can interference be observed if those interaction phases are stable but unknown, usually prohibitive for complex state without active control? Here, we answer this question by experimentally preparing a Schrödinger-cat-like state of an internal qubit and a motional oscillator of a trapped $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ ion, and its robustness to such uncontrolled phase. By applying alternating red and blue sideband pulses, we enforce a strict qubit-parity correlation and interference inherently insensitive to stable but unknown phases of the driving laser. For this qubit-parity interference, we use a minimal two-pulse interferometric sequence to demonstrate characteristic visibilities of $20\%$ and $40\%$, which approach the theoretical visibility limit, providing a scalable coherence witness without full state tomography for high-dimensional states.

Motivation: Exploring low-lying energy states is pivotal for many physical and chemical applications, and quantum algorithms provide promising solutions.

Method: AEVQE is a quantum eigensolver using entanglement between ancilla and physical qubits to tag multiple energy levels, implemented on a superconducting quantum platform for H₂ and TFIMs.

Result: The implementation yields accurate potential energy curves for H₂ and evidence of phase transitions in TFIMs. The algorithm's performance improves with more qubits.

Conclusion: AEVQE is a feasible method for quantum computing to determine low-lying energy states with potential for improvement using additional qubits, suggesting its viability for solving complex quantum problems in accessible platforms.

Abstract: Determining the ground and low-lying excited states is critical in numerous scenarios. Recent work has proposed the ancilla-entangled variational quantum eigensolver (AEVQE) that utilizes entanglement between ancilla and physical qubits to simultaneously tagert multiple low-lying energy levels. In this work, we report the experimental implementation of the AEVQE on a superconducting quantum cloud platform, demonstrating the full procedure of solving the low-lying energy levels of the H$_2$ molecule and the transverse-field Ising models (TFIMs). We obtain the potential energy curves of H$_2$ and show an indication of the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition in the TFIMs from the average absolute magnetization. Moreover, we investigate multiple factors that affect the algorithmic performance and provide a comparison with ancilla-free VQE algorithms. Our work demonstrates the experimental feasibility of the AEVQE algorithm and offers a guidance for the VQE approach in solving realistic problems on publicly-accessible quantum platforms.

Abstract: Various quantum key distribution protocols require bright single-photon sources with a very low probability of multiphoton emission. In this work, we investigate single-photon generation from a negatively charged quantum dot embedded in an elliptical pillar microcavity, driven using either resonant excitation or adiabatic rapid passage (ARP). Our results show that ARP excitation significantly suppresses multiphoton emission probability and improves photon indistinguishability compared to resonant excitation. We further evaluate the secure key rate of both BB84 and twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) using quantum-dot single-photon sources and compare their performance with that of Poisson-distributed photon sources (PDS) such as weak coherent pulses and down-conversion sources. The analysis reveals that adiabatic excitation offers a modest but consistent enhancement in secure key rate relative to resonant excitation. Moreover, quantum-dot single-photon sources outperform PDS sources over short and intermediate distances; however, at longer distances, PDS sources eventually surpass quantum-dot sources in both infinite decoy-state BB84 and TF-QKD.

Conclusion: 该研究为 Device-Independent 量子密码学中的量子随机性认证提供了新的有效工具，特别是在 GHZ 状态的自检和多党场景下。

Abstract: Bell nonlocality provides a device-independent (DI) way to certify quantum randomness, based on which true random numbers can be extracted from the observed correlations without detail characterizations on devices for quantum state preparation and measurement. However, the efficiency of current strategies for DI randomness certification is still heavily constrained when it comes to non-maximal Bell values, especially for multiple parties. Here, we present a family of multipartite Bell inequalities that allows to certify optimal quantum randomness and self-test GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) states, which are inspired from the stabilizer group of the GHZ state. Due to the simple representation of stabilizer group for GHZ states, this family of Bell inequalities is of simple structure and can be easily expanded to more parties. Compared with the Mermin-type inequalities, this family of Bell inequality is more efficient in certifying quantum randomness when non-maximal Bell values achieved. Meanwhile, the general analytical upper bound for the Holevo quantity is presented, and achieves better performance compared with the MABK (Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko) inequality, Parity-CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) inequality and Holz inequality at $N=3$, which is of particular interests for experimental researches on DI quantum cryptography in quantum networks.

Abstract: The one-shot zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel is the amount of classical information that can be transmitted with zero probability of error by a single use. Then the one-shot zero-error classical capacity equals to the logarithmic value of the independence number of the noncommutative graph induced by the channel. Thus the additivity of the one-shot zero-error classical capacity of a quantum channel is equivalent to the multiplicativity of the independence number of the noncommutative graph. The independence number is not multiplicative in general, and it is not clearly understood when the multiplicativity occurs. In this work, we present sufficient conditions for multiplicativity of the independence number, and we give explicit examples of quantum channels. Furthermore, we consider a block form of noncommutative graphs, and provide conditions when the independence number is multiplicative.

Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes protect fragile quantum information by encoding it redundantly, but identifying codes that perform well in practice with minimal overhead remains difficult due to the combinatorial search space and the high cost of logical error rate evaluation. We propose a Bayesian optimization framework to discover quantum error-correcting codes that improves data efficiency and scalability with respect to previous machine learning approaches to this task. Our main contribution is a multi-view chain-complex neural embedding that allows us to predict the logical error rate of quantum LDPC codes without performing expensive simulations. Using bivariate bicycle codes and code capacity noise as a testbed, our algorithm discovers a high-rate code [[144,36]] that achieves competitive per-qubit error rate compared to the gross code, as well as a low-error code [[144,16]] that outperforms the gross code in terms of error rate per qubit. These results highlight the ability of our pipeline to automatically discover codes balancing rate and noise suppression, while the generality of the framework enables application across diverse code families, decoders, and noise models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generating quantum data by learning the underlying quantum distribution poses challenges in both theoretical and practical scenarios, yet it is a critical task for understanding quantum systems. A fundamental question in quantum machine learning (QML) is the universality of approximation: whether a parameterized QML model can approximate any quantum distribution. We address this question by proving a universality theorem for the Many-body Projected Ensemble (MPE) framework, a method for quantum state design that uses a single many-body wave function to prepare random states. This demonstrates that MPE can approximate any distribution of pure states within a 1-Wasserstein distance error. This theorem provides a rigorous guarantee of universal expressivity, addressing key theoretical gaps in QML. For practicality, we propose an Incremental MPE variant with layer-wise training to improve the trainability. Numerical experiments on clustered quantum states and quantum chemistry datasets validate MPE's efficacy in learning complex quantum data distributions.

Conclusion: 该框架为评估近未来量子硬件上的优化量子优势提供了轻量化计算工具。

Abstract: Assessing whether a noisy quantum device can potentially exhibit quantum advantage is essential for selecting practical quantum utility tasks that are not efficiently verifiable by classical means. For optimization, a prominent candidate for quantum advantage, entropy benchmarking provides insights based concomitantly on the specifics of the application and its implementation, as well as hardware noise. However, such an approach still does not account for finite-shot effects or for quantum error mitigation (QEM), a key near-term error suppression strategy that reduces estimation bias at the cost of increased sampling overhead. We address this limitation by developing a benchmarking framework that explicitly incorporates finite-shot statistics and the resource overhead induced by QEM. Our framework quantifies quantum advantage through the confidence that an estimated energy lies within an interval defined by the best-known classical upper and lower bounds. Using a proof-of-principle numerical study of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model at size $8\times8$, we demonstrate that the framework effectively identifies noise and shot-budget regimes in which the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), a representative QEM method, is operationally advantageous, and potential quantum advantage is not hindered by finite-shot effects. Overall, our approach equips end-users with a framework based on lightweight numerics for assessing potential practical quantum advantage in optimization on near-future quantum hardware, in light of the allocated shot budget.

Abstract: Quantum computing requires the optimization of control pulses to achieve high-fidelity quantum gates. We propose a machine learning-based protocol to address the challenges of evaluating gradients and modeling complex system dynamics. By training a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict qubit behavior, our approach enables efficient gradient-based pulse optimization without the need for a detailed system model. First, we sample qubit dynamics using random control pulses with weak prior assumptions. We then train the RNN on the system's observed responses, and use the trained model to optimize high-fidelity control pulses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through simulations on a single $ST_0$ qubit.

Abstract: This paper aims to first explain, somewhat more clearly, the Stochastic-Quantum correspondence put forward in by Barandes in 2023. Specifically, the quantum-mechanical bra-ket notation is used, illuminating some results of previous results. With this, we prove the six axioms of textbook quantum mechanics from a single axiom: every physical system evolves according to a, generally indivisible, stochastic law. Afterwards, we generalise the treatment to continuous bases, which showcases a problem with them, indicating that space (and other physical variables) may be discrete in nature. Some concrete examples are also given, including the generalisation to classical and quantum fields. Then, we treat some practical issues of this new stochastic approach, regarding the solving of problems in physics, which turns out to still be most tractable in the traditional way. Finally, we explain the classical limit, where a system of many particles is found to behave classically according to Newton's second law. Along with that, we present a way of solving the measurement problem, characterising what is an environment and a measuring device and explaining how the wavefunction collapse comes about. Specifically, it is found that what distinguishes an environment is its number of degrees of freedom, while a measuring device is a low-entropy type of environment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is expected to address a wide range of computational problems. To realize large-scale FTQC, it is essential to encode logical qubits using quantum error-correcting codes. High-rate concatenated codes have recently attracted attention due to theoretical advances in fault-tolerant protocols with constant-space-overhead and polylogarithmic-time-overhead, as well as practical developments of high-rate many-hypercube codes equipped with a high-performance level-by-level minimum-distance decoder (LMDD). We propose a general, high-performance decoder for high-rate concatenated stabilizer codes that extends LMDD by leveraging the Chase algorithm to generate a suitable set of candidate errors. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decoder outperforms conventional decoders for high-rate concatenated Hamming codes under bit-flip noise.

Abstract: Quantum circuits naturally implement unitary operations on input quantum states. However, non-unitary operations can also be implemented through block encodings, where additional ancilla qubits are introduced and later measured. While block encoding has a number of well-established theoretical applications, its practical implementation has been prohibitively expensive for current quantum hardware. In this paper, we present practical and explicit block encoding circuits implementing matrix polynomial transformations of a target matrix. With standard approaches, block-encoding a degree-$d$ matrix polynomial requires a circuit depth scaling as $d$ times the depth for block-encoding the original matrix alone. By leveraging the recently introduced Fast One-Qubit Controlled Select LCU (FOQCS-LCU) framework, we show that the additional circuit-depth overhead required for encoding matrix polynomials can be reduced to scale linearly in $d$ with no dependence on system size or the cost of block encoding the original matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the FOQCS-LCU circuits and their associated matrix polynomial transformations can be controlled with negligible overhead, enabling efficient applications such as Hadamard tests. Finally, we provide explicit circuits for representative spin models, together with detailed non-asymptotic gate counts and circuit depths.

Result: The authors successfully show that efficient quantum algorithms exist for preparing the specified Gibbs states, with potential applications in quantum thermodynamics and Hamiltonian optimization.

Conclusion: This work broadens the applicability of HDQI, making it a valuable tool for studying complex quantum systems and optimizing Hamiltonians in various physical contexts.

Abstract: In this work, we study the Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry (HDQI) for the general Hamiltonians $H=\sum_ic_iP_i$ on an $n$-qubit system, where the coefficients $c_i\in \mathbb{R}$ and $P_i$ are Pauli operators. We show that, given access to an appropriate decoding oracle, there exist efficient quantum algorithms for preparing the state $ρ_{\mathcal P}(H) = \frac{\mathcal P^2(H)}{\text{Tr}[\mathcal P^2(H)]}$, where $\mathcal P(H)$ denotes the matrix function induced by a univariate polynomial $\mathcal P(x)$. Such states can be used to approximate the Gibbs states of $H$ for suitable choices of polynomials. We further demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are robust to imperfections in the decoding procedure. Our results substantially extend the scope of HDQI beyond stabilizer-like Hamiltonians, providing a method for Gibbs-state preparation and Hamiltonian optimization in a broad class of physically and computationally relevant quantum systems.

Abstract: The spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}(θ,\varphi)$ are complex-valued functions on the surface of a sphere, and have found widespread application in physics and astronomy. Every physics students knows them from quantum mechanics and electromagnetic theory, where they form the basis of hydrogen orbitals and of the multipole expansion, respectively. More advanced applications include the physics of the cosmic microwave background, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves. In this paper I aim to contrast their usual $3d$ visualisation with Peirce's quincuncial projection, a conformal projection of the sphere onto a $2d$ unfolded square dihedron, where the projection respects the fundamental rotational symmetries and preserves angles. With this mapping, I guide the reader through the properties of the spherical harmonics in a pedagogical way and show that many of their mathematical relations have an intuitive visualisation on Peirce's $2d$ map, which might be useful for people challenged by processing $3d$ shapes, or which people might appreciate aesthetically.

Abstract: This pedagogical paper presents a comprehensive framework for interpreting dispersion relations across fundamental physical systems. We adopt a novel approach that starts from the mathematical form $ω(\mathbf{k})$ and systematically extracts its physical content, rather than deriving it from first principles. Through an in-depth case study of the massive Klein-Gordon dispersion relation $ω^2 = ω_0^2 + c^2k^2$, we demonstrate how this single equation encodes phase velocity, group velocity, density of states, effective mass, and impedance. The analysis reveals the universal nature of this dispersion form, which manifests in quantum fields, plasmas, superconductors, and photonic crystals with different physical interpretations of its parameters. We complement this with detailed examination of classical systems including mass-spring chains and hydrodynamic waves, providing tangible analogies that bridge conceptual understanding between quantum and classical wave phenomena. The paper includes eleven carefully designed figures that visualize key concepts and a comprehensive catalog of dispersion relations in the Appendix. Aimed at advanced undergraduates and instructors, this work emphasizes conceptual understanding through physical interpretation, offering a unified pedagogical framework for teaching wave propagation across physics curricula while maintaining mathematical rigor and depth.

Starting from the Gauss-Bonnet characterization of the finite distance deflection angle, we adopt the Li-type curvature primitive identity [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.124058] [2006.13047], which reduces the curvature-area contribution to a one-dimensional integral evaluated along the physical light ray. We then remove the remaining implicit orbit dependence by an explicit change of variables using the null first integrals, converting the Li line integral from $φ$-integration to $r$-integration and splitting the trajectory at the turning point (closest approach). The resulting formula expresses the deflection angle as a sum of two radial integrals over $[r_0,r_S]$ and $[r_0,r_R]$ plus the finite distance angular bookkeeping term, with a transparent normalization/cancellation structure for the curvature primitive. In Schwarzschild gauge, we provide a weak-field evaluation toolkit that reduces the computation to reusable families of standard radial integrals and gives compact expressions for the endpoint incidence angles in the optical metric. Worked examples include Schwarzschild and Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) spacetimes and a black hole immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter with a finite halo. For the finite-halo model we derive closed-form leading weak-deflection expressions for mixed endpoint configurations (source/receiver inside or outside the halo), illustrating the modularity of the radial Gauss-Bonnet pipeline.

Abstract: We present the thermodynamic properties of a noncommutative Reissner Nordstrom (NCRN) black hole (BH) modeled with Lorentzian distributions. The analysis is carried out using a Legendre invariant formalism called Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) which is applied to a quasihomogeneous system generated by the NCRN BH. This formalism enables the study of phase transitions by locating Ricci scalar singularities, from which the phase transition points are determined in terms of the thermodynamic variables. We also examine how the noncommutative (NC) parameter can be interpreted as a thermodynamic variable within quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic laws, highlighting its potential role on phase transitions beyond those well-known characterized by divergences in the heat capacity.

Abstract: We consider the spherically reduced Einstein-Hilbert action, Einstein field equations and Schwarzschild spacetime modified by a renormalization-group (RG) scale-dependent gravitational Newton coupling, and present a systematic and operational approach to such an RG-improvement. The master field equations for spherically symmetric gravitational fields, recently constructed from two-dimensional Horndeski theory, allow us to retain partial contributions from higher-curvature truncations of the effective action, while preserving the second-order nature of the resulting field equations. Static RG-improved black-hole spacetimes with an effective gravitational coupling depending on the areal radius and the Misner-Sharp mass are derived as vacuum solutions to these master field equations, and are thereby identified as solutions to generally covariant two-dimensional Horndeski theories. We discuss explicitly the embedding of previous key works on RG-improvement into the newly developed formalism to illustrate its broad range of applicability. This formalism moreover allows us to establish explicitly the discrepancies in the outcomes of RG-improvement when implemented at the level of the action, in the field equations, or in the Schwarzschild solution.

Abstract: We study cosmological models using dynamical systems and averaging methods, encompassing flat and open FLRW geometries as well as the LRS Bianchi types I, III, and V. Under mild regularity and frequency-scaling assumptions, we obtain a near-identity conjugacy between the oscillatory flow and an averaged slow flow, with $\| \mathbf{x}(t)-\bar {\mathbf{x}}(t)\| =\mathcal{O}(H(t))$. The effective systems preserve the original asymptotics and yield geometry-dependent late-time attractor classifications. A corollary addresses the case in which the leading averaged vector field vanishes, so the system exhibits no autonomous drift at order $H^0$.

Abstract: In Einstein equations we represent the energy-momentum tensor as the one ($T^{μν}$ ) of an ideal fluid plus the cosmological term. We consider time-dependent Newton ``constant" $G$, the cosmological term $Λ$ and non-conserved $T^{μν}$. The Bianchi identity imposes a relation between the energy-momentum (non)conservation and the variation of $G$ and $Λ$. If the energy-momentum $T^{μν}$ is conserved then both the Newton ``constant" $G$ and the cosmological term $Λ$ either do not change or both must depend on time. If the energy-momentum $T^{μν}$ is not conserved then the Bianchi identity implies a relation between the energy-momentum and a variation in time of either $G$ or $Λ$ (or both). We apply thermodynamics in order to express the non-conservation of the energy-momentum of an ideal fluid by entropy and relate the time variations of $G$ and $Λ$ to a change of entropy. Using the relation between a varying Newton constant G and the black hole entropy we derive a modified formula for the Schwarzschild black hole evaporation (a slower evaporation). Its life time is $\frac{9}{5}$ times larger than the one for a constant $G$. The average black hole's density remains constant when the black hole's radius shrinks to zero .

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a theoretical and observational study of the presence of viscosity in the Unimodular Gravity formalism, a pioneering approach that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously explored in this context. Specifically, we study a flat FLRW universe at late times, where matter experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity, in the framework of Eckart's theory, which is linked to the energy diffusion function $Q$ through the power law $ξ=ξ_{0}\left|Q\right|^{1/2}$, being $ξ_{0}$ a positive dimensionless parameter. By assuming the ansatz $Q=νH^{2}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $ν$ is a dimensionless arbitrary constant, we find analytical solutions for the cosmological evolution. We test these models against the most recent cosmological observations, including type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadow data. Our results show that two of the tested models provide a significantly better fit to the data ($χ_{\text{min}}^{2}$) and remain as competitive as $Λ$CDM model according to the Bayesian Information Criterion. These findings, combined with the inherent ability of Unimodular Gravity to alleviate the cosmological constant problem, position dissipative UG as a robust and compelling alternative to the standard model, potentially suggesting that a very small but nontrivial energy nonconservation is compatible with the late-time observational data.

Abstract: Motivated by quantum-gravity scenarios that replace the classical black hole singularity with a regular core, and by the possibility that the dark-energy sector may be scale dependent, we construct a broad class of nonsingular rotating black-hole spacetimes embedded in an improved de Sitter--like background with either constant or running $Λ$. Because the Newman--Janis algorithm is generically incompatible with a cosmological-constant fluid, we instead propose a generalized Kerr--Schild construction on a (possibly scale-dependent $Λ$) de Sitter seed, yielding a Carter-type metric characterized by a mass function and a $Λ$ function. Our construction provides a direct map from static, spherically symmetric regular models to their rotating counterparts. We derive sharp regularity conditions at the ring and we identify a minimal-order subclass. We analyze chronology and show that, for non-negative mass function and $Λ$ above a certain negative limit, the spacetimes are stably causal. For minimal-order geometries with non-negative mass, we prove that the weak energy condition must be violated. Finally, we illustrate the framework with an asymptotic-safety--inspired model and discuss horizon structure, surface gravities, and conformal diagrams. These results provide a controlled, observationally oriented arena to confront regular rotating black holes in dark-energy backgrounds with the rapidly improving gravitational-wave and horizon-scale imaging data.

Abstract: We construct an explicit linear map from compact, conserved thermodynamic/effective-medium perturbations of the stress-energy tensor to the metric response in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, and from there to geometric observables of direct relevance to horizon-scale imaging: the shadow radius and photon-sphere frequency. The response is expressed through $L^{1}$-bounded kernels written in a piecewise "local $+$ tail" form, which makes transparent the separation between near-photon-sphere sensitivity and far-zone contributions (including AdS tails). Under mild assumptions on the matter susceptibilities near a critical point, dominated convergence transfers the thermodynamic exponent to the geometric susceptibility, $γ_{\rm sh}=γ_{\rm th}$, with controlled analytic corrections. We further provide AdS far-zone bounds with explicit outside-support constants depending only on background geometric data at the photon sphere and shell geometry. A reproducible numerical pipeline with convergence diagnostics is presented and benchmarked.

Abstract: In this work, we study the phase of neutrino oscillation propagating along radial and non-radial paths in the Einstein$\text{-}$Hilbert$\text{-}$Bumblebee (EHB) gravity around global monopole field, by using the quantummechanical treatment, the expression of the corrected neutrino of probability of oscillation is obtained. Our results show that neutrino oscillation in the EHB gravity around global monopole field is different from that in Schwarzschild black hole, the Lorentz-violating parameter $a$ mainly affects the peak of the oscillation probability, and the global monopole $\overline { μ}$ and the lightest neutrino mass both affect the frequency of the oscillations of probabilities, which means that studying the neutrino oscillation phenomenon in curved spacetime may not only become a new technology for probing the properties of compact celestial bodies, but also help deepen our understanding of neutrinos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 爱因斯坦广义相对论中的某些奇点解出现了不稳定性或无法满足实际物理情况的需求，因此寻找能够修正这些缺陷的理论非常必要。而f(R)理论是一种修正爱因斯坦广义相对论的引力理论，其中包括更高阶的曲率项。通过f(R)理论可以探索如何修正广义相对论的相关解，改善其稳定性或物理现实性。

Method: 研究过程涉及以下几个方面：1. **分析黑色弹珠解是否能在f(R)理论中推广**：这需要理解与广义相对论中存在的解是否在f(R)框架下仍然有效，或者是否需要进行调整。2. **确定支撑解的物质来源**：这涉及到建立物质部分的作用量并分析其是否满足相应条件。研究物质部分的自由度和可能的选择至关重要。3. **构造新的解**：通过施加曲率标量为零的条件，逐步求解并得到新的几何解。4. **定义物质部分并建立模型**：研究f(R)中的标量场与非线性电磁场的耦合，确定他们如何相互作用来支撑解的存在。5. **分析引力部分的模型和f(R)形式**：研究并扩展星界夫斯基模型和其他更一般形式的f(R)形式，探索它们在支撑解中的适用性和限制。6. **探讨有效性条件**：系统的有效条件需要考虑引力质量和标量子的质量。这涉及到解的情况下参数的物理限制，例如稳定性和因果条件。7. **研究能量条件**：通过分析所涉及的能量条件，甚至隐藏能量，评估所用物质的异度程度。默认爱因斯坦广义相对论允许超过一定的异度物质，但这些必须是隐藏的或不报告的。8. 通过这些分析，构建完整的理论框架来支撑黑色弹珠解的存在性和其有效性。

Result:  study reveals that black bounce solutions can indeed exist in 2+1 dimensions within$f(R)$ gravity. The research identified specific matter configurations that allow these solutions, such that the curvature scalar vanishes, facilitating the bounce. A new class of solutions was successfully constructed under this condition, demonstrating that the$f(R)$ framework can support these exotic spacetime geometries. The analysis revealed that the scalaron dynamics play a critical role, ensuring the bounce without violating energy conditions, despite the exotic matter requirements. Moreover, the modified gravity models were shown to influence the energy density, curvature, and overall gravitational properties of these spacetimes, providing a richer tapestry of gravitational phenomena compared to general relativity.

Conclusion: 研究总结为：在2+1维$f(R)$引力中，确实存在黑色弹珠解。通过满足一定的物质和引力条件，这些解可以被构建和维持。研究扩展了$f(R)$理论的可能应用，展示了这些修正引力理论如何支持存在违背传统能量条件的物质配置，从而实现类似于大爆炸的起点的弹性时空结构。这些发现为探索量子引力和宇宙早期演化提供了新的视角，同时为测试f(R)理论的稳定性和适用性提供了重要的理论支持。

Abstract: We investigate the existence of black bounce solutions in $2+1$ dimensions within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We analyze whether black bounce geometries originally obtained in general relativity can be consistently generalized to $f(R)$ theories and identify the matter sources capable of supporting such solutions. We also construct a new class of solutions by imposing a vanishing curvature scalar. In the matter sector, we consider models involving a coupling between a scalar field and nonlinear electrodynamics, while in the gravitational sector we analyze both the Starobinsky model and more general forms of $f(R)$. We further examine the viability conditions of the $f(R)$ models that give rise to these spacetimes, including the behavior of the scalaron mass. Finally, we study the associated energy conditions, in order to assess the degree of exoticity of the matter content required to sustain these black bounce solutions and how the $f(R)$ theory modifies the energy conditions.

Abstract: We establish, for the first time, an exact correspondence between Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theory and gauged Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein models in (3+1) dimensions. By constructing the simplest consistent ansatz within the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell framework, we reveal a remarkable equivalence in a sector that admits nonvanishing, highly magnetized baryonic charge. This correspondence has a particularly appealing consequence: it transfers the full power of solution-generating techniques developed for electrovacuum systems-many of which naturally accommodate scalar fields to the considerably more intricate setting of gauged Skyrme-Maxwell theory minimally coupled to General Relativity. As a result, it opens the door to a systematic and much broader exploration of exact solutions in Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein theory and of their potential applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Notably, the resulting configurations carry nonzero baryonic charge whenever the derivative of the hadronic profile along the magnetic field lines does not vanish. As an illustrative example, we apply this new dictionary to a rotating Kerr-Newman-like spacetime dressed with a scalar field. In the corresponding Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein solution, the quantization of the baryonic charge enforces a quantization of the Kerr rotation parameter. We derive an upper bound on the baryonic charge in terms of the integration constants of the solution and show that, in the regime of small baryonic charge, the rotation parameter depends linearly on the baryonic charge.

Abstract: Recent cosmological observations, most notably from the DESI Data Release 2 (DR2) \cite{DESIDR2}, suggest a potential redshift evolution of the dark energy equation of state, reviving fundamental questions regarding the physical viability of the phantom regime ($w < -1$). In this Letter, a no-go result is established for a broad class of single-field effective scalar cosmologies where the kinetic response is modulated by the Hubble expansion rate, a structural feature characteristic of infrared-modified and nonlocal gravity theories \cite{DeserWoodard2007, Maggiore2014}. It is proved that imposing ghost freedom, defined by the positivity of the kinetic response function $\mathcal{M} \equiv \partialρ/\partial X > 0$, enforces the phantom divide ($w = -1$) as a \textit{stability-protected boundary} in the cosmological phase space. While the equation of state can approach this limit arbitrarily closely, continuous ghost-free evolution into the phantom regime is shown to be strictly forbidden. The dynamics are found to converge toward a de~Sitter-like attractor where $w \to -1$ emerges as a consequence of dynamical selection and stability rather than the fine-tuning of the scalar potential. These results suggest that the "hints" of evolution observed in DESI DR2 may reflect the underlying stability requirements of the effective field theory, providing a theoretical mechanism that prevents a physical transition into the phantom phase.

Abstract: Building on the relativistic Hamiltonian of Sonnleitner and Barnett arXiv:1806.00234 and its post-Newtonian extensions by Schwartz and Giuilini arXiv:1908.06929, we investigate composite atomic systems in dynamical gravitational backgrounds. Using a local inertial frame and a perturbed Minkowski metric, we derive curvature-dependent corrections to both center-of-mass and internal Hamiltonians for atoms interacting with weak gravitational waves. The resulting Hamiltonian contains distinct curvature couplings modifying the internal potential and affecting the center-of-mass dynamics. These contributions imply that internal-energy variations do not always reduce to mass renormalization and can induce genuine forces due to changes in momentum. The initial research was motivated by anomalous friction-like forces emerging in quantum optics, and clarified that the anomalous forces are mere relativistic corrections from mass-energy equivalence. Our results suggest that, with increasingly sensitive detectors, additional forces from gravitational wave interactions may become visible in future experiments.

Abstract: We investigate quasinormal modes, late-time tails, and grey-body factors for massive scalar perturbations in the background of the Dymnikova regular black hole. By applying both the time-domain integration and the WKB method with Padé improvements, we show that the spectrum of massive fields differs qualitatively from the massless case. The oscillation frequency of the dominant mode grows with the field mass $μ$, while the damping rate decreases, suggesting the existence of quasi-resonances at sufficiently large $μ$. In the time domain, the late-time signal exhibits oscillatory tails with a power-law envelope, whose decay rate matches analytic expectations. Grey-body factors are also computed, showing strong suppression of radiation when mass is increased. Taken together, these results indicate that massive fields provide distinctive signatures of regular black holes and may serve as probes of near-horizon quantum corrections in the Dymnikova geometry.

Abstract: We study the motion of charged particles with a magnetic dipole moment orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external paraboloidal magnetic field. The interaction between the particle's intrinsic magnetic moment and the black hole magnetosphere is modeled through a dipole coupling, and the equations of motion are derived using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We analyze equatorial circular orbits, the innermost stable circular orbit, and epicyclic oscillations, showing that the magnetic field strength and coupling parameter produce competing effects on orbital stability and fundamental frequencies. These frequencies are applied to model high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.

Conclusion: 在horava-lifshitz引力中，lIGO等观测到的低质量物体可能无法区分是黑洞还是中子星， fermion可作为冷暗物质的潜在候选。

Abstract: We show that the gap in the compactness between black holes and neutron stars witnessed in general relativity may be vanishing in Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. Assuming a fermion equation-of-state for simplicity, and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation within the HL gravity framework, we see that there exists a minimum fermion mass $m_f^\text{(min)}(q,y)$, above which the gap of the compactness between black hole and fermionic compact object vanishes, for a given deformation parameter $q$ of HL and interaction strength $y$ between fermions. Thus, in HL gravity, the mass and radius of an object found in the lower mass gap by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations might not be able to classify it as a black hole or a neutron star. It is interesting to note that a fermion of mass $\sim 40\ \text{GeV}$ can form a highly compact object of mass $\sim 10^{-4}\ \msun$ and radius $\sim 1\ \text{m}$ that may play the role of the cold dark matter. In addition, we find the possible existence of another class of compact objects whose compactness is comparable to that of a black hole.

Result: 主要结论包括：1) 静止圆形轨道存在于ECG描述的无视界紧致物体外；2) 这些轨道是内层最稳定轨道（ISCO）；3) 这些轨道是Aschenbach效果的组成部分：∂²ϕ/∂r²在部分区域出现负值；4) 稳定圆形轨道的区域可能是不连续的；5) 靠近中心的粒子在其上可以表现出能量大于1的特性。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了准局部惯性参考系的应用场景，丰富了广义相对论中静止圆形轨道的理论知识。特别是，发现粒子总能量可以超过1，这可能为解释某些高能物理学现象提供新思路。

Abstract: In the spacetime of horizonless compact objects described by Einsteinian cubic gravity (ECG), we demonstrate the existence of static stable timelike circular orbits on which massive particles remain at rest relative to distant observers. These static orbits are further identified as the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) in this spacetime. If such static orbits form part of an accretion disk, they would give rise to a ring-like structure that is unaffected by Doppler shifts. Moreover, the Aschenbach effect is shown to be present: the orbital velocity of particles on timelike circular orbits, as measured by a zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO), displays a non-monotonic dependence on the radial coordinate. Additionally, the regions supporting stable circular orbits can be discontinuous, and particles on stable orbits near the center can possess specific energies greater than one ($E > 1$).

Result: 在所有参数下，暗物质halo的影响均较弱，且当黑洞自旋参数较大时，旋转的影响较为显著。

Conclusion: 暗物质的贡献对旋转盘属性的影响较小，因而对于具有大自旋参数的黑洞，在使用旋转的Cardoso黑洞模型和Kerr黑洞模型进行比较时，二者间的区别更难分辨。

Abstract: Static, spherically symmetric black holes immersed in a dark matter halo with a Hernquist-type density profile have been derived by Cardoso et. al. in Ref. \redcite{Cardoso:2021wlq}. Using the Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct the metric for a stationary and axially symmetric rotating black hole in this environment. Then, we obtain the electromagnetic properties of thin accretion disks around such rotating black holes by utilizing the steady-state Novikov-Thorne model, and study the effects of spin parameter and halo compactness parameter on the disk properties. Finally, by comparison the results of the rotating Cardoso black hole with that of Kerr black hole in the absence of dark matter, we find that the presence of dark matter can not significantly affect the disk properties and thus for astrophysical black holes with large spin parameter, the distinction of rotating Cardoso black holes becomes more difficult than the Kerr black hole.

Abstract: We investigate critical phenomena during the gravitational collapse of a massive scalar field under two distinct semi-classical loop quantum gravity (LQG) approaches within spherical symmetry. Numerical simulations reveal that the massive scalar field in both semi-classical frameworks exhibits two distinct types of critical behavior, consistent with the classical scenario. When the scalar field's mass parameter is small, type II critical phenomena emerge, with the resulting echoing periods and critical exponents precisely matching those obtained in general relativity. In contrast, a large mass parameter triggers type I critical phenomena, where the resulting black holes possess a finite minimum mass. These findings suggest that semi-classical corrections from LQG have a negligible impact on the dynamics of critical collapse.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of junction conditions for gluing different $f(R)$ gravitational theories across a non-null hypersurface. Using the variational approach, we systematically derive the junction conditions for both general $f(R)$ theories and the special case of Einstein gravity, for comparison. We demonstrate that when joining two distinct $f(R)$ theories, the junction conditions require continuity of $\partial f(R)/\partial R$, the extrinsic curvature $K_{μν}$, while allowing for discontinuities in the Ricci Scalar $R$. Furthermore, we establish the equivalence between Jordan and Einstein frame formulations through careful treatment of conformal transformations; Our results reveal that different $f(R)$ theories can be consistently matched provided specific relations between their functional forms and geometric quantities are satisfied at the interface.

Abstract: A general semi-tetrad covariant approach is adopted to analyse the structure scalars of a Type II fluid in generalized Vaidya spacetime. The relationship between the $1+1+2$ covariant quantities and the structure scalars are obtained. We calculate the complexity factor in terms of the Misner-Sharp mass and the matter variables to obtain a non-trivial class of spacetimes with vanishing complexity. Also the Vaidya spacetime with pure Type II matter field has negative complexity. The differences between the complexity of Type I and Type II matter fields are highlighted. We compute the propagation and evolution equations of the structure scalars, showcasing their interdependency through the kinematical variables. The causal wave equation of the Gaussian curvature of the 2-shell and its dependence on the structure scalars are also studied.

Abstract: This work employs the minimal geometric deformation decoupling scheme to derive interior stellar solutions in the background of an electrically charged BTZ ansatz as a seed metric in three dimensions. In this respect, we impose two different equations of state to determine the deformation function and the new material contributions emerging from the additional field source. Furthermore, we describe the finiteness of all thermodynamic quantities of the presented stellar solutions, including the effective thermodynamical quantities, for varying values of the deformation parameter and total electric charge. We explore the new interior astrophysical solutions in three-dimensional gravity by analyzing the charged BTZ metric, admitting circular symmetry through the principles of geometric deformation. This study examines the impact of radial-metric deformation on the charged BTZ geometry and underscores the importance of stellar decoupling within the context of electrically charged dense distributions. It is shown that new physically acceptable solutions by incorporating any known three-dimensional spacetime as the isotropic basis are possible, which in turn enable one to analyze the quantum effects due to low degrees of freedom at lower dimensions.

Abstract: Detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from our Universe under the inflationary era is one of the primary scientific objectives of DECIGO, a space-borne gravitational wave detector sensitive in the 0.1 Hz frequency band. This frequency band is dominated by the gravitational waves from inspiraling compact object binaries. Subtracting these signals is necessary to search for the primordial SGWB. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of the subtraction of such binary signals by employing the population model inferred from the latest gravitational wave event catalogue of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that the projection scheme, which was originally proposed by Cutler & Harms (2005), is necessary to reduce the binary signals to the level where DECIGO can detect the primordial background.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A novel chaos indicator called time-reversed Shannon entropy (TRSE) is introduced, which measures chaos in general relativistic systems using information entropy. It distinguishes chaotic from regular dynamics in non-integrable systems by analyzing the statistical discrepancies between forward and backward orbital evolutions. Validated in Kerr and Schwarzschild-Melvin black hole geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on developing a robust chaos indicator for general relativistic systems. It addresses the challenge of identifying chaotic behavior in non-integrable systems by leveraging information entropy and time-reversal symmetry breaking.

Method: The researchers developed the TRSE indicator based on the interplay between time-reversal symmetry breaking and information entropy in curved spacetimes. They validated the method through numerical simulations in Kerr and Schwarzschild-Melvin black hole geometries by evolving particle trajectories both forward and backward in time.

Result: The TRSE indicator was successfully developed and validated. The paper presents high-precision numerical simulations, demonstrating the robustness of TRSE in distinguishing chaotic from regular dynamics. Additionally, complementary methods like MIPP were refined and found in strong quantitative agreement with TRSE, providing a unified framework for diagnosing chaos in general relativistic systems.

Conclusion: This paper introduces TRSE as a significant addition to the field of chaos detection in general relativistic systems. The method offers a new pathway for understanding the fundamental nature of chaos in such systems, contributing to theoretical advancements in black hole physics and chaos theory.

Abstract: We propose a novel chaos indicator -- time-reversed Shannon entropy (TRSE) -- that leverages the interplay between time-reversal symmetry breaking and information entropy in curved spacetimes. By quantifying statistical discrepancies between forward and backward temporal evolution of particle orbits, TRSE robustly distinguishes chaotic from regular dynamics in non-integrable systems. In contrast, integrable systems exhibit stable, symmetric probability distributions preserved by conserved quantities such as the Carter constant. We validate the method through high-precision numerical simulations in both Kerr and Schwarzschild-Melvin black hole geometries, evolving trajectories forward and backward in time. Furthermore, we refine our previously introduced particle-pair mutual information (MIPP) and perform comprehensive parameter-space scans, revealing a strong quantitative agreement between MIPP and TRSE. The two indicators emerge as complementary probes of chaos: TRSE captures symmetry breaking in orbital evolution, while MIPP measures statistical correlations. Together, they establish a unified framework for diagnosing chaos in general relativistic systems, paving a new path to understand the fundamental nature of chaos in non-integrable systems.

Abstract: In this study, we employ dynamical systems methods to analyse the large-scale structure by considering two distinct interaction models (linear and non-linear) within the dark sector, associated with a specific dynamical dark energy model inspired by the Veneziano ghost theory in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In these models, the dark energy density ($ρ_{DE}$) varies with the Hubble parameter ($H$), expressed as $ρ_{DE} = αH + βH^2$. After defining the dimensionless parameters, we present autonomous equations that allow us to find the trace $\text{Tr}(J)$ and the determinant $D(J)$. With these solutions, we demonstrate the presence of unstable, saddle, and stable fixed points, corresponding to the radiation-, matter-, and dark-energy-dominated eras, respectively. Our results suggest that these models are theoretically viable for representing the interaction between dark sector fluids.

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational $e^-+e^+\to\ell^-+\ell^+$ scattering process within the framework of gravitoelectromagnetism, a weak-field approximation of gravity analogous to Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. This process involves the interaction between a fermion and an antifermion mediated by graviton exchange. We consider the nonminimal gravitational sector of the standard model extension and calculate the corrections to the scattering cross section arising from Lorentz violation. The analysis is carried out in two scenarios: (i) at zero temperature and (ii) at finite temperature. To incorporate thermal effects, we employ the thermo field dynamics formalism, which allows for a consistent treatment of quantum fields at finite temperature. The results provide insights into how Lorentz-violating and thermal corrections influence gravitational interactions, particularly relevant in high-energy or astrophysical environments.

Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between the quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black holes. The gravitational perturbations in higher-dimensional black holes can be classified into scalar, vector, and tensor types. Considering the dimension-dependent forms of their effective potentials, the correspondence was examined for each dimension and perturbation mode. The accurate quasinormal modes were computed by suitably adopting the continued fraction and integration-through-midpoints methods, depending on the structure of the singularity. The grey-body factor can be obtained through its correspondence with the quasinormal mode, and its accuracy was analyzed by calculating its difference from the numerically computed grey-body factor. The correspondence failed for $l=2$ scalar gravitational perturbations in $D\ge7$ because the form of the potential is markedly different from that in four dimensions. The vector and tensor perturbation types exhibited good correspondence accuracies in all cases. The breakdown of the correspondence was rigorously demonstrated to stem from multiple potential barriers, and its applicability to each mode in higher dimensions was assessed.

Abstract: Models of effective stellar collapse inspired by loop quantum gravity predict a bounce when the stellar energy density reaches the Planck scale, typically followed by the formation of shell-crossing singularities. This work aims to extend the spacetime beyond these singularities by employing a Hamiltonian formulation of the Darmois-Israel junction conditions, treating the singularity as a non-isolated thin dust shell. By construction, the shell's motion remains timelike throughout the entire evolution, regardless of the amount of initial stellar mass, and the induced metric on the shell remains continuous. The resulting stellar evolution produces an inter-universal wormhole, analogous to the simpler Oppenheimer-Snyder scenario. The proposed approach provides a general framework for any effective (or classical) theory of stellar collapse characterized by shell-crossing singularities.

Abstract: We show that the Novikov coordinates can be obtained in a direct and physically transparent way from the radial geodesics of massive particles with negative energy in the Schwarzschild spacetime. These geodesics form a complete congruence that covers the entire spacetime. By rectifying this family of trajectories using the proper time as the time coordinate, the Novikov variables naturally emerge, providing a clear dynamical interpretation of the different regions usually identified as black-hole and white-hole sectors.
  In Novikov coordinates, observers at fixed spatial position follow free-fall trajectories. From their perspective, the gravitational collapse of a dust star is completed in a finite proper time, independently of their initial distance from the star. In contrast, observers described by Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates perceive the boundary of the collapsing star as taking an infinite coordinate time to reach the horizon.
  We emphasize that Schwarzschild-Droste observers are static with respect to the center of mass of the star and therefore cannot be in free fall. The use of these coordinates implicitly requires the presence of a force that compensates the gravitational attraction. From this viewpoint, the apparent infinite-time collapse is not a physical effect but a coordinate artifact associated with non-inertial observers.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: In ultra-clean 2D materials, electron viscosity is as important as Ohmic dissipation, and hydrodynamic features are observed in electron transport. Using Brinkman equations, hydrodynamic electron flows exhibit a geometric skin effect: sharp obstacles locally enhance the current, suppressing it far from the edges where the flow is unobstructed. This effect arises within hydrodynamic transport with finite momentum relaxation and does not rely on ballistic dynamics. Results provide a natural hydrodynamic interpretation of edge-enhanced and double-bump current profiles in constricted geometries. Recent scanning NV magnetometry experiments on gated graphene show consistency with viscous hydrodynamics shaped by geometry, clarifying the role of geometric effects in interpreting electronic flow experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of electron transport in ultra-clean 2D materials is motivated by the need to understand the interplay between electron viscosity and Ohmic dissipation. The observation of hydrodynamic features suggests that viscous effects cannot be ignored, and this understanding is crucial for the design and optimization of novel electronic devices.

Method: The authors employ a theoretical framework based on Brinkman equations to model hydrodynamic electron flows in constrained geometries. They analyze the impact of sharp obstacles on the current distribution and compare their findings with experimental data obtained from scanning NV magnetometry experiments on gated graphene.

Result: The study reveals that hydrodynamic electron flows exhibit a geometric skin effect, where sharp obstacles locally enhance the current while suppressing it far from the edges. The results are consistent with viscous hydrodynamics, providing a natural explanation for edge-enhanced and double-bump current profiles observed in constricted geometries. Furthermore, the comparison with scanning NV magnetometry experiments validates the hydrodynamic model and underscores the role of geometry in shaping electronic flow behavior in ultra-clean 2D materials.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects, particularly electron viscosity, play a non-negligible role in the transport properties of ultra-clean 2D materials. The geometric skin effect provides a clear mechanism for the observed current profiles and highlights the importance of considering viscous hydrodynamics in the interpretation of electronic flow experiments in constrained geometries.

Abstract: In ultra-clean 2d materials electron viscosity is as important as Ohmic dissipation and electron transport exhibits hydrodynamic features. Using a simple framework of Brinkman equations we find that hydrodynamic electron flows exhibit a geometric skin effect: sharp obstacles locally enhance the current suppressing it far from the edges where the flow is unobstructed. This effect arises within hydrodynamic transport with finite momentum relaxation and does not rely on ballistic dynamics. Our results provide a natural hydrodynamic interpretation of edge-enhanced and double-bump current profiles observed in constricted geometries. By comparing with recent scanning NV magnetometry experiments on gated graphene, we demonstrate that such flow patterns are consistent with viscous hydrodynamics shaped by geometry, clarifying the role of geometric effects in the interpretation of electronic flow experiments.

Abstract: It's established that the nonlinear anomalous Nernst effect (NANE), originating from Berry curvature near the Fermi energy, is symmetry-permitted only when a single mirror symmetry exists in the transport plane of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we show that an applied direct electric field can lift this symmetry constraint, enabling an electric-field-induced NANE emerge in time-reversal symmetric 2D systems with higher crystallographic symmetries. This electric-field-induced NANE arises from both Berry connection polarization, rooted in the electric-field-corrected Berry curvature, and the anomalous-velocity-modified nonequilibrium Fermi distribution function. Additionally, we propose an alternating temperature gradient as a driving force instead of the conventional steady one, ensuring experimental detection of NANE via second-harmonic measurement techniques. The behaviour of electric-field-induced NANE in the monolayer graphene has been theoretically and systematically investigated.

Abstract: We demonstrate a tunable Dirac-Weyl semimetal phase in two dimensions, realized by introducing in-plane d-wave altermagnetism into a Dirac system. This phase hosts both a central Dirac point and momentumseparated Weyl points connected by Fermi line edge states. The Weyl point positions--and thus the edge-state connectivity--can be continuously tuned by rotating the altermagnetic axis. In contrast, out-of-plane altermagnetism gaps part of the bulk spectrum while preserving a single Dirac point accompanied by chiral edge modes, as evidenced by quantized edge polarization. Our findings provide a tunable platform for manipulating Dirac-Weyl physics and topological edge transport in two dimensions.

Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate an orthogonal Einstein-de Haas effect, where the rotation of ferromagnetic materials is caused by the change of magnetization in the direction orthogonal to the rotation axis. This amounts to an anisotropic gyromagnetic ratio. To reveal its microscopic origin, we treat the spin-orbit coupling as a perturbation, integrate out the electronic degree of freedom, and show that in collinear ferromagnets the phonon angular momentum admits a dipolar structure in the spin-order space due to the constraint of the spin group symmetry. The spin-flipping and spin-conserving parts of the spin-orbit coupling contribute differently to such a dipolar structure. All these features are exemplified in a lattice electron-phonon model with ferromagnetic order and $C_{1h}$ point group symmetry. Our work lays the ground for revealing the connection between phonon angular momentum and general spin-order configurations.

Abstract: There is growing interest in characterizing magnetic order and dynamics in two-dimensional magnets, yet most efforts to date rely on external probes that interrogate the sample from tens of nanometers away and inevitably average over that length scale. Here we use internal, lattice-embedded Er3+ defects in CrSBr as atomic-scale probes, accessing their telecom-band photoluminescence with spectroscopy and temperature-dependent confocal imaging to read out magnetism from within the material. At room temperature we observe narrow, long-lived photoluminescence (PL) lines in the telecom band, characteristic of erbium emitters. Upon cooling to 3 K and reheating, the Er3+ PL intensity and excited-state lifetime display pronounced thermal hysteresis with a minimum near 132 K, at the reported antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of CrSBr. Remarkably, we observe magnetic signatures persisting over a broader temperature range than expected from bulk benchmarks, suggesting nanoscale magnetic order that locally survives beyond the nominal phase boundary. Further, a moderate in-plane field of 0.3 T shifts the PL minimum by +8 K, which we tentatively associate to field-biased ferromagnetic correlations.

TL;DR: The paper discusses molecular chirality's role in spin-dependent filtering effects in quantum transport, focusing on eMChA and CISS. A kinetic Monte Carlo code models electron transport under voltage, distinguishing spin currents and coupling spin, chirality, and mobility. The code predicts voltage-dependent spin filtering effects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating spintronic devices, quantum transport, and understanding fundamental spin-dependent effects.

Method: Developed kinetic Monte Carlo code to model electron transport under voltage, considering α/β spin currents and coupling between spin, chirality, and mobility.

Result: Observed voltage-dependent spin filtering effects consistent with experimental findings.

Conclusion: Code successfully models theoretical mechanisms behind observed effects, suggesting potential used for further theoretical exploration.

Abstract: Molecular chirality interacting in a non-negligible manner with the spin angular momentum of subatomic particles, mainly electrons or photons, is the cause of a variety of spin-dependent filtering effects in quantum transport. Among them, spin-selective transport at room temperature is clearly one of the most promising properties in the quest for functional spintronic devices. In this context, two main effects have been experimentally investigated in the past 25 years and have attracted significant interest within the community: the so-called Electronic Magnetochiral Anisotropy (eMChA) and Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS). Despite extensive research, there is still a lack of consensus in the modeling of their microscopic mechanisms. As a consequence, it remains unclear whether the two are truly distinct or if they originate from a common physical cause. With the long-term goal of modelling the main different theories and to test them against the available experimental evidence, we programmed the core of an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo code. The current code models electron transport under an external voltage, distinguishes between $α$ and $β$ spin currents, and parametrizes molecules by their intrinsic electron mobility and the effective coupling between electron movement, spin and chirality. The code allows obtaining spin filtering values arising from the effective coupling between these three. We obtain an effect that vanishes at low voltages, with the asymmetry between positive and negative voltages typically found in electrical magnetochiral anisotropy experiments.

Abstract: We consider the minimal coupling of a Dirac semimetal Hamiltonian to a generic spin-texture in this work. A simple unitary transformation gauges away the spatial dependence in the exchange term, leading to the generation of effective corrections to the Dirac dispersion. A full function's worth of freedom is obtained as a result. Choosing different pitch vectors, we show that many forms of novel phenomena arise in such systems. For example, a linear pitch vector leads to the generation of type-I Weyl semimetal -- we observe the anomalous Hall effect and the chiral magnetic effect. The anomalous Hall coefficient requires a non-zero pitch vector whereas the CME is proportional to the exchange coupling. The band structure of the model in the presence of a magnetic field shows a Lifshitz transition. The introduction of a suitable time dependent pitch vector leads to the formation of nodal spheres in the Sambe space of effective Hamiltonians. This nodal sphere is robust to all orders in van-Vleck perturbation theory as proven explicitly.

Motivation: Understanding skyrmion-skyrmion interactions is crucial for manipulating skyrmions in next-generation spintronics and neuromorphic computing.

Method: The study uses micromagnetic simulations to model and compute the magnetic structures and spin textures of skyrmions in chiral magnetic films.

Result: The simulations reveal that the skyrmion-skyrmion interactions exhibit a universal RKKY-like oscillatory behavior with a well-defined period, characterized by a wavy tail in the skyrmion spin texture.

Conclusion: The findings provide a novel physical principle for designing skyrmion molecules and superstructures, offering significant potential for applications in skyrmion-based spintronics and neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Understanding skyrmion-skyrmion interactions is crucial for effectively manipulating the motion of multiple skyrmions in racetrack and logic devices. However, the fundamental nature and microscopic origins of these interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate skyrmion-skyrmion interactions in chiral magnetic films and reveal that they possess intrinsic, anisotropic, and oscillatory characteristics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the attractive and repulsive forces between skyrmions oscillate with a well-defined period, akin to the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling observed between two magnetic moments in metals. Our analysis uncovers the essential physics behind a previously unrecognized universal wavy tail in the skyrmion spin texture. Notably, the resulting RKKY-like interaction between skyrmions is universal for all tilted skyrmions, irrespective of whether the titled easy-axis is from an external field or a crystalline magnetic anisotropy. These findings introduce a novel physical principle for the design of skyrmion molecules or skyrmion superstructures, which hold significant potential for applications in skyrmion-based spintronics and neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: The nonlinear Nernst and Seebeck effects (NNE and NSE) offer promising routes for thermoelectric energy conversion in non-magnetic systems. While intrinsic mechanisms such as the nonlinear Drude and Berry-curvature-dipole terms are well established, extrinsic contributions to thermoelectric responses arising from disorder-induced asymmetric scattering remain comparatively less explored, despite growing experimental evidence of their dominance. Here, we develop a unified semiclassical theory of NNE and NSE that incorporates skew scattering and side-jump processes, identifying four distinct extrinsic contributions to NNE and two for NSE. A systematic symmetry analysis shows that these responses are allowed in time-reversal-symmetric non-magnets, PT-symmetric antiferromagnets, and non-centrosymmetric magnetic systems such as altermagnets. As a case study, we demonstrate that ABA-stacked trilayer graphene hosts large nonlinear Nernst and Seebeck responses dominated by extrinsic scattering, in excellent agreement with recent experiments. Our results establish the microscopic origin of these effects and provide guiding principles for designing high-efficiency nonlinear thermoelectric devices.

Motivation: Understanding and controlling the behavior of topological spin textures like hopfions and skyrmions is crucial for advancing spintronic devices and quantum computing.

Method: The research introduces an electric-current-assisted nucleation protocol in chiral magnets, which is independent of sample shape and size.

Result: Hopfions exhibit extraordinary stability under both positive and negative magnetic fields, aligning with micromagnetic simulations.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for simpler methods to study topological spin textures and could enhance the design of next-generation electronic devices.

Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons -- knotted, vortex-like spin configurations. In chiral magnets, hopfions can appear as isolated structures or they can be linked to skyrmion strings. Previous studies employed a sophisticated protocol and a special sample geometry to nucleate such hopfions linked to one or a few skyrmion strings. Here, we introduce an electric-current-assisted nucleation protocol that is simple and independent of the sample shape and size. The resulting hopfions exhibit extraordinary stability in the presence of both positive and negative magnetic fields, in perfect agreement with micromagnetic simulations. We also present a comprehensive framework for classifying hopfions, skyrmions, and merons by deriving the corresponding homotopy group.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses the investigation of drag and two-stream instability effects in graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures. A heterostructure with a conducting graphene layer on top of a AlGaN barrier layer and a 2DEG layer below was fabricated by chemical vapor deposition. Drag currents were observed to exhibit quantum oscillations at low temperatures but lose them as temperature increases. Reducing the AlGaN barrier layer thickness to a few nanometers could enhance the drag effect, making the heterostructure a promising platform for these studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding drag effects and instabilities in graphene is important for various applications such as electron transport and device design in next-generation electronic devices. The two-stream instability, where electrons and holes flow in opposing directions, is a fundamental phenomenon that can affect device performance. Investigating these effects in layered structures like graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures can provide insights into how to control and optimize electron transport and device reliability.

Method: The researchers used chemical vapor deposition to grow a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) layer and a graphene layer on a AlGaN/GaN wafer. A AlGaN barrier layer was introduced between the 2DEG and graphene layers to form the heterostructure. Contacts were fabricated to the 2DEG and graphene layers to measure the drag currents induced in graphene when driven by the 2DEG current. The drag current was measured under varying temperatures and drive voltages to analyze temperature dependencies and quantum oscillations.

Result: At low temperatures, the drag current in graphene exhibited clear quantum oscillations as a function of drive voltage. However, as the temperature increased, these quantum oscillations disappeared. Conversely, the magnitude of the drag current increased with temperature. The results indicate that the two-stream instability and drag effects are sensitive to temperature changes and the structural integrity of the barrier layer (AlGaN thickness). Reducing the barrier layer thickness to a few nanometers could enhance the drag effect, suggesting that alloy composition or mechanical exfoliation might further tune the drag coefficient for potential applications.

Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrate that graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are a feasible platform for studying drag and two-stream instability effects. The findings point towards the possibility of controlling the drag effect by modifying the barrier layer thickness, which could lead to practical applications in electron transport and device design. Future research should focus on optimizing the structural properties for controllable drag effects and exploring device applications.

Abstract: Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are proposed to investigate the drag and two-stream instability effects. In this study, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition was transferred from copper onto the top of the standard AlGaN/GaN wafer, forming a heterostructure with two conducting layers separated by an AlGaN barrier layer. Contacts fabricated to the two-dimensional electron gas and graphene allowed us to study the drag current induced in graphene by passing the drive current through the two-dimensional electron gas. At low temperatures, the graphene drag current exhibited quantum oscillations as a function of the drive voltage. As temperature increases, quantum oscillations disappear, and the magnitude of the drag current increases. Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are a promising platform for studying drag and two-stream instability effects, especially if the AlGaN barrier layer thickness can be reduced to a few nanometers.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate dispersion of plasma waves propagating in a lateral plasmonic crystal based on a two-dimensional electron system with grating gates. Two specific configurations are analyzed: a system with single grating gate having ungated gaps and a double-grating-gate system. We calculate the dispersion relations for the fundamental and several higher-order plasma modes, classifying them as either ${\it bright}$ or ${\it dark}$ excitations. At the boundaries of the Brillouin zones, the dispersion of both types of excitations is shown to be quadratic, justifying introduction of effective bright and dark plasmon masses. In the low-frequency limit, the plasmonic crystal spectrum exhibits an acoustic plasma mode characterized by a certain velocity. We demonstrate that the effective plasmon mass and acoustic velocity are highly sensitive to both the crystal geometry (specifically the lattice filling factor) and the gate voltages, enabling wide-range tunability.

Abstract: Motivated by the unique dispersions close to the two dimensional band crossing in a topologically charged nodal surface semimetal (NSSM) spectrum, we perform theoretical analysis of quantum tunnelling through a junction consisting of such NSSM, an insulator and a s-wave superconductor (acronymed NSSM-I-SC junction). In particular, for excitation energies both more and less than the superconducting gap potential $Δ$ we probe the normal and Andreev conductance for different incident orientations and thereby find the tunnelling electrical conductance through the heterostructure. The present work considers only the thin barrier limit which witness the conductance G to oscillate periodically with frequency $π$ as a function of the barrier strength, both in high and low doping limit. Such periodic behavior is also observed while calculating the thermal conductance $κ$ through the junction. Novelty of this problem is that the behavior of these G or $κ$ with insulator width are, in many respect, different compared to that from a normal metal - insulator - superconductor (NIS) junction on graphene or silicene. The findings can thus motivate experimentalists to culture renewed control over electric or thermal transport on topological materials.

Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions offer a powerful playground for exploring exotic superconducting and topological phenomena beyond the reach of conventional two-terminal devices. In this work, we present the direct spectroscopic observation of Cooper quartet resonances, a signature of correlated tunneling of two Cooper pairs across the device, in a graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (3TJJ). Using tunneling spectroscopy, we visualize how Andreev bound states (ABS) evolve across a two-dimensional superconducting phase space, controlled by the two independent phase differences in the 3TJJ. These measurements reveal sharp local minima in the differential conductance spectra locked in a specific phase condition of superconducting phase variables. The resulting quantized trajectories around the compact torus of the superconducting phase variables reveal an underlying topological winding in the multipair transport. To interpret our results, we develop a theoretical model that connects the observed quartet resonances to the coherent hybridization of multiple ABS branches, a hallmark of the rich pairing process enabled by multiterminal geometries. Our results highlight the potential of multiterminal superconducting devices to host engineered superconducting states and pave the way for new approaches to topological band structure design based on phase-controlled, higher-order superconducting transport.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate signatures of exciton condensation and the underlying interband coherence in scanning tunneling microscopy. We consider both monolayer and bilayer condensates in the regime of a dilute condensate of tightly bound excitons. For monolayer condensates, interband coherence is directly encoded in spatially oscillating contributions to the tunneling conductance, which break the underlying lattice symmetry. We show how scanning tunneling microscopy allows one to extract the exciton wavefunction. For bilayer condensates, we show that the formation of the exciton insulator is signaled by the emergence of a characteristic peak in the tunneling conductance, which can be used to extract the (local) exciton density. Our results are based on analytical considerations using a systematic solution of the mean-field equations in powers of the exciton density as well as numerical calculations.

Abstract: The physics of phase transitions in low-dimensional systems has long been a subject of significant research interest. Long-range magnetic order in the strict two-dimensional limit, whose discovery circumvented the Mermin-Wagner theorem, has rapidly emerged as a research focus. However, the demonstration of a non-trivial topological spin textures in two-dimensional limit has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the out-of-plane electric field breaks inversion symmetry while simultaneously modulating the electronic band structure, enabling electrically tunable spin-orbit interaction for creation and manipulation of topological spin textures in monolayer CrI3. The realization of ideal two-dimensional topological spin textures may offer not only an experimental testbed for probing the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism, but also potential insights into unresolved quantum phenomena including superconductivity and superfluidity. Moreover, voltage-controlled spin-orbit interaction offers a novel pathway to engineer two-dimensional spin textures with tailored symmetries and topologies, while opening avenues for skyrmion-based next-generation information technologies.

Abstract: This study examines electrostatic screening effects in graphene using tight binding calculations under the BBC and modified BBC models, with sigmav ranging from 0.00 to 3.00. Our results demonstrate that the modified BBC potential decays, which effectively suppresses electron-electron interactions. Hopping integrals decrease by 65% over distance and shift 7% with sigmav, while on site energy rises linearly by 0.045 eV. A band gap opens for sigmav greater than or equal to 1.00. The density of states peaks near the Fermi level, with the low energy region largely unaffected. Graphene's low energy helical wave functions yield topological features like pseudospin momentum locking and a pi Berry phase, leading to distinct transport behavior. The model avoids the Coulomb singularity, offering insights for 2D screening engineering and topological device design.

### [170] [Boundary condition for phonon distribution functions at a smooth crystal interface and interfacial angular momentum transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18584)
*Yuta Suzuki,Shuntaro Sumita,Yusuke Kato*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper establishes boundary conditions for phonon distribution functions at crystal interfaces, considering reflection, transmission, and mode conversion. It derives these conditions from classical lattice vibration theory, aligning with quantum descriptions. The formulation supports the acoustic mismatch model, essential for analyzing Kapitza resistance. The refined conditions include spatial dependence and capture transverse shifts in elastic wave packets, akin to the optical Imbert-Fedorov shift. This enables the generation of phonon orbital angular momentum (OAM) by circularly polarized phonons, which carry spin angular momentum (SAM). The spatial profile of OAM and its role in chiral phonon interfacial diffusion are analytically determined. The theory provides concise boundary conditions for phonon systems, applicable to heat transport and phonon angular momentum transport.

Motivation: Understanding phonon behavior at crystal interfaces is crucial for advancing materials science and nanotechnology. This research addresses gaps in boundary conditions for phonons at smooth interfaces, which impacts phenomena like Kapitza resistance and chiral phonon effects.

Method: The study employs theoretical derivations starting from classical lattice vibrations and aligns them with quantum descriptions. It considers reflection, transmission, and mode conversion, derives boundary conditions, and refines them to include spatial dependence.

Result: The paper successfully formulates boundary conditions for phonon distribution functions, incorporating reflection, transmission, and mode conversion. It captures transverse shifts in elastic wave packets and establishes the generation of OAM by SAM in chiral phonon systems, providing analytical determinations of OAM profiles and their role in interfacial diffusion.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for phonon boundary conditions at smooth crystal interfaces. It enhances understanding of phonon phenomena in interface systems and offers practical applications in heat transport and phonon angular momentum transport.

Abstract: We theoretically elucidate the boundary conditions for phonon distribution functions of long-wavelength acoustic phonons at smooth crystal interfaces. We first derive boundary conditions that fully incorporate reflection, transmission, and mode conversion. We obtain these conditions for phonons from those for classical lattice vibrations, using the correspondence between the quantum and classical descriptions. This formulation provides a theoretical foundation for the acoustic mismatch model, widely used to analyze Kapitza resistance. We then refine the boundary conditions to include spatial dependence parallel to the interface. The refined form captures transverse shifts of elastic wave packets, analogous to the optical Imbert--Fedorov shift, and ensures conservation of total angular momentum. Consequently, circularly polarized phonons carrying spin angular momentum (SAM) generate phonon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at the interface. We analytically determine the spatial profile of this OAM and demonstrate that SAM and OAM are both involved in the interfacial diffusion of chiral phonons. Our theory provides concise boundary conditions for phonons, with applications ranging from heat transport to phonon angular momentum transport.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 研究扩展的Kitaev模型在三角形晶格上的行为。在某种条件下，该模型映射为XXZ模型，并结合Kitaev相互作用。在已知的磁二元体Z₂域中，发现了带有子晶格标量旋向性的铁 Chernsky天线相位。两个子格携带单位天线电荷，而第三个子格是无旋向的。通过经典蒙特卡洛模拟，显示这种铁Chernsky天线相位在零温度、零外部磁感应和无Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya相互作用下产生。与常规天线系统形成不同，该相位在材料传统上归类为XXZ磁体的系统中也存在。这一发现揭示了一种全新的途径致天线物理，纯由 frustration 交互引起，并揭示了丰富拓扑结构的出现。由于 XXZ 细分和Kitaev相互作用均源于相同的自旋-轨道耦合机制，传统上归类为XXZ磁体的材料可能具有有限的Kitaev相互作用。因此，这种系统的铁Chernsky性质值得进一步研究。


<details>

Motivation: 材料科学中的自旋-轨道相互作用（Spin-orbit interaction，SOI）是描述自旋与轨道运动相互作用的基本框架。自旋-轨道耦合在磁性材料和天线（skyrmion）研究中扮演着关键角色。自旋-轨道作用产生的多频天线吸引了大量研究兴趣，尤其是与Kitaev相互作用结合的情况。这篇论文探讨了扩展的Kitaev模型在三角形晶格上的行为，特别是在由自旋-轨道作用驱动的 frustrating 交点的相互作用域中，发现了铁Chernsky天线相位。这一发现表明，通过仅仅通过 frustrating 交点相互作用，一种全新的天线物理路径得以实现，这为天线物质的进一步研究提供了新的视角。

Method: 该研究采用经典蒙特卡洛模拟的方法，探讨扩展Kitaev模型的相行为。研究者通过在不同参数条件下对模型进行分析，发现了铁Chernsky天线相位，并确定其存在的条件。此外，还通过理论分析和数值模拟，揭示了该相位的稳定性及其对温度的依赖性。

Result: 论文的主要结果包括：1) 发现了一个(named)铁Chernsky天线相位，该相位由扩展Kitaev模型在三角形晶格上组成；2) 该相位在纯 frustrating 交点相互作用下产生，无需外部磁场和Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya相互作用；3) 该相位在零温度下稳定，并在较高温度下仍然存在；4) 该相位展现了子晶格标量旋向性的独特性质：两个子格携带单位天线电荷，而第三个子格电中性。研究者通过经典蒙特卡洛模拟证明了这些结论，并且发现该相位在广泛的参数范围内存在。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过 frustrating 交点相互作用，自旋-轨道耦合机制可以驱动出一种独特的铁Chernsky天线相位。这一发现丰富了天线材料和自旋拓扑结构的多样性，并为理解由 frustrating 交点相互作用引起的新型磁性和天线现象提供了新的视角。此外，由于扩展Kitaev模型的材料传统上被视为XXZ磁体，这意味着这些材料可能具有有限的Kitaev相互作用，从而具有潜在的铁Chernsky天线性质。这种发现对实验ists来说具有重要意义，可以指导进一步探索这些材料中天线物理的可能性。综上所述，这篇论文在理论和材料科学领域都具有重要意义，揭示了自旋-轨道相互作用在驱动新型磁性和天线现象中的潜在潜力。

Abstract: We study an extended Kitaev model on the triangular lattice in a limit where the symmetric off-diagonal bond-dependent and Heisenberg interactions together map onto an XXZ model, in addition to the Kitaev interaction. Within the previously identified $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex regime, we uncover a ferrichiral skyrmion phase characterized by a sublattice-resolved scalar chirality: two of the three sublattices carry unit skyrmion charge, while the third remains nonchiral. Using classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this ferrichiral skyrmion phase emerges at zero temperature and in the absence of both an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, in sharp contrast to conventional skyrmion-hosting systems. The phase is stable over a wide parameter window and persists to relatively high temperatures. Our results reveal an unconventional route to skyrmion physics driven purely by frustrated exchange interactions and highlight the emergence of rich topological structures. Since both XXZ anisotropy and Kitaev interactions originate from the same spin-orbit-coupling mechanism, materials traditionally classified as XXZ magnets are expected to host finite Kitaev interactions as well. The potential for ferrichirality in these systems therefore warrants further investigation.

Abstract: Conventionally, symmetry-protected topological phases and band crossings are protected by global symmetries acting on the entire system. Here, we show that symmetries preserved only on a partial region of a system, termed local support symmetries, can protect topological features of the full system, even in the presence of symmetry-breaking couplings. We establish a unified framework by deriving explicit conditions for such protection in both insulating and metallic phases and show that destructive interference of Bloch wave functions plays a key role. Using representative tight-binding models, we demonstrate band crossings and topological bands protected by local support crystalline and time-reversal symmetries, and further present a realistic material realization in a fluorinated biphenylene network, where a band crossing is protected by a local support C$_2$ symmetry.

Abstract: We investigate the disordered perovskite BaCu$_{1/3}$Ta$_{2/3}$O$_3$, where Cu (spin-1/2) and Ta randomly occupy a pseudo-cubic lattice. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy establish the local nature of the disorder, revealing the presence of structurally constrained magnetic exchange paths. No magnetic ordering or spin freezing is observed down to 0.1 K. The low-temperature magnetic and thermodynamic behavior is captured by a broad but non-singular distribution $P(J)$ of exchange couplings $J$. These results open the possibility of realizing a disordered quantum ground state where the exchange randomness is broad yet intrinsically bounded, departing from the conventional infinite-randomness fixed point driven random-singlet phase.

Abstract: We introduce a tree tensor network (TTN) impurity solver that enables highly efficient and accurate real-time simulations of quantum impurity models. By decomposing a noninteracting bath Hamiltonian into a Cayley tree, the method provides a tensor network representation that naturally captures the multiscale entanglement structure intrinsic to impurity-bath systems. This geometry differs from conventional chain-based mappings and yields a substantial reduction of entanglement, allowing accurate ground-state properties and long-time dynamics to be captured at significantly lower bond dimensions. Benchmark calculations for the single-impurity Anderson model demonstrate that the TTN solver achieves markedly enhanced resolution of real-frequency spectral functions, without invoking analytic continuation. This impurity solver provides a balanced, scale-uniform description of impurity physics and offers a versatile approach for real-time dynamical mean-field theory and related applications involving quantum impurity models.

Abstract: Extending hyperuniformity from classical to quantum fluctuations in electron systems yields a framework that identifies quantum phase transitions and reveals underlying gap structures through the quantum weight. We study long-wavelength fluctuations of many-body ground states through the charge-density structure factor by incorporating intrinsic quantum fluctuations into hyperuniformity. Although charge fluctuations at zero temperature are generally suppressed by particle-number conservation, their long-wavelength scaling reveals distinct universal behaviors that define quantum hyperuniformity classes. By exemplifying the Aubry-Andre model, we find that gapped, gapless, and localized-critical-extended phases are sharply distinguished by the quantum hyperuniformity classes. Notably, at the critical point, multifractal wave functions generate anomalous scaling behavior. We further show that, in quantum-hyperuniform gapped phases, the quantum weight provides a quantitative measure of the gap size through a universal power-law scaling. Along with classical hyperuniformity, quantum hyperuniformity serves a direct fingerprint of quantum criticality and a practical probe of quantum phase transitions in aperiodic electron systems.

Abstract: The interplay among electronic correlation, topology, and time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) often leads to exotic quantum states of matter. Primary examples include the recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2) and multilayer graphene aligned with hBN, where TRS is broken in partially filled flat moire Chern bands. Among the FCIs in tMoTe2, the most robust is at a hole filling of v = -2/3 per moire unit cell. Interestingly, transient optical sensing and more recent transport measurements revealed a correlated state at v = -4/3, twice the filling factor for the v = -2/3 FCI. Here, employing pump-probe circular dichroism (CD) measurements on tMoTe2 with twist angles = 3.9 degree and 3.7 degree, we find that the v = -4/3 state exhibits vanishing magnetization (m = 0) in finite windows of out-of-plane magnetic field less than ~2-4 mT, and a first order phase transition to + - m states at higher fields. This out-of-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) like behavior is notably absent for all other correlated states and disappears for the v = -4/3 state at higher or lower twist angles = 4.0 degree and 3.3 degree. The observed magnetic signature at v = -4/3 is consistent with a predicted fractional topological insulator (FTI) with TRS, consisting of two copies of -2/3 FCIs with opposite chiralities. We support these findings with calculations in the interacting continuum model of tMoTe2. Our work presents a candidate for fractional topological insulators with TRS.

Abstract: Motivated by the objective of quantifying the energetic cost of accessing boundary phases through local control, we investigate here a simple, analytically tractable quantum impurity model. This model exhibits a rich boundary phase diagram, characterized by phases with different numbers of edge states. By considering a local quench protocol that drives the system out of equilibrium, we calculate exactly the resulting quantum work distribution across these phases. Our results show that the presence of edge states strongly alters this distribution. In particular, we analytically determine key fingerprints of these states both near the low-energy threshold and in the high-energy region.

Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularization provides a powerful framework for studying three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs) by mapping them onto numerically tractable lattice models on the spherical lowest Landau level. However, the system sizes accessible to this method have been limited by the exact diagonalization (ED). In this work, we transcend this limitation by combining the fuzzy sphere regularization with a sophisticated multi-target density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. Focusing on the 3D Ising-type model on the spherical lowest Landau level, we calculate the 24 low-lying energies at a larger system size than previously feasible with ED. At criticality, we extract the scaling dimensions of six primary operators, and the results show significantly improved agreement with bootstrap benchmarks compared to previous ED results at smaller sizes. Our approach allows us to efficiently target multiple excited states in larger systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. This study establishes the fuzzy sphere regularization combined with advanced DMRG techniques as a powerful and general framework for precision physics in 3D CFTs.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasiparticles potentially useful for memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions present no transverse deflection, making them suitable candidates for data storage applications. After the discovery of skyrmions with length scales comparable to the lattice constant, several works presented quantum analogues of classical ferromagnetic skyrmions in spin systems. However, studies about quantum analogues of AF skyrmions are still lacking. Here, we explore the phases of the AF quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on the triangular lattice using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. We study the magnetization profile, spin structure factor and quantum entanglement of the resulting ground states to characterize the corresponding phases and signal the emergence of quantum AF skyrmions. Our results support that three-sublattice quantum antiferromagnetic skyrmion textures are stabilized in a wide range of magnetic fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The FCC-ee produces copious photon radiation that needs to be absorbed downstream, so developing effective absorbers is critical.

Method: The study uses Monte Carlo simulations (Fluka) to model photon-matter interactions and computational-fluid-dynamics (ANSYS FLUENT) for thermal and flow analysis.

Result: Both designs perform well within thermal and structural limits, making circulating liquid lead a viable option.

Conclusion: This design shows that flowing liquid lead can effectively handle the photon absorption needs of FCC-ee.

Abstract: The electron-positron Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) being developed at CERN will generate intense beamstrahlung radiation, thus requiring photon absorbers downstream of the interaction points. This work presents the conceptual design of flowing-liquid-lead absorbers capable of dissipating around 370 kW of photon power, with a mean photon energy of 62 MeV. Two configurations are investigated: an inclined-flow geometry, developed to increase the photon interaction length to maximize absorption, and a compact upstream slope with an additional pool, in which a free-surface lead flow intercepts the power peak before a downstream pool dissipates the remaining load. Photon-matter interactions are modeled using Monte Carlo simulations in fluka, while conjugate heat-transfer and free-surface dynamics are analyzed through computational-fluid-dynamics simulations using ansys fluent. Design refinements are introduced based on the simulated thermal and hydraulic performance and to mitigate secondary effects such as photon backscattering. Both configurations demonstrate stable operation within the 300 kg/s flow limit and maintain liquid-lead and structural temperatures within the operational range of 450--500 $^{\circ}$C. The results establish circulating liquid lead as a feasible and thermally robust baseline technology for beamstrahlung absorption in FCC-ee.

Abstract: Today, apart from some isolated R&D efforts, there are no gravitational wave (GW) experiments, yet which explore a large part of the vast frequency range above the LIGO/Virgo band. It is planned to establish an experiment at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) and at the Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) to search for high-frequency GWs in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 100 MHz. The basic idea is to use superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities to detect tiny harmonic deformations induced by GWs which change the boundary conditions of the oscillating electromagnetic field. This paper summarizes the challenging environmental boundary requirements, and the R&D to operate a cavity using a low level RF (LLRF) system which pushes beyond state-of-the-art accuracy and resolutions and a seismic noise mitigated cryostat at 1.8 K. The focus of this paper is the warm and cold commissioning of a prototype cavity, built 20 years ago during the MAGO collaboration, and its first measurement in our collaborative research project.

Motivation: Process optimization and understanding reaction dynamics are motivations for this work on Fe2O3 reduction using TR-APXPS.

Method: The study employs TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS to analyze surface chemistry and dynamics, addressing spectral complexity.

Result: TR-APXPS with chemometric tools successfully extracts pure spectral profiles, aiding in understanding reaction mechanisms.

Conclusion: This method contributes to optimizing processes and tailoring material properties through detailed surface analysis.

Abstract: This work presents a study on the application of Time-Resolved Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TR-APXPS) in association with chemometric techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), to investigate the surface chemistry and dynamics of Fe2O3 reduction processes. The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications.

*Ioan Bâldea*

TL;DR: Antioxidants like vitamin C have significantly altered reactivity indices in different solvents. Koopmans' theorem fails in solution, so adiabatic calculations with solvent are essential. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how solvents affect antioxidants is crucial for fields like medicine and chemistry. However, using Koopmans' theorem in these conditions leads to incorrect predictions. This realization is important for improving research accuracy and theory.

Method: Quantum-chemical investigations of vitamin C's reactivity indices were conducted using CBS-QB3 and DFT methods in various solvents. Koopmans' theorem was tested and found to be ineffective in these conditions.

Result: Solvation significantly affects reactivity indices, and Koopmans' theorem does not account for dielectric screening and geometric relaxation. Therefore, it must be abandoned for antioxidant studies in condensed phases.

Conclusion: Koopmans' theorem is unsuitable for studying antioxidants in solution. Instead, adiabatic calculations with solvent must be used for accurate predictions, enhancing the reliability of research and theory in relevant fields.

Abstract: Antioxidants operate in biological environments where solvent effects dramatically alter their redox properties. Using ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a paradigmatic example, we present a comprehensive quantum-chemical investigation of its global chemical reactivity indices -- ionization potential, electron affinity, HOMO-LUMO gap, hardness, softness, electronegativity, electrophilicity, and electrodonating/accepting powers -- computed at the compound chemistry CBS-QB3 and various DFT levels in vacuo and across six solvents. The results demonstrate that solvation stabilizes charged species so strongly that reactivity indices shift by several electronvolts, following a roughly Born-like dependence on dielectric constant. Most importantly, we show unequivocally that Koopmans' theorem, often used to estimate these indices from orbital energies, fails catastrophically in solution: it predicts solvent-independent values that are qualitatively and quantitatively wrong, missing the essential physics of dielectric screening and geometric relaxation. We therefore conclude that Koopmans' theorem must be abandoned for antioxidant studies in condensed phases; adiabatic calculations with solvent are mandatory for meaningful predictions.

These rules were validated statistically and align with existing organic electronic principles.

Conclusion: By autonomously deriving design principles, ChemNavigator demonstrates the potential of AI to augment materials discovery, highlighting its importance as a complementary tool to traditional chemical intuition.

Abstract: The discovery of high-performance organic photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution remains limited by the vastness of chemical space and the reliance on human intuition for molecular design. Here we present ChemNavigator, an agentic AI system that autonomously derives structure-property relationships through hypothesis-driven exploration of organic photocatalyst candidates. The system integrates large language model reasoning with density functional tight binding calculations in a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method: formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, executing calculations, and validating findings through rigorous statistical analysis. Through iterative discovery cycles encompassing 200 molecules, ChemNavigator autonomously identified six statistically significant design rules governing frontier orbital energies, including the effects of ether linkages, carbonyl groups, extended conjugation, cyano groups, halogen substituents, and amine groups. Importantly, these rules correspond to established principles of organic electronic structure (resonance donation, inductive withdrawal, $π$-delocalization), demonstrating that the system can independently derive chemical knowledge without explicit programming. Notably, autonomous agentic reasoning extracted these six validated rules from a molecular library where previous ML approaches identified only carbonyl effects. Furthermore, the quantified effect sizes provide a prioritized ranking for synthetic chemists, while feature interaction analysis revealed diminishing returns when combining strategies, challenging additive assumptions in molecular design. This work demonstrates that agentic AI systems can autonomously derive interpretable, chemically grounded design principles, establishing a framework for AI-assisted materials discovery that complements rather than replaces chemical intuition.

Abstract: A size-extensive, converging, black-box coupled-cluster ($Δ$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $α$- and $β$-spin electrons, any patterns of orbital occupancy, any spin multiplicities, and any spatial symmetries. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($Δ$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A determinant-based, general-order algorithm is implemented, generating $Δ$CC energies through connected octuple excitations, which are compared with the results from CI, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), and SUMRCC theories up to the FCI limits as well as from $Δ$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitations only and of single and double excitations. The order of performance is: $Δ$CC $>$ EOM-CC $>$ CI at the same order or $Δ$CC $>$ $Δ$MP $>$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex reaction kinetics, especially in systems with multiple stages, is crucial for various scientific fields. Existing methods often have limitations, so developing a more comprehensive theory addresses these gaps.

Method: The authors use quantum field theory to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactions, termed CMET. This involves formulating coupled partial differential equations that can be numerically integrated.

Result: CMET reproduces predictions from other theories within their applicable domains, demonstrating its versatility and accuracy across various case studies.

Conclusion: CMET provides a versatile and general framework for studying reaction-diffusion processes, particularly for multistage reactions where existing approaches may fall short.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to enhance the computational efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for large-scale systems, by leveraging modern hardware architectures like GPUs.

Method: The method involves utilizing dynamic-programming walk counts for constant-time configuration state function (CSF) ranking and unranking, as well as pretabulated segment factors for efficient coupling coefficient evaluation. Two-electron contributions are optimized through an intermediate-weight formulation, allowing for efficient handling of both dense and density-fitted/Cholesky backends. GPU acceleration is achieved by implementing irregular DRT traversal and accumulation in CUDA kernels, enabling efficient distribution of computational tasks across many cores. Two-electron contributions are further optimized by delegating contractions to CUDA libraries, which offloads tasks from the CPU and leverages GPU's FP64 GEMM capabilities for higher performance.

Result: The implementation achieves remarkable results, including reproducing reference energies with an unprecedented precision of 10^{-11} Eh. On an RTX 4090 GPU, the implementation provides significant speedups, up to ~10x for smaller active spaces and multifold speedups for representative CASCI kernels. The speedup decreases with larger active spaces due to increasing dominance of FP64 GEMM on consumer GPUs. Comparatively, the CPU backend generally delivers superior performance over PySCF's determinant and CSF backends, with speedups exceeding 2x and 4x, respectively.

Conclusion: cuGUGA represents a substantial advancement in quantum chemistry software, offering a robust and scalable solution for complex electronic structure calculations with high computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present cuGUGA, an operator-direct graphical unitary group approach (GUGA) configuration interaction (CI) solver in a spin-adapted configuration state function (CSF) basis. Dynamic-programming walk counts provide constant-time CSF ranking/unranking, and pretabulated segment factors enable constant-time evaluation of coupling coefficients. Two-electron contributions are organized through an intermediate-weight formulation that separates sparse generator enumeration from integral contraction and supports both dense and density-fitted/Cholesky backends. We further map the same primitives to GPUs by implementing the irregular DRT traversal and accumulation in custom CUDA kernels while delegating contractions to CUDA libraries. The implementation reproduces reference energies at the 10^{-11} Eh level and matches CPU/GPU sigma-vectors to 10^{-14}. On an RTX 4090, the GPU backend provides up to ~10x speedup over the CPU backend for smaller active spaces and multifold speedups on representative CASCI kernels. Speedup decreases as the active space grows because the workload becomes increasingly dominated by FP64 GEMM, which is not strongly accelerated on consumer GPUs. In addition, the cuGUGA CPU backend generally delivers >2x speedup over PySCF's determinant backend and >4x speedup over PySCF CSF backend.

Abstract: In our previous work, we developed a CCSD(T)-level range-separated water force field that combines the power of physics-driven and machine learning models. However, it was found that expensive CCSD(T)/CBS calculations lead to limited number of QM data as well as the missing of force labels, both of which lead to training instability issues. Bulk properties show large variations that cannot be resolved by simply reducing the fitting error in small cluster QM dataset. Such instability in bulk phase simulation is a universal problem in the training of machine learning potentials (MLPs), and is particularly severe at CCSD(T) level of theory.In this work, using our range-separated water model as an example, we aim to overcome these limitations by developing a new training workflow. It is composed by several techniques including: 1. an active learning protocol that ensures more thorough sampling in different temperatures and densities; 2. an intermediate force label technique employing machine learning density functional; and 3. an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method. These techniques significantly stabilize the resulting water model, consistently achieving sub-chemical accuracies in both cluster energies and experimental properties. Benchmarks are carried out for various properties including densities, radial distribution functions (RDFs), dielectric constants, diffusivity, and infrared spectra, all showing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and proving the effectiveness of the training protocol.

Abstract: We study the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S$_\mathrm{N}$2) reaction of 1-phenyl-2-trimethylsilylacetylene (PTA) under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) from the perspective of high-level ab initio quantum and polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we address conflicting mechanistic proposals, cavity-induced electronic corrections under VSC and the relevance of a previously debated Si-C-stretching motion of PTA for vibrational polariton formation. We first provide computational evidence for a two-step mechanism based on density functional theory and high-level coupled cluster results, identify new encounter and products complexes and illustrate the relevance of diffuse basis functions for a qualitatively correct description of anionic reactive systems. We subsequently show that cavity-induced dipole fluctuation corrections of electronic energies can be significant on the level of cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster theory and discuss their qualitative impact on the proposed two-step mechanism taking into account cavity-induced molecular reorientation. We finally show that the Si-C-stretching contribution to the experimentally relevant double-peak feature of PTA exhibits a dominant dipole character, which renders it central for linear IR response and vibrational polariton formation despite the presence of CH$_3$-rocking contributions. The dipole character along the cleaving Si-C-bond is eventually shown to rationalize Rabi splittings throughout the proposed two-step mechanism. Our work refines the microscopic perspective on the S$_\mathrm{N}$2 reaction of PTA under VSC and highlights recent developments in ab initio polaritonic chemistry for the VSC regime.

Abstract: We present a model for a topological quasicrystalline system which is suitable for realisation in cold-atom experiments. We define the model in terms of complex momentum-space couplings which break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), and detail how it may be experimentally realised using two-photon Raman couplings. In the weak-potential limit, we study the model analytically by calculating the bandstructure over a `quasi-Brillouin zone' (QBZ). We find symmetry-protected Dirac cones, which are gapped by a TRS-breaking term, resulting in a Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. This provides a direct analogy to the Haldane model, but now in a quasicrystalline setting. We also infer the number of states below the topological gap from the QBZ area. We verify our analysis with numerical calculations of periodic approximants to our system, constructing a phase diagram in parameter space which shows a topological region extending beyond the weak-potential regime. We also find examples of narrow Chern bands with the potential for hosting strongly-correlated physics. Our work raises questions about the nature of localisation and strongly-correlated states in Chern bands in quasiperiodic systems.

*Suman Mondal,Emmanuel Gottlob,Fabian Heidrich-Meisner,Ulrich Schneider*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: Inter-particle interactions disrupt the quantized Thouless pump in the bosonic quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr{é} model, with the pumped charge showing sharp changes as interaction strength varies. At strong interactions, the system recovers quantization, and doublon stability depends on their band, leading to different lifetime dynamics compared to typical Floquet heating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of interaction in quantized Thouless pump in complex quantum systems is crucial in the field of condensed matter physics, as it helps to establish the conditions under which topological invariants and quantized transport can be observed, which has implications for quantum computing and other quantum technologies.

Method: The research employs numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and finite-size scaling analysis to study the system's behavior under varying interaction strengths. The Aubry-Andr{é} model's quasiperiodic potential introduces complexity, and the study focuses on the system's response to periodic driving.

Result: The key findings are that weak interactions lead to a breakdown of the quantized pump, while strong interactions restore quantization. Additionally, the stability of doublons (bound states of bosons) depends on the band they occupy: doublons in the lowest band are stably pumped, while those in higher bands dissociate during the pump, leading to a decay of the total energy over time. This finding provides a deeper understanding of how interaction strength affects the stability of topological states in periodically driven quantum systems.

Conclusion: This work highlights the significant role of interaction strength in maintaining or disrupting the quantized Thouless pump in quasiperiodic systems. The asymmetry in doublon stability under pump driving offers insights into the mechanisms behind non-equilibrium energy dynamics in driven many-body systems, opening new avenues for controlling quantum transport in such systems.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of inter-particle interaction on the quantized Thouless pump in the bosonic quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr{é} model and find that the quantization of the pumped charge breaks down already for weak interactions. Furthermore, the pumped charge undergoes sharp changes as a function of interaction strength that we can attribute to the closing of specific doublon channels. As expected, the quantization revives in the hard-core limit at very large interaction strengths where the bosons are subject to a hardcore constraint. Interestingly, the stability of isolated doublons under the pump depends on the band they are in. For repulsive interactions and a suitably fixed pump period, doublons in the lowest band are pumped stably while doublons in higher bands dissociate during the pump with one particle decaying into a lower band. This asymmetry leads to the decay of the total energy over time, in stark contrast to the typical Floquet heating expected for a driven many-body system.

Abstract: Great effort has been invested over the past decade in studying the properties of quantum droplets, a phase of bosonic quantum matter that arises as a consequence of the fluctuating Lee-Huang-Yang correction. However, the dynamics of droplet formation for heteronuclear Bose mixtures is partially understood. Here, we numerically analyze the formation process for homonuclear and heteronuclear boson mixtures in one dimension using a tight-binding model and real-time evolution. A systematic sweep of interaction strengths, mass ratios, and initial conditions allows us to characterize quantitative criteria for droplet formation and equilibration. We find that the energy contribution of the LHY correction dominates the energetic profile of the droplets formed, with the deepest binding occurring for mass ratios $m_2/m_1 \in [1.2,2.0]$. Breathing oscillations are observed, and the low equilibration rate is consistent with the restricted nature of the phase space for one-dimensional systems; the oscillation frequency is found to have a very weak correlation to the interaction strengths. For the simulation, Gaussian over discrete initial conditions are clearly favorable to the formation of droplets. The results contained herein provide rich insight into the dynamical nature of quantum droplet physics.

Abstract: We investigate the collective excitation spectrum and dynamics of a quasi two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba type spin-orbit (SO) coupling. Employing Bogoliubov-de-Gennes analysis, we analytically compute the excitation spectra across a wide range of interaction strengths and coupling parameters. By systematically varying the SO and Rabi couplings, we uncover distinct dynamical signatures of quantum phase transitions, including mode softening, the appearance of roton-like minima, and miscibility-driven instabilities in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction regimes. In the antiferromagnetic case, these instabilities lead to a dynamically unstable supersolid phase characterized by the coexistence of density modulation and global phase coherence. To corroborate the analytical predictions, we numerically solve the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations and analyze the dynamical stability of the condensate. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for spinor condensates with tunable spin-orbit coupling and demonstrate the rich interplay between spin-dependent interactions and synthetic couplings in nonequilibrium quantum fluids.

Abstract: We develop a simple and general variational method to estimate the solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations and obtain the corresponding density profiles for all spin states of a trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We further employ this approach to obtain the complete phase diagram of the system under quasi-one-dimensional harmonic confinement, with ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin interactions. We identify a suitable scaling that collapses all phase diagrams for different system sizes (i.e., total particle number) into a universal (system size-independent) phase diagram. The complete phase diagram for a confined system shows some significant qualitative differences compared to that of a condensate with homogeneous density distribution. The phase diagrams reported here could help identify the important parameter regimes in which phase transitions in the confined system, in general, occur. This knowledge of the region of phase boundaries can enable a reliable investigation of the instabilities near the boundaries that drive phase transitions.

Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for compact, high-energy power sources has outpaced the capabilities of conventional electrochemical systems that rely on outer-shell redox reactions. In this work, we present a new energy platform that utilizes inner-shell electron transitions that are previously inaccessible due to their high energy thresholds. By leveraging charge exchange processes between bare argon ions (Ar^18+) and neutral helium atoms, we provide clear evidence for the emission of soft X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet photons across a broad spectra range, resulting from inner-shell electron capture and cascade de-excitation. This strategy overcomes the limitations of radiative recombination by enhancing photon energy utilization through broader emission profiles more compatible with practical energy converters. Our design of a helium-filled chamber design enables precise control of output via pressure tuning, achieving a remarkable radiation power density of 6.29*10^8 W L^-1 and an unprecedented energy density of 2.64*10^6 Wh kg^-1. These results may provide a new and effective paradigm for energy conversion systems with ultra-high power and energy densities based on inner-shell electrons.

Abstract: Entanglement, a defining feature of quantum mechanics, arises naturally from interactions between molecular systems. Yet the precise nature and quantification of entanglement in the products of molecular collisions and reactions remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that coupling between the external (motional) and internal degrees of freedom of the colliding molecules generates diverse forms of product-state entanglement: discrete-discrete, continuum-continuum, and hybrid discrete-continuum. We develop a general theoretical framework to quantify these entanglement forms directly from scattering S-matrix elements and identify a novel class of entangled states-multimode hybrid cat states, that exhibit multimode discrete-continuum entanglement. Although applicable at arbitrary collision energies, the formalism is illustrated in the ultracold and cold regimes for inelastic Rb+SrF and Rb+Sr$^+$ collisions, as well as the chemical reaction F+HD $\rightarrow$ HF+D, DF+H. We demonstrate that entanglement can be efficiently controlled near magnetic Feshbach resonances, paving the way for precise magnetic control of product-state entanglement generation in ultracold molecular collisions.

Abstract: We extend our recently developed semiclassical strong-field Herman-Kluk propagator (SFHK) method to calculate high-order harmonic generation (HHG) for atoms in intense lasers. We show that our method, based on a combination of the Herman-Kluk propagator and the strong-field approximation, can provide highly accurate results for both HHG yield and phase, nearly identical to those from the exact numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We provide detailed analyses of our method and its applications to the HHG process, particularly the recombination time. The main computational task in this method is to solve the classical Newton equations for the active electron in the combined atomic potential and laser-electron interaction. The motion of the centers of the electron wave packets, modeled by coherent states, is governed by independent classical trajectories so that the computation can therefore be parallelized very efficiently.

Abstract: Atom interferometers are used in a variety of applications, from measuring gravity and gravity gradients in the field to performing tests of fundamental physics in the lab. One method of increasing interferometer sensitivity is to produce a larger momentum difference between interferometer arms through the use of large momentum transfer methods, such as Bragg diffraction. However, Bragg diffraction introduces systematic effects in the accumulated interferometer phase that are challenging to characterize.
  A Bragg atom interferometer is described by the one-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation (1D-TDSE). In this paper we show that for the case of Bragg diffraction the 1D-TDSE partial differential equation can be separated into several systems of ordinary differential equations, allowing for the use of adaptive step size Runge-Kutta methods. We compare the convergence of this method to the split-step and Crank-Nicolson methods, and present a method for further computational speed-ups using a lookup table.

Abstract: We measured the Q-value and the scattering angle distributions for non-dissociative state selective single electron capture in collisions of 7.5 keV H$^+$ and 15 keV H$_2^+$ with He. The experimental data are compared with semiclassical close-coupling calculations and predictions from the classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulations. By analogy with Fraunhofer diffraction, we also developed a toy model to reconstruct an imaginary screen that reflects the reaction impact-parameter dependence, in channels where the magnetic quantum number remains unchanged. It is well established that H$_2^+$ acts as a molecular double-slit in scattering processes. By demodulating the Young's double-slit-type interference pattern, we extracted the individual slit diffraction pattern of H$_2^+$ and compared it with that of the H$^+$ atomic single-slit. For ground state electron capture, we found that the single and the double slit diffraction patterns have equal fringe width, whereas for excited state electron capture, diffraction patterns are quite different.

### [202] [Worldline-Induced Transparency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17100)
*Arash Azizi*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper examines how to manipulate the Unruh response in a single detector whose acceleration path is a superposition of two accelerated worldlines. The detector is read out in a way that erases which-path information, allowing for manipulation of the response by making the excitation amplitudes from each path interfere appropriately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling the Unruh effect is important in quantum field theory and has potential applications in quantum information and quantum gravity.

Method: The authors used a combination of theoretical analysis and quantum optics formalisms to model the system and derive conditions for controlling the Unruh response.

Result: The authors derived conditions under which the Unruh response can be suppressed or restored by engineering the detector's acceleration path and interaction timing.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for controlling Unruh-like effects in experiments, potentially leading to new insights into quantum spacetime effects and their applications in quantum technology.

Abstract: We show that the Unruh response can be interferometrically suppressed or restored in a single Unruh--DeWitt detector whose center-of-mass is prepared in a coherent superposition of two uniformly accelerated worldlines. The two paths remain physically disjoint; the detector is read out in a path-erasing basis so that no which-path information is revealed. If the detector's energy gap is path dependent during the interaction, the branch amplitudes for first-order excitation become operationally indistinguishable and therefore add coherently. With appropriate tuning -- matching the gap-to-acceleration ratios of the two branches and choosing a single relative phase -- the conditional first-order excitation amplitude cancels, while reversing the phase restores the response. We derive these conditions in two complementary formalisms and interpret the mechanism as a relativistic analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency, which we term worldline-induced transparency. We also treat finite switching times explicitly and quantify how imperfect matching produces a residual signal, yielding a tolerance window rather than an idealized infinitely sharp condition.

*Heng-Yu Chen,Nick Dorey,Sanefumi Moriyama,Rishi Mouland,Canberk Sanli*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: There's a conjectured relationship between the superconformal indices of two ABJM theories in different dimensions, and the conjecture is supported by checking against existing results up to the third order in the expansion around the six-dimensional Cardy limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding dualities between theories in different spacetime dimensions is a key goal in theoretical physics, and this paper contributes to that understanding by suggesting a precise relationship between superconformal indices of ABJM theories in 3D and the N=(2,0) theory in 6D.

Method: The authors propose a precise relation between the superconformal indices of the two theories. They then verify this conjecture by comparing the indices to results available in the literature, specifically expanding around the six-dimensional Cardy limit and matching the results up to the third order.

Result: The conjectured duality is validated up to the third order in the expansion around the six-dimensional Cardy limit for the superconformal indices of the ABJM and N=(2,0) theories. This provides strong numerical support for the existence of the duality proposal.

Conclusion: The work provides numerical support for the conjectured duality between the superconformal indices of ABJM theory in 3D and the N=(2,0) theory in 6D, at least to the checked orders in the Cardy-like expansion.

Abstract: We conjecture a precise relation between the superconformal indices of two theories defined in different spacetime dimensions. The first is the three-dimensional ABJM theory describing the worldvolume of parallel M2-branes in M-theory on $\mathbb{R}^{10,1}$. The second is the $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory in six dimensions which describes the worldvolume of parallel M5-branes in the same background. As we review, the existence of such a duality is closely related to Imamura's proposal for the giant graviton expansion of the three-dimensional index. We check our conjecture against various results for the two indices available in the literature. Using an existing proposal of Hristov for the ABJM superconformal index, we verify our conjecture to the first three orders in an expansion around the six-dimensional Cardy limit.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The ``fortuitous'' Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) sector states in gauge theory have been argued to furnish a description, through holography, of generic BPS black hole microstates. They are expected to be strongly chaotic, a necessary feature to capture the black hole dynamics. This dovetails nicely with the existence of various random matrix models of JT supergravity with extended supersymmetry, within which the BPS chaos must be contained as a subsector. This paper identifies and studies a simple random matrix model that underlies all known random matrix models of JT supergravity. It is argued that it captures many essential universal features of fortuitous BPS chaos. The model is topological, naturally interpolating between the Bessel and Airy models, where the gap energy $E_0$ controls the interpolation, and seems to have a simple intersection theory interpretation.

### [205] [Entanglement Enabled Tomography of Flux Tubes in (2+1)D Yang-Mills Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17199)
*Rocco Amorosso,Sergey Syritsyn,Raju Venugopalan*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper investigates the entanglement properties of the color flux tube between a static quark-antiquark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory in (2+1)D. They introduce a new observable, FTE$^2$, which they argue captures the entanglement entropy contributed by the color degrees of freedom. They identify a characteristic length scale, the entanglement radius $ξ_0$, which increases linearly with $N_c$ and is independent of other factors like the Rényi replica number and inter-quark separation length. They find that $ξ_0$ is related to the intrinsic width $λ$ of the flux tube. The key findings are that the entanglement entropy contribution from color degrees of freedom scales with $N_c$, and this contribution can be directly linked to physical properties of the flux tube itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the entanglement properties of the color flux tube is crucial for gaining insights into the non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), particularly in the confinement regime. The identification of a scale-dependent entropy provides a bridge between the abstract concepts of entanglement entropy and the physical properties of the flux tube, such as its width and the number of colors in the gauge group.

Method: The authors consider (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory with SU(N_c) gauge groups for $2e... ≤ N_c ≤5$. They employ systematic studies of multi-slab entangling regions to clarify how the boundaries of these regions interact with the flux tube. The calculation involves measuring FTE$^2$ before and after the flux tube is severed by the entangling regions. The linear dependence of $ξ_0$ on $N_c$ is inferred by analyzing how $ξ_0$ changes with different gauge groups.

Result: The entanglement entropy contribution from the color degrees of freedom scales linearly with the number of colors $N_c$. A characteristic length scale $ξ_0$, the entanglement radius, quantifies the transverse extent of the flux tube required to preserve the color degrees of freedom' entanglement entropy. $ξ_0$ is independent of the Rényi replica number and inter-quark separation length. This quantity increases with $N_c$ and is empirically consistent with the inverse mass of the lightest glueball for the studied gauge groups. Furthermore, the dependence of FTE$^2$ on the position of the entangling region shows behavior consistent with the intrinsic width $λ$ of the flux tube.

Conclusion: The study establishes a direct link between the entanglement entropy of the color flux tube and its intrinsic properties. The entanglement radius $ξ_0$ scales with the number of colors $N_c$, and $FTE^2$'s dependence on position aligns with the flux tube's width. This work provides a foundational understanding of the relationship between flux tube properties and entropy, paving the way for future studies into the entanglement structure of QCD and the vacuum state of Yang-Mills theories.

Abstract: We investigate the entangling properties of the color flux tube between a static quark-antiquark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory. In earlier works, we defined a gauge-invariant flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), the excess entanglement entropy of a region of gluon fields that can be attributed to the color flux tube, and demonstrated that it is finite in the continuum limit. FTE$^2$ was shown to have two contributions, one from the vibrations of the QCD string, and the other from its internal (color) degrees of freedom. In this work, we further explore the internal color component in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory for $SU(N_c)$ gauge groups, varying $2\le N_c\le5$. We identify a novel physical scale in the theory, the entanglement radius $ξ_0$. This radius characterizes the transverse extent of the flux tube that must be completely severed by an entangling region to capture the entanglement entropy of color degrees of freedom. The key feature underlying this phenomenon is its topological nature. This is revealed through systematic studies of multi-slab entangling regions in which FTE$^2$ changes sharply when boundaries of the slabs completely cross-cut the flux tube. We find that $ξ_0$ increases approximately linearly with $N_c$ and is independent of both Rényi replica number and the inter-quark separation length. We also study FTE$^2$ as a function of the entangling region's transverse displacement from the static quark pair and observe behavior consistent with a previously identified intrinsic width $λ$ of the flux tube, with an extracted value in agreement with the inverse mass of the lightest glueball for the gauge groups studied.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explain that the logic behind the derivation of the Noumi-Shiraishi function can be applied directly to the Baker-Akhiezer function (BAF). This amounts to changing an ansatz for BAF to a nested one, where the BAF of N + 1 variables is recursively expressed as a sum over BAFs of N variables. This may be seen as a generalization of symmetrization trick from [1], but for the generally non-symmetric BAF. We demonstrate that, for usual non-twisted (a = 1) BAFs, this method correctly reproduces the Noumi-Shiraishi formula directly from linear equations, resolving the ambiguity related to non-simple roots. For the first non-trivial twisted case (N = 3, a = 2) this method also fixes this ambiguity, moreover, answers for the first few layers of coefficients are in the form of direct quantization of [1].

Abstract: We construct a holographic c-function for sine dilaton gravity (sDG) in the domain wall gauge. We show the equivalence between sDG and the two copies of Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT) and compute the associated central charge. We reproduce the central charge of LCFT from the holographic c-function of sDG corresponding to the UV limit. In contrast, in the deep IR limit, the c-function flows to the pure JT gravity, where the central charge becomes identically zero.

Abstract: We study the power spectral density of time delay fluctuations in an interferometer as a potential low-energy quantum gravitational observable. We derive a general expression for the spectrum in terms of the Wightman function of linear metric perturbations, which we then apply to a variety of cases. We analyze the intrinsic graviton fluctuations in the vacuum, thermal, and squeezed states, as well as the fluctuations induced by the vacuum stress-energy of a massless scalar field. We find that the resulting spectra are free of ultraviolet divergences and that, while thermal and squeezed states provide a natural amplification mechanism, the spectra remain suppressed by the Planck scale.

Abstract: We present a first-principles, non-perturbative worldline instanton analysis of vacuum decay in the non-abelian Yang-Mills root of a Schwarzschild background. We recover the gauge theory color-thermal spectrum as a topological winding mode. The double copy maps vacuum response from the gauge theory directly to the gravity theory. Furthermore, the decay exponent acquires a universal quadratic correction from color charge conservation, showing that the double copy correctly captures the non-linear backreaction as required for unitarity.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents exact charged and rotating asymptotically Lifshitz black hole solutions in five dimensions with electric, axionic charges, and dynamic exponent z. The solutions solve Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell-Chern-Simons equations. Their thermodynamics are consistent with first law and Smarr relation. In the rotating phase, they drive the study of superconductivity. Spin-2 scalar condensation and AC conductivity show that rotation suppresses condensation and weakens the superconducting phase, while higher z enhances the phase. This is the first 5D rotating Lifshitz black hole with both electric and axionic charges, opening new avenues in holography beyond static backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring black hole solutions and their applications in gauge/gravity duality, particularly in non-relativistic settings, is increasingly important. This paper contributes by providing rotating and charged black holes, enhancing the understanding of such systems in holographic contexts.

Method: The authors solve the Einstein equations coupled to necessary fields (dilaton, gauge fields, axions, Chern-Simons terms) assuming asymptotically Lifshitz and rotational symmetries, achieving a novel exact solution. Thermodynamical analysis, including calculation of Smarr relation and first law, is conducted.

Result: The key results include: 1) novel black hole solutions with specified charges and dynamics; 2) consistent thermodynamics verifying the Smarr relation and first law; 3) in the rotating case, superconductivity studies show rotation suppresses scalar condensation and weakens the superconducting phase, while increasing dynamical exponent z enhances the phase; 4) this is the first five-dimensional rotating Lifshitz black hole with both electric and axionic charges, opening new avenues in non-static holographic studies.

Conclusion: This paper successfully constructs five-dimensional rotating charged Lifshitz black holes and applies the results to study holographic superconductivity, demonstrating the dynamic interplay between charge, rotation, and critical exponents. The findings contribute to non-relativistic gauge/gravity correspondence and open new research directions in black hole thermodynamics and condensed matter physics. The construction of such black hole solutions is set in standard gravity, suggesting next steps could involve the inclusion of more exotic matter fields or additional supergravity couplings.

Abstract: In the present paper, we construct a new family of exact charged and rotating asymptotically Lifshitz black hole solutions in five dimensions. The spacetime solves Einstein equations coupled to a dilaton, two Abelian gauge fields, and axionic scalars supplemented by two generalized Chern-Simons terms. This configuration is characterized by a range of the free dynamical exponent $z$ and possesses nontrivial thermodynamical parameters, where we verify the first law of black hole thermodynamics and derive the corresponding Smarr relation. Motivated by applications to gauge/gravity duality, we then investigate a holographic superconductor in the rotating Lifshitz background. We study the condensation of the scalar operator and the AC conductivity of the dual system. These results show that increasing the rotation parameter suppresses the condensate and weakens the superconducting phase, while increasing the dynamical critical exponent enhances the superconducting order. To the best of our knowledge, the solutions presented here are the first to demonstrate five-dimensional rotating Lifshitz black holes supported by both electric and axionic charges. This opens up a new avenue to investigate non-relativistic holography beyond static backgrounds.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-perturbative limitations on low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) based on the characteristics of high-energy theory are provided by the analyticity of the flat-space version of the S-matrix. Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions.

Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model describing interacting pomerons and odderons is proposed with triple reggeon vertices taking into account the negative signature of the odderon. Its simplified version with zero transverse dimensions is first considered. No phase transition occurs in this case at the intercept crossing unity. This simplified model is studied without more approximations by numerical techniques. The physically relevant model in the two-dimensional transverse space is then studied by the renormalization group method in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied. Five real fixed points are found with singularities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase transition as the intercepts cross unity. The new phases, however, are not physical, since they violate the projectile-target symmetry. In the vicinity of fixed points the asymptotical behaviour of Green functions and elastic scattering amplitude is found under Glauber approximation for couplings to participants.

Abstract: We thoroughly investigate nonanalytic terms in the finite-temperature effective potential in one-loop approximation on a $D$-dimensional spacetime, $S_τ\times R^{D-(p+1)}\times \prod_{i=1}^p S_i^1$, using a mode recombination formula. Such nonanalytic terms cannot be expressed as positive powers of field-dependent mass squared. The formula provides a clear separation of the effective potential into a part that contains the nonanalytic terms and a part that is purely analytic, and clarifies the origin of the nonanalytic terms. We obtain all the nonanalytic terms and show that only two types of nonanalytic terms arise: power-type and logarithmic-one. For a real scalar field with periodic boundary conditions, the manner of the emergence of these terms is highly characteristic; the two types never appear simultaneously. By contrast, for fermions with general boundary conditions, we find that neither of the two types appears. These results clarify the nonanalytic structure of the finite-temperature effective potential on the spacetime with compactified spatial dimensions.

Abstract: We investigate the holographic timelike entanglement entropy (HTEE) and timelike subregion complexity of a thermal CFT$_d$ deformed by a relevant scalar operator $φ_0$, dual to a hairy black hole in AdS$_{d+1}$. We employ the prescription of merging spacelike and timelike surfaces at the interior, constructing an extremal surface homologous to a boundary timelike subsystem with a time interval $Δt$. Consequently, this deformation breaks the invariance of the imaginary component of HTEE observed in pure AdS$_3$ and BTZ geometry, introducing a nontrivial dependence on $Δt$. At small $Δt$, we derive analytical expressions that are in agreement with numerical results, and observe partial consistency with analytic continuation to temporal or spacelike entanglement entropy at the level of the near-boundary expansion. However, analytic continuation of CFT temporal entanglement entropy fails to reproduce the HTEE calculations under boundary deformation, even in $d=2$. Furthermore, we extend the numerical calculations to higher dimensions ($d=3$). In addition, we study holographic timelike subregion complexity within the complexity=volume conjecture and find that it remains real-valued, providing a complementary geometric probe of the black hole interior. In particular, for the BTZ black hole, we analytically show that the UV-finite term of the subregion complexity receives its entire contribution from the interior region alone.

*Federico Ambrosino,Tomáš Procházka*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究了二维共形场理论中由扩展的更高自旋$	ext{W}$-对称性支配的RG流动，提出了新的RG流动类$	ext{W}_N(p,q)	o	ext{W}_N(p,kp-q)$，并通过匹配非可逆对称性$	ext{Rep}[SU(N)_{p-N}]$（及其离散商）的异常来处理这些流动。这些流动扩大了最近在Virasoro代数中发现的RG流动，并包含所有已知的$	ext{W}_N$的RG流动。它们的显著特性是与$	ext{W}$-代数的秩$N$无关。

Motivation: 研究RG流动在更高自旋对称性中的行为以填补现有理论的空白是重要的。特别是对于$	ext{W}_N$-代数，理解其RG流动的结构和流动之间的关系有潜在的物理应用，如非临界$string$理论、临界现象和统计力学模型。

Method: 通过定义$	ext{W}_N(p,q)$的非可逆对称性，推导出其与$	ext{W}_N(p,kp-q)$之间的RG流动，利用超对称性和 anomalies匹配方法实现了这一推广。

Conclusion: 这项研究扩展了$	ext{W}_N$RG流动的已知类别，并以一种与秩$N$无关的方式统一了这些流动。结果不仅丰富了理论结构，还为相关物理问题提供了新的工具和分析框架。

Abstract: In this letter we study renormalization group (RG) flows between 2d conformal field theories enjoying extended higher-spin $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry. We propose a new class of RG flows between the diagonal minimal models of $\mathcal{W}_N$-algebra that take the form $\mathcal{W}_N(p,q)\to\mathcal{W}_N(p,kp-q)$. These are obtained by matching the anomalies of the non-invertible symmetry ${\mathrm{Rep}}[SU(N)_{p-N}]$ (and its discrete quotients) that is preserved by special relevant primary fields. This large non-invertible symmetry includes the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry of the minimal models. Our new flows furnish a significant generalization of the ones recently found in the case of Virasoro algebra, and include all previously known RG flows of $\mathcal{W}_N$. They have the remarkable property of being uniform in the rank $N$ of the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra.

### [218] [Black Hole Interior and Time-like Entanglement Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18319)
*Zi-Hao Li,Run-Qiu Yang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 我们提出时间型纠缠熵（TEE）来表征黑洞内部，从单边界视角出发。在双曲黑洞AdS中，TEE在时间宽度很大时线性增长，而其虚部具实际意义。通过分析带有电荷和标量毛的黑洞，我们发现TEE识别了类型-I和类型-II内部的‘因果相变’——由奇点结构区分。我们发现一个临界时间宽度τ_c，作为相变的秩序参数：当条纹宽度小于τ_c时，系统进入由纯时间贡献主导的‘时间型纠缠相变’；当宽度大于τ_c时，空间型纠缠重新出现。特别的是，柯西视界的存在使τ_c无穷大，导致纯时间型纠缠。这些结果表明TEE可能提供一个边界量子信息量的新度量，用于识别黑洞内部隐藏的结构，并暗示TEE与宇宙 censorship有着深层联系。

Motivation: 研究黑洞内部结构的量子纠缠度量，有助于理解量子引力、相变及其与宇宙基本理论的联系。

Method: 通过 Schwarzschild-AdS 和带有电荷和标量毛的黑洞模型，利用数值计算和理论分析研究时间型边界条纹的纠缠熵。

Result: 时间型纠缠熵在长段时间宽度下呈线性增长，虚部有意义；通过分析带有电荷和标量毛的黑洞，TEE识别了内部的因果相变；临界时间宽度τ_c作为相变的秩序参数，小于τ_c时进入纯时间型纠缠相变，大于τ_c时恢复空间型纠缠。特别地，柯西视界的存在使τ_c趋于无穷大，导致纯时间型纠缠。

Conclusion: 时间型纠缠熵为探索黑洞内部结构提供了新工具，展示了其潜在在量子引力和宇宙学中的重要作用。

Abstract: We establish time-like entanglement entropy (TEE) as a novel tool to characterize the black hole interior from a single-boundary perspective. In the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, we show that TEE of time-like boundary strips exhibits linear growth as a function of temporal width in the limit of large temporal width, and that its imaginary part carries physical significance rather than being a constant. By analyzing charged, scalar-hairy black holes, we present evidence that TEE detects a hidden "causal phase transition" separating Type-I and Type-II interiors -- distinguished by singularity structure. We identify a critical temporal width $τ_c$ that acts as the order parameter for this transition: for strips narrower than $τ_c$, the system enters a distinct "time-like entanglement phase" dominated purely by time-like contributions, up to a regulator effect; conversely, for strips wider than $τ_c$, space-like entanglement re-emerges. Notably, the existence of a Cauchy horizon drives the $τ_c$ to infinity, leading to pure time-like entanglement. These results suggest that the TEE may supply a novel boundary quantum-information measure to detect structure hidden inside the black hole and suggests a deep connection between TEE and cosmic censorship.

Conclusion: 小波基函数在哈密顿方法中为非微扰场论提供了有效的截断方式，计算在趋于已知值时收敛。

Abstract: We apply the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to investigate nonperturbative dynamics within the Hamiltonian framework. In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $φ^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 > 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations.

Abstract: It is well known that a general two-point function cannot be uniquely determined in a theory with Poincaré symmetry. In this paper, we show that bulk-to-boundary correlators are highly constrained after imposing suitable fall-off conditions near future/past null infinity. More precisely, scalar bulk-to-boundary correlators are fixed to a unique form up to a normalization constant, whereas fermionic bulk-to-boundary correlators are fixed to a linear superposition of scalar and fermionic branches. This is established by asymptotically expanding the Ward identities, where upon the leading terms decouple from the subleading ones. In the fermionic branch, the power-law exponent of the bulk-to-boundary correlator is greater by one than the fall-off index. Consequently, we revisit the relation between Carrollian correlators and momentum space scattering amplitudes for fermionic operators. In this context, we find that the Fourier transform bridging the two acquires an extra factor of $\sqrtω$ for each fermionic operator. Furthermore, we reduce the bulk-to-boundary correlator to the boundary-to-boundary correlator and identify a critical fall-off index $Δ=1$. For $0 \le Δ< 1$, only a magnetic branch exists for scalars. For $Δ> 1$, the electric branch is always divergent for both scalar and fermionic branches and thus requires regularization.

Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the classical duality between the $SIM(2)$-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond (MKR) theory and a self-dual non-gauge-invariant model. First, we establish the equivalence in the free-field case using two complementary methods: a direct comparison of the equations of motion and the master Lagrangian approach. In both methodologies, we verify that the classical correspondence between the MKR model and self-dual fields exhibits modifications induced by very special relativity (VSR). Moreover, we employ the master Lagrangian approach to examine the duality when the self-dual model is minimally coupled to fermionic matter. We show that the resulting MKR model contains Thirring-like interactions modified by nonlocal contributions arising from VSR.

Abstract: The AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude has recently been generalized to the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence between type IIB string theory on $ AdS_3 \times S^3 \times K3$ (or $T^4$), supported by Ramond-Ramond flux, and the D1-D5 CFT. In this paper, we use the $ AdS\times S$ Virasoro-Shapiro machinery to extract strong-coupling CFT data of the D1-D5 CFT by extending and completing earlier analyses in several directions. First, starting from the superconformal/Mellin block expansion of four-point functions of half-BPS tensor operators with arbitrary external KK modes, we employ the full $ AdS\times S$ Mellin formalism to bootstrap the $ AdS_3 \times S^3$ Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for general KK configurations. This establishes its consistency with superconformal symmetry and yields a wealth of additional CFT data naturally organized in internal Mellin space. Second, we push the computation to the next order in the strong-coupling expansion and extract additional higher-order CFT data. Third, we translate the resulting Mellin-space data into the internal spin basis. We derive the transformation kernel relating internal Mellin variables and $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ R-symmetry spins. As applications, we obtain explicit formulae for the scaling dimensions of long multiplets on the first two leading Regge trajectories of arbitrary internal spins, and certain three-point functions with half-BPS tensor operators. These results provide a valuable set of analytic D1-D5 CFT data, enabling future applications and direct comparison with complementary approaches such as integrability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture that doubled four-dimensional Chern-Simons produces new integrable models, we perform its Hamiltonian analysis and find the theory's Poisson algebra. This requires carefully accounting for a set of boundary conditions that identify two gauge fields. Two methods for doing so are given, one of which is based on edge-modes and the other on a recharacterisation of the boundary conditions as constraints. We find that the Poisson algebra is that of an affine Gaudin model subject to a constraint, generalising the Goddard-Kent-Olive construction (from conformal field theory) to the world of integrable models. We also conjecture the existence of extended quantum groups and a generalisation of the affine Harish-Chandra Isomorphism.

Abstract: The (holomorphic) partition function of the Euclidean BTZ black hole with boundary modulus $τ$, is the $S$-image of the Virasoro vacuum character, $χ_{\rm vac}(-1/τ)$. This object decomposes into primaries via the modular $S$-kernel: $χ_{\rm vac}\left(-\frac{1}τ\right)=\int_{0}^{\infty} dP S_{0P}(P,c)χ_P(τ)$. In this paper, we provide a bulk understanding of this spectral resolution using the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS$_3$ gravity with $two$ boundaries: an asymptotic torus and an excised Wilson line at the origin ("stretched horizon"). At infinity, we impose standard AdS$_3$ Drinfel'd-Sokolov (DS) gauge to obtain the Alekseev-Shatashvili (AS) boundary action for a coadjoint orbit. At the inner boundary, removing the Wilson line prepares the state at the cut as a sum over orbits of the $spatial$ cycle. Re-inserting a spatial holonomy Wilson line acts as a delta-function projector onto the corresponding primary, which together with boundary gravitons, reproduces the Virasoro character (e.g., of a conical defect). But we can also consider projectors onto the $conjugate$ basis $\tilde P$, of the dual cycle. A key observation is that this leads to $S$-kernels instead of delta functions, with the BTZ character arising when the dual cycle label is in the exceptional orbit. Our two-boundary construction provides a bulk understanding of BTZ entropy: holonomy zero modes at the horizon have an effective central charge $c_{\rm prim}=c-1$ from the kernel measure (primaries), while the universal Dedekind-$η$ in $χ_P(τ)$ contributes $c_{\rm desc}=1$ from boundary gravitons (descendants). Together, they reproduce the full Cardy entropy. While our methods are specific to AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, they are an explicit illustration that smoothness of the (Euclidean) horizon may emerge from a $sum$ over bulk states which are manifestly unsmooth.

Abstract: We initiate a study of subregion dualities, entropy, and redundant encoding of bulk points in holographic theories deformed by $T \bar T$ and its generalizations. This includes both cut off versions of Anti de Sitter spacetime, as well as the generalization to bulk de Sitter spacetime, for which we introduce two additional examples capturing different patches of the bulk and incorporating the second branch of the square root dressed energy formula. We provide new calculations of entanglement entropy (EE) for more general divisions of the system than the symmetric ones previously available. We find precise agreement between the gravity side and deformed-CFT side results to all orders in the deformation parameter at large central charge. An analysis of the fate of strong subadditivity for relatively boosted regions indicates nonlocality reminiscent of string theory. We introduce the structure of operator algebras in these systems. The causal and entanglement wedges generalize to appropriate deformed theories but exhibit qualitatively new behaviors, e.g. the causal wedge may exceed the entanglement wedge. This leads to subtleties which we express in terms of the Hamiltonian and modular Hamiltonian evolution. Finally, we exhibit redundant encoding of bulk points, including the cosmological case.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy holds transformative potential for non-invasive sensing, yet characterizing individual nanoparticles in complex biological environments remains challenging due to the far-field diffraction limit. While near-field dipolar theory is well established, its application to characterizing/identifying nanoparticles immersed in complex media at THz frequencies is largely unexplored.
  This work utilizes numerical simulations of magneto-optical (MO) heterodimers -- comprising n-doped Indium Antimonide (n-InSb) and isotropic or birefringent particles (e.g., SiO2, GaSe) -- under counter-propagating, circularly polarized THz illumination. We demonstrate that while far-field observables like absorption cross-sections are often dominated by the MO-active particle, mechanical variables-specifically induced binding forces and spin/orbital torques-exhibit superior sensitivity for detecting "hidden" neighboring components. Because these mechanical signatures depend directly on near-field interactions, they provide higher information density regarding interparticle coupling.
  Key findings reveal material-specific spectral "hotspots" and "zeros" that serve as robust calibration markers even within dispersive biological surrogates. We show that the spin torque on non-MO particles is significantly modified by MO-neighbor proximity, a phenomenon controllable via static magnetic fields. Furthermore, these variables exhibit high angular sensitivity in perpendicular configurations. Our results provide a roadmap for using optomechanical signatures as high-resolution detectors for in-vivo diagnostics, signal transduction, and low-energy nanocircuit control.

TL;DR: Physics-informed machine learning (PDE-Net, PIDE-embedNet, and PINO) shows potential for real-time control of electrochemical devices, each with trade-offs in training effort, inference speed, and extrapolation capability. PDE-Net is simple but requires retraining for parameter changes. PIDE-embedNet excels with irregular geometries. PINO performs best on regular grids with fast inference and strong extrapolation. Future applications include real-time concentration prediction, fault detection, and optimal power management.

Motivation: Electrochemical devices are becoming increasingly important due to the green energy transition. Controller technology for these devices is crucial, especially for fast transients or faults, requiring real-time control. Physics-informed machine learning provides a promising solution, leveraging the complexity of the physical phenomena involved.

Method: The paper evaluates three frameworks: PINN, PIDE-embedNet, and PINO. It assesses their training effort, inference speed, and extrapolation capacity. The analysis reveals trade-offs in simplicity, adaptability, and performance.

Result: PINN is simple but requires retraining for parameter changes. PIDE-embedNet is suitable for irregular geometries. PINO performs best on regular grids with fast inference and strong extrapolation capabilities. All three show potential for real-time control applications.

Conclusion: Physics-informed operator learning is a promising approach for next-generation electrochemical device controller technology, with each framework having specific advantages depending on the geometry and required performance characteristics.

Abstract: Electrochemical devices (batteries, fuel cells, and electrolyzers) are in full development, driven by the green energy transition. Their real-time control requires ms predictions in order to take critical decisions during fast transients or faults. The physics behind include coupled multi-physics phenomena that conventional finite element methods cannot solve so fast with the current CPU technology. This paper evaluates the potential of physics-informed machine learning represented by three frameworks: \ac{pinn}, \ac{pideeponet}, and \ac{pino} by evaluating their training effort, inference speed, and extrapolation capacity. Our analysis reveals valuable performance trade-offs. \acp{pinn} offer simplicity for fixed problem instances but require retraining for parameter changes. \ac{pideeponet} enables operator learning across varying conditions with mesh-free geometric flexibility. \ac{pino} delivers superior performance on regular grids, with the strongest extrapolation capabilities due to spectral derivative computation and resolution invariance. \ac{pideeponet} is particularly suited for irregular, unstructured geometries (e.g., porous electrodes or complex flow fields), while \ac{pino} works best for layered, structured-grid problems (e.g., transport across stacked electrochemical layers) requiring fast inference. Possible future applications include real-time lithium concentration prediction for safe fast-charging and micro short circuit detection, water management in fuel cells, and optimal power management in electrolyzers under intermittent renewable inputs. These findings establish physics-informed operator learning as a transformative approach for next-generation electrochemical device controller technology.

Result: CO2 shows significant enhancement potential (2-86%) in mitigating thermal loss compared to other materials in non-evacuated settings. It is an effective alternative to more complex materials like transparent heat mirrors and aerogels.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a combination of thermal loss mitigators and appropriate surface orientations can maximize mitigation. CO2 proves to be a cost-effective and effective solution in many cases.

Abstract: Optically transparent thermal loss mitigators have recently seen renewed research interests owing to their increasing relevance in the realms ranging from smart windows, efficient greenhouse designs and high-performance-low-cost solar thermal systems. In depth understanding of the heat transport mechanisms and their quantification is crucial for building efficient opto-thermal management strategies for optimization of the aforementioned systems. The present work serves to identify and quantify the key heat transfer mechanisms operative in a host of optically transparent thermal loss mitigators. In particular, comprehensive experimental modelling frameworks have been developed to investigate the efficacy of carbon dioxide gas (CO2), air, vacuum (0.07mbar), transparent heat mirrors (Indium tin oxide coated glass) and aerogels (silica-based) in mitigating thermal losses. Detailed and careful experimental modelling reveals that it is imperative to employ more than one thermal loss mitigator and choose correct absorber surface orientation (relative to the irradiation direction) to maximize thermal loss mitigation. Magnitude of absorber surface stagnation temperature has been employed as the figure of merit to quantitatively compare various optically transparent thermal loss mitigators. Under un-evacuated conditions, CO2 has emerged as potent alternative to more sophisticated optically transparent thermal loss mitigators like aerogels and transparent heat mirrors. Enhancements (relative to air) on the order of 2%-7%, 46%-84%, 57%-84% and 66%-86% are observed in case of CO2, vacuum, transparent heat mirrors (vacuum) and aerogel (vacuum) respectively.

Abstract: The methods of time-reversed acoustics and Green's function retrieval are traditionally deployed for classical inhomogeneous, time-invariant materials. The mutual relation between these methods is well-established. Recently, similar methods have been proposed for homogeneous, time-variant materials. Here we investigate their mutual relation and their relation with the corresponding methods in classical materials. For this analysis we make use of the fact that the wave equations for both types of material are similar, with the roles of time and space interchanged. However, the principle of causality holds for both types of material, hence, here the roles of time and space are not interchanged. We find that:
  (1) whereas classical time-reversed acoustics involves emission of a time-reversed single-component wave field from a (ideally closed) boundary into the inhomogeneous material, its idealized counterpart involves emission of a sign-reversed two-component wave field, recorded in a time-reversed material, from a single time instant into the actual time-variant material;
  (2) whereas classical Green's function retrieval involves temporal crosscorrelation of wave fields at two space locations in response to single-component sources on a (ideally closed) boundary, its counterpart involves spatial crosscorrelation of wave fields at two time instants in response to two-component sources at a single time instant.
