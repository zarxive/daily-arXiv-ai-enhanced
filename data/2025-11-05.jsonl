In this work, we extend the measurable film-thickness range of\nreflectometry to at least 50 um through a new model-free algorithm, the\nLinearized Reflectance Zero-Crossing (LRZ) method. The approach builds upon the\npreviously reported Linearized Reflectance Extrema (LRE) technique but\neliminates the sensitivity to spectral sampling and fringe attenuation that\ndegrade performance in the thick-film regime. By linearizing phase response and\nextracting zero-crossing positions in wavenumber space, LRZ provides robust and\nrepeatable thickness estimation without iterative fitting, achieving comparable\naccuracy with much higher computational efficiency than conventional\nmodel-based methods. Validation using more than 80 measurements on alumina\nfilms over NiFe substrates shows excellent correlation with WLI (r = 0.97) and\nlow gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R < 3%).

However, applications like low-background experiments that search\nfor rare physics, such as dark matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and\ncoherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, could profit a lot from a more\ndetailed understanding of the detector response close to the surface. The outer\n$n^+$ electrode of the $p$-type HPGe detector forms a layer with reduced charge\ncollection, and events originating here can be a critical background source in\nsuch experiments. If the difference in detector pulse shape between detector\nsurface and bulk events is known, it can be used to identify and veto these\nbackground events.

Here, we\npropose and analyze a strategy for distinguishing among N phase-symmetric\ncoherent states, which optimally takes unambiguous discrimination (UD) to the\ndeterministic regime, at the inevitable cost of having non-zero probability of\nerror. Despite the disturbance introduced by the separation map used in the UD\nprocess, we show that for N > 2, the \"failure\" states of UD retain residual\ninformation about the original input states, which can be further used for\ndiscrimination. Rather than discarding inconclusive outcomes as in conventional\nUD, we show that the \"failure\" states of UD can be optimally recycled by\nperforming a sequential minimum-error discrimination (MED). This strategy,\nwhich we call information recycling (IR), combines the benefits of both MED and\noptimal UD: It always provides conclusive results while allowing for a subset\nof those results to be error-free, which are identifiable by an ancillary\nsystem. We characterize the disturbance introduced by the state separation map\nby the infidelity between input and failure states, demonstrating that it lower\nbounds the error probability in the recycling stage.

In this\nwork, we study three models of two-qubit open quantum systems. The first model\ncomprises two central spins immersed in spin baths, and both central spins are\ncollectively considered as quantum batteries. The impact of inter-qubit\ninteractions on the performance of the quantum battery is investigated. In the\nsecond model, a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath serves\nas a collective quantum battery, where the impact of inter-atomic distance and\nthe bath temperature on the battery's performance is explored. Furthermore, a\ntwo-qubit model is used, where one qubit is modeled as a battery and the other\nas a charger. The charger in this model interacts with an anisotropic\nspin-chain bath, which is conducive to quantum criticality. It is demonstrated\nthat this criticality has a substantial impact on the quantum battery's storage\ncapacity."}

This\nresearch offers a broad roadmap for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning\n(TQML), integrating three foundational pillars of reliability: (i) uncertainty\nquantification for calibrated and risk-aware decision making, (ii) adversarial\nrobustness against classical and quantum-native threat models, and (iii)\nprivacy preservation in distributed and delegated quantum learning scenarios.\nWe formalize quantum-specific trust metrics grounded in quantum information\ntheory, including a variance-based decomposition of predictive uncertainty,\ntrace-distance-bounded robustness, and differential privacy for hybrid learning\nchannels. To demonstrate feasibility on current NISQ devices, we validate a\nunified trust assessment pipeline on parameterized quantum classifiers,\nuncovering correlations between uncertainty and prediction risk, an asymmetry\nin attack vulnerability between classical and quantum state perturbations, and\nprivacy-utility trade-offs driven by shot noise and quantum channel noise.

Each agent operates as a finite transverse-field Ising\nsubsystem, maintaining internal quantum coherence while interacting through\nstate-dependent feedback channels characterised by reduced observables such as\nspin polarisation, bond correlation, and internal energy. These informational\ncouplings enable the transformation of a static lattice into a\nfeedback-reconfigurable medium. The effective Hamiltonian generated, which\nremains Hermitian at each iteration, is resolved self-consistently using a\nmean-field approximation, where the feedback fields are iteratively adjusted to\nminimise the total energy. Numerical investigations identify three distinct\nregimes: domain formation near the feedback--fluctuation critical point,\nglass-like frustration due to competing feedback channels, and modular\npolarisation sustained by structured interactions. These phenomena occur\nindependently of geometric embedding, illustrating that informational\nsimilarity alone can induce coherent organisation. The AQIA framework is\nadaptable to implementation on superconducting, trapped-ion, or Rydberg\nplatforms, offering a minimalistic model for exploring self-organisation and\nlearning in adaptive programmable quantum matter."}
