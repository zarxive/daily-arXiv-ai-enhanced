This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases."}

The role of the initial polarization and the Feshbach detuning are investigated. It is found with an increasing initial population imbalance, the longituidinal relaxation time (that governs the dyanamics of the polarization) grows, while the transverse relaxation time (that governs the dynamics of the coherence) decays. As for the varying Feshbach detuning, it is observed that the longituidinal relaxation time reaches its minima and its transverse counterpart reaches its maxima near the resonance.

MEMs vapor cell fabrication for Rydberg atom radio frequency sensors is particularly demanding. The Rydberg states used for the sensor can shift in a constant electric field which can be generated by the internal surfaces of the vapor cell cavity. The ratio of the detection wavelength to vapor cell size can span a large range, meaning that the radio frequency field-vapor cell interaction is a critical design consideration. In many radio frequency sensing cases, there is a desire to minimize the interaction between the vapor cell and the target radio frequency field, as well as assure that every vapor cell behaves uniformly. These criterion favor MEMs vapor cells with low background electric fields. Known inert, organic coatings cannot survive the bonding temperatures required for conventional anodic bonding of a MEMs vapor cell. Applying inert, organic coatings to the internal cavities of MEMs vapor cells is a longstanding challenge. In this paper, we present a low temperature bonding scheme that is compatible with coating the internal cavity of a MEMs vapor cell with Octadecyltrichlorosilane (CH$_3\\,$(CH$_2$)$_{17}\\,$SiCl$_3$, OTS).

However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis.

Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^α$ (with $α\\approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^α$ (with $α\\approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < α< 2$."}

However, implementing magnetoplasmon-assisted resonant transistors at terahertz frequencies has remained challenging so far. Here we use gate-dependent, on-chip terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field to resolve and probe the evolution of resonant magnetoplasmons in antenna-coupled monolayer and bilayer graphene TeraFETs. In monolayer graphene the dispersion reflects the Dirac nature of the carriers, exhibiting a non-monotonic density dependence due to the interplay of plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal plasmon-cyclotron coupling. In contrast, in bilayer graphene we recover and map a magnetoplasmon dispersion consistent with the conventional Schrödinger-type picture.

Here, we overcome these limitations by synthesizing 2D single crystal ErOCl that has an Er density of 1.75*1022 cm-3. The high-quality single crystal material significantly reduces the density-related quenching effect that dominates in randomly doped materials with high Er concentration. This results in a record optical gain coefficient over 1500 dB/cm at 1536 nm band, at least larger by an order of magnitude than the previous gain record in Er materials. Leveraging this exceptional gain medium, we demonstrate room-temperature continuous-wave lasing operation by integrating with a photonic crystal microcavity, achieving a record-low threshold of 7 μW with the most compact size of any Er-based lasers. Furthermore, the unique Stark splitting characteristics of ErOCl provide optical gain in three wavelength bands and lead to lasing in these wavelengths by engineering the cavity. This is the first time that optical gain has been shown in three different wavelength bands in Er materials, together with the smallest size of laser cavity, could have many important applications in on-chip sensing and optical communication."}

In this paper, we explore the image formation of electric dipoles and quadrupoles near a conducting sphere and uncover a wonderful result: the image of a given multipole is not necessarily of the same type. Instead, alongside the expected multipole image, the resulting image configuration also includes lower-order multipole contributions. This finding broadens the understanding of electrostatic images and offers new insights into the interaction of multipoles with conducting boundaries."}

The baby universe spacetime originates from the black hole interior in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. The holographic description is a low-temperature thermal pure state of two Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. The construction of the state relies on the insertion of a heavy matter operator, which supports the baby universe, together with a first-order thermal phase transition between a black hole phase and an empty Anti de Sitter (AdS) phase. For the transition, we employ a version of the Maldacena-Qi phase transition of two coupled SYK systems. The bulk entanglement between the AdS region and the baby universe remains O(N) below the transition, owing to the large number of light bulk fields. This entanglement admits a definition through coarse-graining over SYK couplings."}

The ontology names key device types, signals, parameters, and regions, and relates them through explicit properties (e.g., hasSetpoint, hasReadback, partOf). Each site contributes a lightweight facility bundle, a profile that maps local conventions into the shared vocabulary plus data slices that instantiate those mappings, without renaming channel addresses or changing existing systems. Using standard W3C technologies, the approach supports both sparse and rich descriptions. We demonstrate the idea on two beamline segments at different laboratories. A single semantic query is expressed once and evaluated against both knowledge bases, returning the locally correct PVs. The ontology thereby enables not only portable workflows but also interoperable data, since measurements and catalogs are annotated with shared semantics rather than facility-specific names. The framework complements, rather than replaces, existing middle layers and lattice/data standards, and it creates a stable foundation for reusable tools and agentic workflows."}

Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \\neq 0$. Our study demonstrates that a semiclassical approach effectively captures the $1/3$ plateau in the kagome lattice and serves as a valuable tool for interpreting experimental and numerical results alike."}

In this paper we investigate the birefringence properties of this crystalline semiconductor material by modulating the optical illumination on the mirror coating and monitoring the induced birefringence. While the measured low-frequency birefringence values align with previous studies, we observed a frequency-dependent behavior in the illumination-to-birefringence coupling, characterized by a pole increasing with illumination intensity and a DC gain decreasing with illumination intensity. We developed a theoretical mode based on a master equation to characterize the measurement results by considering photon-induced electric fields and electro-optical effects. This model reproduces the frequency and intensity dependencies of the induced birefringence. Additionally, this model predicts a generation-recombination noise (GR noise) will be observable in the coatings birefringence. While the presented measurement cannot predict the exact level of GR noise, for the frequency band and spot sizes relevant for gravitational-wave detectors we expect GR noise to be white below the pole frequency, scale with power the same way laser shot noise does, and for fixed power be independent of spot size."}

As the simplest protonated Schiff base (PSB), it also serves as a model for studying the nonadiabatic dynamics of retinal PSB, the chromophore central to vertebrate vision. While previous studies have established CN bond cleavage and photoisomerization as the primary pathways in the photochemistry of CH$_2$NH$_2^+$, we now report a new UV-induced photochemical pathway to HCNH$^+$, the dominant ion in Titan's upper atmosphere. Through high-level XMCQDPT2 and CASSCF(12,12) calculations, we identify a novel S$_1$/S$_0$ conical intersection that mediates the concerted double H-atom elimination from the carbon center of CH$_2$NH$_2^+$, yielding carbene CNH$_2^+$ as a direct precursor to HCNH$^+$. On-the-fly trajectory surface hopping dynamics confirm the presence of direct H$_2$ loss following excitation to either the S$_2$ or S$_1$ state.

The parameter space regions that satisfy the energy extraction condition, as well as the efficiency and power of the extracted energy, are analyzed. The study shows that the presence of a negative cosmological constant extends the range of dominant reconnection radial locations where the energy extraction condition is met, and enables energy extraction even from black holes with relatively low spin. Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts. Our results highlight the crucial role of the cosmological constant in energy extraction via magnetic reconnection."}

The zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) observed in QPCs and in the triplet state of the even sector of quantum dot single-electron transistors (QDSETs) are identified as normal Kondo peaks, formed by spin dynamics involving spin exchange, a symbolic characteristic of the Kondo effect. For these ZBPs, the scaling temperature coincides with half the full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the ZBP observed in the odd sector of QDSETs and all finite-bias coherent peaks, including the coherent side peaks of QPCs and the split ZBP in the singlet state of the QDSET even sector, are identified as anomalous Kondo peaks, because they arise from spin dynamics without spin exchange, and their scaling temperature does not coincide with half the FWHM. To support these findings, we reproduce gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance line shapes measured in the odd sector of a QDSET, demonstrating that its ZBP originates from a combination of two coherent side peaks explicitly observed in QPCs."}

Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^α$ (with $α\\approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^α$ (with $α\\approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < α< 2$."}

A 5.8 GHz aperture-coupled patch antenna array is developed with a gain of 19.5 dBi, which is a part of the rectenna. A novel Class-F rectifier with a series diode is proposed to achieve a high rectifying efficiency based on harmonic termination techniques. The input circuit of the proposed rectifier is taken into consideration to reach the Class-F condition, while mostly only the output circuit is involved in conventional Class-F designs. A low-pass filter based on defected ground structure is implemented, which not only blocks the harmonics produced in rectifying but also presents desired impedance at harmonics. The current and voltage waveforms on the diode are well enforced. The radiation feature of the rectifier is presented as well. It shows that an optimized cavity, which shields the parasite radiation, may achieve a 5% enhancement on the MW-to-DC conversion efficiency. A C-band rectifier based on HSMS-286 Schottky diode is fabricated and measured. A MPT simple demo system is constructed with the proposed rectifier and antenna.

In this work, we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for low Earth orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali noble gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon matter coupling and noble gas nuclear spins for minutes to hours coherence, all without the need for cryogenics.

Various mechanisms have been proposed for the disappearance of the Dirichlet boundary condition. From the boundary viewpoint, the associated $3d$ CFT is a deformation of a generalised free theory of non-Abelian conserved currents, with the deformation governed by the bulk gauge coupling. We test these scenarios by deriving non-perturbative constraints from the numerical conformal bootstrap of the four-point function of non-Abelian conserved currents. We rule out the scenario in which the boundary current decouples. Bounds on the lightest scalar operators disfavour a bulk Higgs mechanism and instead point to a transition driven by a scalar singlet becoming marginal. We also obtain bounds on other scalar operators and on the current central charge, and we refine character-based techniques incorporating parity and charge-conjugation symmetry to determine the operator spectrum of the $3d$ Generalised Free Vector theory. These results may be of independent interest beyond Yang-Mills theory in AdS."}

While it is inversely proportional to the number of electrons, shot noise is typically modeled using macroparticles, whose bunching factors correspond to those of the much larger number of electrons. For short-wavelength FELs, the macroparticles are assumed to be uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength, since shot noise dominates the initial radiation - for instance, in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold at longer wavelengths, particularly in the THz range, where the bunch current profile is not uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength. Instead, the current profile dominates the initial bunching factors, which can be several orders of magnitude higher than shot noise. The slice-based bunching factors and bunching phases are derived for Gaussian distributions and compared with shot noise under the assumption that the current within each slice remains constant. Using the THz FEL at the photoinjector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a case study, the influence of the current profile has been benchmarked through simulations under very low bunch charge, where the real number of electrons can be modeled using the Genesis1.3 code. Additional simulations with the nominal working parameters of PITZ THz FEL have been compared with experimental data, indicating better agreement when the actual current profile is taken into account."}

Such dislocations arise in diverse physical systems ranging from crystalline solids, acoustic and photonic lattices and crystals to matter waves in optical lattices. Dislocations drastically affect the evolution of wave excitations in their vicinity, enabling novel mechanisms for trapping on topological defects and controlling the energy flow. Moreover, when combined with nonlinearity, such systems give rise to new types of self-sustained states of topological origin that have never been observed to date. Here we demonstrate experimentally, for the first time at optical frequencies, the waveguiding at various types of topological edge dislocations, resulting in the formation of localized photonic eigenstates with distinct and tunable shapes. Using femtosecond laser-writing techniques, we fabricated waveguide arrays with precisely tailored dislocation parameters, enabling full control over the degree of localization and internal structure of the associated modes. We further demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that in the high-power regime, the families of thresholdless dislocation solitons bifurcate from such modes, which inherit shape diversity of their linear counterparts. Our results reveal a nontrivial interplay between nonlinearity and global lattice deformations and establish dislocation solitons as a new class of nonlinear topological states. They may stimulate the observation of new types of nonlinear states and interaction scenarios for excitations in nonlinear physical systems, where lattices with controllable global deformations can be created."}

By constructing wave functions for two bosonic, fermionic, or distinguishable impurities immersed in a Bose or Fermi gas, we derive rigorous results for the polaron interactions in the limit of weak impurity-medium coupling.

A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods."}

We argue that $\\ln Z$ develops a simple pole in $(1-ω_i)$ for each $ω_i$ that is scaled to unity. The residue of this product of poles is a theory dependent (so non-universal) function of $β$ and the fixed angular velocities. The inverse Laplace transformation of this partition function constrains the functional form of the field theory entropy as a function of charges in a limit in which angular momenta and the twist are scaled as follows. While $n$ special angular momenta $J_1\\ldots J_n$ are scaled to infinity, the twist and the other angular momenta - collectively denoted $x_i$ - are also taken to infinity but at the slower rate that ensures that the scaled charges $x_i/(J_1 J_2 \\ldots J_n)^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}$ are held fixed.

The results demonstrate that the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the collector (CEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation exceeds the linear superposition of their individual effects. Conversely, the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the base (BEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation aligns closely with the results observed under BEMP acting alone. Mechanism analysis reveals that when CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, there is a significant increase in both the drift photocurrent at the collector junction and the diffusion photocurrent near the collector junction. However, when BEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, these photocurrent components remain small, leading to a combined effect similar to the results observed when BEMP acts alone.

First, we consider a two-level system which maps onto a spin-vector on a Bloch sphere and determine that the Spin-MInt is a symplectic, symmetrical, second-order, time-reversible, angle invariant and geometric structure preserving algorithm. Despite spin-variables resulting in a non-invertible structure matrix, we rigorously prove the Spin-MInt is symplectic using a canonical variable transformation. Computationally, we find that the Spin-MInt and MInt algorithms are symplectic, satisfy Liouville's theorem, provide second-order energy conservation and are more accurate than a previously-published angle-based algorithm. The Spin-MInt is significantly faster than the MInt algorithm for two electronic states. Secondly, we extend this methodology to more than two electronic states and present accurate population results for a three-state morse potential. We believe this to be the first known symplectic algorithm for propagating the nonadiabatic spin-mapping Hamiltonian and one of the first rigorously symplectic algorithms in the case of non-trivial coupling between canonical and spin systems. These results should guide and improve future simulations."}

Here, we employ quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) in acoustic meta-cavities composed of coupled Helmholtz resonators to enhance acoustic HD. We design both achiral and chiral meta-cavities that support QBICs in the form of vortex states with high Q-factors. Using full-wave numerical simulations, we show that the QBICs in the achiral meta-cavities cannot enhance acoustic HD due to the absence of a chiral wavefront. In contrast, the chiral meta-cavity exhibits a pronounced HD enhancement through the QBICs with a 3D helical wavefront, which can be excited by incident waves either with or without OAM. Our work identifies two essential requirements for enhancing acoustic HD effect via QBICs: a high Q-factor of the states and 3D chirality of the state fields, which usually compromise each other in conventional acoustic resonators. The findings open new avenues for achieving strong chiral sound-matter interactions, with potential applications in acoustic chiral sensing and acoustic OAM manipulation."}

This rate has been conjectured by Maldecena et al. to obey a universal, temperature dependent bound. Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD. The instanton is found to be stationary in all coordinates but its collective angle $Φ_0$, and fluctuations about it no longer resemble that of classical dynamics on a first order saddle as in RPMD."}

The second is via the mean-squared-displacement of thermal wavepackets subject to stochastic collapse via Lindblad jump operators. These two methods are applicable in the high-temperature regime, where the noise is temporally uncorrelated. In this regime the noise causes particle localization and the transport is diffusive. The third approach -- applicable in the low-temperature regime -- is weak-coupling Redfield theory. Here, static disorder causes particle localization. When the dynamics is diffusive, the diffusion coefficient is a non-monotonic function of temperature, increasing with temperature in the low-temperature Environment Assisted Quantum Transport regime and decreasing with temperature in the high-temperature quantum-Zeno regime. For any temperature, static and dynamic disorder decreases the diffusion coefficient. The dynamics is non-diffusive for thermal energies deep within the manifold of local-ground-states, where the sub-diffusive exponent decreases with increasing disorder and decreasing temperature."}

Each segment covers one surface and the distance to the subsequent surface. Surface contributions represent the change of the wavefront that occurs due to propagation through individual segments. Further, the surface contributions are divided with respect to their phenomenological origin into intrinsic, induced and transfer components. Each component is determined from a separate set of rays.

We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry."}

Whilst the ensemble geometric phase, a mixed-state generalization of the Zak phase remains well defined at nonzero temperature, the modulus of the corresponding expectation value vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, limiting its practical use. To develop a diagnostic that is suitable also for very large systems, we introduce local density operators acting on neighboring sites, which distinguish topological phases by comparing their expectation values. The topological phase is identified from the relative magnitude of these expectation values, which only requires measuring two local expectation values at nonzero temperature, together with one additional nonlocal expectation value when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is included. In addition, we generalize the local chiral marker to mixed Gaussian states, fully determined by its single-particle correlation matrix, with a nonzero purity gap in their effective single-particle Hamiltonian. The presence of a purity gap ensures that the correlation matrix can be adiabatically flattened to an effective projector. Evaluating the chiral marker with respect to the band-flattened correlation matrix yields a real space topological invariant that coincides with the winding number in the zero temperature limit. The ensemble geometric phase, the local density operators, and the local chiral marker, provide complementary schemes to identify and measure topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain beyond pure states."}

Prior studies have employed Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as ancillary qumodes to suppress small Gaussian displacement errors, but when the displacement magnitude becomes large, lattice-crossing events arise beyond the correctable range of the GKP state. To address this issue, we concatenate a Gaussian-noise-suppression circuit with an outer analog Steane code that corrects such occasional lattice-crossing events as well as other abrupt displacement errors. Unlike conventional concatenation, which primarily aims to reduce logical error rates, the Steane-GKP duality in encoding provides complementary protection against both large and small displacement errors, enabling CV error correction within the continuous encoding space and contrasting with earlier approaches that concatenate GKP states with repetition codes for discrete qubit or qudit encodings. Analytical results show that, under infinite squeezing, the concatenated code suppresses the variance of Gaussian displacement errors across all qumodes by up to 50 percent while enabling unbiased correction of lattice-crossing events, with a success probability determined by the ratio between the residual Gaussian error standard deviation and the lattice-crossing magnitude. Even with finite squeezing, the proposed architecture continues to provide Gaussian-error suppression together with lattice-crossing correction, and the presence of the outer analog Steane code relaxes the squeezing requirement of the inner GKP states, indicating near-term experimental feasibility. This work establishes a viable route toward fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation and provides new insight into the design of concatenated CV error-correcting architectures."}

We introduce a complementary framework that instead starts from Jain's composite-fermion (CF) wavefunctions, which accurately describe FQH states as weakly interacting states of CFs at fillings $ν= n/(2pn+1)$ in an idealized limit. As we move away from this idealized limit to one more in line with experimental reality, we expect CFs to become dressed much like the electrons of a noninteracting system, which are dressed by neutral excitations as interaction is turned on adiabatically, as in Landau's Fermi-liquid theory. We model this dressing using a Feynman-Cohen-style backflow approach, implemented through symmetry-preserving neural networks-a framework we refer to as CF-Flow. CF-Flow achieves competitive accuracy with substantially greater computational efficiency and scales to systems of $\\gtrsim 26$ electrons. At fillings $ν= 1/3$ and $2/5$, as a function of Landau-level mixing strength, CF-Flow produces ground-state energies with low local-energy variance that are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained using the fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo (fp-DMC) method, even though the latter constrains the wavefunction phase to that of the lowest Landau level-thereby providing insight into why fp-DMC has been successful in giving an accurate quantitative account of several experiments. Finally, the symmetry-preserving architecture of CF-Flow enables access to excited states and computation of the transport gap at $ν= 1/3$, where we find, unexpectedly, that it decays exponentially toward a finite value in the limit of large Landau-level mixing, suggesting a first-order transition from the FQH liquid to a non-FQH state."}

The first is an improved version of the current model, the ORCA-Fusion-BT, featuring a back-illuminated design that reaches a quantum efficiency of up to 95% at 550 nm. The second is a next-generation sensor, the ORCA-Quest. Although its peak quantum efficiency is not as high as that of the Fusion-BT, it offers high sensitivity over a broader spectral range, extending into the ultraviolet region, and provides ultra-low readout noise of 0.27 electrons, about 2.6 times lower than that of the Fusion family.\n  These two sensors therefore represent a significant opportunity to enhance the performance of scientific experiments, including those conducted by the CYGNO collaboration. This document presents a comprehensive characterization of these sensors to evaluate their relevance for experiments operating in photon-limited environments and their suitability for integration into the CYGNO detector system."}

However, atomistic simulation of thermal conductivity of organic liquids has been hindered by the limited accuracy of classical force fields and the huge computational demand of ab initio methods. In this work, we present a machine learning force field (MLFF)-based molecular dynamics simulation workflow to predict the thermal conductivity of 20 organic liquids. Here, we introduce the concept of differential attention into the MLFF architecture for enhanced learning ability, and we use density of the liquids to align the MLFF with experiments. As a result, this workflow achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 14% for the thermal conductivity of various organic liquids, significantly lower than that of the current off-the-shelf classical force field (78%). Furthermore, the MLFF is rewritten using Triton language to maximize simulation speed, enabling rapid prediction of thermal conductivity."}

Static scanning photocurrent measurements provide a qualitative measure of the band-bending and spatial distribution of the Schottky barrier between semiconducting WSe$_2$ and gold electrodes whereas the surface acoustic wave-induced acousto-electric current reveals the height of the tunnelling barrier created by the van der Waals gap between the multilayered WSe$_2$ flake and the gold electrodes in addition to the Schottky barrier. The combination of both techniques shows a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent by the acoustic wave. Moreover, the observed spatial redistribution of the current is attributed to the interplay between the contact properties at the source and drain electrodes and the charge carrier dynamics induced by the surface acoustic wave. The ratio of acoustic wavelength to the electrical channel length is found to impact the SAW-induced charge carrier transport. For a channel length shorter than one acoustic wavelength, carriers undergo a seesaw-like motion which changes to charge conveyance for channel lengths comparable or exceeding the acoustic wavelength."}

While persistent photoconductivity (PPC) and gate-voltage (VG)-induced electron trapping are well-known phenomena in oxide heterostructures, their mutual coupling remains poorly explored. Here, we report that the non-equilibrium state established by PPC can effectively modulate the efficacy of VG-induced electron trapping in a STO/Al heterostructure. The PPC, characterized by a slow relaxation (8.5 hours at 4 K) after sub-illumination, originates from the re-trapping of photoexcited carriers into deep-level states. In contrast, VG-induced trapping, governed by shallow states, exhibits much faster dynamics ({100 - 400 s). Crucially, we discover that the strength of VG-induced trapping is not constant but is dynamically modulated by the PPC relaxation process. The trapping amplitude is strongly amplified after illumination and recovers only after the deep-level states are substantially refilled, precisely following the PPC relaxation time constant. Furthermore, the electron trapping effect diminishes with increasing temperature and vanishes near the ferroelastic phase transition of STO (110 K), confirming that ferroelastic twin walls and associated oxygen vacancy clusters are the physical origin of the traps. Our findings reveal a novel optical gating mechanism for electron trapping, paving the way for designing non-volatile, optically programmable electronic devices."}

Although numerous achievements have been made regarding local distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states, some fundamental issues have not been effectively addressed.

In this paper, we give the properties of local distinguishability of five OPSs on bipartite and tripartite quantum systems. Firstly, to characterize the structure of a set of bipartite OPSs, we propose the concept of the vector of orthogonal relations for a set of bipartite OPSs. Secondly, we classify the structures of five bipartite OPSs into six categories by this concept and prove that five of these six categories can be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Thirdly we show that the local distinguishability of each case of the sixth category singly. On the other hand, we first divide the structures of five tripartite OPSs into eight categories by the vectors of orthogonal relations of five tripartite OPSs.

In this case, in addition to the standard invariant tensor $δ^{ij}$, there exists another invariant tensor $ε^{ij}$, which enables the construction of genuinely new realizations beyond the conventional one. We show that these new realizations arise from a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$--grading of the mode index $n$ of the Virasoro generators $L_n$ and the space of such realizations corresponds to points of a possibly singular algebraic variety. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ cases, the space of all such constructions is topologically equivalent to a cylinder, while for $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ it forms a non-compact real four-dimensional manifold. We show that the spaces of constructions for $Z_{2N}$ and $Z_{2N+1}$ are closely similar. Furthermore, we reformulate the problem within an action-principle framework by introducing $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-equivariant maps, which provide a systematic method for constructing conformal field theories endowed with these generalized Virasoro symmetries.

All three diagnostics consistently identify a broad crossover centered in the weak-to-intermediate coupling regime U~2-6; charge gaps open rapidly, double occupancy suppresses, local moments form, entanglement is significantly reduced, PCA concentrates variance into a few dominant modes and the distance matrices reveals rapid wavefunction reorganization. Our multi-pronged approach establishes the Mott crossover as a smooth but well defined reorganization of electronic correlations with pronounced spin-sector dependence in finite systems."}

Quantum mechanically, the molecule can tunnel between these configurations resulting in a tunnelling splitting, which in the case of H$_2$, is the same as the ortho--para splitting. In this work, we generalize semiclassical instanton theory to calculate the energy splitting of molecules in electric fields in full dimensionality. This goes beyond a perturbative treatment of the field and takes into account changes in molecular geometry during the tunnelling process which influence its electrical properties and can have a significant impact on the result. We first study the case of H$_2$ in a static electric field and then show how it can be applied to larger polar molecules subjected to oscillating electric fields, where we find that even large-amplitude heavy-atom tunnelling can lead to observable splittings."}

Quantum gates can be implemented by parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gates have been proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the errors arising from approximations used is critical for high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the charge qubit that produces smaller errors and show that the fidelity of the CZ gate outperforms its spin counterpart, resulting in a much smaller fidelity loss of $0.05\\%$ compared to $0.80\\%$ for the spin qubit, and greater robustness against qubit dephasing and photon loss. We find that drive amplitude -- a parameter dropped in RWA -- is critical for optimizing fidelity, with the charge qubit exhibiting better tolerance to drive amplitude variations. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation."}

In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies.

A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems."}

By analyzing the response of high-order quantum coherences to these control-field jitters, we investigate the critical interplay between the enhanced sensitivity offered by large coherence orders, their relative distributions, and their varying susceptibility to decoherence. We further demonstrate that, even within a non-uniform distribution of coherence orders, there exists an optimal maximum coherence order that maximizes sensing efficiency. To support our interpretation, we supplement the experimental results with a simplified numerical model that estimates the corresponding quantum Fisher information.

We calculate the cylinder partition function. We first place the cylindrical worldsheet on a rectangular lattice before taking the continuum limit. We find an integer number of string configurations on the worldsheet, which we call line defects, that run from one boundary of the cylinder to the other. We insert two sources (conical defects) at each boundary and fix the two ends of the line defect by Dirichlet boundary conditions to a point $r_c$ in target space. In target space, a line defect appears as an Susskind\\&Uglum-type open string ending on $r_c$. We compute the semiclassical contribution to the off-shell cylinder amplitude by saddle point approximation. The amplitude has an interesting infrared (IR) divergence structure that depends on the given range of the cone angle. We then compute the entropy by varying the cone angle. In a particular renormalization scheme that relates the ultraviolet (UV) and to the infrared (IR) limits of the modulus integral, we find the entropy to be free of IR divergences but linearly dependent on the radial cutoff. We argue that our calculation provides a well-defined state on a constant Euclidean-time slice directly from the string worldsheet. We also study the 2D flat cone NLSM without discretization. We compute the entropy from the off-shell stationary action and show it is finite in each winding sector $W$ with a maximum at $r_c=\\sqrt{α'}/|W|$. After summing over all winding sectors, it still has a finite maximum in the UV limit but for $r_c >0$."}

It typically consists of two magnetic sites of opposite spins related by rotation within the unit cell. Here, we use circular dichroism (CD) in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to identify a new form of altermagnetism, namely bi-altermagnetism, in the correlated insulator Fe2Mo3O8, which comprises two altermagnetic sublattices: one with alternating quasi-octahedral Fe environments and the other with alternating tetrahedral Fe environments. We experimentally revealed the emergence of CD in an achiral, zero-magnetization system, thereby probing mirror-symmetry breaking associated with altermagnetic order. Notably, the CD appeared at sublattice-specific excitations of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, indicating symmetry breaking in both altermagnetic sublattices. Calculations based on a model with the bi-altermagnetic order along the c axis successfully reproduce the observed CD. Our findings provide compelling evidence for bi-altermagnetism in Fe2Mo3O8, and showcase the use of RIXS-CD as a probe of magnetic sublattices in systems with zero net magnetization."}

We derive the average charge and the fluctuation-dissipation relation for the differential capacitance, highlighting the contribution of the fluctuations of the net ionic dipole moment, as well as those from the solvent polarization and of the electron density, whose fluctuations are suppressed within the Born-Oppenheimer description. We demonstrate the relevance of this model by validating its predictions against known results for the force on ions as a function of the ion-surface distance in simple geometries. The equilibrium ionic density profiles from BD simulations are in excellent agreement with those from an explicit electrode model for perfect metals, and are obtained at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we discuss with the present model the effect of the Thomas-Fermi screening length on the equilibrium ionic density profiles and the capacitance. While limited to parallel plate capacitors, the present simulation method allows to consider larger systems, lower concentrations, and longer time scales concentrations than molecular simulations in order to predict the electrochemical properties of Thomas-Fermi capacitors and correlate them with the ion dynamics."}

Leveraging this insight, we formulate a reverse projection optimization that adjusts only a small set of phase parameters to approximate the ideal operator within the physical constraints of a metasurface. This produces significantly higher fidelity and robustness than Gerchberg_Saxton type algorithms. Experimentally, we demonstrate H, V, L, and R polarized tweezer arrays using a single layer metasurface. A key advantage of our method is its phase stability, yielding strong resistance to optical aberrations and enabling coherent global phase modulation such as forming vortex tweezer lattice, without degrading trap quality.

Using the geometric framework of Ref.~\\cite{GRP}, we analyse the intrinsic curvature of the associated energy--momentum surfaces, where negative curvature ensures hyperbolic and stable propagation, and curvature sign changes or critical points indicate kinematical instabilities or new invariant scales.

We propose instead that the path integral on the Euclidean elliptic dS defines a no-boundary density matrix. As an explicit example, we study the free Dirac fermion CFT in two-dimensional elliptic dS and analytically compute the von Neumann and the Rényi entropies of this density matrix. The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT.

We extend its applicability to smaller ice crystals, combining rigorous modelling of particle shapes with the Phase Field Modelling and light-scattering simulations with the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). Even for particles with the largest dimension of 11.5 wavelengths (and the smallest one comparable to the wavelength), the 2D Fourier transform of the interferometric image remains linked to the 2D autocorrelation of the particle shape at various viewing angles, validating the general measurement principle. However, the sensor must necessarily have wide viewing angle, which complicates interpretation of apparent particle shape, when such particles are observed from the edge.

Hunt"], "title": "Out-of-time correlation functions in single-body systems", "comment": null, "summary": "In the study of quantum chaos, `out of time ordered correlators' (OTOCs) are commonly used to quantify the rate at which quantum information is scrambled. This rate has been conjectured by Maldecena et al. to obey a universal, temperature dependent bound. Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD. The instanton is found to be stationary in all coordinates but its collective angle $Φ_0$, and fluctuations about it no longer resemble that of classical dynamics on a first order saddle as in RPMD."}

However, in-situ characterization of the spatially confined THz modes within filaments faces significant challenges due to the plasma's ultra-high intensity, which not only hinders direct near-field probing but also limits reliance on indirect far-field reconstruction. Here, we introduce a non-invasive near-field modulation scheme where a metal plate approaches the filament at submillimeter distances (comparable to THz wavelengths), perturbing the dielectric environment to convert the symmetric annular THz mode into an asymmetric state. This controlled transition enables far-field detection of broadband calculus behaviors (first- and second-order differentiation/integration) on time-domain THz waveforms and characteristic spectral transfer functions with 1/f, 1/f^2, f or f^2 dependency (where f is the THz frequency), thereby diagnosing the near-field THz mode confinement. Hence, the proposed approach synergizes near-field modulation efficiency with far-field detection robustness, advancing fundamental understanding of plasma-THz interactions and enabling novel all-optical signal processing for filament-based THz technologies."}

The combination of both techniques shows a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent by the acoustic wave. Moreover, the observed spatial redistribution of the current is attributed to the interplay between the contact properties at the source and drain electrodes and the charge carrier dynamics induced by the surface acoustic wave. The ratio of acoustic wavelength to the electrical channel length is found to impact the SAW-induced charge carrier transport.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Optically levitated particles are used in a wide range of experiments to explore both fundamental physics and to act as sensors to a variety of external forces. One field of particular interest that these particles can be used to investigate is quantum mechanics. Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite. We will then review the aspects of the payload that require further development, then summarize the current estimates of the payload's requirements."}

Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise. A preliminary experiment addressing the ETPA detection limits using the standard RhB dye is presented."}

Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing."}

The introduction of Haldane-type complex next-nearest-neighbor hoppings gaps these Dirac points, breaks time-reversal symmetry, and generates a sequence of quantum anomalous Hall phases.

The nontrivial bulk topology is verified by the presence of the corresponding number of chiral edge modes in ribbon geometries.

Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories."}

Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes."}

However, the typically weak exchange interactions mediated by the diamagnetic organic ligands result in ordering temperatures confined to the cryogenic limit. The itinerant magnetic ground state realized in the chromium-based framework Cr(tri)$_{2}$(CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$)$_{0.33}$ (Htri, $1H$-$1$,$2$,$3$-triazole) is a remarkable exception to this trend, showing a robust ferromagnetic behavior almost at ambient conditions. Here, we use dc SQUID magnetometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ferromagnetic resonance to study the magnetic state realized in this material. We highlight several thermally-activated relaxation mechanisms for the nuclear magnetization due to the tendency of electrons towards localization at low temperatures as well as the rotational dynamics of the charge-balancing triflate ions confined within the pores. Most interestingly, we report the development within the paramagnetic regime of mesoscopic magnetic correlated clusters whose slow dynamics in the MHz range are tracked by the nuclear moments, in agreement with the highly unconventional nature of the magnetic transition detected by dc SQUID magnetometry. We discuss the similarity between the clustered phase in the paramagnetic phase and the magnetoelectronic phase segregation leading to colossal magnetoresistance in manganites and cobaltites.

This integration leads to a significant increase in emission directionality and a reduction of the excited-state lifetime via Purcell enhancement, without compromising spectral integrity.

The space of quantum channels in this scheme is a unit hypersphere, and components of mutually constrained unit vectors residing in this space, are used to construct a physically valid quantum channel. Symplectic constraints, orthogonality, and unit length of the vectors suffice to maintain complete positivity and the trace-preserving property of the channels.

Combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that, in the strong-coupling regime at low temperatures, ferromagnetically ordered (FM) states develop away from the commensurate fillings. In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies. The results uncover the nature of the FM state in the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems and highlight the rich magnetic behavior enabled by enlarged internal symmetries."}

We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $η$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $η$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon."}

In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing."}

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \\(β_c\\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport.

We used the Dirac-3, a device based on the entropy computing paradigm and made by Quantum Computing Inc., to evaluate our approach. Our formulations consist of (i) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model (QUBO, suitable for Ising machines) and a quartic formulation that allows for real-valued and integer variables (suitable for machines like the Dirac-3). Although current devices cannot solve large NMF problems, the results of our preliminary experiments are promising enough to warrant further research. For non-negative real matrices, we observed that a fusion approach of first using Dirac-3 and then feeding its results as the initial factor matrices to Scikit-learn's NMF procedure outperforms Scikit-learn's NMF procedure on its own, with default parameters in terms of the error in the reconstructed matrices. For our experiments on non-negative integer matrices, we compared the Dirac-3 device to Google's CP-SAT solver (inside the Or-Tools package) and found that for serial processing, Dirac-3 outperforms CP-SAT in a majority of the cases.

Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories."}

By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems."}

We prove soundness of LCM-based fusion and normalization rules, derive curvature predictors for phase-grid compatibility, and present the Weighted ZX Circuit Compression (WZCC) algorithm, which performs geometry-aware optimization on heterogeneous phase lattices.\n  To connect circuit-level structure with fault-tolerant architectures, we introduce Monodromy-Aware Surface-Code Decoding (MASD), a winding-regularized modification of minimum-weight matching on syndrome graphs.

By computing the circular reduction of the one-loop Chern-Simons term and pure-gravity couplings in type IIA theory and applying the T-duality transformation to the resulting couplings, we derive their counterparts in the type IIB effective action. We demonstrate that the resulting nine-dimensional type IIB couplings are invariant under S-duality without requiring contributions from the tree-level effective action or non-perturbative effects. This result is non-trivial: while S-duality forbids one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in ten-dimensional type IIB theory, we show that the one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in nine dimensions, derived from the T-duality of type IIA, are S-duality invariant.

We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM."}

High expressivity required for robust privacy induces exponentially large dynamical Lie algebras. This structure inevitably leads to barren plateaus. Conversely, trainable models restricted to polynomial-sized algebras remain transparent to algebraic attacks. To resolve this impasse, DyLoC is proposed. This dual-layer architecture employs an orthogonal decoupling strategy. Trainability is anchored to a polynomial-DLA ansatz while privacy is externalized to the input and output interfaces. Specifically, Truncated Chebyshev Graph Encoding (TCGE) is employed to thwart snapshot inversion. Dynamic Local Scrambling (DLS) is utilized to obfuscate gradients. Experiments demonstrate that DyLoC maintains baseline-level convergence with a final loss of 0.186. It outperforms the baseline by increasing the gradient reconstruction error by 13 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, snapshot inversion attacks are blocked when the reconstruction mean squared error exceeds 2.0.

A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $κ$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory."}

The interplay between these momenta yields the spin-orbit interaction of light, in which the spin (circular polarization) controls the spatial (orbital) degrees of freedom of light: either the extrinsic (trajectory) or the intrinsic orbital angular momentum (vortex). While the well-known spin-orbit interaction of light plays a crucial role in nano-optics by providing spin-controlled light manipulation, the interaction between the intrinsic and the extrinsic orbital angular momentum - the orbit-orbit interaction of light - has remained elusive. In this interplay, the helical phase fronts of optical vortices control the spatial trajectory of light, giving rise to vortex-dependent shifts of optical beams. We report the orbit-orbit interaction of light in a plasmonic ellipse cavity, whose unique geometry facilitates the interplay when a vortex is considered in one of the foci of the ellipse. In this configuration, the orbit-orbit interaction is achieved by the interplay between the vortex of the source and the ellipse-induced transverse shift of the source beam, positioned at one of the focal points - thus inducing transverse vortex-dependent shifts at the second focal point. Strikingly, the orbit-orbit interaction of light significantly enhances the toolbox available for controlling light by leveraging the manifold orbital angular momentum states for vortex-controlled light manipulation - in contrast to light manipulation based on the spin-orbit interaction, which exploits the binary polarization helicity."}

In the second-order process, a spin in the $σ$-orbital virtually hops to the $π$-orbital, flips its direction due to intra-atomic SOI, and then hops back to the $σ$-orbital in the neighboring atom due to the misalignment of $p$-orbitals along the helix. This process induces an interatomic SOI in the $σ$-band, which takes the form of a Rashba-type SOI generated by an electric field normal to the helical axis. The magnitude of the SOI is proportional to the curvature, the hopping energy, the intra-atomic SOI energy, and inversely proportional to the crystal field strength. The second-order process also induces long-range second-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We analytically derive the spin-split band structure in the zero-torsion limit."}

The zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) observed in QPCs and in the triplet state of the even sector of quantum dot single-electron transistors (QDSETs) are identified as normal Kondo peaks, formed by spin dynamics involving spin exchange, a symbolic characteristic of the Kondo effect. For these ZBPs, the scaling temperature coincides with half the full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the ZBP observed in the odd sector of QDSETs and all finite-bias coherent peaks, including the coherent side peaks of QPCs and the split ZBP in the singlet state of the QDSET even sector, are identified as anomalous Kondo peaks, because they arise from spin dynamics without spin exchange, and their scaling temperature does not coincide with half the FWHM.

Hence, it is prudent to explore low loss alternatives to the current mainstay of plasmonics-the noble metals. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of potassium as a plasmonic material with intrinsically low losses in the optical region. The ultraflat, high quality potassium film, fabricated via a rapid slipping-assisted oxide-free crystallization process, achieves an experimentally observed optical damping rate of 3.7 meV,with a measured imaginary permittivity of approximately 0.1 across the entire visible to near-infrared range (400-2000 nm). Near field optical spectroscopic measurements further confirmed the reduced losses by revealing deeply subwavelength confinement of optical modes. This result enhances our understanding of the factors governing plasmonic materials and devices and establishes a new platform for exploring extreme light-matter interactions in a variety of plasmonic systems."}

We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks. Our setting thus provides a rare example of a physically motivated quantum learning task with no known dequantization."}

Furthermore, the influence of the negative cosmological constant on energy extraction is modulated by the extent of the dominant reconnection radial region: a more negative cosmological constant enhances the extracted energy, efficiency, and power, particularly for smaller dominant reconnection radii. These results demonstrate that the energy extraction from Kerr-AdS black holes is more favorable than that from their asymptotically flat counterparts.

Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width.

Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials."}

We introduce the notions of \\textit{$\\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \\textit{non-isolation tensor}.

As an application we derive a \\textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $Λ$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section."}

In contrast to the other terms, the recoil terms are odd under time reversal. To clarify their nature and properties, we re-derive the recoil force from first principles using the total Lorentz force on a system of charges that form a simultaneous electric and magnetic dipole. The results agree with the standard momentum-based derivation and reveal their ultimate origin from retardation effects -- arising from the finite speed of light -- in the mutual interactions between charges.

The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordström spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere.

During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time.

We prove that superextensive power scaling is possible only when the interaction-energy distribution becomes increasingly nonuniform, with the maximal local weight growing with system size. This criterion explains why many previously studied protocols fail to exhibit superextensive power, even when the Hamiltonians involve large participation numbers. We further demonstrate that this condition is realized in an experimentally relevant interacting model, where, despite fixed interaction order, the charging power scales superextensively.

In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing."}

In that context, we study the relationship between particle creation, adiabaticity and irreversibility in terms of three different representations: the initial, the diagonal and the invariant representations of the TDHO. We provide analytical results that are valid for any functional value of the frequency and along the whole evolution of the TDHO, which allows us to monitor the behavior of the thermodynamical magnitudes in regions that are not fully considered in previous works, i.e. the transition and the non quasi-static regions. We supplement the analytical results with numerical calculations and graphs.\n  They both show how the largest modes of the non invariant representations may undergo a process of reversible thermalization, where the concept of temperature naturally arises from the unitary evolution of the oscillator with no relation to any external concept of temperature. It would allow us to monitor an unexpected classical-to-quantum transition, which might entail a violation of the third principle of classical thermodynamics. We also provide adaptations of the customary definitions of the quantum heat and work that account for the particle creation of the TDHO. They thus depend on the representation and their evolution is different for the three representations analyzed in this paper, which might have important consequences in the development of quantum thermal machines. Finally, we study the relationship between the creation of particles and the diagonal entropy, which is derived from the von Neumann entropy in the diagonalization limit. The condition of no production of entropy under unitary evolution suggests the definition of a mode temperature that would correspond to the thermal temperature is some appropriate limit."}

However, recent works have shown that multiqubit gates can be beneficial for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction and for fault-tolerant stabilizer readout in unrotated surface codes. In this work, we investigate multiqubit Rydberg gates that are useful for fault-tolerant quantum error correction in single-species neutral-atom platforms and can be implemented with a single, non-addressed laser pulse. We develop an open-source Python package to generate analytical, few-parameter pulses that implement the desired gates while minimizing gate errors due to Rydberg-state decay. The tool also allows us to identify parameter-optimal pulses, characterized by a minimal parameter count for the pulse ansatz. Measurement-free quantum error correction protocols require CCZ gates, which we analyze for atoms arranged in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We investigate the performance of these schemes for various single-, two-, and three-qubit gate error rates, showing that break-even performance of measurement-free QEC is within reach of current hardware. Moreover, we study Floquet quantum error correction protocols that comprise two-body stabilizer measurements. Those can be realized using global three-qubit gates, and we show that this can lead to a significant reduction in shuttling operations. Simulations with realistic circuit-level noise indicate that applying three-qubit gates for stabilizer measurements in Floquet codes can yield competitive logical qubit performance in experimentally relevant error regimes."}

Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise. A preliminary experiment addressing the ETPA detection limits using the standard RhB dye is presented."}

In these systems, effects such as coherence, entanglement, and non-Markovianity play key roles. In this thesis, we explore different ways to describe quantum thermodynamics, using two main approaches: one based on entropy and the other on ergotropy. First, we introduce a generalized approach to quantify non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity in thermodynamic functions. In this context, the entropy-based heat flow serves as a practical tool to witness and measure quantum memory in unital maps that do not reverse the sign of the internal energy. Next, we analyze the dynamics of ergotropy in open qubits under both Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. We identify phenomena such as freezing and sudden death of ergotropy, and we establish an analytical relation between the change in ergotropy and the environment-induced work . This provides a clear physical interpretation for the additional term in the first law in the entropy-based formulation. Finally, we propose an ergotropy-based thermodynamic formulation, in which heat is reinterpreted in terms of the change of the passive state associated with the density operator governing the quantum dynamics. This approach allows one to measure non-Markovianity of unital maps more generally and accurately than the entropy-based heat flow. This advantage comes from the direct link between heat and von Neumann entropy, a property ensured by invariance under passive transformations. Moreover, the out-of-equilibrium temperature naturally remains non-negative, similarly to equilibrium thermodynamics."}

In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes."}

In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum.

The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT.

For this reason, Richard Feynman proposed the concept of a quantum simulator: quantum systems engineered to obey a prescribed evolution equation and repeating the experiment multiple times. Experimentally, however, as we explain below, the vast majority of observables describing the system are inaccessible. Thus, while Feynman's idea addresses the problem of simulating quantum dynamics, it leaves unsolved the equally fundamental problem of inferring the underlying physics from the limited observables accessible in experiments. Indeed, many complex phenomena associated with QMB systems remain elusive. Perhaps, the most important example is identifying phase transitions in QMB systems when no simple order-parameter exists, which poses major challenges to this day. Complicating the problem further is the fact that, in most cases, it is impossible to learn from numerical simulations, as the underlying systems are often too large to be computable, and small QMB can show strong finite size effects, masking the presence of the transition. Here, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach to study QMB experiments, specifically aimed at detecting phase transitions and crossovers directly from raw experimental measurements. We demonstrate our methodology on systems undergoing Many-Body Localization cross-over and Mott-to-Superfluid phase-transition, showing that it reveals collective phenomena from the very partial experimental data and without any model-specific prior knowledge of the system.

A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $κ$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes.

Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise.

One existing study pointed out that dynamic reordering worsens the simulation time and numerical accuracy, and there is no comprehensive research on static orders in the context of quantum circuit simulation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scoring-based heuristic method for determining a static variable order that enables efficient DD-based quantum circuit simulation. When applied to benchmark circuits, the default original variable orders resulted in slow simulations, whereas the proposed method achieved speedups of up to 150x.

The Liouvillian exceptional point (LEP), involving the interplay of energy loss and decoherence inherently relevant to quantum jumps, has recently drawn much attention due to capability to fully capture quantum system dynamics and naturally facilitate non-Hermitian quantum investigations. It was also predicted that quantum jumps could give rise to third-order LEPs in two-level quantum systems for its high dimensional Liouvillian superoperator, which, however, has never been experimentally confirmed until now. Here we report the first observation of the third-order LEPs emerging from quantum jumps in an ultracold two-level trapped-ion system. Moreover, by combining decay with dephasing processes, we present the first experimental exploration of LEPs involving combinatorial effect of decay and dephasing. In particular, due to non-commutativity between the Lindblad superoperators governing LEPs for decay and dephasing, we witness the movement of LEPs driven by the competition between decay and dephasing occurring in an open quantum system. This unique feature of non-Hermitian quantum systems paves a new avenue for modifying nonreciprocity, enhancing precision measurement, and manipulating topological dynamics by tuning the LEPs."}

However, practical applications require techniques capable of reliably distributing entanglement under lossy and noisy conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple configuration using two polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) arranged in a cross-axis alignment enables stable distribution of entangled photon pairs without the need for real-time polarization compensation. To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the cross-aligned PMF pair allows robust entanglement transmission without complex active compensation devices, suggesting its suitability for reliable quantum state distribution in long-distance quantum communication, drone-based QKD, and multi-user quantum networks."}

We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability."}

However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and challenging operational conditions (e.g., cryogenics), which hinder scalable commercial deployment. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This level of performance is comparable to or surpasses recently designed superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the scheme's device requirements are moderate, relying on readily available current technology, which ensures near-term experimental feasibility. The ESPD framework thus provides a clear, scalable path toward the large-scale deployment of high-performance SPDs and the commercialization of quantum communication technologies."}

Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions.\n  We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker.\n  Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL.

As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages."}

Achieving efficient simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and forthcoming Fault-Tolerant Application-Scalable Quantum (FASQ) systems demands a detailed understanding of how computational resources scale with molecular complexity and fermion-to-qubit encoding schemes. In this study, resource requirements for VQE implementations employing the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz are systematically analyzed. The molecular Hamiltonian is formulated in second quantization and mapped to qubit operators through the Jordan-Wigner (JW), Bravyi-Kitaev (BK), and Parity (Pa) transformations.

Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology.

In particular, modeling two-dimensional systems with realistic long-range interactions, in addition to dissipation, is of vital importance to the development of modern quantum computing and simulation platforms. In this paper, we present a construction of the time-evolution operator, as a projected entangled pair operator (denoted tePEPO), that can be used to evolve a tensor network ansatz through time. Interactions beyond nearest-neighbor, including interactions between sites not collinear in the lattice, can be represented efficiently as a tePEPO. Furthermore, we obtain approximations to realistic radial long-range interactions decaying with a power-law, that give accurate results with small tePEPO bond dimension. Finally, we consider a physical example of a Rydberg atom Hamiltonian with long-range dipolar interactions, and show evidence of a dipole-dipole blockading effect in presence of dissipation. This work demonstrates the applicability of tensor networks to two-dimensional systems widely studied in experiments, but previously inaccessible to non-semi-classical methods."}

The method first applies a classical compression step to obtain a $d$-sparse representation of the input, loads this sparse vector using a sparse-state preparation routine, and then reconstructs the target state through a polynomial-depth quantum inverse transform. We evaluate the framework on synthetic benchmark signals and real biomedical time series using Fourier and Haar transforms, demonstrating substantial reductions in CNOT counts and circuit depth compared to EAE, together with competitive performance relative to the Fourier Series Loader (FSL).

In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate DQC emulators using a distributed implementation of the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ($\\mathrm{QFT}^{\\dagger}$) as a representative test case, which enables efficient phase recovery from pre-encoded Fourier states. The QFT is partitioned across nodes using teleportation-based protocols, and performance is analyzed in terms of execution time, memory usage, and fidelity with respect to a monolithic baseline.\n  As part of this work, we review a broad range of emulators, identifying their capabilities and limitations for programming distributed quantum algorithms. Many platforms either lacked support for teleportation protocols or required complex workarounds. Consequently, we select and benchmark four representative emulators: Qiskit Aer, SquidASM, Interlin-q, and SQUANCH. They differ significantly in their support for discrete-event simulation, quantum networking, noise modeling, and parallel execution. Our results highlight the trade-offs between architectural fidelity and simulation scalability, providing a foundation for future emulator development and the validation of distributed quantum protocols.

However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems.

By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \\times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\\times$ relative to defect-free circuits.

Unlike previous applications of this formalism, we explicitly account for reflections in the system.

The versatility of this model is illustrated through three examples: (i) spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an idealized cavity with flat-response mirrors; (ii) the generation of counter-propagating photon pairs in a periodically-poled material; and (iii) spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cavity built with Bragg reflectors."}

In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5."}

Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^α$ (with $α\\approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^α$ (with $α\\approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 < α< 2$."}

We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity.

Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories."}

We exactly solve the two-body scattering problem, showing that for large Rabi coupling the confinement-induced resonance can be displaced towards scattering lengths values much smaller than the oscillator length. Our results make the observation of confinement-induced resonances more tunable and accessible, offering yet another handle for the efficient control of strong interactions in ultracold quantum gases."}

Hansen", "Marvin Holten", "Dhiren M. Kara", "Jean-Francois Perrier", "Ulrik L. Andersen", "Alexander Huck"], "title": "High-Sensitivity NV Ensemble Imaging via AOD-Based Raster Scanning and Photodetection", "comment": "8 pages, 5 Figures", "summary": "We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems."}
