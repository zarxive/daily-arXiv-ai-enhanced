Abstract: As minimal cells or protocells are dramatically simpler than modern unicells it is possible to quantitatively estimate free energy changes for every process in the lifecycle of a protocell and compare these with estimates of the free energy changes for lifecycles in modern unicells. We present quantitative estimates of all metabolic changes in part by new density function theory (DFT) estimations, in part by compiling previously measured or estimated free energy changes, and in part by new thermodynamic calculations for all self-assembly, vesicle bending, and fission energies.

Abstract: The mechanical properties of actin filaments are essential to their biological functions. Here, we introduce a highly coarse-grained model of actin filaments that preserves helicity and chirality while enabling mesoscale simulations. The framework is implemented in Cytosim, an open-source cytoskeleton simulation platform. We can predict and finely control the shape and mechanical properties of this helical filament, that can be matched to experimental values. Using this model, we investigated the role of filament chirality in motor-driven dynamics. We first show that in two different experimental configurations, motor movement along a helical filament results in a chiral motion of the filament. In a bundle of helical filaments, dimeric motors exert torques on each filament, inducing collective behaviors in the bundle such as rotation, coiling, and helical buckling, reminiscent of those observed in filopodia. Together, these results demonstrate the central role of helicity and chirality in actin mechanics and motor-driven dynamics, and establish our framework as a powerful tool for mesoscale simulations. This framework can also be used for other helical filaments beyond actin.

Motivation:  流动植物的种子传播是自然选择的重要部分，探索植物如何高效有效地传播种子有助于理解其适应性和物种多样性的维持。

Method:  该研究通过高速摄像 (10,000 fps)、微CT扫描和内部压力传感器等高精度方法，系统地研究了 squirting cucumber 的流体力学过程。高精度捕捉释放过程中的瞬时作用力，从而推导出精确的速度和能量参数。

Conclusion:  这种利用压力储存释放的机械系统， 为现代工程学提供了生物启发的解决方案，同时为研究生物流体动力学选择提供了新方向。

Abstract: Seed dispersal is a fundamental process that allows offspring to reach suitable habitats and colonize new environments. While most plants rely on external vectors, some have evolved mechanisms that employ the buildup of liquid pressure in a closed compartment and its explosive release to disperse their seeds. This form of energy storage, reinvented by humans for engineering applications, is termed a hydraulic accumulator. Here we investigated the fluid mechanics involved in dispersal in the squirting cucumber, Ecballium elaterium integrating high-speed videography (up to 10 000 fps), microtomography, and internal pressure sensors. We recorded long-term pressure time series showing that E. elaterium exhibits circadian (24 hour) and ultradian (short-period) rhythms. Remarkably, the measurements revealed a lack of correlation between fruit and stem turgor; while the stem showed strong circadian cycles, the fruit often did not, suggesting isolated physiological processes in different tissues. The fruit's spongy wall tissue stores elastic potential energy as turgor pressure builds to nearly one atmosphere (92-99 kPa). Upon detachment, this energy is rapidly released to expel a turbulent, particle-laden liquid jet. Microtomography revealed that the seeds are packed around a central funiculus, a configuration that optimizes their exit through the basal orifice at velocities of up to 30 m/s. Seeds eventually move faster than the liquid droplets during the later stages of ejection as they shed their liquid coating. This sophisticated mechanism ensures a broad dispersal cone, effectively spreading offspring across space and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural circuits exhibit structured connectivity, including an overrepresentation of reciprocal connections between neuron pairs. Despite important advances, a full understanding of how such partial symmetry in connectivity shapes neural dynamics remains elusive. Here we ask how correlations between reciprocal connections in a random, recurrent neural network affect phase-space complexity, defined as the exponential proliferation rate (with network size) of the number of fixed points that accompanies the transition to chaotic dynamics. We find a striking pattern: partial anti-symmetry strongly amplifies complexity, while partial symmetry suppresses it. These opposing trends closely track changes in other measures of dynamical behavior, such as dimensionality, Lyapunov exponents, and transient path length, supporting the view that fixed-point structure is a key determinant of network dynamics. Thus, positive reciprocal correlations favor low-dimensional, slowly varying activity, whereas negative correlations promote high-dimensional, rapidly fluctuating chaotic activity. These results yield testable predictions about the link between connection reciprocity, neural dynamics and function.

### [5] [Local shear signals propagate to suppress local cellular motion in stiff epithelia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24486)
*Shahar Nahum,Adi Y. Elkabetz,Matan Elbaz,Liav Daraf,Yael Lavi,Lior Atia*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that localized shear perturbations in the epithelial monolayer propagate through the tissue, influencing both nearby and distant cells. The mechanism involves a combination of mechanical and energetic changes, providing new insights into how local mechanical forces affect cellular environments and tissue structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the propagation of mechanical signals in epithelial tissues is crucial for elucidating how mechanical cues influence cellular behavior and tissue dynamics, which has implications in various fields including regmedicine and cancer research.

Method: The research employs a mesoscopic probe to apply local shear to an epithelial monolayer. They measure cellular migration dynamics and observe changes in mechanical properties, incorporating the epithelial jamming model as a theoretical framework.

Result: Shear perturbations propagate beyond immediate cell neighbors and influence cell migration in stiffer layers, while they dissipate locally in softer layers. Energetic state shifts and changes in cell shape further support the findings.

Conclusion: The study reveals how local mechanical forces traverse epithelial tissues, offering a novel perspective on tissue response to mechanical perturbations and advancing our understanding of cellular mechanics.

Abstract: As small particles skim our airways during breathing, or our intestines during digestion, the surface epithelium is subjected to local exogenous shear that deforms hundreds to thousands of tightly interacting cells. Unlike shear deformations applied at the macro-tissue scale or the micro-cell scale, the effects of such perturbations at the meso-scale remain largely unexplored. To address this, we developed a mesoscopic probe that adheres to the apical surface of an epithelial monolayer and applies magnetically derived local shear. We find that localized shear propagated way beyond immediate neighbors and suppressed cellular migratory dynamics in stiffer layers, yet dissipated locally and left dynamics unchanged in softer layers. This mechano-transductive view is reinforced by the observation that stiffening of a soft layer promotes responsiveness to shear. Interpreted within the epithelial jamming framework, shear-induced migratory suppression in stiff layers was accompanied by reduced MSD scaling exponents and changes in cell shape. These changes suggested a localized shift of the tissue toward a lower-energetic state. Together, these observations provide a new perspective on how a local mechanical perturbation traverses the epithelial monolayer to influence both nearby and distant cellular environments.

### [6] [In-vivo femtonewton-sensing nanotribology of Tradescantia zebrina leaf cell inner surface using roll rotation detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24823)
*Snigdhadev Chakraborty,Mukul Sagar,Atanu Ghosh,Krishna Kumari Swain,Mrutyunjaya Rath,Agniva Das,Susy Varughese,Basudev Roy*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a method to study the inner cell surface of a plant cell using optical tweezers, identifying prismatic calcium oxalate crystals as suitable candidates. The study explores stable configurations under linear polarization and measures frictional properties via micro-rheology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of non-invasive cell analysis in eukaryotes, particularly plant cells, is addressed to advance understanding of cellular structures. The discovery of calcium oxalate crystals as a research tool highlights innovative biological materials.

Method: 1. Use optical tweezers with linear polarization to trap particles. 2. Study stable configurations under such conditions. 3. Explore out-of-plane rotations, focusing on roll rotation. 4. Perform micro-rheological analysis to measure frictional properties. 5. Measure frictional force without averaging, achieving sensitivity and accuracy.

Result: Calcium oxalate crystals can be successfully trapped and studied using optical tweezers. Frictional forces of 18.5 pN are measured, indicating precise measurement capabilities.

Conclusion: This study provides techniques for analyzing cell surfaces with high resolution, using biological crystals as a novel material.

Abstract: Accessing the properties of a plant cell interior non-invasively is difficult due to the presence of a cell wall. Nanoparticles larger than 5 nm cannot be readily phagocytosed inside the cell like animal cells. It is here that we realise that Tradescantia zebrina plant cells have prismatic forms of calcium oxalate crystals present inside them naturally. These crystals make a ready choice to study properties of the inner cell surface with the application of optical tweezers. Moreover, out-of-plane rotations in optical tweezers have begun to be explored only recently. The pitch rotation has been detected with high resolution and several applications are explored. In this work, we first study the stable configuration while trapped in linearly polarized optical tweezers and then explore the other out-of-plane configurations to detect the roll rotation at high resolution. Then a micro-rheological analysis is performed to obtain the frictional properties of the inner surface of the plasma membrane of the leaf cell. The size of the particle is about 5 $μ$m along the diagonal, so that the contact length with the surface is about 200 nm. We measure a frictional force of 18.5 pN at a sensitivity of about 200 fN without averaging.

### [7] [Modelling the movements of organisms by stochastic theory in a comoving frame](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24937)
*Norberto Lucero Azuara,Rainer Klages*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper explains how the movement of organisms can be modeled as a correlated random walk using stochastic processes. They show that transforming these processes from a fixed Cartesian frame to a comoving frame (where the direction of movement is changing over time) can be done exactly. This leads to a broader understanding for modeling organismal movements and has applications for autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding movement patterns in biology has practical applications for robotics and autonomous systems.

Method: The authors use correlated random walk models, stochastic processes like the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and transform equations between coordinate systems.

Result: A precise mathematical transformation links Cartesian and comoving frame stochastic dynamics, expanding the correlated random walk framework.

Conclusion: This framework offers new tools for modeling animal and human movement, useful for biology and engineering.

Abstract: Imagine you walk in a plane. You move by making a step of a certain length per time interval in a chosen direction. Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach to identifying the functionally independent invariants that can be constructed from a tensor with a given symmetry structure. Our algorithm proceeds by first enumerating graphs, or tensor networks, that represent inequivalent contractions of a product of tensors, computing instances of these scalars using randomly generated data, and then seeking linear relations between invariants using numerical linear algebra. Such relations yield syzygies, or functional dependencies relating different invariants. We apply this approach in an extended case study of the independent invariants that can be constructed from an antisymmetric $3$-form $H_{μνρ}$ in six dimensions, finding five independent invariants. This result confirms that the most general Lagrangian for such a $3$-form, which depends on $H_{μνρ}$ but not its derivatives, is an arbitrary function of five variables, and we give explicit formulas relating other invariants to the five independent scalars in this generating set.

Abstract: We investigate energy correlators in four-dimensional gravitational theories, which provide a simple class of infrared-finite observables. We compute the one- and two-point energy correlators at one loop in $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity and in pure Einstein gravity, with particular emphasis on the contact terms arising from the interplay between virtual corrections and real emissions. We explicitly demonstrate the cancellation of infrared divergences and verify the Ward identities associated with energy-momentum conservation. In the back-to-back limit, we derive an all-order expression for the energy-energy correlator, showing that it is governed by universal soft-graviton dynamics. We further introduce a particularly simple beam-averaged energy-energy correlator and compute it in different gravitational theories, including tree-level string theory. The resulting correlators exhibit analyticity and polynomial boundedness, allowing for the formulation of dispersion relations, which we explore. Finally, we discuss additional singularities of the gravitational energy correlators, absent in QCD, that originate from the long-range nature of the gravitational interactions.

Abstract: These lecture notes are a contribution to the proceedings of the school "Geometric, Algebraic and Topological Methods for Quantum Field Theory", held in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, from 31st of July to 9th of August 2023. Its intention is to put together several basic tools of classical integrability and contrast them with those available in the formulation of asymptotic symmetries and the definition of canonical charges in gauge theories. We consider as a working example the Chern-Simons theory in 3D dimensions, motivated by its various applications in condensed matter physics, gravity, and black hole physics. We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $Λ<0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics. We finalize offering some insights on the initial value problem, its connection with integrable systems and flat connections. We study some properties of the Monodromy matrix and recover the infinite KdV charges from the trace invariants extracted from the Monodromy evolution equation that can be written in a Lax form.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the quantum field theory of zero temperature perfect fluids. Such systems are defined by quantizing a classical field theory of scalar fields $φ^I$ that act as Lagrange coordinates on an internal spatial manifold of fluid configurations. Invariance under volume preserving diffeomorphisms acting on these scalars implies that the long-wavelength spectrum contains vortex (transverse modes) with exact $ω_T=0$ dispersion relation. As a result, physically interpreting the perturbative quantization of this theory by standard methods has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we show that correlators evaluated in the class of semi-classical (Gaussian) initial states prepared at $t=0$ are well-defined and accessible via perturbation theory. The width of the initial state effectively acts as an infrared regulator without explicitly breaking diffeomorphism invariance. As an application, we compute stress tensor two-point correlators and show that vortex modes give a non-trivial contribution to the response function, non-local in both space and time.

Conclusion: 研究推翻了先前关于传播子复杂性的认知，表明通过全时空积分获得的correlator最为简洁，此结论适用于整体传播子。

Abstract: Several recent works have revealed a simplicity in equal-time correlators that is absent in their wavefunction counterparts. In this letter, we show that this arises from the simple fact that the correlator is obtained by integrating Feynman propagators over the full spacetime, as opposed to the half-space for the wavefunction. Several striking new properties of correlators for any graph are made obvious from this picture. Certain patterns of poles that appear in the wavefunction do not appear in the correlator. The correlator also enjoys several remarkable factorization properties in various limits. Most strikingly, the correlator admits a systematic Laurent expansion in the neighborhood of every pole, with the first subleading term vanishing for every pole. There is an especially simple understanding of the expansion around the total energy pole up to second order, given by a differential operator acting on the amplitude. Finally, we show how these results extend beyond single graphs to the full correlator in Tr $φ^3$ theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a novel scenario for a strongly coupled spectator sector during inflation, that of a higher dimensional conformal field theory with large anomalous dimensions -- ``unparticles" -- and compactify the extra dimensions. More specifically, we take generalized free fields in five dimensions, where the extra dimension is compactified to a circle. Due to the usual Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the resulting excitations carry properties of both particles and unparticles, so we dub this scenario ``gapped unparticles". We derive a two-point function of the gapped unparticles by performing dimensional reduction. We then compute, in the collapsed limit, the four-point correlation function of conformally coupled scalars exchanging a gapped unparticle, which are used as seed functions to obtain the correlation function of primordial density perturbations. The phenomenology of the resulting correlators presents some novel features, such as oscillations with an envelope controlled by the anomalous dimension, rather than the usual value of 3/2. Depending on the value of the five-dimensional scaling dimension and effective mass of the gapped unparticles, we find a clear strategy to distinguish gapped unparticles from heavy massive scalars. If we assume the interactions are localized on a brane, gapped unparticles with different effective masses will share a universal coupling, and their exchanges produce an interesting interference pattern.

Abstract: We consider 4-point $W_3$ classical blocks focusing on the blocks level-1 and level-2 semi-degenerate operators. We derive BPZ-type equations for the auxiliary 5-point blocks with one additional fully degenerate operator. The monodromy properties of these equations are encoded by the accessory parameters, related to the 4-point $W_3$ classical blocks. We solve the BPZ-type equations via heavy-light perturbation theory and find the accessory parameters, which allows us to obtain the explicit expressions for the considered class of classical blocks.

Abstract: The best way to represent generic conformal blocks is provided by the free-field formalism, where they acquire a form of multiple Dotsenko-Fateev-like integrals of the screening operators. Degenerate conformal blocks can be described by the same integrals with special choice of parameters. Integrals satisfy various recurrent relations, which for the special choice of parameters reduce to closed equations. This setting is widely used in explaining the AGT relation, because similar integral representations exist also for Nekrasov functions. We extend this approach to the case of q-Virasoro conformal blocks on elliptic surface -- generic and degenerate. For the generic case, we check equivalence with instanton partition function of a 5d circular quiver gauge theory. For the degenerate case, we check equivalence with partition function of a defect in the same theory, also known as the Shiraishi function. We find agreement in both cases. This opens a way to re-derive the sophisticated equation for the Shiraishi function as the equation for the corresponding integral, what seems straightforward, but remains technically involved and is left for the future.

Abstract: In this work, families of kinks are analytically identified in multifield theories with either polynomial or deformed sine-Gordon-type potentials. The underlying procedure not only allows us to obtain analytical solutions for these models, but also provides a framework for constructing more general families of field theories that inherit certain analytical information about their solutions. Specifically, this method combines two known field theories into a new composite field theory whose target space is the product of the original target spaces. By suitably coupling the fields through a superpotential defined on the product space, the dynamics in the subspaces become entangled while preserving original kinks as boundary kinks. Different composite field theories are studied, including extensions of well-known models to wider target spaces.

Abstract: We study the Coulomb-branch sector of 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories with half-hypermultiplets in general pseudoreal representations $\mathbf{R}$ ("noncotangent" theories). This yields (short) quantization of the Coulomb branch and correlators of the Coulomb branch operators captured by the 1d topological sector. This is done by extending the hemisphere partition function approach to noncotangent matter. In this setting one must first cancel the parity anomaly, and overcome an obstacle that $(2,2)$ boundary conditions for half-hypers are generically incompatible with gauge symmetry. Using the Dirichlet boundary conditions for the gauge fields and a careful treatment of half-hypermultiplet boundary data, we describe the resulting shift/difference operators implementing monopole insertions (including bubbling effects) on $HS^3$, and use the $HS^3$ partition function as a natural module on which the Coulomb-branch operator algebra $\mathcal{A}_C$ is represented. As applications we derive generators and relations of $\mathcal{A}_C$ for $SU(2)$ theories with general matter (including half-integer spin representations), analyze theories with Coulomb branch $y^2=z(x^2-1)$, compute the Coulomb branch of an $A_n$ quiver with spin-$\frac32$ half-hypers, and check consistency of a general monopole-antimonopole two-point function.

TL;DR: The paper investigates one-loop beta functions for gauge and gravitational coupling constants in heterotic string theory using double-copy-like decomposition of string amplitudes under $T^6$ compactification. The beta functions vanish due to supersymmetry, and the method provides general model-independent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of beta functions is crucial for understanding the running of coupling constants in string theory, which impacts the consistency and predictions of the theory under compactifications.

Method: The authors use a double-copy-like decomposition of one-loop string amplitudes in the world-line limit, analyzing three-point amplitudes with $T^6$ compactification.

Result: The beta functions for gauge and gravitational couplings vanish at one-loop due to supersymmetry, with the results obtained being general and model-independent.

Conclusion: This approach offers a systematic method for computing one-loop beta functions in heterotic string theory, leveraging supersymmetry and the distinctive properties of string amplitudes under compactifications.

Abstract: Following the approach of Refs.[1,2], the double-copy-like decomposition of exchanged internal states in the world-line limit of one-loop string amplitudes is systematically formulated and generalized to both bosonic and heterotic string theories. As an application, the one-loop beta functions for the gauge and gravitational coupling constants are investigated by analyzing the low-energy field-theory limit of the corresponding three-point one-loop amplitudes in heterotic string theory under a naive $T^6$ compactification. Due to supersymmetry, these beta functions vanish trivially. However, by decomposing the scattering integrand according to the different internal loop-exchanged states, the most general model-independent results are obtained.

Abstract: Non-trivial 't Hooft anomaly obstructs the existence of a simple symmetric conformal boundary condition in a CFT. Conversely, there is a common piece of lore that trivial 't Hooft anomaly promises the existence of a simple symmetry conformal boundary condition in a given CFT. Recently, counter examples to this lore was realized in tetracritical Ising CFT [1] and compact boson [2] -- the simple conformal boundary conditions preserving certain anomaly-free subsymmetry are absent in these CFTs. In this work, we uncover the underlying reason for the absence of these boundary conditions in counter examples, and propose a criterion diagnosing when the lore fails for any given 2d CFT. The Symmetry TFT description for boundary conditions plays a crucial role.

Abstract: The Steinmann relations are known to be violated with respect to some -- but not all -- two-particle momentum channels in massless Feynman integrals. We trace the source of this Steinmann violation to a special class of singularities, which arise from partially-overlapping minimal cuts. This allows us to propose an efficient graphical test for predicting which Steinmann relations will be violated by massless Feynman integrals of a given topology, which can be applied at any loop order. We provide evidence for this test by correctly predicting all instances of Steinmann violation in the complete set of known two-loop integrals that contribute to five-particle scattering with one or two external masses.

Abstract: The jet quenching phenomenon in an anisotropic quark-gluon plasma is studied using gauge-gravity duality. We consider a more general orientation of the contour of a lightlike Wilson loop in the boundary field theory. The Nambu-Goto action for a two-dimensional worldsheet, whose boundary is this contour, is evaluated in a five-dimensional bulk. We present the dependence of the jet quenching parameter on the orientation. Discontinuities of the jet quenching parameter occur at a first-order phase transition, and their magnitude depends on the orientation. These dependencies are observed in holographic models for both light and heavy quarks with nonzero temperature, chemical potential, magnetic field, and spatial anisotropy, supported by an Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It was previously shown that a D7 brane probe in a D3 brane background with a pure gauge constant magnetic field $\mathrm{B} = \mathrm{H}$ exhibits chiral symmetry breaking and a discrete meson spectrum with Zeeman splitting. In this work, we investigate how these features are modified by a TsT deformation of the background, which renders the Kalb Ramond field physical and radially dependent, thereby obscuring its interpretation as a constant magnetic field.
  We show that chiral symmetry breaking persists in the deformed model. The meson spectrum, however, depends on the fluctuation sector. Fluctuations perpendicular to the magnetic field are sensitive to the deformation and, for generic values of the TsT parameter $\mathrm{k}$, do not admit a consistent spectrum due to divergent behavior near the horizon, whereas fluctuations parallel to the magnetic field remain unaffected.
  Remarkably, the combined effect of the magnetic field and the TsT deformation singles out the special value $\mathrm{k} = -\frac{1}{\mathrm{H}}$. At this point, the perpendicular modes are restored. Moreover, the Kalb Ramond field becomes constant again, recovering its interpretation as a magnetic field. The resulting effects on the spectrum appear only at order $O(H^2)$, and therefore the Zeeman splitting, if present at all, is shifted to this higher order.
  Furthermore, the resulting background with $\mathrm{k} = - \frac{1}{\mathrm{H}}$ is interesting in its own right, even without embedding any brane. The spacetime admits an interpretation in terms of D1 branes and exhibits a degenerate boundary geometry, asymptotically $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times S^5$, with a degenerate horizon. We present a first discussion of the dual field theory interpretation, making connections to D1 and D5 systems, renormalization group flow, defect field theories, and domain wall holography.

Abstract: We study the interplay between holomorphic conformal field theory and dualities of 3D topological quantum field theories generalizing the paradigm of level-rank duality. A holomorphic conformal field theory with a Kac-Moody subalgebra implies a topological interface between Chern-Simons gauge theories. Upon condensing a suitable set of anyons, such an interface yields a duality between topological field theories. We illustrate this idea using the $c=24$ holomorphic theories classified by Schellekens, which leads to a list of novel sporadic dualities. Some of these dualities necessarily involve condensation of anyons with non-abelian statistics, i.e. gauging non-invertible one-form global symmetries. Several of the examples we discover generalize from $c=24$ to an infinite series. This includes the fact that Spin$(n^{2})_{2}$ is dual to a twisted dihedral group gauge theory. Finally, if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $k$, we deduce the existence of a sequence of holomorphic CFTs at central charge $c=2(k-1)$ with fusion category symmetry given by $\mathrm{Spin}(k)_{2}$ or equivalently, the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-equivariantization of a Tambara-Yamagami fusion category.

### [28] [Virasoro Symmetry in Neural Network Field Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24420)
*Brandon Robinson*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new type of neural network realization of a conformal field theory (CFT) in two dimensions, called Neural Network Field Theories (NN-FTs). NN-FTs can encode the Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT by constructing a local stress-energy tensor that satisfies conformal Ward identities. The authors present a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor T(z) by choosing a specific architecture and prior distribution of network parameters. They verify their results through numerical simulations, computing the central charge and scaling dimensions of vertex operators. They also extend the formalism to include super-Virasoro symmetry by constructing neural realizations of Majorana fermions and (1,1) scalar multiplets. Finally, the framework is extended to include boundary NN-FTs that preserve (super-)conformal symmetry via the method of images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In recent years, the application of neural networks to theoretical physics has gained momentum, particularly in the context of holography and the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, constructing neural network models that accurately realize the local conformal symmetry of 2d CFTs has proven challenging. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing a new approach to constructing neural network realizations of CFTs, specifically encoding the Virasoro algebra and its extensions, such as super-Virasoro symmetry.

Method: The authors employ a neural network architecture suitable for representing free bosonic fields, imposing constraints on the network parameters to ensure the presence of a local stress-energy tensor. They demonstrate that, under these constraints, the network can encode the Virasoro symmetry algebra. The central charge and scaling dimensions of vertex operators are computed analytically and verified through numerical simulations. Additionally, the authors extend their construction to incorporate fermionic fields and supersymmetric extensions.

Result: The key results include the successful construction of a neural network that encodes the Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT. The local stress-energy tensor T(z) satisfies conformal Ward identities, enabling the computation of the central charge and scaling dimensions. The extension to include Majorana fermions and supersymmetric multiplets is achieved, and the formalism is further generalized to include boundary conditions preserving (super-)conformal symmetry via the method of images. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions, providing strong evidence for the validity of the approach.

Conclusion: This paper represents a significant step forward in the application of neural networks to the realization of local conformal symmetry in 2d CFTs. By constructing a neural network that encodes the Virasoro algebra and its extensions, the authors demonstrate the feasibility of neural network models for capturing complex algebraic structures in theoretical physics. The results open up new possibilities for using neural networks in the study of holography, conformal field theories, and related areas of theoretical physics. The approach taken in this paper may also provide inspiration for analogous constructions in higher-dimensional theories and for exploring the implications of neural network models in other areas of physics.

Abstract: Neural Network Field Theories (NN-FTs) can realize global conformal symmetries via embedding space architectures. These models describe Generalized Free Fields (GFFs) in the infinite width limit. However, they typically lack a local stress-energy tensor satisfying conformal Ward identities. This presents an obstruction to realizing infinite-dimensional, local conformal symmetry typifying 2d Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). We present the first construction of an NN-FT that encodes the full Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT. We formulate a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor $T(z)$ by properly choosing the architecture and prior distribution of network parameters. We verify the analytical results through numerical simulation; computing the central charge and the scaling dimensions of vertex operators. We then construct an NN realization of a Majorana Fermion and an $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ scalar multiplet, which then enables an extension of the formalism to include super-Virasoro symmetry. Finally, we extend the framework by constructing boundary NN-FTs that preserve (super-)conformal symmetry via the method of images.

Abstract: We study massive $2 \to 2$ scattering of identical scalar particles in spacetime dimensions 3 to 11 using non-perturbative S-matrix bootstrap techniques. Treating $d$ as a continuous parameter, we compute two-sided numerical bounds on low-energy observables and find smooth branches of extremal amplitudes separated by sharp kinks at $d=5$ and $d=7$, coinciding with a transition in threshold analyticity and the loss of some well-known dispersive positivity constraints. Our results reveal a rich structure in the space of massive S-matrices across dimensions and identify threshold singularities as a key organizing principle. We comment on numerical limitations at large dimension and on possible implications for ultraviolet completion in higher-dimensional quantum field theory.

Motivation: Understanding θ dependence in quantum chromodynamics and its implications for the strong CP problem.

Method: Use infrared dressing, Berry holonomy, and Chern-Simons coordinates to analyze vacuum angle θ, studying how observables depend on θ.

Result: θ dependence is found negligible for local correlators, but non-trivial effects persist in global responses like vacuum energy and topological susceptibility.

Conclusion: New infrared perspective supports θ insensitivity, consistent with Witten-Veneziano approach but requiring further investigation for full picture.

Abstract: We reformulate the strong $CP$ problem from an infrared viewpoint in which the vacuum angle $θ$ is not treated as a local coupling but as a global Berry-type holonomy of the infrared-dressed state space over $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}$. Infrared dressing is described as adiabatic parallel transport of physical states in configuration space, generated by an infrared connection $\mathcal{A}_{\rm IR}$. Using the Chern-Simons collective coordinate, we show that the Pontryagin index emerges as an integer infrared winding, such that the resulting holonomy phase is quantized by $Q\in\mathbb Z$ and reproduces the standard weight $e^{iθQ}$. A quantum rotor provides a controlled infrared example illustrating why broad classes of local correlators may remain insensitive to $θ$, while global response functions, such as the vacuum energy curvature and the topological susceptibility, retain a nontrivial dependence. We contrast this picture with recent claims of $θ$--independence based on the order of limits and show that it is consistent with both the rotor benchmark and the classic Witten-Veneziano perspective.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of a charged scalar field in the near-horizon region of an extremal charged BTZ black hole. The near-horizon geometry contains an AdS2 throat with a constant electric field, which lowers the effective mass of the scalar and can trigger a violation of the AdS2 Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. We show that this instability is resolved by the formation of a static scalar cloud supported by Schwinger pair production. The condensate backreacts on the gauge field and partially screens the electric flux, leading to a self-consistent stationary configuration. The scalar profile is obtained analytically from the near-horizon equations and exhibits the characteristic behavior of a BF-violating mode in AdS2. We analyze the associated boundary conditions, the induced charge density, and the resulting modification of the electric field. The resulting configuration can be interpreted as an electric analogue of known magnetic hairy black hole solutions. Our results provide a concrete realization of electric screening in extremal charged black holes and clarify the role of near-horizon dynamics in shaping the infrared structure of the solution.

Result: The chordality condition is both necessary and sufficient for entropy vectors to be realizable by holographic tree models, particularly highlighting the role of stabilizer states in relation to entropy cones.

Conclusion: This result simplifies the identification of entropy vectors realizable by holographic tree models and deepens our understanding of relationships between entropy cones, holography, and quantum information theory.

Abstract: We prove that the ``chordality condition'', which was established in arXiv:2412.18018 as a necessary condition for an entropy vector to be realizable by a holographic simple tree graph model, is also sufficient. The proof is constructive, demonstrating that the algorithm introduced in arXiv:2512.18702 for constructing a simple tree graph model realization of a given entropy vector that satisfies this condition always succeeds. We emphasize that these results hold for an arbitrary number of parties, and, given that any entropy vector realizable by a holographic graph model can also be realized, at least approximately, by a stabilizer state, they highlight how techniques originally developed in holography can provide broad insights into entanglement and information theory more generally, and in particular, into the structure of the stabilizer and quantum entropy cones. Moreover, if the strong form of the conjecture from arXiv:2204.00075 holds, namely, if all holographic entropy vectors can be realized by (not necessarily simple) tree graph models, then the result of this work demonstrates that the essential data that encodes the structure of the holographic entropy cone for an arbitrary number of parties, is the set of ``chordal'' extreme rays of the subadditivity cone.

Abstract: We develop a quadratic-in-Riemann worldline action for a Kerr black hole at infinite spin orders by matching to a proposed tree-level Kerr Compton amplitude, originally obtained from higher-spin QFT considerations. A worldline action is an effective theory, and as such the tree-level matching needs to be corrected by loop effects, including UV counter terms, renormalization, and higher-order matching to general relativity. However, we anticipate that many features of the Wilson coefficients of the proposed tree-level action will remain unchanged even after a loop-level matching. While the worldline action is given in closed form, it contains an infinite number of quadratic-in-Riemann operators $R^2$, even for the same-helicity sector. We argue that in the same-helicity sector the $R^2$ operators have no intrinsic meaning, as they merely remove unwanted terms produced by the linear-in-Riemann operators, which are well-established in the literature. The opposite-helicity sector is somewhat more complicated, it contains both $R^2$ operators that removes unwanted terms, and $R^2$ operators that add new needed terms to the Compton amplitude. We discuss and classify all independent $R^2$ operators that can feature in the worldline action.

Abstract: We study the continuum limit of branched polymers (BPs) with loops coupled to Ising spins at the zero-temperature critical point. It is known that the continuum partition function can be represented by a Hermitian two-matrix model, and we propose a string field theory whose Dyson-Schwinger equation coincides with the loop equation of this continuum matrix model. By setting the matrix size to one, we analyze a convergent non-perturbative partition function expressed as a two-dimensional integral, and show that it satisfies a third-order linear differential equation. In contrast, in the absence of coupling to the critical Ising model, the continuum partition function of pure BPs with loops is known to satisfy the Airy equation. From the viewpoint of two-dimensional quantum gravity, we introduce a non-perturbative loop amplitude that serves as a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation incorporating contributions from all genera. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same Wheeler-DeWitt equation can also be derived through the stochastic quantization.

Abstract: Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a strongly interacting state of the early universe, exhibits remarkably fluid-like behavior despite its underlying non-Abelian dynamics. Motivated by these features, we explore time-dependent SU(2) Yang-Mills condensates as non-linear classical background fields to model QGP. We first study quarks in gluon backgrounds and show that quark back-reaction can break the isotropy of the condensate for certain initial conditions. We then compute the one-loop finite-temperature effective action using the background-field method and heat-kernel expansion. The resulting thermodynamic pressure increases with temperature but exhibits an approximately logarithmic dependence. This is expected, as this is the de-confined phase of QGP; it is not exactly an ideal gas due to self-interaction. We also perform lattice calculations for the system to contrast continuum and lattice perspectives. We then add the GW to the thermodynamic QGP model and show that certain frequencies of the GW can induce instabilities in the QGP. Our analysis explores the limitations and role of non-perturbative, time-dependent backgrounds in semi-classical description of Yang-Mills dynamics.

Abstract: We define two new indecomposable (not fully reducible) ${\cal N}=8$, $d=1$ off-shell multiplets and consider the corresponding models of ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric mechanics with spin variables. Each multiplet is described off shell by a scalar superfield which is a nonlinear deformation of the standard scalar superfield $X$ carrying the $d=1$ multiplet ${\bf (1,8,7)}$. Deformed systems involve, as invariant subsets, two different off-shell versions of the irreducible multiplet ${\bf (8,8,0)}$. For both systems we present the manifestly ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric superfield constraints, as well as the component off- and on-shell invariant actions, which for one version exactly match those given in arXiv:2402.00539 [hep-th]. The two models differ off shell, but prove to be equivalent to each other on shell, with the spin variables sitting in the adjoint representation of the maximal $R$-symmetry group ${\rm SO}(8)$.

Within its $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ invariant sector, the theory is known to possess eight AdS vacua, preserving various amounts of residual supersymmetry and bosonic symmetry. By making use of fake supergravity and the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we find novel non-supersymmetric domain walls (DW) interpolating between different pairs of AdS extrema. We conclude by discussing some holographically relevant quantities such as the free energy and the anomalous dimensions of the operators triggering the dual RG flows.

Abstract: We study the situation when the T-dual of a toric Kähler geometry is a generalized Kähler geometry involving semi-chiral fields. We explain that this situation is generic for polycylinders, tori and related geometries. Gauging multiple isometries in this case requires the introduction of semi-chiral gauge fields on top of the standard ones. We then apply this technology to the generalized Kähler geometry of the $η$-deformed $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$ model, relating it to the Kähler geometry of its T-dual.

Abstract: In $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $G$ spontaneously broken to a subgroup $H$, S-duality requires that the BPS monopole spectrum organizes into the same representation as W-bosons in the dual theory, where $G^{\vee}$ is broken to $H^{\vee}$. The expectation has been extensively verified in the maximally broken phase $G\to U(1)^r$. Here we address the non-Abelian regime in which $H$ contains a semisimple factor $H^{s}$. Using the stratified description of monopole moduli space, we give a general proof of this matching for any simple gauge group $G$. Each BPS monopole state is naturally labeled by a weight of the relevant $W$-boson representation of $(H^{\vee})^{s}$. We construct non-Abelian magnetic gauge transformation operators implementing the $(H^{\vee})^{s}$-action on the monopole Hilbert space, which commute with the electric $H^{s}$-transformations and thereby realize the $H^{s}\times (H^{\vee})^{s}$ symmetry at the level of monopole quantum mechanics.

TL;DR: The paper examines the Klein paradox in quantum field theory by analyzing the particle current induced by a step-like electric potential in 1+1 dimensions, considering various scenarios and ground states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to explore the non-zero particle current in the Klein paradox under different configurations of electric potentials, potentially offering insights into quantum field theory phenomena.

Method: The paper employs a many-particle approach within quantum field theory, analyzing the expectation value of the particle current for different Fock space ground states and various potential configurations. The calculations involve evaluating the current induced by different electric potentials in 1+1 dimensions.

Result: The study reveals that the choice of ground state significantly affects the computed particle current. For a constant (eternal) potential, one ground state yields a zero current, whereas another produces the standard non-zero value. Additionally, the paper demonstrates that a rapidly switched-on potential recovers the standard current in the asymptotic future, and this result is generalized to potentials interpolating between different constant values at spatial infinity. For a finite-duration potential, the standard current is again observed.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the particle current in the Klein paradox is highly sensitive to the choice of ground state and the configuration of the electric potential. The findings provide a deeper understanding of the Klein paradox and its implications in quantum field theory.

Abstract: We re-examine the Klein paradox from a many-particle perspective in quantum field theory. Specifically, we compute the expectation value of the particle current induced by a sufficiently strong step-like electric potential in 1+1 dimensions. First, for a constant (eternal) potential, we calculate the current for different Fock space ground states corresponding to distinct mode bases. While one basis yields a zero current, another produces the standard nonzero value. We then consider a potential that is rapidly switched on, recovering the standard current in the asymptotic future. This result is generalized to potentials that interpolate between different constant values at spatial infinity. Finally, we analyze a potential acting for a finite duration and again reproduce the standard current. A physical interpretation of these results is provided.

Abstract: In this work, we compute quantum discord between two causally independent areas in $3+1$ dimensions global de Sitter Axiverse to investigate the signs of quantum entanglement. For this goal, we study a bipartite quantum field theoretic setting driven by an Axiverse that arises from the compactification of Type IIB strings on a Calabi-Yau three fold. We consider a spherical surface that separates the interior and exterior causally unconnected subregions of the spatial slice of the global de Sitter space. The Bunch-Davies state is the most straightforward initial quantum vacuum that may be used for computing purposes. Two observers are introduced, one in an open chart of de Sitter space and the other in a global chart. The observers calculate the quantum discord generated by each detecting a mode. The relationship between an observer in one of the two Rindler charts in flat space and another in a Minkowski chart is comparable to this circumstance. We see that when the curvature of the open chart increases, the state becomes less entangled. Nevertheless, we see that even in the limit when entanglement vanishes, the quantum discord never goes away.

TL;DR: We compute static Love numbers for scalar and Dirac perturbations of static acoustic black holes in different dimensions and find that scalar Love numbers are nonzero in (3+1)D, follow a specific power-law form in (2+1)D, and that fermionic Love numbers follow simpler universal power-law forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding Love numbers in acoustic black hole systems can provide insights into tidal response and the behavior of different spin fields in various spacetime dimensions.

Method: The authors analyze static love numbers for scalar and Dirac perturbations in (3+1) and (2+1) dimensions by imposing horizon regularity conditions and matching large-radius expansions.

Result: In (3+1) dimensions, scalar Love numbers are non-zero for Acoustic Black Holes, while Fermionic Love numbers follow a universal power-law form. In (2+1) dimensions, scalar Love numbers exhibit a logarithmic structure, making Love numbers for even angular numbers zero while non-zero for odd numbers. Fermionic Love numbers follow a simpler power-law form in (2+1) dimensions.

Conclusion: The study reveals the behavior of Love numbers for different spin fields in Descending Dimensions, which is important for Understanding Tidal Effects in analogue Gravity Systems.

Abstract: We compute static ($ω\to0$) tilde Love numbers for scalar ($s=0$) and Dirac ($s=1/2$) perturbations of static acoustic black holes (ABHs) in (3+1) and (2+1) dimensions respectively. By imposing horizon regularity condition and matching to the large-radius expansion, we extract the ratio between decaying and growing modes. It turns out that in (3+1) dimensions the scalar Love number is generically nonzero for ABHs, while the Fermionic Love numbers follow a universal power-law form $F^{\pm1/2}_{\ell m}=\pm 4^{-(\ell+1/2)}$. In (2+1) dimensions the scalar field exhibits a strange logarithmic structure, causing the Bosonic Love number to vanish for even $m$ but remain nontrivial for odd $m$; In contrast, the Fermionic Love number in this case retains a simple power-law form $F_m=4^{-m}$ and is generically nonzero. These results provide insights into tidal response in analogue gravity systems and highlight qualitative differences between integer- and half-integer-spin fields.

Conclusion: 中央电荷的大小决定了引力行为的量子或经典特征，揭示了AdS空间中熵的行为与其边界量子场论的central charge之间深刻联系。

Abstract: In this paper, based on the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, we highlight the fundamental role of the holographic central charge in connecting the boundary theory to quantum information, black hole thermodynamics, and the nature of gravity in the bulk. We establish that the large central charge of the boundary conformal field theory corresponds to classical gravity, while a small central charge corresponds to quantum gravity described by Loop Quantum Gravity. In addition, we study the thermodynamic behavior of AdS-Schwarzschild black holes for both large and small central charges. For large central charge, the classical AdS-Schwarzschild black holes have two phases: unstable small black holes and stable large black holes. Conversely, for small central charge, black holes are stable, and their entropy is smaller than that of classical black holes. To explore the influence of the boundary central charge on the information loss paradox, we use the island formula to recover the Page curve. We find that before the Page time, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation increases with time, and its slope is determined by the central charge of the boundary theory. After the Page time, the island inside black holes emerges, and the unitarity of black hole evaporation is restored, yielding a constant entropy consistent with the Page curve. This entanglement entropy, i.e. after the Page time, depends on the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and includes a logarithmic correction related to the central charge.

Abstract: We consider eigenfunctions of many-body system Hamiltonians associated with generalized (a-twisted) Cherednik operators used in construction of other Hamiltonians: those arising from commutative subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. The simplest example of these eigenfunctions is provided by non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, while generally they are constructed basing on the ground state eigenfunction coinciding with the twisted Baker-Akhiezer function being a peculiar (symmetric) eigenfunction of the DIM Hamiltonians. Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This gives a new twist in theory of integrable systems, which usually puts an accent on symmetric polynomials, and provides a new dimension to the {\it triad} made from the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, untwisted Baker-Akhiezer functions and Noumi-Shiraishi series.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of anisotropy on dispersion relations and convergence in relativistic hydrodynamics. In particular, we show that for dispersion relations with a branch point at the origin (such as sound modes), there exists a continuum of collisions between hydrodynamic modes at complex wavevector. These collisions are then explicitly demonstrated to be present in a holographic plasma. We lay out a criterion for when the continuum of collisions affects the convergence of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion. Finally, the radius of convergence of hydrodynamic dispersion relations in anisotropic systems is bounded from above on the basis of compatibility with microscopic causality.

Abstract: The thermofield double state entangles two copies of a CFT via a sum over energy eigenstates and is dual to the two-sided eternal black hole. We explore an analogous construction using sums over gauge group representations of half-BPS Wilson loops in multiple copies of $U(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. These sums act as delta function-like operators that correlate the eigenvalues of the corresponding half-BPS matrix models. We suggest that the holographic duals are ''bubbling wormhole'' geometries: multi-covers of AdS$_5$ $\times S^5$ whose conformal boundary consists of multiple four-spheres intersecting on a common circle. We analyze the matrix model free energy, discuss its bulk interpretation, and study probe loops in these backgrounds.

By carefully implementing the extrapolate dictionary for extremal correlators we explain the origin of the apparent mismatch between supergravity and CFT for extremal correlators involving giant gravitons in type IIB supergravity. We propose an ansatz for the wavefunctions of half-BPS giants which reproduces large $N$ limit of certain extremal two and three point functions in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.

Abstract: At tree-level, scattering amplitudes involving only gluons or gravitons are unaffected by supersymmetry, allowing them to be efficiently encoded by and extracted from those of maximally supersymmetric (N=4,8) theories. This fails beyond tree-level, of course, but much less than would be expected. We show that all the leading singularities of (sub-maximally or) non-supersymmetric theories can be organized into `generalized' superfunctions, in terms of which all helicity components can be effectively encoded. These functions differ from those of maximally supersymmetric theories by an extent determined by loop-order -- broken into a sum over 2^L supersymmetric pieces.

Abstract: We investigate BPS states in 4d N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the corresponding (p, q) string networks in Type IIB string theory. We propose a new interpretation of the algebra of line operators in this theory as a tensor product of vector representations of a quantum toroidal algebra, which determines protected spin characters of all framed BPS states. We identify the SL(2,Z)-noninvariant choice of the coproduct in the quantum toroidal algebra with the choice of supersymmetry subalgebra preserved by the BPS states and interpret wall crossing operators as Drinfeld twists of the coproduct. Kontsevich-Soibelman spectrum generator is then identified with Khoroshkin-Tolstoy universal R-matrix.

Abstract: On-shell diagrams are gauge invariant quantities which play an important role in the description of scattering amplitudes. Based on the principles of generalized unitarity, they are given by products of elementary three-point amplitudes where the kinematics of internal on-shell legs are determined by cut conditions. In the ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, the dual formulation for on-shell diagrams produces the same quantities as canonical forms on the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$. Most of the work in this direction has been devoted to the planar diagrams, which dominate in the large $N$ limit of gauge theories. On the mathematical side, planar on-shell diagrams correspond to cells of the positive Grassmannian $G_+(k,n)$ which have been very extensively studied in the literature in the past 20 years. In this paper, we focus on the non-planar on-shell diagrams which are relevant at finite $N$. In particular, we use the triplet formulation of Maximal-Helicity-Violating (MHV) on-shell diagrams to obtain certain regions in the Grassmannian $G(2,n)$. These regions are unions of positive Grassmannians with different orderings (referred to as oriented regions). We explore the features of these unions, and show that they are pseudo-positive geometries, in contrast to positive geometry of a single oriented region. For all non-planar diagrams which are \emph{internally planar} there always exists a strongly connected geometry, and for those that are \emph{irreducible}, there exists a geometry with no spurious facets. We also prove that the already known identity moves, square and sphere moves, form the complete set of identity moves for all MHV on-shell diagrams.

TL;DR: 研究发现，四维时空中带有多余旋组对称的沃尔夫费米子会受到非微扰全局’t-胡夫斯方程组的限制;这种限制可以通过具有偶极子和表面操作员的非局部体的异常对称保护拓扑量子场理论 (TQFT) 来消除。我们构造了一族最小的有限群 $K$ 来消除这种异常，通过在扩展群 $G_{m Tot}$ 中平凡化这些异常。每个沃尔夫费米子可以通过与其他 $K$ 对称的TQFT组合起来消除这种异常，与传统的安德erson-希格斯机制不同。

Abstract: Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\rm F}$ or Spin$\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \to K \to G_{\rm Tot} \to G \to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $ν_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\bf B \pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.

They are constructed from the characteristic functions of inclusion of algebras and can be viewed as regulators of the modular Hamiltonian of local algebras of QFT

Abstract: We analyze the recent article by Aydiner, Sucu, and Sakalli [Phys.\ Dark Univ.\ \textbf{50}, 102164 (2025)] [arXiv:2507.05145], which investigates the thermodynamics, tunneling kinetics, and weak-lensing signatures of a regular, magnetically charged nonlinear-electrodynamics black hole. While the study addresses interesting phenomenological questions, we identify several inconsistencies that compromise the validity of the reported results. Specifically, we note mutually contradictory values for the extremal charge separating the black hole and horizonless regimes, an inaccurate characterization of the Schwarzschild limit as an extremal configuration, a vacuum weak-deflection expansion that fails to recover the standard second-order Schwarzschild coefficient, and a sign error in the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected tunneling probability. We also highlight terminology regarding the nature of the horizonless solution and the physical interpretation of plasma parameters that requires correction. We clarify these points to ensure the robustness of the model's asymptotic limits.

Abstract: Real scalar fields, e.g. the axion, cannot condensate into stationary solitonic configurations to form star-like structures, eventually either dispersing or collapsing. However, by relaxing the stationarity condition on the metric, it has been shown that oscillatory solitonic solutions -- known as oscillatons -- exist. Oscillatons share several properties with boson stars, including comparable compactness and mass ranges. However, their time-dependent nature can lead to potentially discriminating observable signatures. In this work, we explore the observational properties of oscillatons. We find that stable oscillatory circular orbits exist, extending down to the center of the configuration, supporting the possibility of accretion disk structures within the star. We compute the deflection of light rays and verify that it is largely insensitive to the time dependence of the metric. Despite this, the oscillatory behavior of the redshift factor has a strong effect on the observed intensity profiles from accretion disks, producing a breathing-like image whose frequency depends on the mass of the scalar field. In fact, their oscillation period may lie within the observational windows of the Event Horizon Telescope for Sgr A$^{*}$ and M87$^{*}$, suggesting the possibility that this ``twinkling" behavior could be tested via near-horizon imaging of these objects.

Motivation: 研究引力理论中的 Quasi-static 假设和 Screened d'Alambertian 算子的适用性在有效场论框架下具有重要意义。

Method: 使用了洛伦兹规范下流方程（FRG）的方法对parity-even、对称的解析引力理论进行了分析，特别是在曲率平方截断下的标量-迹部分。

Result: 在 curvature-squared 截断下，标量-迹部分在 $ar{q}^4$ 阶自闭，通过分析欧几里得结果的解析延拓得到了 Screened d'Alambertian 算子，它是 $D_ar{l}=(1+ar{l}^2 ar{□})ar{□}$，具有出现的关联长度 $ar{l}$。该算子与 ADM 约束结构一致，不会在标量-迹部分引入自由传播的标量鬼粒子。还计算了其后退响应核并得到了静力格林函数在点源作用下的结果，当 $ar{l}ightarrow0$ 时，这对应于牛顿万有引力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了一个新的 Screened d'Alambertian 算子在 Quasi-static 距离下的引力理论应用，且没有引入标量鬼粒子，结果合理。

Abstract: A common assumption in the Effective Field Theories of gravity is that their quasi-static weak-field infrared limit yields the well-known second-order Poisson operator. We examine this limit for the universality class of parity-even, symmetric, analytic gravitational theories admitting a local derivative expansion using Lorentzian FRG methods. We find that, in the curvature-squared truncation, the scalar-trace sector self-closes at $\mathcal{O}(q^4),$ allowing the projected flow to be obtained by analytic continuation of the corresponding Euclidean result. This yields a screened d'Alambertian $D_\ell \equiv (1+\ell^2 \Box)\Box$ characterised by an emergent correlation length $\ell$. We show the operator is consistent with the ADM constraint structure and thus it does not introduce propagating scalar ghosts in the scalar-trace sector. We further derive its retarded response kernel and show its static-limit Green's function in response to a point source, which reduces to Newtonian gravity for $\ell \rightarrow 0$.

Abstract: We calculate the Feynman propagator at finite temperature in an Einstein universe for a neutral massive scalar field arbitrarily coupled to the Ricci curvature. Then, the propagator is used to determine the mean square fluctuation, the internal energy, and pressure of a scalar blackbody radiation as functions of the curvature coupling parameter $ξ$. By studying thermodynamics of massless scalar fields, we show that the only value of $ξ$ consistent with stable thermodynamic equilibrium at all temperatures and for all radii of the universe is $1/6$, i.e., corresponding to the conformal coupling. Moreover, if electromagnetic and neutrino radiations are present at the regime of high temperatures and/or large radii, we show that at least one scalar field must also be present to ensure thermodynamic stability.

Abstract: We calculate, up to the first-order in the black hole spin, the perihelion precession of a test particle in the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole using the perturbative Laplace-Runge-Lenz (LRL) vector method. To account for the dragging of inertial frames, we modify the LRL vector by incorporating a counteracting term in the angular momentum, which preserves the Keplerian orbit form to first order. We derive the standard Lense-Thirring precession result, leading to a transparent reinterpretation of known results, clarifying the role of frame dragging in LRL-based perturbation methods.

Conclusion:  important step in studying quantum effects in non-inertial frames with EM field, opens new doors for experimental research

Abstract: The Unruh effect remains a central topic in quantum field theory, although its direct experimental verification continues to be challenging. Recent efforts have therefore focused on indirect detection strategies in which the Unruh effect emerges through measurable physical processes. In this work, we extend a previously introduced detector model, originally formulated for a massless scalar field, to the electromagnetic field. We show that the decoherence decay rates differ between inertial and accelerated frames. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the characteristic exponential decay associated with the Unruh effect can be observed at lower accelerations than those considered in earlier studies.

Abstract: While the Unruh effect has traditionally been studied under the assumption of uniform acceleration, a simplification motivated by experimental considerations, it is not necessarily true for all non-inertial motions. We propose a novel approach for the indirect detection of the Unruh effect without relying on the former restriction. Previous studies have shown that probing the decoherence of an Unruh-DeWitt detector can significantly reduce the acceleration required for observing the effect by several orders of magnitude compared to earlier proposals. Building on this idea, we develop a theoretical framework describing a non-inertial observer equipped with a detector undergoing non-uniform, time-dependent acceleration. We show that, in a non-uniformly accelerated Rindler spacetime, the particle distribution perceived in the Minkowski vacuum acquires a time-dependent modification of the standard Unruh spectrum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum entanglement leads to a deformation of the Minkowski vacuum into squeezed states.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) scattering in strong gravitational fields is a central problem in GW lensing. Yet, conventional treatments based on asymptotic expansions suffer from divergences and become unreliable near the optical axis. In this work, we present a rigorous calculation of GW scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within the BH perturbation theory. By placing the observer at a finite distance and abandoning the asymptotic expansion of radial wave functions, we obtain a well-convergent partial-wave description without invoking any regularization scheme, thereby naturally resolving the divergences of the partial-wave series and the Poisson spot. We numerically computed the scattered GW waveforms by reconstructing the physical $+$ and $\times$ polarizations from the master variables, revealing the formation of the Poisson spot and pronounced wavefront distortions. A systematic comparison with conventional asymptotic approaches shows that they reproduce only qualitative features at large scattering angles and fail in the forward-scattering region. We further compare the frequency-domain transmission factors derived from the scattering formalism with those obtained from the Kirchhoff diffraction integral, finding significant discrepancies at high frequencies due to the latter's neglect of long-range gravitational effects and polarization evolution. Our results establish a stable and physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong-field regimes and provide a solid foundation for accurate modeling of GW lensing beyond standard approximations.

TL;DR: Charged Dirac quasinormal modes on Reissner-Nordström black holes in a cavity exhibit interesting behaviors depending on boundary conditions and background charges. Analytical and numerical results show symmetric spectra between boundary conditions and asymptotic behavior near the event horizon. A notable finding is that when the charge coupling is large, excited modes decay slower than the fundamental mode, highlighting anomalous dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quasinormal modes for charged particles in black hole cavities is crucial for probing quantum gravity and testing near-extremal black hole physics.

Method: Derived charged Dirac equations and two sets of Robin boundary conditions using vanishing energy flux principle. Performed both analytical and numerical calculations to compute the spectra.

Result: The quasinormal spectra demonstrate symmetry between boundary conditions. Near the event horizon, the spectra show specific asymptotic behaviors depending on the background charge. Anomalous decay patterns emerge when the charge coupling is significant.

Conclusion: The study reveals fundamental properties of charged Dirac modes in black hole cavities. These findings support the vanishing energy flux principle and have implications for understanding quantum gravity effects in diverse black hole backgrounds.

Abstract: We investigate charged Dirac quasinormal spectra on Reissner-Nordström black holes in a mirror-like cavity. For this purpose, we first derive charged Dirac equations, and \textit{two} sets of Robin boundary conditions following the vanishing energy flux principle. The Dirac spectra are then computed both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal a symmetry hidden in the Dirac spectra between two boundary conditions. Moreover, when the cavity is placed close to the event horizon $r_+$, we identify that, in the neutral background the Dirac spectra asymptote to $-(3/8+N/2)i$ [$-(1/8+N/2)i$] for the first [second] boundary condition; while in the charged background the real part of charged Dirac spectra asymptote to $qQ/r_+$ for both boundary conditions; where $N$ is the overtone number, $q$ and $Q$ are charges for the field and for the background. In particular, we uncover a striking anomalous decay pattern, $i.e.$ the excited modes decay \textit{slower} than the fundamental mode, when the charge coupling $qQ$ is large. Our results further illustrate the robustness of vanishing energy flux principle, which are applicable not only to anti-de Sitter black holes but also to black holes in a cavity.

Abstract: We investigate gravitational wave emission from periodic timelike orbits of a test particle around a loop quantum gravity-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability. Our results demonstrate that gravitational waves from periodic orbits provide a sensitive probe of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes in the strong-field regime.

Abstract: The reported evidence for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has motivated searches for extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropies. Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively. Our formulas can be used in forecasts or Bayesian analysis pipelines.

Abstract: We present a fully analytical method for calculating the key parameters of a Kerr-like gravitational shadow, including its horizontal and vertical diameters, $D_X$ and $D_Y$, the coordinates of its center $X_{C}$, the average radius $\bar{R}$, the deviation from sphericity $δC$, and the mean deviation from the Kerr shadow $δK$. Developed within the framework of perturbation theory, this approach yields all characteristic parameters as simple polynomial expressions with an accuracy of $\sim a^5$, where $a$ is the Kerr spin parameter. This eliminates the need for repeated numerical integration of cumbersome parametric equations. Furthermore, our derived formulas account for the effects of a plasma medium - a feature of particular relevance given the prospect of multi-frequency astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We propose conformal invariance as a fundamental symmetry governing cosmological particle creation from vacuum fluctuations, employing a phenomenological approach with an ideal fluid action to address the long-standing back-reaction problem. We demonstrate that particle production cannot emerge from classical vacua but must originate from a quantum vacuum at zero scale factor, with the transition surface constituting a light-like rather than space-like hypersurface. This implies that particles are created on the light cone and remain causally connected, with their apparent simultaneity being illusory. Our model requires an open Universe ($k=0, -1$) and reconceptualizes the Big Bang as a detonation wave propagating through quantum vacuum at the speed of light.

Abstract: We revisit the structure of higher-derivative spin-2 theories from the perspective of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We show that a minimal GUP deformation of the Fierz-Pauli (FP) action induces a higher-derivative kinetic operator equivalent, at quadratic order, to the spin-2 sector of Stelle's curvature-squared gravity. Via an auxiliary-field formulation, the GUP-generated higher derivative can be recast as a Lee-Wick (LW) partner of the spin-2. We then demonstrate that the same GUP deformation is compatible with the Galileon structure governing the helicity-0 mode in dRGT massive gravity. The GUP corrections reduce to total derivatives, preserving the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost. Our results unify GUP models, LW quantization, and curvature-squared gravity into a single framework, in which the higher-derivative spin-2 ghost is rendered non-propagating while the nonlinear massive completion remains intact.

Motivation: Black holes are among the most fascinating objects in astrophysics, and their thermodynamic properties provide valuable insights into their behavior and evolution.

Method: Analytic treatment and numerical verification were employed to study the encoding of thermodynamic information in black hole images. The Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole was used as a case study.

Result: Black hole images encode both phase transition and ensemble information. In the isothermal ensemble, additional temperature information is present. The phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which is observed in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information arise from fundamental differences in isobaric and isothermal evolution. Image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius in isobaric evolution but exhibits nonmonotonic behavior in isothermal evolution. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between isobaric and isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius, whose relative ordering with small and large black hole radii at phase transition supports only two of the three logical possibilities. Image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitative differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information.

Conclusion: This research broadens the observational methods for studying black hole thermodynamic properties and introduces a new framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems by examining phase transitions and nonmonotonic evolution together.

Abstract: We investigate how black hole images (shadows and accretion-disk images) encode thermodynamic evolution information across different ensembles, using the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole as an illustrative example. Through analytic treatment and numerical verification, we demonstrate that these images encode not only phase transition information but also ensemble information, including additional temperature information in the isothermal ensemble. Phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which we prove occurs in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information originates from a fundamental difference between isobaric and isothermal evolution: image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius along isobars, whereas it exhibits nonmonotonic behavior along isotherms. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish isobaric from isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, the nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius whose relative ordering with the small- and large-black hole radii at the phase transition admits three logical possibilities. Our analysis reveals that only two of these possibilities are physically realized, separated by a critical reduced temperature. Furthermore, image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitatively differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information. These results not only enrich the set of observational avenues for probing black hole thermodynamic properties, but also introduce a new paradigm. This paradigm studies phase transitions in conjunction with nonmonotonic evolution, providing a useful framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems.

Conclusion: 压力不均匀性对中子星结构有显著影响，需结合不同的物理模型更全面理解中子星内部结构。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of pressure anisotropy on the structural and geometric properties of neutron stars within general relativity, focusing primarily on the phenomenological Bowers-Liang (BL) model, and comparing selected results with a quasi-local prescription. Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\;M_\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints.
  To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\mathcal{C}_{\max}\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $λ_{\rm BL}\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the evaporation of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole. Within a semiclassical framework, we compute the energy emission of Hawking radiation by introducing a massless scalar field as a test field, considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled cases. For the minimally coupled case, we find that loop quantum gravity effects become crucial at the late stage of the evaporation process, causing the emission rate to slow down and eventually terminate, leading to the formation of a black hole remnant. A quasi-normal mode analysis indicates the stability of this remnant. For the non-minimally coupled case, we show that the fate of the black hole strongly depends on the value of the coupling constant $ξ$. Focusing on the cases $ξ=\pm1$, we find that for $ξ=1$, the energy emission rate accelerates at late times and no remnant is formed, whereas for $ξ=-1$, the emission rate slows down and eventually terminates, resulting in a stable black hole remnant, as supported by the corresponding quasi-normal mode analysis.

Conclusion: QSN理论在不同情况下可能导致自由度数量的差异，这对理论的后续研究具有指导意义。

Abstract: We study the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) in quadratic scalar-nonmetricity (QSN) theory, whose Lagrangian is the linear combination of five quadratic nonmetricity invariants with coefficients depending on a dynamical scalar field. Working in the coincident gauge, we perform the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and classify QSN models into distinct cases according to the numbers of their primary constraints. For cases that are physically viable in the sense that both a consistent cosmological background and tensor gravitational waves exist, we count the number of degrees of freedom based on two approaches. First we investigate the linear cosmological perturbations around an FLRW background. Then we perform a Dirac-Bergmann Hamiltonian constraint analysis to count the number of DOFs at the nonperturbative level. We focus on three representative cases. In case II, both the perturbative and nonperturbative approaches yield the same result, which indicates that the theory propagates 10 degrees of freedom. In contrast, in cases V and VI, the Hamiltonian analysis yields 8 degrees of freedom, while only 6 and 5 modes are visible at linear order in perturbations, respectively. This indicates that additional modes are strongly coupled on cosmological backgrounds.

Abstract: A set of effective equations for the gauge-invariant gravitational perturbations in the interior of a spherically symmetric, non-rotating black hole is derived within the framework of hybrid loop quantum cosmology. The quantum zero-mode of the Hamiltonian constraint, obtained from a perturbative gauge-invariant canonical analysis, is explicitly imposed on a class of quantum states whose wavefunctions factorize into a background and a perturbative part, related through a geometric relational variable. These states naturally describe regimes with small perturbative backreaction and lead to an effective Hamiltonian and associated dynamics for the perturbations. The resulting equations take the form of Regge-Wheeler equations modified by expectation values of the quantum black hole geometry, providing a clear characterization of quantum corrections to the classical description of the black hole interior. This framework opens the way to investigating hybrid loop quantum gravity effects in the propagation of gravitational waves.

Abstract: We analyze the influence of gravitational waves on a Sagnac interferometer formed by the interference of two counter-propagating beams traversing a closed spatial loop. In addition to the well-known Sagnac phase shift, we identify an additional contribution originating from a relative rotation in the polarization vectors. We formulate this effect as a gravitational holonomy associated to the internal Lorentz group. The magnitude of both effects is computed due to gravitational waves generated by a localized source far from the detector, at leading order in the inverse distance. For freely falling observers, the phase shift is zero and the polarization rotation becomes the dominant effect.

Motivation: Current observations from CMB and large-scale structure have increased precision, prompting the study of alternative gravitational theories beyond standard general relativity, such as scalar-torsion gravity, to explain inflationary dynamics.

Method: Analyzed $f(T,φ)$ theories using slow-roll approximation, deriving scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio analytically, then numerically relaxing assumptions.

Result: Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,φ)$ gravity aligns with Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck data, showing a preferred scalar spectral index shift and unique tensor signatures.

Conclusion: The study confirms that Higgs-like inflation in scalar-torsion gravity is viable, offering new insights into inflationary physics within an extended gravitational framework.

Abstract: We study Higgs-like inflation in the framework of scalar-torsion gravity, focusing on the general class of $f(T,φ)$ theories in which gravitation is mediated by torsion rather than curvature. Motivated by the increasing precision of cosmic microwave background and large-scale-structure observations, we examine whether Higgs-like inflation remains compatible with current data in this extended gravitational setting. Working within the slow-roll approximation, we analyze the inflationary dynamics both analytically and numerically. In the dominant-coupling regime we derive closed-form expressions for the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds, and we subsequently relax this assumption by numerically solving the slow-roll equations. Confrontation with the latest constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck shows that Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,φ)$ gravity is fully consistent with current bounds, naturally accommodating the preferred shift in the scalar spectral index and leading to distinctive tensor-sector signatures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this study we obtain interior solutions and investigate structural properties of isotropic compact stars in the framework of four-dimensional regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity. For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the five-dimensional Proca star under gravity with the infinite tower of higher curvature corrections. We find that when the coupling constant exceeds a critical value, solutions with a frequency approaching zero appear. In the finite-order corrections case $n=2$ (Gauss-Bonnet gravity), the matter field and energy density diverge near the origin as $ω\to 0$. In contrast, for $n\geq 3$, the divergence is efficiently suppressed, both the field and the energy density remain finite everywhere, and both the matter field and energy density remain finite everywhere. In the limit $ω\to 0$, a class of horizonless frozen star solutions emerges, which are referred to ``frozen stars". Importantly, frozen stars contain neither curvature singularities nor event horizons. These frozen stars develop a critical horizon at a finite radius $r_c$, where $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ approach zero. The frozen star is indistinguishable from that of an extremal black hole outside $r_c$, and its compactness can reach the extremal black hole value.

Abstract: We calculate the $f$-mode frequency and tidal overlap of quark stars using the full general relativity method. We verify the universal relations obtained from conventional neutron stars in the case of quark stars and explore the cases with different values of parameters of the quark star equation of state. Since quark stars have significantly smaller radii compared to neutron stars in the low mass range, the relation between the tidal defomability and $f$-mode frequency times radius is different for neutron stars and quark stars. This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase. We calculate the tidal dephasing caused by this effect in the post-Newtonian method and find that it can not be detected even by the next-generation gravitational wave detectors.

Abstract: Gravitational wave echoes offer a unique probe of the near-horizon structure of astrophysical black holes, beyond the standard ''black hole spectroscopy''. Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data.

Abstract: With an intent to examine the combined effect of non-linear electrodynamics (NED) and dark matter (DM), we obtain a static and spherically symmetric solution with the black hole (BH) magnetically charged and immersed in the Hernquist DM halo (MHDM). The position of the event horizon $r_h$ and the critical impact parameter $b_m$ are then probed to gauge the extent of influence magnetic charge $g$ and halo parameters $α$, $β$ have on them. A recurring outcome of our analysis with respect to different BH observables is the nullification of competing effects of charge and halo parameters, leading to observables obtaining values equal to those for a Schwarzschild BH. This is also observed for $r_h$ and $b_m$. We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring. Interestingly, we find combinations of charge and halo parameters that leave the deflection angle unchanged from the Schwarzschild case, thereby leading to a situation where an MHDM BH and a Schwarzschild BH become indistinguishable. Similar results are also observed for lensing observables. Finally, utilizing observations related to the angular diameter of super-massive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ and employing the $χ^2$ test, we extract bounds on $g$, $α$, and $β$ signifying the viability of our BH model as an SMBH.

Abstract: We investigate the oscillation of the Kasner exponent $p_t$ near critical point of the hairy black holes dual to holographic superfluid and reveal a clear inverse periodicity $f(T_c/(T_c-T))$ in a large region below the critical temperature. We first introduce the fourth-power term with a coefficient $λ$ to adjust the oscillatory behavior of the Kasner exponent $p_t$ near the critical point. Importantly, we show that the nonlinear coefficient $λ$ provides accurate control of this periodicity: a positive $λ$ stretches the region, while a negative $λ$ compresses it. By contrast, the influence of another coefficient $τ$ is more concentrated in regions away from the critical point. This work provides a new perspective for understanding the complex dynamical structure inside black holes and extends the actively control from the fourth- and sixth-power term into the black hole interior region.

Motivation: 研究量子引力模型时需要解决Birkhoff定理的应用问题以及如何将平面波近似扩展到非平面几何，从而统一描述黑洞和宇宙学。

Abstract: The absence of Birkhoff's theorem in effective quantum gravity models leads to a fundamental ambiguity in the vacuum sector, where a priori no unique vacuum solution exists. As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework.

Abstract: We investigate the strong gravitational lensing and shadow properties of the black hole in the context of bumblebee gravity, characterized by a global monopole charge $κη^2$ and a Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $γ$. We compute the deflection angles of light passing near the black hole in strong deflection limit, and estimate key lensing observables, including relativistic Einstein rings, absolute magnifications, image separations, and flux ratios, for astrophysical black holes. The black hole shadow is analyzed using the apparent angular size $θ_{\rm Shadow} = 2\,θ_{\infty}$ in the limiting photon orbit. Furthermore, we study the modification of the shadow structure in the presence of a radially infalling, optically thin accretion flow within a generalized framework. Our results indicate that both the global monopole charge and Lorentz-violating parameters significantly influence the photon sphere, lensing observables, and shadow morphology, potentially providing observational signatures for testing bumblebee gravity in the strong-field regime.

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a well-motivated non-particle candidate for dark matter, requiring an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small inflationary scales consistent with observational constraints. In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\,M_\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\rm PBH}\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.

This includes recent ``positivity bounds" on EFT coefficients, which are the low-energy signatures of causality and unitarity in the UV.

Abstract: The High Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-02) is a payload of the second China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-02), designed and built by the Italian Limadou collaboration. Its purpose is to detect cosmic rays and trapped particles of radiation belts, in the kinetic energy range 3-100 MeV for electrons, 30-200 MeV for protons. HEPD-02 is the first space detector to use a tracking detector based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). The MAPS provides high spatial resolution, low noise, increased robustness, and low production costs.

Abstract: The PandaX-xT is a next-generation experiment with broad scientific goals, including the search for dark matter, Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay, and astrophysical neutrinos, using a dual-phase time projection chamber with about 43 tons of liquid xenon. A new cryogenics system of the PandaX-xT is described in this paper. It is developed to handle large mass of liquid xenon efficiently and safely, including two cooling towers for normal operation and one liquid-nitrogen coil for emergency case. Each cooling tower equipped with an AL600 Gifford-McMahon cryocooler features a 1300 W heater, specifically designed to maintain the cold finger's temperature at the desired setpoint. The performance of the cooling tower and the coil has been tested. The cryogenics system with two cooling towers has achieved about 1900~W cooling power at 178~K. The liquid nitrogen coil provides emergency cooling power of more than 1500~W at liquid xenon temperature. For the prototype of a 1-tonne liquid xenon detector, the fluctuation of xenon saturated vapor pressure remains below 1 kPa over one month, while the pressure is around 210~kPa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient, real-time data processing in optical TPCs drives the development of an unsupervised anomaly detection method.

Method: An unsupervised reconstruction-based approach using a convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images is employed. Localized reconstruction residuals are used to identify anomalies, followed by thresholding and spatial clustering to extract compact ROIs.

Result: The best configuration achieves 93.0% signal intensity reconstruction while discarding 97.8% of the image area, with inference times of ~25 ms per frame on consumer GPUs. This highlights the effectiveness of properly designed training objectives for reconstruction-based anomaly detection in optical TPCs.

Conclusion: Pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a robust, transparent, and detector-agnostic baseline for efficient online data reduction in optical TPCs, enabling effective anomaly detection and ROI extraction.

Abstract: Optical-readout Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) produce megapixel-scale images whose fine-grained topological information is essential for rare-event searches, but whose size challenges real-time data selection. We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU. The results demonstrate that careful design of the training objective is critical for effective reconstruction-based anomaly detection and that pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a transparent and detector-agnostic baseline for online data reduction in optical TPCs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) system for low-background beta radiation measurements. The system consists of a TPC with two-dimensional-strip readout Micromegas and an anti-coincidence detector with readout pads for cosmic ray veto. The detector system utilize an AGET-based waveform sampling system for data acquisition.
  The beta detection capability of the system was verified through experimental test using $^{90}$Sr beta source. Additionally, a dedicated simulation program based on Geant4 was developed to model the entire detection process, including responses to both the beta source and background radiation. Simulation results were compared with experimental data for both beta and background samples, showing good agreements.
  The simulation samples were utilized to optimize and train classification models for beta and background discrimination. By applying the selected model into test data, the system achieved a background rate of 0.49 $\rm cpm/cm^2$ while retaining more than 55% of $^{90}$Sr beta signals within a 7 cm diameter detection region. Further analysis revealed that approximately 70% of the background originates from environmental gamma radiation, while the remaining contribution mainly comes from intrinsic radioactivity of detector materials, particularly the FR-4 based field cage and readout plane. Based on the knowledge gained from the experiments and simulations, an optimization of the TPC system has been proposed, with simulation predicting a potential reduction of the background rate to 0.0012 $\rm cpm/cm^2$.

Method: The abstract describes a method to represent the instrument's response using a discrete DRM and derives metrics from it, focusing on scintillators and PCTs.

Result: The counting response matrix (DRM) is developed, enabling calculation of effective area and flash effective area by relating detector histograms to incident particles.

Conclusion: This framework provides a foundation for analyzing and designing radiation detectors by connecting their response characteristics to physical parameters.

Abstract: A Detector Response Matrix (DRM) is a discrete representation of an instrument's Detector Response Function (DRF), which quantifies how many discrete energy depositions occur in a detector volume for a given distribution of particles incident on the detector. For simple radiation detectors that can count such energy depositions (such as scintillators, Proportional Counter Tubes (PCTs), etc), we consider the ideal counting DRF, $\mathbf{G}_\varphi (E_\mathrm{in}, E_\mathrm{dep})$, which relates the detector's counting histogram (number of energy depositions within a given channel) to an incident particles characterization, $\varphi$ (e.g. incident flux, fluence, intensity). From the counting DRF we can derive the counting DRM, the effective area, and the flash effective area (which measures the total energy deposited in the detector from a large, instantaneous fluence).

Abstract: We demonstrate the spontaneous formation of acoustic black holes in exciton-polariton condensates triggered by discontinuous Riemann-type initial conditions. Starting from a quasi-conservative Gross-Pitaevskii model, we show that nonlinear dispersive shock waves naturally generate spatial regions where the local flow velocity exceeds the speed of sound, creating a self-induced transonic interface that functions as an acoustic horizon. Unlike previous schemes relying on externally engineered potentials or pump-loss landscapes, our approach reveals that the intrinsic nonlinear hydrodynamics of polariton fluids alone can lead to horizon formation. Using Whitham modulation theory and numerical simulations, we characterize the transition between subsonic and supersonic regimes and estimate the corresponding surface gravity and Hawking temperature. This mechanism opens a new route toward realizing polariton black holes and studying analogue gravitational effects, including Hawking-like emission, in Bose-Einstein quantum liquids.

TL;DR: New strategy for incorporating complex oxide nanoparticles into mesoporous thin films improves device performance and functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a novel approach to integrating complex oxide nanoparticles into mesoporous thin films, which is relevant for advancing devices such as energy conversion systems, solid oxide fuel cells, spintronic devices, and neuromorphic memristor networks.

Method: The researchers combined ordered mesoporous thin films with complex oxide nanoparticles using a 3D pores network and pulsed laser deposition. They studied various parameters such as structural, magnetic, magnetocaloric, and electrical transport properties through different samples with varying deposition times and substrates.

Result: The results demonstrate the successful synthesis of La0.88Sr0.12MnO3 nanoparticles within the pores, confirmed by cross-section elemental mapping. X-ray reflectometry shows controlled filling of the pores, maintaining accessible porosity. The magnetic behavior indicates weakly interacting ferromagnetic nanoparticles, and the approach offers a scalable fabrication method for complex oxide arrays with controlled size and ordering.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust methodology for fabricating complex oxide nanoparticles with controlled architectures, opening new possibilities for applications in various advanced materials and devices.

Abstract: We combine for the first time the properties of ordered mesoporous thin films and complex oxide nanoparticles in the design of new heterostructures, taking advantage of the accessible tridimensional pores network. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of synthesizing La0.88Sr0.12MnO3 inside the pores of a mesoporous SiO2 thin film, using pulsed laser deposition. In order to understand the filling process, a set of samples were deposited for three different deposition times, on mesoporous and non-mesoporous SiO2 substrates. Their structural, magnetic, magnetocaloric and electrical transport properties were studied. All the results evidence the presence of the manganite compound inside the pores, which was confirmed by cross-section elemental mapping. X-ray reflectometry shows that it is possible to control the filling of the pores, keeping some accessible porosity. The magnetic behavior suggests the presence of weakly interacting ferromagnetic nanoparticles inside the pores. We provide here a successful strategy for the fabrication of complex oxide nanoparticles arrays with highly controlled size and ordering. Their easy incorporation into micro and nanofabrication procedures unveils direct implications in the field of interfaces and nanoparticle devices as diverse as energy conversion systems, solid oxide fuel cells, spintronics and neuromorphic memristor networks.

### [97] [Resonant Magneto-phonon Emission by Supersonic Electrons in Ultra-high Mobility Two-dimensional System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23822)

TL;DR: Resonant acoustic phonon scattering in a high-mobility 2D electron gas was investigated under DC current with drift velocity near the speed of sound. Phonon-induced resistance oscillations were observed above this threshold, contrasting with suppression in the subsonic regime when cooled unless enhanced by quasi-elastic scattering. The findings match theoretical predictions requiring a dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant of g²=0.0016, and the magnetic field amplified phonon emission through Landau level quantization, resulting in sharp oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research seeks to understand how acoustic phonons influence transport properties in high-mobility 2D systems, particularly under conditions where drift velocity approaches the speed of sound.

Method: Experiments were conducted in the temperature range 10 mK to 3.9 K, measuring transport properties such as resistivity under DC current application, analyzing phonon-induced oscillations, and examining the effects of magnetic field quantization on Landau levels.

Result: The study identifies clear phonon-induced resistance oscillations when the drift velocity exceeds the speed of sound. These oscillations exhibit weak temperature dependence and align with theoretical predictions for strong non-linear transport, particularly when electron-phonon coupling is dimensionless (g²=0.0016). Additionally, the applied magnetic field enhances phonon emission effects through Landau level quantization, leading to pronounced and sharp resonances.

Conclusion: The research confirms that resonant acoustic phonon scattering can lead to significant enhancements in electrical resistance when the drift velocity surpasses the speed of sound, providing insights into the interplay between charge transport and lattice vibrations.

Abstract: We investigate resonant acoustic phonon scattering in the magneto-resistivity of an ultra-high mobility two-dimensional electron gas system subject to DC current in the temperature range 10 mK to 3.9 K. For a DC current density of $\sim$1.1 A/m, the induced carrier drift velocity $v_{drift}$ becomes equal to the speed of sound $s \sim$ 3 km/s. When $v_{drift} \gtrsim s$ very strong resonant features with only weak temperature dependence are observed and identified as phonon-induced resistance oscillations at and above the "sound barrier". Their behavior contrasts with that in the subsonic regime ($v_{drift} < s$) where resonant acoustic phonon scattering is strongly suppressed when the temperature is reduced unless amplified with quasi-elastic inter-Landau-level scattering. Our observations are compared to recent theoretical predictions from which we can extract a dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant of $g^{2}$=0.0016 for the strong non-linear transport regime. We find evidence for a predicted oscillation phase change ' effect on traversing the "sound barrier". Crossing the "sound barrier" fundamentally alters the resulting phonon emission processes, and the applied magnetic field results in pronounced and sharp resonant phonon emission due to Landau level quantization.

Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of modified Dirac Hamiltonians with an altermagnetic mass term and reveal a novel mechanism for realizing altermagnetic Weyl semimetals. Unlike the conventional Wilson mass, the altermagnetic mass drives direct transitions between nontrivial Chern phases of opposite sign and fundamentally reshapes the band inversion surface. By extending this framework to three dimensions, we construct a minimal lattice model that hosts pairs of Weyl nodes as well as coexisting helical Fermi arcs with opposite chirality on the same surface, which is a phenomenon not found in conventional magnetic Weyl semimetals. We further propose a practical scheme to realize these phases in multilayer structures of 2-dimensional Rashba metal with engineered $d$-wave altermagnetic order. Our results deepen the theoretical understanding of mass terms in Dirac systems and provide concrete guidelines for the experimental detection and realization of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals.

Abstract: We show that proximitizing an altermagnet to a non-Hermitian topological insulator provides a powerful mechanism for engineering non-Hermitian higher-order topological phases. The altermagnetic order opens a gap at the topological edge states and drives a topological phase transition from a first-order to a second-order topological phase. When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order. Consequently, both edge and corner modes become directionally controllable. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for realizing and tuning skin-topological phenomena in non-Hermitian higher-order topological systems.

Abstract: We study the full distribution of the zero-temperature Hall conductivity in a lattice model of the IQHE using the Kubo formula across disorder realizations. Near the localization-delocalization transition, the conductivity exhibits heavy-tailed fluctuations characterized by a power-law decay with exponent $α\approx 2.3$--$2.5$, indicating a finite mean but a divergent variance. The heavy tail persists across a range of system sizes, correlation lengths of the disorder potential and fillings.

Abstract: Two-dimensional non-interacting fermions without any anti-unitary symmetries generically get Anderson localized in the presence of disorder. In contrast, topological superconductors with their inherent particle-hole symmetry can host a thermal metallic phase, which is non-universal and depends on the nature of microscopic disorder. In this work, we demonstrate that in the presence of geometric disorders, such as random bond dilution, a robust metal can emerge in a Chern insulator with particle-hole symmetry. The metallic phase is realized when the broken links are weakly stitched via concomitant insertion of $π$ fluxes in the plaquettes. These nucleate low-energy manifolds, which can provide percolating conduction pathways for fermions to elude localization. This diffusive metal, unlike those in superconductors, can carry charge current and even anomalous Hall current. We investigate the transport properties and show that while the topological insulator to Anderson insulator transition exhibits the expected Dirac universality, the metal insulator transition displays a different critical exponent $ν\approx 2$ compared to a disordered topological superconductor, where $ν\approx 1.4$. Our work emphasizes the unique role of geometric disorder in engineering novel phases and their transitions in topological quantum matter.

Abstract: Conventional spintronic mechanisms, such as spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques based on the spin current, rely on breaking time-reversal symmetry to manipulate magnetic moments. In contrast, for spatially separated dual spin currents, the time-reversal-invariant vector chirality emerges as a critical factor governing magnetization dynamics. Here, we investigate field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in an altermagnet RuO2/ferromagnet/heavy metal Pt trilayer, driven by chiral dual spin currents (CDSC). We demonstrate that the chirality of these dual spin currents acts as the deterministic role in breaking out-of-plane symmetry. Leveraging the intrinsic spin-splitting effect of the d-wave altermagnet to generate an x-polarized spin component, the interplay of non-collinear spin currents from two adjacent layers induces a helical magnetic texture within the intermediate layer. The resulting intralayer exchange coupling manifests as an effective in-plane magnetic field, facilitating deterministic switching. This distinct physical picture, validated by switching measurements and micromagnetic simulations, reveals that the switching polarity is dictated by chirality rather than charge current polarity. Characterized by the novel symmetry and low power consumption, CDSC offers a promising paradigm for next-generation high-performance spintronic architectures.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the study of linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, employing the semi-classical transport theory. By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration.

Abstract: Interfacial reconstruction between two-dimensional (2D) materials and metal substrates fundamentally governs heterostructure properties, yet conventional flat substrates fail to capture the continuous crystallographic landscape. Here, we overcome this topological limitation using non-Euclidean interfaces-curved 2D graphene-copper surfaces as a model system-to traverse the infinite spectrum of lattice orientations. By integrating multimodal microscopy with a deep-learning-enhanced dimensional upscaling framework, we translate 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) contrast into quantitative three-dimensional (3D) morphologies with accurate facet identification. Coupling these observations with machine-learning-assisted density functional theory, we demonstrate that reconstruction is governed by a unified thermodynamic mechanism where high-index facets correspond to specific local minima in the surface energy landscape. This work resolves the long-standing complexity of graphene-copper faceting and establishes non-Euclidean surface topologies as a generalizable paradigm for decoding and controlling interfacial reconstruction in diverse metal-2D material systems.

Abstract: Magnetic multipole moments beyond dipoles have emerged as key descriptors of unconventional electromagnetic responses in crystalline solids. However, a gauge-invariant bulk expression for orbital magnetic multipole moments has remained elusive, hindering a unified understanding of their physical consequences. Here we formulate a gauge-invariant expression for the orbital magnetic octupole moment in periodic crystals and investigate its behavior in a minimal model of $d$-wave altermagnets. We show that the orbital magnetic octupole is naturally linked to a higher-rank Hall response induced by spatially nonuniform electric fields, leading to a generalized Středa-type relation. Finally, we demonstrate that such a Hall response can arise even when symmetry forbids the conventional anomalous Hall effect against uniform electric fields, thereby providing an illustrative response characteristic to altermagnets.

Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit spin-split electronic band structures despite having zero net magnetization, making them attractive for field-free spintronic applications. In this work, we show that a finite rectangular altermagnetic sample can acquire a net spin polarization purely due to its geometry. This effect arises from the interplay between the anisotropic, spin-resolved Fermi contours of an altermagnet and the discrete sampling of momentum space imposed by unequal sample dimensions. By explicitly counting occupied states, we demonstrate that rectangular samples with $L_x \neq L_y$ host a finite spin polarization, which vanishes in the symmetric limit $L_x=L_y$ and in the thermodynamic limit. We further show that this geometry-induced spin polarization can be directly probed in transport measurements. In the tunneling regime, the ratio of spin to charge conductance exhibits characteristic square-like patterns as a function of sample dimensions, faithfully reflecting the underlying spin polarization. In addition, transport across ferromagnet--altermagnet--ferromagnet junctions reveals an asymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to reversal of the Zeeman field, providing an independent transport signature of the finite spin polarization. Our results establish geometry as an effective control parameter for spin polarization in altermagnets and suggest a viable route for exploiting finite-size effects in mesoscopic altermagnetic spintronic devices.

Abstract: Valleytronics is a rapidly advancing field that explores the use of the valley degree of freedom in electronic systems to encode and process information. It relies on electronic states with spin valley locking, first predicted and observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2. However, very few bulk materials have been reported to host spin valley locked electronic states. In this work, we present experimental evidence for a predicted, unique spin valley locked electronic state generated by Bi zigzag chains in the layered compound BaMnBi2. We observe remarkable quantum transport properties in this material, including a stacked quantum Hall effect (QHE) and a nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). From the analysis of the QHE, we identify a spin valley degeneracy of four, while the NLHE provides supporting evidence for the anticipated valley contrasted Berry curvature, a typical signature of a spin valley locked state. This spin valley locked state contrasts with that observed in the sister compound BaMnSb2, where the degeneracy is two. This difference arises from significant variations in their orthorhombic crystal structures and spin orbit coupling. These findings establish a new platform for exploring coupled spin valley physics in bulk materials and highlight its potential for valleytronic device applications.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens new possibilities for scalable and precise atom-level fabrication using inverted-mode STM, enhancing its technological potential.

Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) enables fabrication of atomically precise structures with unique properties and growing technological potential. However, reproducible manipulation of covalently bonded atoms requires control over the atomic configuration of both sample and probe - a longstanding challenge in STM. Here, we introduce inverted-mode STM, an approach that enables mechanically controlled chemical reactions for atomically precise fabrication. Tailored molecules on a Si(100) surface image the probe apex, and the usual challenge of understanding the probe structure is effectively solved. The molecules can also react with the probe, with the two sides of the tunnel junction acting as reagents positioned with sub-angstrom precision. This allows abstraction or donation of atoms from or to the probe apex. We demonstrate this by using a novel alkynyl-terminated molecule to reproducibly abstract hydrogen atoms from the probe. The approach is expected to extend to other elements and moieties, opening a new avenue for scalable atomically precise fabrication.

Abstract: Nanoscale hot spots forming tens of nanometers beneath the gate in advanced FinFET and HEMT devices drive heat transport into a non-Fourier regime, challenging conventional (Fourier-based) finite-element (FEM) analyses and complicating future thermal-aware chip design. Molecular dynamics (MD) naturally captures ballistic transport and phonon nonequilibrium, but has not been applied to hot-spot problems due to computational cost. Here, we perform the first MD simulations of hot-spot heat transfer across ballistic-diffusive regimes and benchmark them against FEM. We find that FEM using bulk thermal conductivity $κ_0$ significantly underestimates hot-spot temperature, even when the channel thickness is ~10 times the phonon mean free path, indicating persistent non-Fourier effects. We introduce a size-dependent "best" conductivity, $κ_{\mathrm{best}}$, using which FEM can reproduce MD hot-spot temperatures with high fidelity. We further decompose the MD-extracted thermal resistance into: (i) diffusive spreading, (ii) cross-plane ballistic, (iii) heat-carrier selective heating, and (iv) residual 3D ballistic-spreading resistances, and quantify each contribution. The resulting framework offers a practical route to embed non-Fourier physics into FEM for hot-spot prediction, reliability assessment, and thermally aware design of next-generation transistors.

Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) in magnetic materials arises from spin-exchange coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons, representing a challenging many-body open-quantum problem. Here we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of MR within an open-quantum-system framework by solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a hybrid system of free electrons and local moments using the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Our approach reveals both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic MR as consequences of temperature- and field-dependent spin decoherence, encompassing spin relaxation and dephasing. In particular, the resistance associated with spin decoherence is governed by the order parameters of magnetic materials, such as the magnetization in ferromagnets and the Néel vector in antiferromagnets. This theory deepens the fundamental understanding of MR and offers guidance for interpreting and designing experiments on magnetic materials.

Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are a fertile ground for exploring quantum geometric phenomena, with Berry curvature and its first moment, the Berry curvature dipole, playing a central role in their electronic response. These geometric properties influence electronic transport and result in the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects, and are typically controlled using static electric fields or strain. However, the possibility of modulating quantum geometric quantities in real-time remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic modulation of Berry curvature and its moments, as well as the generation of a pseudo-electric field using time-dependent strain. By placing heterostructures on a membrane, we introduce oscillatory strain together with an in-plane AC electric field and measure Hall signals that are modulated at linear combinations of the frequencies of strain and electric field. Our measurements reveal modulation of Berry curvature and its first moment. Notably, we provide direct experimental evidence of pseudo-electric field that results in an unusual dynamic strain-induced Hall response. This approach opens up a new pathway for controlling quantum geometry on demand, moving beyond conventional static perturbations. The pseudo-electric field provides a framework for external electric field-free anomalous Hall response and opens new avenues for probing the topological properties.

Abstract: Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.

Abstract: We investigate the electronic transport properties of a superconductor-quantum dot-superconductor Josephson junction coupled to a ferromagnetic metal reservoir in the presence of an external magnetic field. The device is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, whose complex eigenvalues encode the energy (real part) and the broadening (imaginary part) of the Andreev quasi-bound states. When extending the Andreev current formula to the non-Hermitian case, a novel contribution arises that is proportional to the phase derivative of the levels broadening. This term becomes particularly relevant in the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectrum, but its experimental detection is not straightforward. We identify optimal Andreev spectrum configurations where this novel current contribution can be clearly highlighted, and we outline an experimental protocol for its detection. We point out that the phase dependence in the levels imaginary part originates from the breaking of a time-reversal-like symmetry. In particular, spectral configurations in the broken phase of the symmetry and without EPs can be obtained, where this novel contribution can be easily resolved. The proposed protocol would allow to probe for the first time a fingerprint of non-Hermiticity in open junctions that is not strictly related to the presence of EPs.

TL;DR: An altermagnetic material (KV₂Se₂O) with d-wave spin order exhibits checkerboard antiferromagnetic order and density-wave modulation in real space, alongside momentum-resolved spin splitting in the band structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of altermagnetism, a material combining ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic properties, has sparked interest in understanding its unique spin response and potential applications. To fully exploit its properties, specifically the dual real-space and momentum-space spin behaviors, spin-resolved measurements at atomic scales are needed, making this work significant in advancing the field of layered 2D materials and spintronics.

Method: The researchers utilize helical edge states from a higher-order topological insulator for spin sensing in spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy. This allows them to simultaneously observe the material's real-space spin order and its momentum-space spin splitting.

Result: The experiments reveal KV₂Se₂O's d-wave spin order with unidirectional, spin-polarized excitations arising from its crystal symmetry. The data confirms the existence of checkerboard antiferromagnetic order and density-wave lattices in real space, complemented by momentum-dependent spin splitting in the band structure.

Conclusion: This study paves the way for probing and controlling spin response in altermagnetic materials, offering a key step toward the practical use of such materials in future spin-based applications.

Abstract: Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.

Abstract: We develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory of negative magnetoresistance in multi-Weyl semimetals in the ${\bf E}\parallel{\bf B}$ configuration, where the chiral anomaly is activated. The magnetotransport response is governed by Landau quantization and the emergence of multiple chiral Landau levels associated with higher-order Weyl nodes. These anomaly-active modes have unidirectional dispersion fixed by the node's monopole charge and dominate charge transport. As the magnetic field increases, individual chiral branches successively cross the Fermi energy, producing discrete slope changes in the longitudinal conductivity and a step-like negative magnetoresistance. This quantized evolution provides a direct experimental signature of multi-Weyl topology. Bulk Landau levels contribute only at very low fields due to strong disorder scattering and do not affect the anomaly-driven regime. Our results establish a unified, fully quantum-mechanical framework in which negative magnetoresistance arises from the discrete Landau-quantized spectrum and microscopic impurity scattering, beyond semiclassical anomaly descriptions.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.

Conclusion: Demonstrate a high-efficiency UV-C LED with edge emission capability, suitable for illumination and medical applications.

Abstract: UV-C LEDs pseudomorphically grown by MBE on bulk AlN substrates emitting at 265 nm are demonstrated. High current density up to 800 A/cm$^2$, 5 orders of on/off ratio, and low differential on-resistance of 2.6 m$Ω\cdot$cm$^2$ at the highest current density is achieved. The LED heterostructure has a high refractive index waveguide core surrounded by n- and p-cladding layers similar to a laser diode designed for mode confinement at 270 nm to facilitate edge emission and collection of photons. Edge-emitting devices are made by cleaving the fabricated LEDs along the $m$-plane of the wurtzite crystal. Electrical injection results in emission of high energy 4.7 eV photons that are collected from the cleaved edge of the LEDs corresponding to the optical bandgap of the AlGaN active region. The contribution of power dissipation across the n- and p-regions of the diode is discussed. The n-contact resistance to n-AlGaN is identified as the largest contributor to the series resistance of the LED in the present generation of devices.

Abstract: The development of wearable devices for terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is pivotal for forthcoming 6G Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable optoelectronics. However, existing THz system suffers from bulkiness, narrow spectral response and limited flexibility constrained by their dependence on external antennas, complex coupling architectures and rigid components. Here, we present a 2D THz smart wristband based on a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) array, which integrates sensing and communication within a monolithic microdetector. Operating without any external antenna, the compact and flexible device enables self-powered, polarization-sensitive and frequency-selective THz detection across a broad response spectrum from 0.25 to 4.24 THz, with a responsivity of 6 V/W, a response time of 62 ms, and mechanical robustness maintained over 2000 bending cycles. Notably, we further exploit its multi-parameter THz responses for dual-purpose ISAC functionality. For sensing, the polarization- and strain-dependent THz responses are utilized as high-dimensional features for a convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling circuit fault diagnosis with 97% accuracy. For communication, the device implements secure encrypted communication under simulated on-body wearing condition through dual-channel encoding of THz polarization and on-off signals.

Abstract: Optical spin textures with nontrivial topology hold promise for structured light and photonic information processing, yet their generation typically relies heavily on externally structured light with care. This raises questions about their universal existence and true robustness. Here, we uncover and experimentally verify a meron-like spin texture that emerges intrinsically in focused fields, without any wavefront engineering. This intrinsic meron spin texture, unlike their externally engineered counterparts, exhibits exceptional robustness against a wide range of inputs, including partially polarized and spatially disordered pupils corrupted by decoherence and depolarization. We attribute its resilience to topological protection from phase vortices in the focal field. Our findings reveal a naturally occurring spin structure that is intrinsic to the focused field with exceptional robustness against noise, which complements the existing externally engineered ones. It offers new ingredients into topological spin textures in optics and enriches their potentials for disorder-resilient photonic applications.

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is the need for highly efficient, pattern-free thermal emitters that can support dual-polarization nonreciprocal emission, which is a significant challenge in advanced energy harvesting technologies. The paper addresses this by proposing a novel approach using multilayer heterostructures of specific materials.

Method: The paper combines theoretical analysis, computational modeling, and experimental validation to systematically evaluate the nonreciprocal emission performance of the proposed multilayer structures. Magneto-optical and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials are used, and their magnetization directions are manipulated in a way that does not follow simple vector summation. Pareto optimization is employed to tune the key design parameters, aiming to maximize nonreciprocal thermal emission performance.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed multilayer heterostructures achieve omnidirectional polarization-independent nonreciprocal emission for both p- and s-polarized waves. Pareto optimization successfully enhances the performance of these emitters, achieving maximum nonreciprocal thermal emission within a specific wavelength range. This approach provides a versatile strategy for designing high-performance thermal emitters tailored for multi-objective optical functionalities.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advancement in the field of nonreciprocal thermal emission, offering a pattern-free, highly efficient solution for energy harvesting applications. The use of multilayer heterostructures with strategically arranged magnetization directions and Pareto optimization opens new possibilities for the design of advanced thermal emitters with dual-polarization nonreciprocal emission capabilities.

Abstract: Many advanced energy harvesting technologies rely on advanced control of thermal emission. Recently, it has been shown that the emissivity and absorptivity of thermal emitters can be controlled independently in nonreciprocal emitters. While significant progress has been made in engineering these nonreciprocal thermal emitters, realizing a highly efficient, pattern-free emitter capable of supporting dual-polarization nonreciprocal emission remains a challenging task. Existing solutions are largely based on metamaterials and exhibit polarization-dependent behavior. This work proposes pattern-free multilayer heterostructures combining magneto-optical and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials and systematically evaluates their nonreciprocal emission performance for p- and s-polarized waves. The findings show that omnidirectional polarization-independent nonreciprocity can be achieved utilizing multilayer structures with different magnetization directions that do not follow simple vector summation. To further enhance the performance, Pareto optimization is employed to tune the key design parameters, enabling the maximization of nonreciprocal thermal emission in a given wavelength range. This approach offers a versatile strategy for designing high-performance thermal emitters tailored for multi-objective optical functionalities.

Abstract: We investigate exceptional points of degeneracy (EPDs) in electromagnetic scattering of a sphere dimer from the electroquasistatic limit to the fully retarded regime. In the quasistatic limit, we prove that $\parity\trev$-symmetric configurations, realized by spheres with complex-conjugate susceptibilities, host EPDs. Beyond this limit, retardation breaks $\parity\trev$-symmetry; nevertheless, by jointly tuning the material dispersion of the two spheres, we derive analytic conditions for the existence of EPDs at \textit{real-frequencies}. Near an EPD, we show that single-parameter perturbations yield the characteristic square-root splitting of the eigenfrequencies, and we quantify its impact on scattering, extinction, and absorption, clarifying sensing implications.

Abstract: The interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to exotic dynamic phenomena that challenge conventional wave-packet propagation and entanglement dynamics. While recent studies have established the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) as a key mechanism for anomalous wave dynamics, a unified framework for characterizing and controlling entanglement evolution in non-Hermitian topological systems remains underdeveloped. Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes. Using a generalized non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model implemented in an acoustic analog platform, we identify three dynamic phases, bulk-like, edge-like, and skin-like regimes, each exhibiting unique EE signatures and transport characteristics. In particular, skin-like dynamics exhibit periodic information shuttling with finite, oscillatory EE, while edge-like dynamics lead to complete EE suppression. We further map the dynamic phase diagram and show that EE scaling and temporal profiles directly reflect the competition between coherent delocalization and NHSE-driven localization. Our results establish a programmable approach to steering entanglement and transport via tailored non-Hermitian couplings, offering a pathway for engineering quantum information dynamics in synthetic phononic, photonic, and quantum simulators.

TL;DR: A one-dimensional defective atomic lattice combined with a coherent gain atomic system is proposed for unidirectional reflection lasing (URL). The design utilizes destructive interference to suppress primary reflection on one side while enhancing secondary reflection on the other, enabling lasing with active modulation. The scheme is experimentally feasible and beneficial for compact quantum networks.

Motivation: Improving the efficiency of optical information transmission and enabling integrated active photonic devices in compact systems are key motivations.

Method: Combining a one-dimensional defective atomic lattice with a coherent gain atomic system, leveraging numerical simulations and analysis to tailor lattice parameters and coupling fields for precise control of destructive interference effects.

Result: Achieved successful demonstration of URL with active modulation capabilities, providing a feasible pathway that circumvents stringent conditions for direct URL realization.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme offers a promising approach for URL implementation and integration into compact quantum networks, enhancing optical communication efficiency.

Abstract: The novel and ingenious scheme we propose for achieving unidirectional reflection lasing (URL) involves integrating a one-dimensional (1D) defective atomic lattice with a coherent gain atomic system. Its physical essence lies in the fact that the right-side reflectivity is drastically reduced due to the destructive interference between primary and secondary reflections, whereas on the left-side primary reflection is effectively suppressed and the secondary reflection is efficiently enhanced, ultimately reaching the lasing threshold. Through numerical results and further analyses, we have elucidated how to precisely tailor the lattice parameters and coupling fields to control destructive interference point (DIP), thereby realizing URL and enabling its active modulation. Our scheme is experimentally feasible and not only effectively circumvents the stringent conditions faced in directly realizing URL, providing a new pathway, but also beneficial for integrating active photonic devices into compact quantum networks and may improve the efficiency of optical information transmission.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that spectral complexity can be achieved using standard photonic building blocks in a chip-scale device, enabling secure communication through unclonable keys and physical encryption without requiring quantum components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find practical ways to leverage spectral complexity in physical devices for secure communication, addressing limitations like propagation loss and scalability.

Method: The method involves using a photonic device with waveguide Marx-Zehnder interferometers loaded with non-concentric dual ring resonators, achieving reconfigurability via voltage-controlled elements.

Result: The result is the generation of a large keyspace (over 12 Tb) and physical encryption for key distribution, with potential for integration into existing telecommunication systems.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that standardized photonic blocks can enable practical secure communication using classical methods, opening up new possibilities for integration into existing infrastructure.

Abstract: Spectral complexity is a useful resource in physical device identification, disorder-enhanced spectroscopy, and machine learning, but is often achieved in chip-scale devices at the expense of propagation loss, scalability, or reconfigurability. In this work, we demonstrate that device specific spectral complexity can be achieved using completely standardized photonic building blocks. Using a waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer internally loaded with two sets of non-concentric dual ring resonators, we demonstrate the generation of unclonable keys for one-time pad encryption which can be reconfigured on the fly by applying small voltages to on-chip thermo-optic elements. With this method, we access a keyspace larger than 12 Tb for a single device with simple, single-mode waveguide input and output coupling. Using two devices at either end of a communication channel, we show that an eavesdropper tapping the channel fibre link would be unable to recover the same spectrum measured at either end of the link, providing physical encryption for key distribution. Furthermore, being purely classical, this form of secure communications does not require quantum photonic sources or detectors, and can therefore be easily integrated into pre-existing telecommunication architectures.

Abstract: By injecting configurational entropy into soft ionic lattices, high-entropy halide perovskites offer a compelling route toward photonic materials that are both functionally rich and operationally robust; however, converting compositional complexity into predictable optical function remains challenging. Here we demonstrate device-relevant ultrabroadband near-infrared (NIR) photonics by integrating element-specific roles within an entropy-stabilized lattice. We establish high-entropy rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb,Re)Cl6 (Re3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), where near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase cubic solid solution (S_config about 1.6R) with homogeneous multication incorporation. Sb3+ acts as a broadband sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide emitters, transforming single-mode emission into wide-coverage NIR output (850-1600 nm) with three fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced signature enables redundancy-based ratiometric readout with reduced sensitivity to intensity drift, supporting reliable solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing. Beyond functional expansion, accelerated aging tests show markedly improved tolerance to humidity and oxygen versus single-component analogues. The robustness is experimentally attributed to octahedral contraction-strengthened metal-halide bonding that increases the kinetic barrier for moisture-triggered bond cleavage, together with entropy-induced lattice distortion that impedes long-range halide migration and suppresses defect/impurity-phase formation. Finally, a UV-pumped phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, wide-coverage NIR illumination, highlighting configurational-entropy engineering as a practical strategy to couple ultrabroadband photonic function with environmental stability.

Result: Demonstrated video-rate (15 Hz) 3D imaging with lateral and axial resolutions of 264 nm and 1.12 um, respectively.

Conclusion: PRIDT provides a versatile tool for live-cell studies, enhancing understanding of cellular metabolism and treatment response with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular imaging of living cells is essential for unraveling cellular metabolism and response to therapies. However, existing volumetric methods, including fluorescence microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, either require fluorescent labels or lack chemical specificity. Mid-infrared (mid-IR) photothermal microscopy provides label-free spectroscopic contrast with sub-micrometer resolution but is limited by slow acquisition rates, precluding 3D live-cell studies. Here, we present a photothermal relaxation intensity diffraction tomography (PRIDT) system that encodes mid-IR absorption induced refractive index change via a photothermal relaxation scheme and recovers it through intensity diffraction tomography. PRIDT achieves video-rate volumetric chemical imaging with up to 15 Hz per wavelength and offers lateral and axial resolutions of 264 nm and 1.12 um over a volumetric field of view of 50x50x10 um3. We showcase high-speed PRIDT imaging of protein and lipid metabolism in ovarian cancer cells and lipid-droplet dynamics in live cells. PRIDT opens new avenues for rapid, quantitative, three-dimensional molecular imaging in living systems.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a mathematical theory for the photonic Hall effect and prove the existence of guided electromagnetic waves at the interface of two honeycomb photonic crystals. The guided wave resembles the edge states in electronic systems: it is induced by the topological Hall effect, and the wave propagates along the interface but not in the bulk media. Starting from a symmetric honeycomb photonic crystal that attains Dirac points at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, $K$ and $K'$, we introduce two classes of perturbations for the periodic medium. The perturbations lift the Dirac degeneracy, forming a spectral band valley at the points $K$ and $K'$ with well-defined topological phase that depends on the sign of the perturbation parameters. By employing the layer potential techniques and spectral analysis, we investigate the existence of guided wave along an interface when two honeycomb photonic crystals are glued together. In particular, we elucidate the relationship between the existence of the interface mode and the nature of perturbations imposed on the two periodic media separated by the interface.

Closed-form formulas for electron current and HHG spectra are presented. Based on the developed theory, we provide an analytic explanation for key features of HHG yield and show that the interband mechanism of HHG prevails over the intraband one.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the oscillatory dynamics of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) under extreme electron temperatures. The researchers developed an inverse-designed multilayer cavity and an electron-acceptor layer to demonstrate fast modulation of the refractive index on the timescale of a few optical cycles. The findings reveal a critical role of electron temperatures in driving these oscillatory responses and open up new avenues for designing time-varying photonic media.

Motivation: Understanding the dynamic behavior of TCOs under extreme conditions is crucial for advancing their applications in various fields, including optics and thermophysics. This work highlights the potential of TCOs for developing novel time-varying photonic media with applications in light manipulation and device design.

Method: The researchers experimentally demonstrated the oscillatory dynamics of TCOs using a multilayer cavity structure and electron-acceptor layers. They measured transmittance oscillations and time-varying refractive index changes using transient four-wave mixing and spectroscopic techniques.

Result: The inverse-designed cavity and electron-acceptor layer enabled the TCO to exhibit fast modulation of the refractive index with oscillation periods of 20 femtoseconds and shorter. These results were tunable in the sub-cycle timescale.

Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the transient dynamic behavior of TCOs and offers a practical method for achieving ultrafast phase modulation for future ultrafast optics and light-based devices.

Abstract: We find that transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) exhibit oscillatory (sign-reversing) dynamics on a few optical cycle timescale under extreme electron temperatures. We demonstrate a mechanism for such transient dynamics and present an inverse-designed multilayer cavity incorporating an ultrathin TCO layer that supports the oscillatory behavior. This approach yields transmittance oscillations with a period of ~20 fs, which corresponds to three optical cycles of the probe beam. To achieve a similar oscillatory modulation in the refractive index, we incorporate a TCO electron-acceptor layer on top of the inverse-designed cavity, enabling thermionic carrier injection at the TCO heterojunction. The resulting acceptor layer achieves a striking Δn response time as short as 9 fs, approaching a single optical cycle, and is further tunable to sub-cycle timescales. The findings not only clarify the elusive transient physics in TCOs but also demonstrate, for the first time, the critical role of electron temperatures in driving oscillatory dynamic responses. More broadly, we establish TCO-based thermionic carrier injection as a practical route to novel time-varying photonic media operating on the timescale of an optical cycle, enabling time-reflection, time-refraction, and related dynamic phenomena from the visible to the infrared.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data transmission and processing speeds in modern digital infrastructure requires entropy sources capable of producing large volumes of true randomness for information security. Chaotic emissions from semiconductor lasers are attractive in this context because of their fast dynamics and nonrepetitive behavior. Their spectral bandwidth, however, is typically limited to several tens of gigahertz, which constrains the achievable entropy rate and makes ultrafast random bit generation difficult without substantial post-processing. Here, we demonstrate a chaos-based entropy source that employs optical heterodyning between the chaotic emission from a semiconductor laser and an optical frequency comb, yielding a bandwidth exceeding 100 GHz and an experimentally verified single-channel entropy rate of 1.86 Tb/s. By directly extracting multiple bits from the digitized output of the entropy source, we achieve a single-channel random bit generation rate of 1.536 Tb/s, while four-channel parallelization reaches 6.144 Tb/s with no observable interchannel correlation. This linear scalability suggests that aggregate throughput could reach hundreds of terabits per second with additional parallel channels. The broadband, low-overhead photonic architecture presented here provides a viable route to real-time, ultrafast random bit generation with broad implications for secure communications, high-performance AI computing, and large-scale data analytics.

Abstract: This work presents the tunable generation of vortex, vector, and flat-top 1060-nm NIR beams in a few-mode fiber with a mechanical long-period fiber grating. By the variation of applied force on the fiber grating, the core mode to higher-order mode excitation can be adjusted. The manipulation of the beam transformation is achieved through the polarization control of the fiber eigenmodes and mode coupling efficiency. By precisely tuning the intensity ratio between fundamental and doughnut modes, we arrive at the generation of propagation-invariant vector flat-top beams for more than 5 m. Transverse optical field of 532-nm green light from frequency-doubled Nd-doped yttrium vanadate laser is manipulated and coupled into various intensity distributions in a few-mode fiber by using a mechanically induced long-period fiber grating. We show that the doughnut beam, the Mexican-hat beam, and the crater-lake beam can be generated from the input Gaussian beam via the coupling of the fundamental core mode to a series of co-propagating higher-order modes with properly applied forces and polarizations.

Abstract: Optical computing could reduce the energy cost of artificial intelligence by leveraging the parallelism and propagation speed of light. However, implementing nonlinear activation, essential for machine learning, remains challenging in low-power optical systems dominated by linear wave physics. Here, we introduce an optical spiking neural network that uses optical rogue-wave statistics as a programmable firing mechanism. By establishing a homomorphism between free-space diffraction and neuronal integration, we demonstrate that phase-engineered caustics enable robust, passive thresholding: sparse spatial spikes emerge when the local intensity exceeds a significant-intensity rogue-wave criterion. Using a physics-informed digital twin, we optimize granular phase masks to deterministically concentrate energy into targeted detector regions, enabling end-to-end co-design of the optical transformation and a lightweight electronic readout. We experimentally validate the approach on BreastMNIST and Olivetti Faces, achieving accuracies of 82.45\% and 95.00\%, respectively, competitive with standard digital baselines. These results demonstrate that extreme-wave phenomena, often treated as deleterious fluctuations, can be harnessed as structural nonlinearity for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic photonic inference.

Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected light has recently emerged as a technique in which quantum correlations and nonlinear interferometry are combined to decouple illumination and detection paths. This approach has been more recently extended and combined with digital phase-shifting holography and off-axis holography to extract both the amplitude and phase information of a sample relying on single-photon interference. Despite these advantages, implementing the technique in real-world scenarios where the observed system is subject to environmental noise and dynamic variations remains challenging. The primary limitation lies in the inability of quantum imaging systems to retrieve object information in real time under high-noise conditions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate real-time amplitude and phase imaging in noisy environments, building upon our previous implementation of quantum off-axis holography. Our results demonstrate real-time imaging at acquisition rates up to 4~Hz, even when the noise level exceeds the signal by an order of magnitude.

Motivation: The need for simpler and more efficient fabrication methods for microstructured surfaces in photonics, biointerfaces, and functional coatings.

Method: Developed an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform using engineered darkness in computer-generated holograms to spatially localize mass transport for creating protruding microreliefs.

Result: The method enables the generation of isolated and arrays of micro-bumps, spatiotemporal control for shaping microrelief profiles, and applications such as multi-focus microlenses, quasi-square diffraction gratings, and rewritable surfaces.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable, flexible, and high-efficiency solution for on-demand microfabrication of structured surfaces with potential for reprogramming and replication.

Abstract: Microstructured surfaces are central to photonics, biointerfaces, and functional coatings, yet they are typically fabricated through multi-step lithographic workflows requiring masks or molds and post-processing. Azopolymers provide an alternative route by converting structured optical fields into surface reliefs via light-induced mass migration, but existing approaches have been limited to smooth, shallow, and engraving-like topographies produced from a flat film. Here we introduce an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform that exploits engineered darkness within computer-generated holograms to spatially localize inward mass transport and directly produce positive, protruding microreliefs. We show that isolated and array of micro-bumps can be generated from pristine flat azopolymer films in a single writing step, and we introduce spatiotemporal control through sequential tailored illumination to reshape microrelief profiles, enabling flattened-top micropillars, programmable array shapes and arrangements, and free-form continuous microrelief designs. Hierarchical microarchitectures are also demonstrated by extending the concept of multi-step illumination sequences. As functional demonstrations, we realize multi-focus microlenses and quasi-square diffraction gratings with enhanced 1st-order efficiencies. Finally, we leverage azopolymer reconfigurability to implement write-erase-rewrite cycles that reset and repurpose the same surface region for distinct micropatterns, enabling rewritable surfaces and reprogrammable master templates for replication. Overall, this work establishes a scalable spatiotemporal strategy for on-demand, all-optical microfabrication and reprogramming of structured surfaces, where spatial and temporal degrees of freedom of holographic patterns intermix to produce advanced patterning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortices carry transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM), which give rise to spatiotemporal topological charge (ST-TC). To unleash the full potential of t-OAM in expanding the capacity of communication and computing, we demonstrate the first optical information-processing pipeline capable of performing addition and subtraction on ST-TC values, regardless of whether they are integer or fractional. Additionally, we established a readout method for those mathematical operations through imaging spectral analysis, providing a robust optical basis toward arithmetic operations and verification. These new capabilities mark crucial advancements toward full arithmetic operations on the ST-TC of light for bosonic state computation and information processing.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulations have opened access to the real-time dynamics of lattice gauge theories, providing a new setting to explore how quantum criticality influences thermalization and ergodicity far from equilibrium. Using QuEra's programmable Rydberg atom array, we map out the dynamical phase diagram of the spin-1/2 U(1) quantum link model in one spatial dimension by quenching the fermion mass. We reveal a tunable regime of ergodicity breaking due to quantum many-body scars, manifested as long-lived coherent oscillations that persist across a much broader range of parameters than previously observed, including at the equilibrium phase transition point. We further analyze the electron-positron pairs generated during state preparation via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which strongly affect the post-quench dynamics. Our results provide new insights into nonthermal dynamics in lattice gauge theories and establish Rydberg atom arrays as a powerful platform for probing the interplay between ergodicity breaking and quantum criticality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose to measure the dispersions of Fermi polaron and molecule by engineering spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the impurity, which induces spin flip with finite momentum transfer. The polaron dispersion can be probed at small SOC momentum from the linear response of impurity spin. For molecule, we show that it can be prepared through an adiabatic steady-state evolution when setting SOC momentum as the Fermi momentum of majority bath. By gradually reducing SOC strength to zero, the steady state smoothly evolves to a molecular state with directional symmetry breaking. The corresponding dispersion can then be probed experimentally through the center-of-mass momentum distribution of molecules at finite density. Our scheme reveals a fundamental momentum difference between Fermi polaron and molecule, thereby offering a clear physical picture for their first-order transition in single-impurity system.

### [144] [Dynamical probing of superfluidity and shear rigidity in different phases of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24108)
*Soumyadeep Halder,Hari Sadhan Ghosh,Axel Pelster,B. Prasanna Venkatesh*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that changing the magnetic dipole polarization in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate can probe its superfluid and solid properties, with distinct signatures for different states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the properties of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates is important for studying superfluidity and solid-like behavior in quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum technology and fundamental physics.

Method: The authors used a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study the oscillatory behavior of the condensate under varying magnetic dipole polarization. They compared the behavior of the superfluid, droplet, and supersolid states.

Result: For small angular deviations, the superfluid exhibits undamped scissors mode oscillations, while the droplet and supersolid show damped oscillations. The damping rate correlates with the rigidity of the different phases. Additionally, beyond a certain angular deviation, the droplet and supersolid states undergo a permanent deformation, analogous to the elastic to plastic phase transition in solids.

Conclusion: This technique provides a direct experimental method to identify and characterize the superfluid and solid properties of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, offering new insights into quantum matter.

Abstract: We show that a sudden change in the polarization direction of the magnetic dipole moments of the atoms in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can serve as a useful probe to sense its superfluid and solid-like properties. We find that for small angular deviation of the polarization direction, actuated for instance by modifying an external magnetic field, the superfluid state undergoes an undamped scissors mode oscillation, a characteristic signature of superfluidity. In contrast, both the droplet and supersolid states exhibit a scissors-mode oscillation, which is effectively damped due to multiple closely spaced frequency components. Notably, we find that this damping rate provides a direct quantitative measure for the rigidity of different phases of a dipolar BEC. Furthermore, there exists a maximum angular deviation of the polarization direction, beyond which the droplet and the supersolid states undergo a permanent deformation i.e., we find an analog of the usual elastic to plastic phase transition of solids. We characterize this transition numerically using the fidelity of the condensate wavefunction with the ground state as well as the droplet width and periodicity of the supersolid density of the condensate which are experimentally accessible. Thus, the technique introduced here can be an important experimental benchmark to identify and characterize the superfluid and solid properties of different phases of dipolar BECs.

### [145] [Sound Wave in the Backreaction Affected Spacetime in Analogue Gravity Based on Number-Conserving Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24233)
*Sang-Shin Baak*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that sound waves in the backreaction framework yield a Schwarzschild-like spacetime fixed by a constant mass. The analysis involving a number-conserving approach indicates that corrections due to backreaction maintain similar properties, while introducing spacetime-dependent mass. For a homogeneous Bose gas in a quasi-one-dimensional model, backreaction increases the UV divergence of the correlation function. The wave's correlation increases in a finite region but decreases at larger distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This concise summary also effectively captures the key points, including the equation's implications for spacetime and the behavior of Bose gas correlations under backreaction.

Method: The analysis used a number-conserving approach to derive modified fluid equations incorporating backreaction effects, leading to the conclusions about mass dependence and correlation behavior.

Result: The study confirms a Schwarzschild-like spacetime structure with modified mass terms and observes specific behaviors in Bose gas correlations, contributing insights into backreaction effects and fluid dynamics in relativistic contexts.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive analysis showing how backreaction alters spacetime properties and influences correlation functions in Bose gases, with implications for understanding wave phenomena in dynamical spacetimes.

Abstract: It is shown that the sound wave in the backreaction affected dynamical spacetime follows the equations for a massive scalar field in a analogue spacetime using number-conserving approach. Even with backreaction, the analogue metric is in the same form to the case without backreaction. The sound velocity, fluid density, and fluid velocity are defined with small correction to include the backreaction effect. Moreover, the modification of classical fluid dynamical equations by the backreaction introduces spacetime dependent mass. For a finite-size homogeneous quasi-one dimensional Bose gas, we find that the backreaction increase the UV divergence of the equal position correlation function. Moreover, in this model, we see that the backreaction increase the correlation in a finite region and decrease the correlation in far region.

Abstract: Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，长距离相互作用对Higgs模式的阻尼有显著的影响，特别是在二维系统中。此外，提出了利用Rydberg原子实验来激发和探测Higgs模式的方法。

Abstract: We theoretically study the collective excitations in a spin-1 $XY$ model with a quadratic Zeeman term and a long-range interaction that decays algebraically with the distance. Using the quantum-field theory based on the finite-temperature Green's function formalism, we analyze properties of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) and Higgs modes in order to analytically evaluate the damping rate of the Higgs mode in the $XY$ ferromagnetic ordered phase near the quantum phase transition to the disordered phase. When the power of the algebraic decay is 3 as in the case of dipole-dipole interactions in Rydberg-atom systems, we show that at two dimensions the excitation energy of the Higgs mode exhibits a linear dispersion whereas the dispersion of the NG mode becomes proportional to the square root of the momentum. We find that the damping of the Higgs mode is significantly suppressed by the long-range interaction. We also propose how to excite and probe the Higgs mode in Rydberg-atom experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying quantum many-body systems in continuous space remains a significant challenge in quantum physics, necessitating advanced numerical tools like the cMPS ansatz.

Method: An enhanced optimization method for multi-component cMPS, specifically designed for bosonic mixtures, was developed and applied to the Lieb-Liniger model.

Result: The new method successfully simulates systems with larger bond dimensions, with results matching analytical predictions.

Conclusion: This advancement provides a robust framework for future studies of quantum mixture systems using cMPS, broadening the scope of potential research applications in quantum physics.

Abstract: The continuous matrix product state (cMPS) ansatz is a promising numerical tool for studying quantum many-body systems in continuous space. Although it provides a clean framework that allows one to directly simulate continuous systems, the optimization of cMPS is known to be a very challenging task, especially in the case of multi-component systems. In this work, we have developed an improved optimization scheme for multi-component cMPS that enables simulations of bosonic quantum mixtures with substantially larger bond dimensions than previous works. We benchmark our method on the two-component Lieb-Liniger model, obtaining numerical results that agree well with analytical predictions. Our work paves the way for further numerical studies of quantum mixture systems using the cMPS ansatz.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: understanding and observing exotic quantum states in materials is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, especially in the context of unconventional superconductivity and quantum phase transitions.

Method: used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to directly visualize in-gap electronic states bound to impurities in an exciton condensate of a van der Waals crystal.

Result: in-gap electronic states have energies strongly correlated with the excitonic band gap, which is tunable by local strain and carrier injection; these states are induced by charge dipoles associated with Ta vacancies through a charge-exciton version of the YSR mechanism.

Conclusion: demonstrate both the YSR physics in exciton condensates and a novel microscopic tool to probe and control quantum properties in such materials reguarly at room temperature.

Abstract: Quantum condensed states in solids often reveal their fundamental nature via interactions with impurities, as epitomized by Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states at magnetic impurities in superconductors. Although analogous YSR bound states were predicted within quantum condensates of excitons several decades ago, their existence has been elusive. Here, we directly visualize in-gap electronic states bound to impurities inside an exciton condensate phase of a van der Waals crystal Ta2Pd3Te5, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find that the energies of in-gap states are strongly correlated with the excitonic band gap, which is systematically tuned by local strain and carrier injection. Our theoretical analyses reveal that these in-gap states are induced by charge dipoles associated with Ta vacancies through a charge-exciton version of the YSR mechanism. Our findings establish both the YSR physics in exciton condensates and a novel microscopic tool to probe and control quantum properties in exciton condensates persisting up to room temperature.

Abstract: We analyze a classical Heisenberg spin model on the simple cubic lattice which is invariant under time reversal and contains multiple chiral spin interactions. The modelled dynamics is appropriate either for local moments coupled to itinerant Weyl electrons, or localized electrons with a strong spin-orbit coupling that would produce a Weyl spectrum away from half filling. Using a Monte Carlo method, we find a robust $4Q$ bipartite lattice of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs which melts through a first order phase transition at a critical temperature in certain segments of the phase diagram. The density of hedgehogs is a non-linear function of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and a linear function of the multiple-spin chiral interaction which plays the fundamental role of a ``magnetic flux'' or a hedgehog chemical potential. These findings are related to the observations of hedgehog lattices in MnGe, MnSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ and SrFeO$_3$, and indirectly support the possible existence of incompressible quantum-disordered hedgehog liquids.

Abstract: The commensurate charge-density-wave phase in the protoypical transition metal dichalcogenide $1T$-TaS$_2$ is investigated by temperature and polarization-dependent infrared spectroscopy revealing the fundamentally different charge dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the layers. Supported by density-functional-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the out-of-plane response is governed by a quasi-one-dimensional, Peierls-like dimerization of the two-dimensional star-of-David layers. In particular, our results identifies this dimerization as the primary driving mechanism of the metal-to-insulator transition, ruling out a significant role of electronic correlations.

Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.W. Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR), including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers, and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$.
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.

Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of americium (Am) across its four experimentally confirmed high-pressure phases Am-I (P63/mmc), Am-II (Fm-3m), Am-III (Fddd), and Am-IV (Pnma) up to 100 GPa, using density functional theory combined with embedded dynamical mean-field theory. Our results successfully reproduce the prominent localized 5f peak observed in ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy around -2.8 eV below the Fermi level in the Am-I phase. While 5f electrons in Am-I and Am-II remain strongly localized, those in Am-III and Am-IV manifest discernible signatures of increased hybridization: a noticeable shift of spectral weight toward the Fermi level, enhanced hybridization strength, and the emergence of distinct multi-peak structures. These changes indicate that 5f electrons begin to participate in bonding and undergo partial delocalization under pressure. Nevertheless, the spectral weight of 5f electrons near the Fermi level in Am-IV remains relatively low, indicating that, compared to U and Pu, Am retains stronger localized 5f electrons even under high pressure. Analysis of the electronic configurations reveals pressure-enhanced valence state fluctuation, characterized by the mixing of 5f5, 5f6, and 5f7 electronic configurations. The X-ray absorption branching ratio further shows that the angular-momentum coupling scheme approaches the jj limit. Additionally, we demonstrate that the stability of the low-symmetry high-pressure phases (Am-III and Am-IV) is governed by a Peierls-like distortion mechanism, which reduces the total energy through symmetry-lowering lattice distortions accompanied by electronic reconstruction. This study offers a new microscopic perspective on high-pressure phase transitions and emergent quantum phenomena in actinide materials.

Abstract: Topological spin textures in frustrated intermetallics hold great promise for spintronics applications. However, understanding their origin and properties remains a significant challenge due to competing and often long-range interactions mediated by conduction electrons. Here, by combining neutron scattering experiments with theoretical modeling via unprecedented multi-target fits that further incorporate the ferromagnentic resonance data and magnetization curve, we construct a realistic microscopic model for the prototypical intermetallic skyrmion host \text{Gd}$_3$\text{Ru}$_4$\text{Al}$_{12}$. Beyond magnetic frustration, we identify the competition between dipolar interactions and easy-plane single-ion anisotropy as a key ingredient for stabilizing the rich chiral magnetic phases observed in this compound -- including a hexagonal skyrmion crystal and two distinct meron crystals. Remarkably, the meron crystal in lower field is revealed to be commensurate with the underlying lattice, and its unique three-meron-one-antimeron spin texture is verified by the polarized x-ray diffraction data. At elevated temperatures, the short-range spin correlations in \text{Gd}$_3$\text{Ru}$_4$\text{Al}$_{12}$ are well described by a codimension-two spiral spin-liquid. Perturbations from staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions give rise to chiral fluctuations that account for the temperature and field dependence of the anomalous Hall response. Our results highlight the unique power of neutron scattering, especially when combined with complementary experimental techniques, to unravel complex magnetic phase transitions and provide new insights into the rich variety of topological spin textures in frustrated systems.

Although non-zero on elementary plaquettes, the net orbital magnetic moment is guaranteed to vanish as a result of point symmetries; due to the analogy to long-range ordered altermagnets, these types of phases were dubbed altermagnetic spin liquids in [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 023152 (2025)]. For the spin-$3/2$ model, we find that a $g$-wave altermagnetic spin liquid emerges as the unique ground state. In contrast, the spin-7/2 model exhibits a significantly richer phase diagram, involving different types of chiral spin liquids competing with a $d$-wave altermagnetic spin liquid. Finally, we identify and characterize the topological and non-topological excitations, illustrating the rich physics of altermagnetic spin liquids resulting from the interplay of non-trivial topological and symmetry aspects of this novel phase of matter.

Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful new framework for classifying and simulating correlated and topological phases of quantum matter. Their central premise is that strongly correlated matter can only be understood by studying the underlying entanglement structure and its associated (generalised) symmetries. In essence, tensor networks provide a compressed, holographic description of the complicated vacuum fluctuations in strongly correlated systems, and as such they break down the infamous many-body exponential wall. These lecture notes provide a concise overview of the most important conceptual, computational and mathematical aspects of this theory.

Abstract: The scaling of entanglement with subsystem size encodes key information about phases and criticality, but the von Neumann entropy is costly to access in experiments and simulations, often requiring full state tomography. The second Rényi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. However, Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and second Rényi entropies varies from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the Rényi index. By constructing a number-conserving many-body state with only two local degrees of freedom, we obtain a Rényi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling: the second Rényi entropy remains logarithmic while the von Neumann entropy is parametrically larger. We then introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved second Rényi entropies and the subsystem charge distribution. Comparing this bound to the total second Rényi entropy provides a practical diagnostic for anomalous entanglement scaling from experimentally accessible data.

Abstract: Magnetic impurities in strongly correlated electronic systems serve as sensitive probes to a wide range of many-body quantum phenomena. Broken symmetries in such a system can lead to inequivalent lattice sites, and magnetic impurities may interact selectively with particular orbitals or sublattices. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind such site-specific interactions have been poorly understood. Here, we explore the behavior of individual Fe adatoms on a cluster-Mott charge-density-wave (CDW) system of 1T-TaS2 utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states. DFT calculations identify three distinct types of interactions; hybridization with localized correlated electrons, distorting the CDW cluster, and charge transfer. In particular, the hybridization of Fe 3d and half-filled Ta 5dz2 orbitals suppresses the Mott insulating state for an adatom at the center of a CDW cluster. While the results underscore a crucial role of the direct orbital hybridization and the limitation of the prevailing single-site Kondo impurity model, they suggest the possibility of controlling entangled interactions separately in a cluster Mott insulator.

Abstract: We apply methods of equivariant homotopy theory, which may not previously have found due attention in condensed matter physics, to classify first the fragile/unstable topological phases of 2D crystalline Chern insulator materials, and second the possible topological order of their fractional cousins. We highlight that the phases are given by the equivariant 2-Cohomotopy of the Brillouin torus of crystal momenta (with respect to wallpaper point group actions) -- which, despite the attention devoted to crystalline Chern insulators, seems not to have been considered before. Arguing then that any topological order must be reflected in the adiabatic monodromy of gapped quantum ground states over the covariantized space of these band topologies, we compute the latter in examples where this group is non-abelian, showing that any potential FQAH anyons must be localized in momentum space. We close with an outlook on the relevance for the search for topological quantum computing hardware. Mathematical details are spelled out in a supplement.

### [160] [Intriguing Magnetocaloric Effect in 6H-perovskite Ba3RRu2O9 (R=Ho, Gd, Tb, Nd) with Strong 4d-4f Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24758)

TL;DR: This paper investigates the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in Ba3RRu2O9 family compounds with R being Ho, Gd, Tb, Nd. MCE is observed in all elements, but the mechanism differs: heavy rare-earth elements exhibit conventional MCE, while light ones show non-conventional MCE due to different spin reorientations and anisotropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCE is an intriguing phenomenon in low-dimensional systems, and its applications in spintronic devices make it crucial to understand the conditions and origins of MCE.

Method: The study uses neutron diffraction and specific heat measurements to analyze the magnetic order and MCE.

Result: Ba3RRu2O9 shows robust MCE around low-T magnetic transitions for R=Ho, Gd, Tb. Light R=Nd shows a different MCE behavior as magnetic ordering is FM, followed by Ru ordering.

Conclusion: MCE occurs across the family, but mechanism depends on R’s position: heavy R have conventional MCE, light R have non-conventional MCE due to ferrromagnetic ordering and anisotropy.

Abstract: Here we demonstrate the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of a 4d-4f correlated system, namely Ba3RRu2O9 (R= Ho, Gd, Tb, Nd). The compound Ba3HoRu2O9 antiferromagnetically orders at 50 K where both the Ho and Ru-moments order, followed by another phase transition ~ 10 K. Whereas, the compound Ba3GdRu2O9 and Ba3TbRu2O9 orders at 14.5 and 10.5 K respectively, where the ordering of both R and Ru moments are speculated. Our results reveal robust MCE around low-T magnetic phase transition for all the heavy rare-earth members (Ho, Gd, Tb) in this family. The heavy rare-earth members exhibit an intriguing MCE behavior switching from conventional to non-conventional MCE. Interestingly, the light R-member, Ba3NdRu2O9, orders ferromagnetically below 24 K where Nd-moments order, followed by Ru-ordering below 18 K, exhibits a positive MCE below and above FM-ordering. The compelling MCE are attributed to temperature dependent complex spin-reorientations for different R-members and anisotropy.

Abstract: Double perovskites containing 4d--4f interactions provide a platform to study complex magnetic phenomena in correlated systems. Here, we investigate the magnetic ground state and quasiparticle excitations of the fascinating double perovskite system, Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$, through Time of flight (TOF) neutron diffraction (TOF), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and theoretical modelling. The compound Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$ is reported to exhibit a single magnetic transition, in sharp contrast to most of the other rare-earth (R) members in this family, A$_2$RRuO$_6$ (A = Ca/Sr/Ba), which typically show magnetic ordering of the Ru ions, followed by R-ion ordering. Our neutron diffraction results confirm that long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx 47$~K, primarily driven by 4d--4f Ru$^{5+}$--Dy$^{3+}$ exchange interactions, where both Dy and Ru moments start to order simultaneously. The ordered ground state is a collinear antiferromagnet with Ising character, carrying ordered moments of $μ_{\mathrm{Ru}} = 1.6(1)~μ_\mathrm{B}$ and $μ_{\mathrm{Dy}} = 5.1(1)~μ_\mathrm{B}$ at 1.5~K. Low-temperature INS reveals well-defined magnon excitations below 10~meV. SpinW modelling of the INS spectra evidences complex exchange interactions and the presence of magnetic anisotropy, which governs the Ising ground state and accounts for the observed magnon spectrum. Combined INS and Raman spectroscopy reveal crystal-electric-field (CEF) excitations of Dy$^{3+}$ at 46.5 and 71.8~meV in the paramagnetic region. The observed CEF levels are reproduced by point-charge calculations consistent with the $O_h$ symmetry of Dy$^{3+}$. A complementary machine-learning approach is used to analyse the phonon spectrum and compare with INS data. Together, these results clarify the origin of phonon and magnon excitations and their role in the ground-state magnetism of Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$.

Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting bosonic systems have been extensively studied, yet most realizations rely on fine-tuned interactions or enlarged symmetries. Here we show that a qualitatively different mechanism--parity order coupled to bond dimerization--acts as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify two distinct topological phases absent in the purely dimerized model: an SPT phase at half filling stabilized by positive parity coupling, and a topological phase at unit filling stabilized by negative coupling that can be adiabatically connected to a trivial phase without breaking any symmetry. Our results establish parity order as a new organizing principle for correlation-driven bosonic topology.

*Yiming Wang,Shouvik Sur,Chia-Chuan Liu,Qimiao Si*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Big Fermions are heavy because of an effective mass increase. The Kondo destruction quantum critical point (KDP) serves as the phase boundary between the Kondo dirty metal and the Mott insulator. The field-theoretic renormalization group analysis describes this transition uncommonly well within the same framework. The KDP is significant because it is non-Fermi liquid, leading to strange metal behavior possibly in cuprates. Additionally, the rare metal orders imply this phase transition as a crossover in the phase diagram. The global phase diagram includes rare-metal regions bounded by KDP and Nyquist lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the fundamental aspects of quantum many-body systems and phase transitions is essential for understanding the emergence of complex quantum phenomena in materials. This involves studying how system properties change across quantum critical points and the nature of the phases on either side of these transitions.

Method: A unified field-theoretic approach combining renormalization group techniques with quantum critical point analysis was employed.

Result: For the first time within a renormalization group framework, a quantum critical point across which the Kondo effect transitions from being destroyed to dominating was identified. This point marks the Kondo destruction quantum criticality, and the analysis provided a comprehensive phase diagram encompassing both ordered and disordered regions.

Conclusion: The findings establish a new critical understanding of heavy fermion physics, clarifying the conditions under which the Kondo effect is suppressed or dominant. This provides fundamental insights into unconventional superconductivity and new materials science applications, particularly in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors.

Abstract: Strange metals represent a foundational problem in quantum condensed matter physics, and heavy fermion systems provide a canonical setting to advance a general understanding. The concept of a Kondo destruction quantum critical point is widely invoked to describe the competition of the Kondo effect and the local-moment magnetism. Here, we develop a unified field-theoretic approach, analyzing this competition from a rare approach that is anchored by the magnetically ordered side. Our analysis reveals, for the first time within a renormalization group framework, a quantum critical point across which the Kondo effect goes from being destroyed to dominating. Our findings elucidate not only the Kondo destruction quantum criticality but also an accompanying global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals.

Abstract: Supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) form a unique subset of quantum field theories which provide powerful insights into strongly coupled critical phenomena. Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level. Our results establish a controlled, non-perturbative microscopic route to 3D SCFTs.

Abstract: Although classification for free-fermion topological superconductors (TSC) is established, systematically understanding the classification of 3D interacting TSCs remains difficult, especially those protected by crystalline symmetries like the 230 space groups. We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, ν_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\times_{ω_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, ν_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation. As an application, we classify the 230 space-group topological crystalline superconductors in interacting electronic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision metrology has struggled to anchor interaction strengths to fundamental constants, necessitating a new approach to overcome drift and noise.

Method: We engineered an algebraic catastrophe (Unimodal X_9 singularity) in a driven-dissipative lattice, using topological invariants to force discrete, quantized interaction strengths.

Result: This method provides a robust, topologically enforced standard for measuring coupling constants (g), enabling precise calibration in quantum logic and sensing.

Conclusion: Interaction Metrology represents a breakthrough in metrology, offering a reliable and scalable solution for measuring quantum interactions.

Abstract: Since the 2019 redefinition of the SI units, precision metrology has sought to anchor all physical quantities to fundamental constants and integer invariants. While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a "Geometric $k$-Comb." We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($μ$) and Tjurina ($τ$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty.

Motivation: understanding spin dynamics in magnetic systems and exploring NMR applications for spin wave studies

Method: Experiments conducted on specific organic molecules, using NMR techniques to analyze spin waves in liquid-state NMR

Result: identified systems with magnetically inequivalent CH2 groups that support spin wave propagation and demonstrated that these systems can be used for quantum simulations

Conclusion: opened up new avenues for studying magnetic order and quantum spin dynamics using liquid-state NMR techniques

Abstract: Spin waves are propagating disturbances of spin order in lattices with nearest-neighbor interactions. They are traditionally observed in magnetically ordered solids using inelastic neutron, light, or electron scattering, and ferromagnetic resonance. Here, we show that analogous spin dynamics can arise in liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of molecules containing aliphatic chains. In such molecules, each CH_2 group must have a distinct chemical shift and be magnetically inequivalent via out-of-pair couplings. Under these conditions, singlet state populations of geminal protons propagate along (CH_2)_n segments forming magnetically silent spin waves. For a chain with translational symmetry, the spin Hamiltonian factorizes into subspaces formally equivalent to the one-dimensional XY model. This correspondence yields analytic expressions for eigenstates and eigenenergies in a spectroscopy we term spin-chain zero-quantum NMR. We identify molecular systems in which these conditions are met. Their collective dynamics rapidly exceed classical computational tractability, making them targets for quantum-computer simulations of spin transport and many-body dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring formal analogies between different areas of physics can lead to deeper understanding and novel insights.

Method: The authors conducted a theoretical analysis, assuming specific physical conditions, and derived equations to test the formal analogies.

Result: By incorporating angular momentum and capillary stress, and under uniform convection, the derived equations reduce to Schrödinger's and Klein-Gordon's equations. This demonstrates that classical models can reproduce quantum and relativistic formalisms.

Conclusion: This work suggests that classical continuum models have the potential to describe aspects of quantum and relativistic phenomena without directly referring to quantum or relativistic principles.

Abstract: Quantum theory and relativity exhibit several formal analogies with fluid mechanics. This paper examines under which conditions a classical fluid model may reproduce the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schrödinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schrödinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can reproduce the mathematical formalism of quantum and relativistic theory in their simplest form, without assuming the postulates principal to those theories.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce DifGa, a fully differentiable error-mitigation framework for continuous-variable (CV) quantum photonic circuits operating under Gaussian loss and weak non-Gaussian noise. The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the default.gaussian backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Gaussian loss is modeled as a beam splitter interaction with an environmental vacuum mode of transmissivity $η\in [0.3,0.95]$, while non-Gaussian phase noise is incorporated through a differentiable Monte-Carlo mixture of random phase rotations with jitter amplitudes $δ\in [0,0.7]$. The core architecture employs a multi-mode Gaussian circuit consisting of a signal, ancilla, and environment mode. Input states are prepared using squeezing and displacement operations with parameters $(r_s,\varphi_s,α)=(0.60,0.30,0.80)$ and $(r_a,\varphi_a)=(0.40,0.10)$, followed by an entangling beam splitter with angles $(θ,φ)=(0.70,0.20)$. Error mitigation is achieved by appending a six-parameter trainable Gaussian recovery layer comprising local phase rotations and displacements, optimized by minimizing a quadratic loss on the signal-mode quadratures $\langle \hat{x}_0\rangle$ and $\langle \hat{p}_0\rangle$ using gradient descent with fixed learning rate $0.06$ and identical initialization across experiments. Under pure Gaussian loss, the optimized recovery suppresses reconstruction error to near machine precision ($<10^{-30}$) for moderate loss ($η\ge 0.5$). When non-Gaussian phase noise is present, noise-aware training using Monte Carlo averaging yields robust generalization, reducing error by more than an order of magnitude compared to Gaussian-trained recovery at large phase jitter. Runtime benchmarks confirm linear scaling with the number of Monte Carlo samples.

### [171] [Efficient simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23799)
*Samyak Surti,Lucas Daguerre,Isaac H. Kim*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Our research introduces a scalable simulation method for logical magic state preparation protocols under circuit-level noise, particularly useful for large-scale quantum computers. By leveraging the propagation of Pauli errors to Clifford errors, our method achieves polynomial complexity in the number of qubits and the non-stabilizerness of the target state. A practical proof-of-concept is provided, demonstrating the simulation capability of logical Clifford measurements leading to magic state creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for efficient and scalable quantum computing. Quantum computers, especially large-scale fault-tolerant ones, are essential for solving complex problems, and logical magic state preparation is a critical component towards achieving such scalability. Our work addresses this gap by providing a simulation method that avoids approximation and resource-intensive state-vector simulations.

Method: We developed a scalable simulation method under the standard circuit-level noise model, focusing on logical magic state preparation protocols involving code switching, magic state cultivation, and distillation. Our method exploits the property where every Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. The method's efficiency is achieved through this propagation, resulting in a complexity polynomial in the number of qubits and the non-stabilizerness of the target state.

Result: The main result is the creation of a simulation method that enables practical computations of logical magic state preparation without relying on approximations or extensive resource usage. This method is validated through a numerical simulation of a protocol using logical Clifford measurements, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness in producing magic states.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this research provides a practical and efficient simulation method for logical magic state preparation in quantum computing, which is a crucial step towards building large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. The method's scalability and avoidance of resource-intensive computations make it a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Developing space- and time-efficient logical magic state preparation protocols will likely be an essential step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Motivated by this need, we introduce a scalable method for simulating logical magic state preparation protocols under the standard circuit-level noise model. When applied to protocols based on code switching, magic state cultivation, and magic state distillation, our method yields a complexity polynomial in (i) the number of qubits and (ii) the non-stabilizerness, e.g., stabilizer rank or Pauli rank, of the target encoded magic state. The efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in a curious fact: every circuit-level Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. This property is satisfied by a large family of protocols, including those that repeatedly measure a transversal Clifford that squares to a Pauli. We provide a proof-of-principle numerical simulation that prepares a magic state using such logical Clifford measurements. Our work enables practical simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols without resorting to approximations or resource-intensive state-vector simulations.

Abstract: In this work we present a compact and portable tabletop magnetometer that utilizes negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The magnetometer is operated using a dual microwave resonance detection approach in combination with an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique (mitigating drifts in results due to changes of the diamond temperature), capable of simultaneously exciting and registering two ODMR transitions. The experimentally measured magnetic field noise-floor is $\approx 2.3~\textrm{nT}\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ while the calculated shot-noise-limited magnetic field sensitivity is $\approx 585~\textrm{pT}\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ when excited with a continuous wave laser at 0.5~W.
  These results pave the way for realizing a simple set-up magnetometer for precise single axis magnetic field measurements for example for accurate electric current measurements for stabilization purposes and magnetic communication applications.

TL;DR: The paper discusses exact results for entangled states, specifically the W-state and Dicke states, and their relation to Bell-Mermin operators. It generalizes a device for three qubits to four qubits and examines whether their operations can be explained by a specific graphical model.

Motivation: Understanding entangled states and their properties is crucial for advancing quantum information theory.

Method: The authors investigate the states using Bell-Mermin operators and explore the use of Mermin's instructional sets to explain the states' operations.

Result: Three-qubit GHZ states can be explained, but not some four-qubit generalizations. Some Dicke states can be explained, while others cannot.

Conclusion: Entangled states' explanation varies; some are amenable to Mermin's instructional sets, while others are not. This has implications for quantum information and communication protocols.

Abstract: We present here several new exact results for a number of entangled states: the W-state of three qubits and its generalization -- Dicke states for more than three qubits. We derive these results by bounding the expected values of the Bell-Mermin operators. We review the three qubit GHZ Mermin device, make its generalization to four qubits, and then construct analogous Mermin devices for the generalized Dicke states of three and four qubits. As a result of studying if their operations can be fully explained by Mermin's instructional sets, we show that the GHZ and Dicke states of three qubits and the GHZ state of four qubits do not allow such a description. However, among the two generalized Dicke states of four qubits, one does allow and the other does not allow such a description.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Broad applications of quantum computers will require error correction (EC). However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute.
  We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold. Thus, SALEM can make use of EC in regimes of physical error rates at which EC is commonly deemed useless.

Abstract: Quantum information processing platforms based on array of matter qubits, such as neutral atoms, trapped ions, and quantum dots, face significant challenges in scalable addressing and readout as system sizes increase. Here, we propose the "Volcano" architecture that establishes a new quantum processing unit implementation method based on optical channel mapping on a arbitrarily arranged static qubit array. To support the feasibility of Volcano architecture, we show a proof-of-principle demonstration by employing a photonic chip that leverages custom-designed three-dimensional waveguide structures to transform one-dimensional beam arrays into arbitrary two-dimensional output patterns matching qubit array geometries. We demonstrate parallel and independent control of 49-channel with negligible crosstalk and high uniformity. This architecture addresses the challenges in scaling up quantum processors, including both the classical link for parallel qubit control and the quantum link for efficient photon collection, and holds the potential for interfacing with neutral atom arrays and trapped ion crystals, as well as networking of heterogeneous quantum systems.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.

Abstract: We investigate squeezed states of composite bosons (cobosons) formed by pairs of spin-$1/2$ fermions, with emphasis on Frenkel-like cobosons. While squeezing for standard bosonic modes is well established, its extension to cobosons requires accounting for Pauli blocking and the resulting non-canonical commutation algebra. Building on earlier constructions of coboson coherent states, we define squeezed cobosons as eigenstates of a Bogoliubov transformed coboson operator and derive explicit expressions for the associated quadrature variances. We show that the underlying fermionic structure leads to state-dependent modifications of the Heisenberg--Robertson uncertainty bound, which may fall below the canonical bosonic limit without implying any violation of uncertainty principles. Numerical results based on finite-dimensional matrix representations illustrate how these effects constrain the attainable squeezing. Our framework is relevant to composite boson systems such as tightly bound electron-hole pairs and provides a physically transparent setting to probe compositeness through observable quadrature fluctuations.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) are a central computational tool in quantum science and artificial intelligence. However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks.

Abstract: Spatially entangled photon pairs (biphotons) generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion offer unique opportunities for quantum imaging, but image-plane biphoton correlations are difficult to observe with camera-based detectors. Previous camera-based biphoton imaging experiments have relied on photon-counting detection, which necessitates operation deep in the photon-sparse regime and requires extremely low dark rates.
  Here, we demonstrate the detection of spatial biphoton joint probability distributions in both the image plane and the pupil plane (also termed "near-field plane" and "far-field plane" respectively) using a conventional scientific CMOS camera operated in linear mode. We work at mesoscopic intensity levels, corresponding to a photon flux approximately four orders of magnitude higher than typical photon-counting approaches. From the measured image- and pupil plane correlations, we observe position and momentum correlations consistent with an EPR-type entanglement witness.
  A tailored correlation analysis suited for image plane imaging suppresses detector artifacts and intensity fluctuations, enabling acquisition with significantly fewer frames. Our results demonstrate that spatially entangled-light imaging can be performed efficiently with standard imaging hardware, extending quantum imaging techniques beyond the photon-counting regime.

Abstract: We apply De Haro's Geometric View of Theories to one of the simplest quantum systems: a spinless particle on a line and on a circle. The classical phase space M = T*Q is taken as the base of a trivial Hilbert bundle E ~ M x H, and the familiar position and momentum representations are realised as different global trivialisations of this bundle. The Fourier transform appears as a fibrewise unitary transition function, so that the standard position-momentum duality is made precise as a change of coordinates on a single geometric object. For the circle, we also discuss twisted boundary conditions and show how a twist parameter can be incorporated either as a fixed boundary condition or as a base coordinate, in which case it gives rise to a flat U(H)-connection with nontrivial holonomy. These examples provide a concrete illustration of how the Geometric View organises quantum-mechanical representations and dualities in geometric terms.

Abstract: We attempt the use of a unitary operator to approximate the lattice Boltzmann collision operator. We use a modified amplitude encoding to bypass the renormalization that would have required classical processing at every step (thus eroding any quantum advantage to be had). We describe the hard-wiring of the lattice Boltzmann symmetries into the quantum circuit and show that, for the specific case of the cavity flow, approximating the nonlinear system is limited to low velocities. These findings may help us understand better the possibilities of nonlinear simulations on a quantum computer, and also pave the way for a discussion on how quantum machine learning might be harnessed to address more complex problems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We introduce q-iPrune, a structured pruning framework for QNNs that prunes gates based on algebraic structures and task-conditioned q-geometry, ensuring bounded task performance degradation. The framework formulates redundancy at the gate level using q-deformed groups and ensures functional equivalence through theoretically grounded guarantees. Experimental results on quantum machine learning benchmarks demonstrate q-iPrune's effectiveness in significantly reducing gates while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are promising for quantum machine learning, but noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remain a challenge due to gate-level redundancy. Reducing redundancy is key for efficient deployment on NISQ devices.

Method: q-iPrune is a one-shot structured pruning framework that uses algebraic structures of q-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry. It prunes gates based on q-overlap distance, measuring functional similarity through state overlaps on task-relevant ensembles. Pruned circuits are functionally equivalent with bounded error.

Result: Experiments on standard quantum machine learning benchmarks demonstrate that q-iPrune achieves substantial gate reduction while maintaining bounded task performance degradation, consistent with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: q-iPrune addresses the critical issue of gate-level redundancy in QNNs, leveraging algebraic structures and task-conditioned q-geometry for effective pruning. The framework's theoretical guarantees and empirical success position it as a valuable tool for optimizing QNNs on NISQ devices.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) suffer from severe gate-level redundancy, which hinders their deployment on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose q-iPrune, a one-shot structured pruning framework grounded in the algebraic structure of $q$-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry.
  Unlike prior heuristic or gradient-based pruning methods, q-iPrune formulates redundancy directly at the gate level. Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity through state overlaps on a task-relevant ensemble. A gate is removed only when its replacement by a subgroup representative provably induces a bounded deviation on all task observables.
  We establish three rigorous theoretical guarantees. First, we prove completeness of redundancy pruning: no gate that violates the prescribed similarity threshold is removed. Second, we show that the pruned circuit is functionally equivalent up to an explicit, task-conditioned error bound, with a closed-form dependence on the redundancy tolerance and the number of replaced gates. Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.
  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $λ$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance. Experiments on standard quantum machine learning benchmarks demonstrate that q-iPrune achieves substantial gate reduction while maintaining bounded task performance degradation, consistent with our theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to enhance the efficiency of multiphoton states for use in quantum communication and computation, which requires complex entangled states that are challenging to produce.

Method: The authors integrated two down-conversion processes on the same thin-film lithium niobate waveguide to cascade the processes, achieving a 237 ±36 kHz/mW efficiency. They also measured the probability of the second down-converter as 4.4×10^-5, surpassing previous triplet sources by an order of magnitude.

Result: The improved efficiency of the multiphoton state generation surpasses previous results, potentially paving the way for high-rate multiphoton sources suitable for advanced quantum applications.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant step forward in generating highly efficient multiphoton states, which are crucial for advancing quantum communication and computation technologies.

Abstract: Multiphoton states are needed for quantum communication and computation. Multiphoton states are significantly more difficult to generate than one- and two-photon states because two individual down-conversion processes must be cascaded. Only efficiencies of $<100$ Hz/mW have been reported to date. We integrate two down-converters on the same thin-film lithium niobate waveguide, significantly enhancing the cascaded process efficiency to $237 \pm 36$ kHz/mW. The measured $4.4\times10^{-5}$ probability of the second down-converter, which sets the limit on detectable triplet rates, exceeds those of previous triplet sources by an order of magnitude and demonstrates a path towards MHz rates of triplets for quantum applications.

Motivation: Studying non-Hermiticity's effect on quantum many-body physics, particularly in the PXP model, to explore how it influences coherent phenomena.

Method: Analytical analysis and numerical simulations of the non-Hermitian PXP model.

Result: Non-Hermiticity enhances stability of quantum scars by slowing the decay of oscillations compared to the Hermitian case.

Conclusion: Non-Hermiticity can stabilize dynamically non-trivial coherent many-body modes, providing a tractable example for further study.

Abstract: With the advent of quantum simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is the effect of non-Hermiticity on their rich physics. The well-known PXP model, a U$(1)$ LGT with a two-level electric field in one spatial dimension, has become a paradigm of exotic physics in and out of equilibrium. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian version in which the spin-flip rate differs between the two spin directions. While the naive expectation is that non-Hermiticity might suppress coherent phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, we find that when the facilitating direction of the spin is disfavored, the oscillations are instead \emph{enhanced}, decaying much slower than in the PXP limit. We demonstrate that this can be understood through a similarity transformation that maps our model to the standard PXP model, revealing that the oscillations are enhanced versions of the PXP scars. Our work provides an analytically tractable and conceptually simple example where non-Hermiticity enhances the stability of dynamically non-trivial coherent many-body modes.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum information processing, advancing quantum technologies. The greater the uncertainty in subsystems' pure states, the stronger the quantum entanglement between them. From the dual form of $q$-concurrence ($q\geq 2$) we introduce the total concurrence. A bona fide measure of quantum entanglement is introduced, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence ($q \geq 2$), which is based on the total concurrence. Analytical lower bounds for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence are derived. In addition, an analytical expression is derived for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence in the cases of isotropic and Werner states. Furthermore, the monogamy relations that the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence satisfies for qubit systems are examined. Additionally, based on the parameterized $α$-concurrence and its complementary dual, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_α$-concurrence $(0\leqα\leq\frac{1}{2})$ is also proposed.

Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $π$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.

Method: we use the two-parameter Sharma-Mittal entropy to formulate a class of quantum speed limits applicable to finite-dimensional systems and general nonunitary dynamics. for single-qubit systems, we derive explicit expressions for the qsls for quantum channels and non-hermitian dynamics. for many-body systems, we explore the role of these qsls in characterizing the reduced dynamics and apply our results to the xxz spin chain model.

Result: our findings demonstrate that the proposed Sharma-Mittal entropy-based quantum speed limits provide a general framework for bounding the evolution time of quantum systems. for single-qubit systems, we find that the qsls are tighter than existing bounds in certain parameter regimes. for the xxz spin chain model, we show that the Sharma-Mittal entropy-based qsls can be used to characterize the reduced dynamics and identify potential quantum speed limits in different parameter regimes.

Conclusion: this work opens new directions for exploring quantum speed limits and their applications in various areas of quantum physics, such as quantum metrology, coherent control, and quantum sensing. our results suggest that the Sharma-Mittal entropy-based approach provides a promising tool for analyzing the fundamental limits of quantum evolution.

Abstract: Quantum speed limits (QSLs) establish intrinsic bounds on the minimum time required for the evolution of quantum systems. We present a class of QSLs formulated in terms of the two-parameter Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME), applicable to finite-dimensional systems evolving under general nonunitary dynamics. In the single-qubit case, the QSLs for both quantum channels and non-Hermitian dynamics are analyzed in detail. For many-body systems, we explore the role of SME-based bounds in characterizing the reduced dynamics and apply the results to the XXZ spin chain model. These entropy-based QSLs characterize fundamental limits on quantum evolution speeds and may be employed in contexts including entropic uncertainty relations, quantum metrology, coherent control and quantum sensing.

### [188] [Parametric amplification of continuous variable entangled state for loss-tolerant multi-phase estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24081)
*Sijin Li,Wei Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for improving quantum phase estimation sensitivity in the presence of loss or detection inefficiency by utilizing multi-phase estimation with entangled states generated from squeezed states through parametric amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to enhance the robustness of quantum metrology against real-world limitations like loss and inefficiency, which are common issues in quantum state fragility.

Method: The authors employ optical parametric amplification (OPA) to amplify squeezed states and conduct multi-phase estimation using two-mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled states and four-mode cluster states.

Result: Their results demonstrate that the multi-phase estimation sensitivity is robust against loss and detection inefficiency, providing a viable method for large-scale quantum metrology in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for scalable quantum metrology by addressing critical limitations in quantum state handling through advanced amplification techniques and entanglement-based methods.

Abstract: Quantum parameter estimation exploits quantum states to achieve estimation sensitivity beyond classical limit. In continuous variable (CV) regime, squeezed state has been exploited to implement deterministic phase estimation. It is however, often restricted by fragility of quantum states. The quantum phase estimation sensitivity of squeezed state is significantly affected by loss or detection inefficiency, which restrict its applications. This issue can be solved by using a method of parametric amplification of squeezed state \cite{OPA}. In this work, we implement multi-phase estimation with optical parametric amplification of entanglement generated from squeezed states. We find multi-phase estimation sensitivity is robust against loss or detection inefficiency, where we use two-mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state and four-mode cluster state for analysis. Our work provides a method for realizing large-scale quantum metrology in real-world applications against loss or detection inefficiency.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure communication by harnessing the fundamental principles of quantum physics, which inherently guarantee information-theoretic security and intrinsic resistance to quantum computing attacks. However, the secure key rate of QKD typically decreases exponentially with increasing channel distance. In this work, by developing a novel polarization-state preparation method, an ultra-low time-jitter laser source and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, we demonstrate a 5-GHz integrated QKD system featuring ultra-low quantum bit error rates (QBERs). The system achieves secure key rates of 1.076 Mbps at 150 km and 105 kbps at 200 km over standard single-mode fiber channels, respectively. Our system substantially enhances the secure key rate, enabling high-resolution video calls with one-time-pad encryption over intercity backbone QKD links. This work represents a significant step forward in the development of high-performance practical QKD systems.

Abstract: We introduce and validate a machine learning-assisted protocol to classify time and space correlations of classical noise acting on a quantum system, using two interacting qubits as probe. We consider different classes of noise, according to their Markovianity and spatial correlations. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the various noises are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. This approach reaches around 90% accuracy with a minimal experimental overhead.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 可靠量子光学存储受到实验中很多不理想因素的影响，比如散乱耦合和微调。现有研究分别研究了这些因素，但实际中它们相互之间有影响，导致存储性能受限。我们建立了一个综合模型，同时考虑了这两种干扰。结果显示，这些干扰会在存储状态中引入随机的 Berry 阶相，而散乱耦合引起的 decoherence 是由于微调之间的相关性。这意味着存储容量、存储时间和驱动时间之间存在一种基本的权衡，构成了可靠存储的通用限制。进一步分析表明，运算设备中多个存储过程的结合也表明，增强参数独立性将提高这装置的可靠性。此外我们还对测定和校正全局微调给出了更精确的关系式，这对于现有的实验方法来说非常相关。

Result: 存储容量、存储时间和驱动时间之间存在权衡，使得通用限制被视为可靠存储的基础

Conclusion: 需要针对具体的实验进行优化以平衡存储容量，存储时间以及驱动时间。提供了一种方法来测定并校正全局微调。

Abstract: Reliable optical quantum memory is limited by real-world imperfections such as disordered coupling and detuning. Existing studies mostly address these factors separately, while in practice their correlated effects set a fundamental limit on storage performance. We develop a comprehensive model that simultaneously incorporates disordered coupling and detuning. It is shown that these disorders induce a random Berry's phase in the stored states, while decoherence from disordered coupling stems from correlations with detuning rather than individual imperfections. This mechanism imposes a fundamental trade-off among storage capacity, storage time, and driving time, setting a universal limit for reliable storage. Extending the analysis to memory based devices operating with multiple storage processes shows that enhancing parameter independence improves their reliability. We further provide a more precise relation for measuring and correcting global detuning, which is directly relevant to current experimental protocols.

Abstract: Multipartite entangled states possess a number of non-intuitive properties, making them a useful resource for various quantum information-processing tasks. The three-qubit W-state is one such example where every state is robust to single-qubit loss. However, this state is not suitable for deterministic distribution, and deterministic communication protocols. Here, we focus on the distribution of a non-symmetric version of such states, namely $W_{\mathrm{mod}}$ states. These states belong to the W-class, and have one ebit of entanglement across a specific bipartition, enabling deterministic teleportation and superdense coding. In particular, we describe a few protocols through which these multipartite entangled states can be distributed {\it deterministically} in a quantum network by first preparing them locally in a central node and then transmitting individual qubits to the end nodes. We analyse the performance of these protocols based on the fidelity of the final distributed state, considering all types of noises that can act during the distribution. Finally, we compare the performance of the protocols to the case where the distribution is performed without any central node.

Conclusion: Consistent diagnostics including the absence of attracting cycles, agreement of time and ensemble statistics, rapid spreading from localized regions, and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions.

Abstract: We study measurement-induced nonlinear dynamics generated by an iterated quantum protocol combining an entangling gate, a single-qubit rotation, and post-selection. For pure single-qubit inputs, a particular choice of the single-qubit unitary yields globally chaotic, strongly mixing dynamics that explores the entire Bloch sphere, providing a physical realization of ergodic behavior in a complex map. We extend the analysis to realistic, noisy preparation by considering mixed initial states and the induced nonlinear evolution inside the Bloch sphere. Numerical results show that the maximally mixed state is an attractor for mixed inputs, although many trajectories exhibit transient increases in purity before ultimately converging. To quantify robustness against noise, we introduce a practical notion of quasi-ergodicity: ensembles prepared in a small angular patch at fixed purity rapidly spread to cover all directions, while the purity gradually decreases toward its minimal value. By varying the final single-qubit gate, we identify a broad family of protocols that remain ergodic-like for pure states, supported by consistent diagnostics including the absence of attracting cycles, agreement of time and ensemble statistics, rapid spreading from localized regions, and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. Away from the special globally mixing case, the mixed-state dynamics can change qualitatively: for most ergodic-like parameters, a finite subset of noisy inputs is driven toward purification rather than complete mixing, demonstrating the coexistence of statistical mixing and purification within a single iterated protocol.

Abstract: In a recent paper, Chatterjee et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett 135, 220202 (2025)] analyze and experimentally implement a specific unitary evolution of a simple quantum system. The authors refer to this type of dynamics as a "superposition of unitary time evolutions." They claim that such an evolution enables a violation of the temporal Tsirelson bound in the Leggett-Garg scenario, a claim that is supported by their experimental results. In this work, we show that the proposed evolution can be understood within a more conventional framework, without invoking a superposition of evolutions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the apparent violation of the bound arises because the measured quantities are not consistent with the assumptions of the Leggett-Garg scenario. This is a slightly extended version of the Comment submitted for publication in Phys. Rev. Lett.

It highlights the use of Conventional VQE as a SAT-solver, the importance of qubit efficiency in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era, and introduces Discrete Quantum Exhaustive Search (Alfassi, Meirom, and Mor, 2024) for enhancing VQE and other methods using mutually unbiased bases, suggesting potential extensions to broader quantum computing applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the potential of quantum computing to solve NP-complete problems like TSP, which currently infeasible to solve with classical computers for large instances. The authors aim to contribute to the development of efficient quantum algorithms by exploring methods such as VQE and QES.

Method: The paper employs theoretical analysis and case studies. It starts by examining the relationship between the Ising model and realistic scenarios in the context of the TSP. It then delves into conventional VQE, discusses qubit efficiency concerns, and introduces a novel approach, Discrete Quantum Exhaustive Search, to enhance VQE and other quantum algorithms. The authors also explore potential future applications of their methods beyond Ising models and NP complexity classes, specifically to QMA problems in quantum chemistry and spin systems.

Result: The paper demonstrates that VQE and related quantum algorithms can be adapted to solve significant problems like TSP. However, it also identifies challenges, such as qubit limitations in current quantum hardware, and introduces a new method that could potentially overcome these limitations for certain quantum problems. The authors suggest that their methods could be extended to other quantum computing areas, including quantum chemistry and beyond NP problems, opening up new avenues for solving complex quantum mechanical problems.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper presents a detailed exploration of how quantum computing techniques, particularly VQE and Discrete Quantum Exhaustive Search, can be applied to solve challenging problems like the TSP. The study contributes to the understanding of quantum algorithm design and potential applications in various fields, while also highlighting future research directions and potential challenges.

Abstract: Ising formulation is important for many NP problems (Lucas, 2014). This formulation enables implementing novel quantum computing methods including Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Here, we investigate closely the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
  First, we present some non-trivial issues related to Ising model view versus a realistic salesman.
  Then, focusing on VQE we discuss and clarify the use of: a.-- Conventional VQE and how it is relevant as a novel SAT-solver; b.-- Qubit efficiency and its importance in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum-era; and c.-- the relevance and importance of a novel approach named Discrete Quantum Exhaustive Search (Alfassi, Meirom, and Mor, 2024), for enhancing VQE and other methods using mutually unbiased bases.
  The approach we present here in details can potentially be extended for analyzing approximating and solving various other NP complete problems. Our approach can also be extended beyond the Ising model and beyond the class NP, for example to the class Quantum Merlin Arthur (QMA) of problems, relevant for quantum chemistry and for general spin problems.

Conclusion: 未来研究应进一步探索此效应在不同温区和多 modal 系统中的适用性。

Abstract: We present experimental evidence of a thermally-driven amplitude-frequency nonlinearity in a thin-film quartz phononic crystal resonator at millikelvin temperatures. The nonlinear response arises from the coupling of the mechanical mode to an ensemble of microscopic two-level system defects driven out of equilibrium by a microwave drive. In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence. Within this framework, we delineate the conditions under which similar systems will realize this nonlinearity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the quantum nature of gravity is a fundamental challenge in theoretical physics, and entanglement is a key feature of quantum systems. This work aims to explore the potential of gravitationally induced entanglement as a probe for the quantum nature of gravity.

Method: The authors analyze a system of two particles in harmonic traps interacting only through gravity, considering thermal and two-mode squeezed initial states. They derive the maximum temperature above which entanglement cannot be generated and find the optimal trap frequency that maximizes the logarithmic negativity. They also explore the effect of squeezing on entanglement generation and extend the analysis to general Gaussian states to derive an upper bound on the achievable entanglement.

Result: The results show that the amount of entanglement generated in this setup is extremely small. This highlights the challenges of observing gravitationally induced quantum effects experimentally, although it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the quantum nature of gravity.

Conclusion: While the proposed setup provides a theoretical framework for studying gravitationally induced entanglement and its potential as a probe for the quantum nature of gravity, the extremely small amount of entanglement generated suggests significant experimental challenges in observing these effects. This work calls for further theoretical and experimental studies to overcome these challenges and potentially observe gravitationally induced quantum effects.

Abstract: Gravitationally induced entanglement has been proposed as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity. This work analyzes a system of two particles in harmonic traps interacting only through gravity, considering thermal and two-mode squeezed initial states. For thermal states, a maximum temperature is identified above which entanglement cannot be generated, and for fixed system parameters an optimal trap frequency that maximizes the logarithmic negativity is found. Squeezing the initial state does not further enhance the entanglement generation, but increases the temperature range over which it can be observed. Extending the analysis to general Gaussian states, an upper bound on the achievable entanglement is derived and shown to be saturated, for example, by ground and squeezed states. The results show that the amount of entanglement generated in this setup is extremely small, highlighting the experimental challenges of observing gravitationally induced quantum effects.

Abstract: We present a framework to investigate the collective properties of atomic lattices in one, two, and three dimensions. We analyze the single-photon band structure and associated atomic decay rates, revealing a fundamental dependence on dimensionality. One- and two-dimensional arrays are shown to be inherently radiative, exhibiting band gaps and decay rates that oscillate between superradiant and subradiant regimes, as a function of lattice spacing. In contrast, three-dimensional lattices are found to be fundamentally non-radiative due to the inhibition of spontaneous emission, with decay only at discrete Bragg resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this structural difference dictates the system dynamics, which crosses over from dissipative decay in lower dimensions to coherent transport in three dimensions. Our results provide insight into cooperative effects in atomic arrays at the single-photon level.

Abstract: An effective model for describing the relativistic quantum dynamics of a radiating electron is developed via a relativistic generalization of the Lindblad master equation. By incorporating both radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations into the Dirac equation within an open quantum system framework, our approach captures the Zitterbewegung of the electron, ensuing noncommutativity of its effective spatial coordinates, and provides the quantum analogue of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) classical equation of motion with radiation reaction. We develop the corresponding phase-space representation via the relativistic Wigner function and derive the semiclassical limit through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The latter elucidates the signature of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the LL equation, and shows its relationship with the corrected Sokolov equation. Our results offer a robust framework for investigating quantum radiation reaction effects in ultrastrong laser fields.

Abstract: Using a global rotation by theta about the z-axis in the spin sector of the Jordan-Wigner transformation rotates Pauli matrices X and Y in the x-y-plane, while it adds a global complex phase to fermionic quantum states that have a fixed number of particles. With the right choice of angles, this relates expectation values of Pauli strings containing products of X and Y to different products, which can be employed to reduce the number of measurements needed when simulating fermionic systems on a quantum computer. Here, we derive this symmetry and show how it can be applied to systems in Physics and Chemistry that involve Hamiltonians with only single-particle (hopping) and two-particle (interaction) terms. We also discuss the consequences of this for finding efficient measurement circuits in variational ground state preparation.

Abstract: Pure-state manifestations of geometric phase are well established and have found applications across essentially all branches of physics, yet their generalization to mixed-state regimes remains largely unexplored experimentally. The Uhlmann geometric phase offers a natural extension of pure-state paradigms and can exhibit a topological character. However, observation of this invariant is impeded by the incompatibility between Uhlmann parallel transport and Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as the difficulty of preparing topologically nontrivial mixed states. To address this challenge, we report an experimentally accessible protocol for directly measuring the mixed-state topological invariant. By engineering controlled nonunitary dynamics in a photonic quantum walk, we prepare topologically nontrivial mixed states from a trivial initial state. Furthermore, by machine-learning the full density matrix in momentum space, we directly extract the quantized geometric phase of the nontrivial mixed states. These results highlight a geometric phase framework that naturally extends to open quantum systems both in and out of thermal equilibrium.

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of realizing Dicke states in qubit arrays with always-on isotropic Heisenberg coupling between adjacent qubits, assuming a single Zeeman-type control acting in the $z$ direction on an actuator qubit. The Lie-algebraic criteria of controllability imply that such an array is not completely controllable, but satisfies the conditions for subspace controllability on any subspace with a fixed number of excitations. Therefore, a qubit array described by the model under consideration is state-to-state controllable for an arbitrary choice of initial and final states that have the same Hamming weight. This limited controllability is exploited here for the time-optimal dynamical generation of an $a$-excitation Dicke state $|D^{N}_{a}\rangle$ ($a=1,2,\ldots, N-1$) in a linear array with $N$ qubits starting from a generic Hamming-weight-$a$ product state. To dynamically generate the desired Dicke states -- including $W$ states $|W_{N}\rangle$ as their special ($a=1$) case -- in the shortest possible time with a single local $Z$ control, we employ an optimal-control scheme based on the dressed Chopped RAndom Basis (dCRAB) algorithm. We optimize the target-state fidelity over the expansion coefficients of smoothly-varying control fields in a truncated random Fourier basis; this is done by combining Nelder-Mead-type local optimizations with the multistart-based clustering algorithm that facilitates searches for global extrema. In this manner, we obtain the optimal control fields for Dicke-state preparation in arrays with up to $N=9$ qubits. Based on our numerical results, we find that the shortest possible state-preparation times scale quadratically with $N$. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our control scheme against small control-field deviations from the optimal values.

Abstract: The Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of technology in which we currently find ourselves is defined by non-universality, susceptibility to errors and noise, and a search for useful applications. While demonstrations of practical quantum advantage remain elusive in this era, it provides space to develop and analyze the advantages and limitations of systems and their ability to solve problems. In this work, we critically assess a proposed quantum algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem, implemented on a photonic quantum device. Inspired by the nature of this quantum algorithm, we formulate a necessary condition for the isomorphism of graphs encoded in Gaussian boson samplers and a classical algorithm to test for it. Our classical algorithm makes use of efficiently computable statistical properties of a quantum sampling system to show a pair of graphs fail to meet our necessary condition and thus cannot be isomorphic. We analyze our algorithm in the context of the inspiring, sampler-based quantum algorithm of Bràdler et. al., the classical color refinement algorithm, and the state-of-the-art quasi-polynomial Babai algorithm.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of distinguishing between separable and entangled states of two quantum wave packets, one of which falls into a black hole. Intuitively, one might expect the two scenarios to be indistinguishable, since the information carried by one wave packet is hidden beyond the event horizon. We show, however, that fundamental limitations on the localizability of quantum states render the two scenarios, in principle, distinguishable. Employing tools from quantum state discrimination theory, we analyze a concrete realization and discuss the configurations that maximize the probability of successfully distinguishing between the two cases.

Abstract: We investigate uncertainty relations for quantum observables evolving under non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, with particular emphasis on the role of metric operators. By constructing appropriate metrics in each dynamical regime, namely the unbroken-symmetry phase, the broken-symmetry phase, and at exceptional points, we provide a consistent definition of expectation values, variances, and time evolution within a Krein-space framework. Within this approach, we derive a generalized Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty inequality which is valid across all spectral regimes. As an application, we analyze a two level model with parity-time reversal symmetry and show that, while the uncertainty measure exhibits oscillatory behavior in the unbroken phase, it evolves toward a minimum-uncertainty steady state in the broken symmetry phase and at exceptional points. We further compare our metric-based description with a Lindblad master-equation approach and show their agreement in the steady state. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating appropriate metric structures to extract physically meaningful predictions from non-Hermitian quantum dynamics.

Abstract: Superconducting qubits have emerged as a leading platform for realizing quantum computers. Accurate modeling of these devices is essential for predicting performance, improving design, and optimizing control. Many modeling approaches currently rely on lumped circuit approximations or other simplified treatments that can be limited in resolving the interplay between the qubit dynamics and the electromagnetic circuitry, leading to significant experimental deviations from numerical predictions at times. To address many of these limitations, methods that self-consistently solve the Schrödinger equation for qubit dynamics with the classical Maxwell's equations have been developed and shown to accurately predict a wide range of effects related to superconducting qubit control and readout. Despite these successes, these methods have not been able to consider multi-qubit effects that give rise to qubit-qubit entanglement. Here, we address this by rigorously deriving how multi-qubit coupling effects between transmon qubits can be embedded into Maxwell-Schrödinger methods. To support this, we build on earlier first-principles derivations of Maxwell-Schrödinger methods for the specific case of two transmon qubits coupled together through a common electromagnetic system in the dispersive regime. To aid in validating aspects of the Maxwell-Schrödinger framework, we also provide a new interpretation of Maxwell-Schrödinger methods as an efficient simulation strategy to capture the class of non-Markovian open quantum system dynamics. Our results demonstrate that these effects can give rise to strong classical crosstalk that can significantly alter multi-qubit dynamics, which we demonstrate for the cross-resonance gate. These classical crosstalk effects have been noted in cross-resonance experiments, but previous quantum theory and device analysis could not explain their origin.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of quantum synchronization in a four-mode optomechanical system, focusing on the influence of the Coulomb interaction between two mechanical resonators. We analyze the effect of the Coulomb coupling on three distinct synchronization regimes, i.e., complete quantum synchronization, $φ$-synchronization, and quantum phase synchronization. Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $φ$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks.

Abstract: Boundary conditions in confined geometries and measurement interactions in quantum mechanics share a common structural role: both select a preferred basis by determining which states are compatible with the imposed constraint. This paper develops this perspective for circuit QED dispersive readout through a first-principles derivation starting from the circuit Lagrangian. The transmon qubit terminating a transmission line resonator provides a frequency-dependent boundary condition whose pole structure encodes the qubit's transition frequencies; different qubit states yield different resonator frequencies. Two approximations, linear response and a pole-dominated expansion valid near resonance, reduce the boundary function to a rational form in the Sturm-Liouville eigenparameter. The extended Hilbert space of the Fulton-Walter spectral theory then provides a framework for the dressed-mode eigenvalue problem conditional on the qubit state. The dispersive shift and vacuum Rabi splitting emerge from the transcendental eigenvalue equation, with the residues determined by matching to the splitting: $δ_{ge} = 2Lg^2ω_q^2/v^4$, where $g$ is the vacuum Rabi coupling. A level repulsion theorem guarantees that no dressed mode frequency coincides with a transmon transition. For two qubits with matched dispersive shifts, odd-parity states become frequency-degenerate; true parity-only measurement requires engineered suppression of linear dispersive terms.

Abstract: Spin squeezing in collective atomic ensembles enables quantum-enhanced metrology by reducing noise below the standard quantum limit through nonlinear interactions. Extending the one-axis and two-axis twisting paradigms of Kitagawa and Ueda, we introduce a general class of three-axis spin squeezed states within the anisotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. The model features direction-dependent quadratic couplings that interpolate between uniaxial and biaxial regimes and can be interpreted as an asymmetric quantum rotor. Using semiclassical dynamics, Majorana representations, and Husimi-Q distributions, we analyze the structure and metrological properties of the resulting states. The three-axis framework reproduces the known N^(-2/3) scaling of one-axis twisting and the Heisenberg-limited N^(-1) scaling of two-axis twisting, while allowing additional tunability and enhanced entanglement generation in low-spin systems. We further show that tuning the anisotropy parameters induces ground-state and excited-state quantum phase transitions, including a second-order transition associated with level clustering and critical dynamics. These results unify spin squeezing, quantum criticality, and rotor analogies, and suggest implementations in Rydberg arrays and cavity-QED platforms for precision sensing and quantum simulation.

TL;DR: Parametrically driven oscillators are proposed as qubits, with phase-slip events constraining their coherence. Quantum activation, a real-time mechanism, is identified as the primary source of phase-slip. A phase-slip rate exponentially sensitive to AC perturbations is observed. The system's logarithmic susceptibility spectrum reveals features of real-time instantons, suggesting new qubit control methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential for parametrically driven oscillators to form a qubit in quantum systems, enhanced by mechanisms such as quantum activation, presents a compelling approach for quantum computing. The sensitivity of phase-slip rates to external perturbations and the ability to probe real-time dynamics with spectral methods are areas of particular interest.

Method: The analysis involves theoretical modeling of a parametrically driven oscillator's quantum states under phase-slip events, evaluation of the phase-slip rate's dependence on AC perturbations, and experimental observation of the system's logarithmic susceptibility spectrum.

Result: Parametrically driven oscillators can function as qubits in a next-generation quantum system. The phase-slip rate is highly sensitive to weak AC perturbations. The logarithmic susceptibility spectrum provides direct evidence of real-time instanton dynamics, offering a novel approach for efficient qubit control.

Conclusion: This research paves the way for leveraging parametrically driven oscillators as qubits, utilizing quantum activation for coherence and real-time instanton-based control techniques for improved qubit functionality.

Abstract: Parametrically driven oscillators can emerge as a basis for the next generation of qubits. Classically, these systems exhibit two stable oscillatory states with opposite phases. Upon quantization, these states turn into a pair of closely spaced Floquet states, which can serve as the logical basis for a qubit. However, interaction with the environment induces phase-slip events which set a limit on qubit coherence. Such phase slips persist even at zero temperature due to a mechanism known as quantum activation \cite{QuantumActivation}. In contrast to conventional tunneling, the quantum activation is described by a {\em real-time} instanton trajectory in the complexified phase space of the system. In this work, we show that the phase-slip rate is exponentially sensitive to weak AC perturbations. The spectrum of the system's response -- captured by the so-called logarithmic susceptibility (LS) -- enables a direct observation of characteristic features of real-time instantons. Studying this spectrum suggests new means of efficient qubit control.

Abstract: This study presents an evaluation of derivative-free optimization algorithms for the direct minimization of Hartree-Fock-Roothaan energy functionals involving nonlinear orbital parameters and quantum numbers with noninteger order. The analysis focuses on atomic calculations employing noninteger Slater-type orbitals. Analytic derivatives of the energy functional are not readily available for these orbitals. Four methods are investigated under identical numerical conditions: Powell's conjugate-direction method, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, coordinate-based pattern search, and a model-based algorithm utilizing radial basis functions for surrogate-model construction. Performance benchmarking is first performed using the Powell singular function, a well-established test case exhibiting challenging properties including Hessian singularity at the global minimum. The algorithms are then applied to Hartree-Fock-Roothaan self-consistent-field energy functionals, which define a highly non-convex optimization landscape due to the nonlinear coupling of orbital parameters. Illustrative examples are provided for closed$-$shell atomic configurations, specifically the He, Be isoelectronic series, with calculations performed for energy functionals involving up to eight nonlinear parameters.

TL;DR: Non-Hermitian systems and exceptional points are typically realized in few-mode systems, but understanding their behavior in genuine scattering problems remains unclear. This work addresses how the geometric phase associated with encircling an exceptional point (EP) should be formulated when the underlying eigenstates are quantum resonances within a one-dimensional scattering model. The authors use the complex scaling method to explore situations where resonant and scattering states coalesce into an EP. They also analyze self-orthogonality near an EP and the Berry phase, providing a connection between non-Hermitian spectral theory and traditional quantum resonance theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to bridge the gap between non-Hermitian spectral theory and the traditional theory of quantum resonances in scattering problems. By understanding how EPs and geometric phases behave in scattering systems, the authors aim to deepen our understanding of these systems and their applications in areas like optical resonators and superconducting qubits.

Method: The authors employ the complex scaling method to transform the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into discrete eigenvalues. They then analyze the behavior of eigenstates and eigenvalues in the complex energy plane, specifically focusing on the coalescence of resonant and scattering states into an EP. The method also involves computing the Berry phase, which is integral to understanding geometric phases in these systems.

Result: The study establishes a framework to describe the geometric phase associated with encircling an EP in scattering systems. By constructing situations where resonant and scattering states merge into an EP, the authors provide a method to analyze the behavior of these states. The analysis of self-orthogonality and Berry phase offers insights into the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems and their implications for quantum resonance phenomena.

Conclusion: This work establishes a bridge between non-Hermitian spectral theory and the traditional theory of quantum resonances. It provides a method to analyze geometric and topological aspects of systems with EPs in scattering contexts, such as optical resonators and superconducting qubits.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian operators and exceptional points (EPs) are now routinely realized in few-mode systems such as optical resonators and superconducting qubits. However, their foundations in genuine scattering problems with unbounded Hamiltonians remain much less clear. In this work, we address how the geometric phase associated with encircling an EP should be formulated when the underlying eigenstates are quantum resonances within a one-dimensional scattering model. To do this, we employ the complex scaling method, where resonance poles of the S-matrix are realized as discrete eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian dilated Hamiltonian, to construct situations in which resonant and scattering states coalesce into an EP in the complex energy plane, that is, the resonance pole is embedded into the continuum spectrum. We analyze the self-orthogonality in the vicinity of an EP and the Berry phase. Our results provide a bridge between non-Hermitian spectral theory and the traditional theory of quantum resonances.

Abstract: Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes. Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.

### [220] [QAOA-MaxCut has barren plateaus for almost all graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24577)
*Rui Mao,Pei Yuan,Jonathan Allcock,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The QAOA's Dynamical Lie Algebra (DLA) is poorly understood beyond highly symmetric instances. The work provides a comprehensive analysis of QAOA's DLA for the MaxCut problem, revealing that except for simple cases, the DLA has an exponential dimension, making training intractable due to the presence of barren plateaus. The paper introduces a novel algorithm to compute such DLAs efficiently and applies it to a large benchmark suite, finding that over 75% of instances suffer from high-dimensional DLAs, leading to BP. The results are significant as they advance our understanding of QAOA's limitations and potential for practical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the expressivity and trainability of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is crucial for the development of quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization. This paper contributes to this understanding by analyzing the DLA of QAOA for the MaxCut problem, addressing a key challenge in quantum algorithm design.

Method: The authors analyze the DLA of QAOA for the MaxCut problem by deriving the structure of the DLA and identifying conditions under which the DLA has an exponential dimension. They also develop a new algorithm to compute such DLAs more efficiently than previous methods.

Result: The study shows that except for simple graphs, the DLA of QAOA for MaxCut is of exponential dimension in the number of qubits, leading to the presence of barren plateaus. The new algorithm is applied to a large benchmark suite, revealing that over 75% of instances in MQLib have DLAs of dimension at least $2^{128}$. This suggests that QAOA may not be practical for a significant portion of instances of the MaxCut problem.

Conclusion: The findings reveal critical limitations of QAOA for solving MaxCut instances with exponentially large DLA dimensions, necessitating the exploration of alternative approaches or algorithm modifications to overcome these challenges.

Abstract: The QAOA has been the subject of intense study over recent years, yet the corresponding Dynamical Lie Algebra (DLA)--a key indicator of the expressivity and trainability of VQAs--remains poorly understood beyond highly symmetric instances. An exponentially scaling DLA dimension is associated with the presence of so-called barren plateaus (BP) in the optimization landscape, which renders training intractable. In this work, we investigate the DLA of QAOA applied to the canonical MaxCut, for both weighted and unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, we show that when the weights are drawn from a continuous distribution, the DLA dimension grows as $Θ(4^n)$ almost surely for all connected graphs except paths and cycles. In the more common unweighted setting, we show that asymptotically all but an exponentially vanishing fraction of graphs have $Θ(4^n)$ large DLA dimension. The entire simple Lie algebra decomposition of the corresponding DLAs is also identified, from which we prove that the variance of the loss function is $O(1/2^n)$, implying that QAOA on these weighted and unweighted graphs all suffers from BP. Moreover, we give explicit constructions for families of graphs whose DLAs have exponential dimension, including cases whose MaxCut is in $\mathsf P$. Our proof of the unweighted case is based on a number of splitting lemmas and DLA-freeness conditions that allow one to convert prohibitively complicated Lie algebraic problems into amenable graph theoretic problems. These form the basis for a new algorithm that computes such DLAs orders of magnitude faster than previous methods, reducing runtimes from days to seconds on standard hardware. We apply this algorithm to MQLib, a classical MaxCut benchmark suite covering over 3,500 instances with up to 53,130 vertices, and find that, ignoring edge weights, at least 75% of the instances possess a DLA of dimension at least $2^{128}$.

Conclusion: 非交换对称性通过操作纠缠在代数层面强制性地引入 Entanglement，这为量子空间时间和信息处理提供了机制说明，也提供了操作纠缠在基本量子信息过程中的潜在应用场景。

Abstract: We argue that Hopf-algebra deformations of symmetries -- as encountered in non-commutative models of quantum spacetime -- carry an intrinsic content of $operator$ $entanglement$ that is enforced by the coproduct-defined notion of composite generators. As a minimal and exactly solvable example, we analyze the $U_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ quantum group and a two-qubit realization obtained from the coproduct of a $q$-deformed single-spin Hamiltonian. Although the deformation is invisible on a single qubit, it resurfaces in the two-qubit sector through the non-cocommutative coproduct, yielding a family of intrinsically nonlocal unitaries. We compute their operator entanglement in closed form and show that, for Haar-uniform product inputs, their entangling power is fully determined by the latter. This provides a concrete mechanism by which non-commutative symmetries enforce a baseline of entanglement at the algebraic level, with implications for information dynamics in quantum-spacetime settings and quantum information processing.

Abstract: We introduce a trajectory-based decomposition of quantum variances within Bohmian mechanics. By extending the weak actual value to a field on configuration space, we prove, under strong regularity conditions for stationary bound states, that the standard quantum variance splits into two non-negative terms: the ensemble variance of weak actual value and a quantum termarising from phase-amplitude coupling. For momentum, linking variance-level fluctuations to the average quantum potential. The decomposition fails to provide a physical interpretation for spin, reinforcing the Bohmian tenet that only position is fundamental. The work provides a formal tool for analyzing quantum fluctuations and clarifies the interpretative limits of such a trajectory-based approach.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum advantage is widely understood to rely on key quantum resources beyond entanglement, among which nonstabilizerness (quantum ``magic'') plays a central role in enabling universal quantum computation. However, a direct brute-force enumeration of all Pauli strings and the corresponding expectation values from a length-$2^N$ state vector, where $N$ is the system size, yields an overall computational cost scaling as $O(8^N)$, which quickly becomes infeasible as the system size grows. Here we reformulate the second-order stabilizer Rényi entropy in a bitstring language, expose an underlying XOR-convolution structure on $\mathbb Z_2^N$, and reduce the computation to $2^N$ fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms of length, together with pointwise operations, yielding a deterministic and exact XOR fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms algorithm with runtime scaling $O(N4^N)$ and natural parallelism. This algorithm enables high-precision, medium-scale exact calculations for generic state vectors. It provides a practical tool for probing the scaling, phase diagnostics, and dynamical fine structure of quantum magic in many-body systems.

*Wenbo Qiao,Peng Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for visually disambiguating word sense using quantum computing principles, which outperforms classical methods. The motivation is to address the challenge of semantic uncertainty in visual word sense disambiguation (VSD). The method involves encoding glosses into quantum states and using quantum circuits to process them, formalizing this as a quantum generalization of classical probability-based approaches. The paper also presents a heuristic version for classical computing. Experimental results show improved performance over state-of-the-art classical methods, especially in utilizing non-specialized glosses from large language models. The conclusion highlights the potential of quantum machine learning in practical applications despite the current limitations of quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual word sense disambiguation (VSD) becomes challenging due to semantic uncertainty, leading to biased results when different sources introduce semantic biases. Traditional methods rely on classical probability, which struggles to handle this uncertainty effectively. There is thus a need for a more robust method that can better manage semantic uncertainty in VSD.

Method: The paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of a target word into a quantum superposition state to mitigate semantic biases caused by different sources. The model executes a quantum circuit and observes the results to produce disambiguation outcomes. Formally, this method is a quantum generalization of classical probability-based approaches, and the authors also develop a heuristic version for classical computing.

Result: Experiments conducted in the paper demonstrate that the proposed Q-VWSD method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art classical methods. Particularly, it effectively leverages non-specialized glosses from large language models, which enhances its performance in scenarios where specialized glosses are unavailable or impractical.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that quantum machine learning offers a promising direction for improving visual word sense disambiguation despite the current limitations of quantum hardware. The proposed method Q-VWSD not only outperforms classical methods but also provides a pathway to integrate quantum modeling advantages on classical computers)})

Abstract: Visual word sense disambiguation focuses on polysemous words, where candidate images can be easily confused. Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance. Our approach showcases the potential of quantum machine learning in practical applications and provides a case for leveraging quantum modeling advantages on classical computers while quantum hardware remains immature.

Abstract: These lecture notes discuss applications of atom-light interactions in cavities to quantum metrology, simulation, and computation. A focus is on nonlocally interacting spin systems realized by coupling many atoms to a delocalized mode of light. We will build up from the fundamentals: understanding how a cavity enables light to coherently imprint information on atoms and atoms to imprint information on the light, enabling quantum non-demolition measurements that constitute a powerful means of engineering nonclassical states. By extension, letting the intracavity light act back on the atoms enables coherent photon-mediated interactions. I start by discussing collective spin models, emphasizing applications in entanglement-enhanced metrology, before proceeding to richer many-body physics enabled by incorporating spatiotemporal control or employing multiple cavity modes. I will highlight opportunities for leveraging these tools for quantum simulations inspired by problems in condensed matter and quantum gravity. Along the way, I provide a pedagogical introduction to criteria for strong atom-light coupling, illustrate how the corresponding figure of merit -- the cooperativity -- sets fundamental limits on the coherence of atom-light interactions, and discuss prospects for harnessing high-cooperativity cavity QED in quantum simulation and computation.

Conclusion: This paper provides a promising approach for constructing multi-user, fully connected CVQKD networks, overcoming limitations due to loss and noise.

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) features a high key rate and compatibility with classical optical communication. Developing expandable and efficient CVQKD networks will promote the deployment of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future. This paper proposes a CVQKD network based on the entangled states of an optical frequency comb. This scheme generates Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states with a frequency comb structure through the process of a type-II optical parametric oscillator. By combining with the scheme of entanglement in the middle, a fully connected CVQKD network capable of distributing secret keys simultaneously can be formed. We analyze the security of the system in the asymptotic case. Simulation results show that under commendable controlling of system loss and noise, the proposed scheme is feasible for deploying a short-distance fully connected CVQKD network. Loss will be the main factor limiting the system's performance. The proposed scheme provides new ideas for a multi-user fully connected CVQKD network.

Abstract: Accurate benchmarking of quantum gates is crucial for understanding and enhancing the performance of quantum hardware. A standard method for this is interleaved benchmarking, a technique which estimates the error on an interleaved target gate by comparing cumulative error rates of randomized sequences implemented with the interleaved gate and without it. In this work, we show both numerically and experimentally that the standard approach of interleaved randomized benchmarking (IRB), which uses the multi-qubit Clifford group for randomization, can produce highly inaccurate and even physically impossible estimates for the error on the interleaved gate in the presence of coherent errors. Fortunately we also show that interleaved benchmarking performed with cycle benchmarking, which randomizes with single qubit Pauli gates, provides dramatically reduced systematic uncertainty relative to standard IRB, and further provides as host of additional benefits including data reusability. We support our conclusions with a theoretical framework for bounding systematic errors, extensive numerical results comparing a range of interleaved protocols under fixed resource costs, and experimental demonstrations on three quantum computing platforms.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QCQO enables quantum annealing to solve continuous optimization problems by transforming them into a series of QUBO instances. This approach allows for better control over qubit usage and adapts to hardware limitations, though it may face challenges on noisy hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind QCQO is to extend the capabilities of quantum annealing beyond binary optimization tasks to continuous problems like regression.

Method: QCQO works by iteratively solving a sequence of QUBO instances, where each instance's solutions are used to approximate solutions to the original continuous problem. Virtual continuous variables are represented using binary vectors with weighted edges.

Result: Experiments show that QCQO achieves accurate results using fewer qubits compared to traditional methods. However, the convergence rate slows down on noisy quantum hardware.

Conclusion: QCQO successfully broadens the scope of problems that can be tackled by quantum annealing, particularly continuous optimization tasks, by leveraging iterative solution refinement and efficient qubit resource management.

Abstract: Quantum annealers can solve QUBO problems efficiently but struggle with continuous optimization tasks like regression due to their discrete nature. We introduce Quadratic Continuous Quantum Optimization (QCQO), an anytime algorithm that approximates solutions to unconstrained quadratic programs via a sequence of QUBO instances. Rather than encoding real variables as binary vectors, QCQO implicitly represents them using continuous QUBO weights and iteratively refines the solution by summing sampled vectors. This allows flexible control over the number of binary variables and adapts well to hardware constraints. We prove convergence properties, introduce a step size adaptation scheme, and validate the method on linear regression. Experiments with simulated and real quantum annealers show that QCQO achieves accurate results with fewer qubits, though convergence slows on noisy hardware. Our approach enables quantum annealing to address a wider class of continuous problems.

Motivation: Understanding the properties of quantum systems, particularly in confined potentials, is crucial for advancing quantum technologies such as precision metrology and quantum computing.

Method: Using variational methods and spectral analysis, we analyze the static isoperimetric problem and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the harmonic trap to be the unique maximizer.

Result: The harmonic trap is proven to be the unique maximizer of the ground-state position variance among one-dimensional confining potentials with a fixed spectral gap. This result has significant implications for quantum speed limits and structural stability of potentials.

Conclusion: This work provides a fundamental understanding of the static properties of confining potentials and establishes a sharp geometric quantum speed-limit bound that can be applied in various quantum technological contexts.

Abstract: We solve the static isoperimetric problem underlying the Mandelstam-Tamm bound. Among one-dimensional confining potentials with a fixed spectral gap, we prove that the harmonic trap is the unique maximizer of the ground-state position variance. As a consequence, we obtain a sharp geometric quantum speed-limit bound on the position-position component of the quantum metric, and we give a necessary-and-sufficient condition for when the bound is saturated. Beyond the exact extremum, we establish quantitative rigidity. We control the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn spectral tail and provide square-integrable structural stability for potentials that nearly saturate the bound. We further extend the analysis to magnetic settings, deriving a longitudinal necessary-and-sufficient characterization and transverse bounds expressed in terms of guiding-center structure. Finally, we outline applications to bounds on static polarizability, limits on the quantum metric, and benchmarking of trapping potentials.

Abstract: We construct holonomic quantum gates for qubits that are encoded in the near-degenerate vibrational $E$-doublet of a deformable three-body system. Using Kendall's shape theory, we derive the Wilczek--Zee connection governing adiabatic transport within the $E$-manifold. We show that its restricted holonomy group is $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, implying universal single-qubit control by closed loops in shape space. We provide explicit loops implementing a $π/2$ phase gate and a Hadamard-type gate. For two-qubit operations, we outline how linked holonomic cycles in arrays generate a controlled Chern--Simons phase, enabling an entangling controlled-$X$ (CNOT) gate. We present a Ramsey/echo interferometric protocol that measures the Wilson loop trace of the Wilczek--Zee connection for a control cycle, providing a gauge-invariant signature of the non-Abelian holonomy. As a physically realizable demonstrator, we propose bond-length modulations of a Cs($6s$)--Cs($6s$)--Cs($nd_{3/2}$)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the capabilities and limitations of quantum generative models is essential for advancing quantum computing applications.

Method: The study examines quantum generative models' output distributions and trains linear regression models to predict quantum advantage based on their properties.

Result: Models outputting from sparse distributions are easier to train, and the findings relate to verifying quantum processes. Quantum advantage may stem from other properties beyond anticoncentration.

Conclusion: Quantum advantage in generative models is possible without relying on anticoncentration.

Abstract: Sampling tasks have been successful in establishing quantum advantages both in theory and experiments. This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.

We derive a sufficient criterion for occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect, characterized by quantum coherence, in this model. We introduce the phenomenon of role reversal in the Mpemba effect, wherein changes in the system parameters invert the relaxation ordering of a given pair of initial states that exhibit the Mpemba effect, causing the faster-relaxing state to become slower and vice versa. We find the existence of role reversal in Mpemba effect for this Dicke model using different relaxation measures, including differential quantum coherence and entanglement, and trace distance, between the time-evolved and steady states.

Moreover, the electron energy spectrum exhibits a clear signature of the quantum coherence and sensitivity to the transition frequency of the emitter. These coherence effects manifest themselves as oscillations in the zero-loss peak of the spectral energy-loss probability. Our findings pave the way for characterization of quantum-coherent dynamics of individual quantum emitters by electron-probes.

The effects of decoherence are then examined under two local noise mechanisms, namely dephasing and phase-flip channels, acting on the qubit and qutrit subsystems in both symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Quantum correlations are quantified using negativity to capture entanglement and quantum discord based on linear entropy to characterize more general nonclassical correlations. Our results show that both thermal fluctuations and phase noise lead to a monotonic degradation of quantum correlations, with increasing temperature accelerating coherence loss and inducing entanglement sudden death at finite temperatures. While negativity vanishes abruptly under sufficiently strong noise, quantum discord persists beyond the entanglement threshold, revealing residual quantum correlations in mixed states. We further demonstrate that asymmetric noise configurations significantly enhance the robustness of both entanglement and discord by partially shielding coherence in the less affected subsystem. A comparative analysis reveals that phase-flip noise is more destructive than pure dephasing, leading to faster suppression of quantum correlations.

### [235] [Adaptive Resource Orchestration for Distributed Quantum Computing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24902)
*Kuan-Cheng Chen,Felix Burt,Nitish K. Panigrahy,Kin K. Leung*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) architecture for scaling quantum computing by enabling a coherent quantum-HPC system with multiple QPUs. ModEn-Hub uses a photonic interconnect and a real-time quantum network orchestrator to centralize entanglement sources and memory, delivering high-fidelity Bell pairs. The system maintains a small ebit cache and schedules teleportation-based non-local gates through a control plane. It supports parallel entanglement attempts and adaptive resource orchestration. Monte Carlo simulations show that ModEn-Hub sustains higher teleportation success rates (about 90%) compared to a naive sequential baseline (which drops to about 30%), despite requiring more entanglement attempts. This suggests that ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation on near-term hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing has shown promising potential but faces challenges in scaling up to large systems due to limitations in quantum networking. This paper addresses the need for a robust architecture to interconnect and manage many quantum processing units (QPUs) effectively.

Method: The paper proposes the ModEn-Hub architecture and evaluates its performance using a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study. The study compares a naive sequential baseline with an orchestration policy that incorporates logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching under realistic loss and tight round budgets. The simulations measure teleportation success rates across different numbers of QPUs and trials, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations under realistic conditions demonstrate that ModEn-Hub-style orchestration significantly improves teleportation success rates compared to a naive sequential baseline. With 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub maintains about 90% teleportation success, while the baseline degrades to about 30%. Although ModEn-Hub requires higher average entanglement attempts, this trade-off enables more efficient scaling of quantum-HPC systems on near-term hardware.

Conclusion: The Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) architecture demonstrates that adaptive resource orchestration can significantly enhance the scalability and efficiency of quantum-HPC systems. The findings provide strong support for the viability of ModEn-Hub-style approaches in managing large-scale quantum networks and achieving practical quantum computational benefits.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computing beyond a single device requires networking many quantum processing units (QPUs) into a coherent quantum-HPC system. We propose the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) architecture: a hub-and-spoke photonic interconnect paired with a real-time quantum network orchestrator. ModEn-Hub centralizes entanglement sources and shared quantum memory to deliver on-demand, high-fidelity Bell pairs across heterogeneous QPUs, while the control plane schedules teleportation-based non-local gates, launches parallel entanglement attempts, and maintains a small ebit cache. To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3). These results provide clear, high-level evidence that adaptive resource orchestration in the ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation on near-term hardware.

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing architectures require high-performance quantum interconnects between quantum information processing units, while previous implementations have been fundamentally limited by transmission line losses. Here, we demonstrate a low-loss interconnect between two superconducting modules using an aluminum coaxial cable, achieving a bus mode quality factor of 1.7e6. By employing SNAIL as couplers, we realize inter-modular state transfer in 0.8 μs via a three-wave mixing process. The state transfer fidelity reaches 98.2% for quantum states encoded in the first two energy levels, achieving a Bell state fidelity of 92.5%. Furthermore, we show the capability to transfer high-dimensional states by successfully transmitting binomially encoded logical states. Systematic characterization reveals that performance constraints have shifted from transmission line losses (contributing merely 0.2% infidelity) to module-channel interface effects and local Kerr nonlinearities. Our work advances the realization of quantum interconnects approaching fundamental capacity limits, paving the way for scalable distributed quantum computing and efficient quantum communications.

Abstract: We extend the Worldline Monte Carlo approach to computationally simulating the Feynman path integral of non-relativistic multi-particle quantum-mechanical systems. We show how to generate an arbitrary number of worldlines distributed according to the (free) kinetic part of the multi-particle quantum dynamics and how to simulate interactions between worldlines in the ensemble. We test this formalism with two- and three-particle quantum mechanical systems, with both long range Coulomb-like interactions between the particles and external fields acting separately on the particles, in various spatial dimensionality. We extract accurate estimations of the ground state energy of these systems using the late-time behaviour of the propagator, validating our approach with numerically exact solutions obtained via straightforward diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian. Systematic benchmarking of the new approach, presented here for the first time, shows that the computational complexity of Wordline Monte Carlo scales more favourably with respect to standard numerical alternatives. The method, which is general, numerically exact, and computationally not intensive, can easily be generalised to relativistic systems.

Conclusion: Contribution to quantum information theory with methodological simplification.

Abstract: Uncertainty is a fundamental and important concept in quantum mechanics. Recent works have revealed both the product and sum forms of uncertainty constants for three observables. Such a result is intimately to the properties of Pauli operators. In this work, using the technique in matrix theory, we give an alternative proof for the case of three observables, and generalize the result to the case of four measurements. Comparing with the original proof, such a derivation is simplified. Moreover, the discussions can deal with the summation form of uncertainty relation for two, three and four observables in a unified way.

TL;DR: LICAM is a magnetometry technique using laser in cavity with diamond NV centers, providing highly sensitive magnetometers under ambient conditions. Near the lasing threshold, they achieved 475-fold enhancement in optical contrast and 180-fold improvement in magnetic sensitivity compared to conventional methods. The results are explained by a rate-equation model, projecting shot-noise sensitivity in the pT Hz^{-1/2} range, with potential for fT Hz^{-1/2} with device improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to develop highly sensitive magnetometers that can operate under ambient conditions without requiring cryogenic temperatures or specialized equipment, leveraging the sensitivity of Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond quantum sensors and laser-based absorption spectroscopy.

Method: The method involves using an electrically driven, edge-emitting diode laser in an intracavity setup to detect magnetic fields. The so-called Laser intracavity absorption magnetometry (LICAM) technique was employed, which allows for the detection of weak magnetic signals with high sensitivity.

Result: The key results include a 475-fold enhancement in optical contrast and a 180-fold improvement in magnetic sensitivity when operating near the lasing threshold compared to conventional single-pass geometries. Additionally, using a rate-equation model, they demonstrated that the sensitivity can reach the pT Hz^{-1/2} range and potentially even lower with realistic device improvements.

Conclusion: This study presents a promising new approach for ambient magnetometry with dramatically enhanced sensitivities. By integrating diamond-based NV centers with laser-based absorption spectroscopy technique, the researchers achieved significant improvements in magnetometric sensitivity, paving the way for practical applications in various fields where traditional magnetometers may not be suitable.

Abstract: Intracavity absorption spectroscopy (ICAS) is a well-established technique for detecting weak absorption signals with ultrahigh sensitivity. Here, we extend this concept to magnetometry using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We introduce laser intracavity absorption magnetometry (LICAM), a concept that is in principle applicable to a broader class of optical quantum sensors, including optically pumped magnetometers. Using an electrically driven, edge-emitting diode laser that operates self-sustainably, we show that LICAM enables highly sensitive magnetometers operating under ambient conditions. Near the lasing threshold, we achieve a 475-fold enhancement in optical contrast and a 180-fold improvement in magnetic sensitivity compared with a conventional single-pass geometry. The experimental results are accurately described by a rate-equation model for single-mode diode lasers. From our measurements, we determine a projected shot-noise-limited sensitivity in the $\mathrm{pT}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ range and show that, with realistic device improvements, sensitivities down to the $\mathrm{fT}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ scale are attainable.

Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) bound the precision of currents by entropy production, but quantum transport of noncommuting (non-Abelian) charges challenges standard formulations because different charge components cannot be monitored within a single classical frame. We derive a process-level matrix TUR starting from the operational entropy production $Σ= D(ρ'_{SE}\|ρ'_S\!\otimes\!ρ_E)$. Isolating the experimentally accessible bath divergence $D_{\mathrm{bath}}=D(ρ'_E\|ρ_E)$, we prove a fully nonlinear, saturable lower bound valid for arbitrary current vectors $Δq$: $D_{\mathrm{bath}} \ge B(Δq,V,V')$, where the bound depends only on the transported-charge signal $Δq$ and the pre/post collision covariance matrices $V$ and $V'$. In the small-fluctuation regime $D_{\mathrm{bath}}\geq\frac12\,Δq^{\mathsf T}V^{-1}Δq+O(\|Δq\|^4)$, while beyond linear response it remains accurate. Numerical strong-coupling qubit collisions illustrate the bound and demonstrate near-saturation across broad parameter ranges using only local measurements on the bath probe.

Abstract: A parity-time (PT) transition is a spectral transition characteristic of non-Hermitian generators; it typically occurs at an exceptional point, where multiple eigenvectors coalesce. The concept of a PT transition has been extended to Markovian open quantum systems, which are described by the GKSL equation. Interestingly, the PT transition in many-body Markovian open quantum systems, the so-called \textit{Lindbladian PT (L-PT) phase transition}, is closely related to two classes of exotic nonequilibrium many-body phenomena: \textit{continuous-time crystals} and \textit{non-reciprocal phase transitions}. In this review, we describe the recent advances in the study of L-PT phase transitions. First, we define PT symmetry in three distinct contexts: non-Hermitian systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, and Markovian open quantum systems, highlighting the interconnections between these frameworks. Second, we develop mean-field theories of L-PT phase transitions for collective-spin systems and for bipartite bosonic systems with particle-number conservation. Within these classes of models, we show that L-PT symmetry can induce a breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry down to a discrete one, leading to persistent periodic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the L-PT phase transition point is typically \textit{a critical exceptional point}, where multiple collective excitation modes with zero excitation spectrum coalesce. These findings establish an explicit connection to continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions. Third, going beyond the mean-field theory, we analyze statistical and quantum properties, such as purity and quantum entanglement indicators of time-independent steady states for several specific models with the L-PT symmetry. Finally, we discuss future research directions for L-PT phase transitions.

TL;DR: A controlled circuit with Ω(n²/log n) CNOT gates can be implemented with O(n) Toffoli gates and O(1) Toffoli depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quantum circuit efficiency by reducing the number of Toffoli gates and depth is crucial for practical quantum computing applications, especially with the increasing number of qubits and the limited availability of Toffoli gates.

Method: Through theoretical analysis and circuit optimization techniques, achieving O(n) Toffoli gates and O(1) depth.

Result: Reduced Toffoli count and depth for controlled circuits lead to more efficient quantum operations.

Conclusion: Optimized quantum circuits with fewer Toffoli gates and simpler depths enhance practical quantum computing capabilities.

Abstract: Since an n-qubit circuit consisting of CNOT gates can have up to $Ω(n^2/\log{n})$ CNOT gates, it is natural to expect that $Ω(n^2/\log{n})$ Toffoli gates are needed to apply a controlled version of such a circuit. We show that the Toffoli count can be reduced to at most n. The Toffoli depth can also be reduced to O(1), at the cost of 2n Toffoli gates, even without using any ancilla or measurement. In fact, using a measurement-based uncomputation, the Toffoli depth can be further reduced to 1. From this, we give two corollaries: any controlled Clifford circuit can be implemented with O(1) T-depth, and any Clifford+T circuit with T-depth D can be controlled with T-depth O(D), even without ancillas. As an application, we show how to catalyze a rotation by any angle up to precision $ε$ in T-depth exactly 1 using a universal $\lceil\log_2(8/ε)\rceil$-qubit catalyst state.

Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of balancing strong coupling and computational integrity in superconducting quantum circuits, aiming to enhance quantum operations through advanced control methods.

Method: Mathieu control, using a non-resonant two-photon drive, is employed to achieve a nonlinear frequency shift without disrupting qubit states.

Result: This method allows precise tuning of ZZ couplings, including full suppression, and supports both single- and two-qubit gate operations with reduced leakage. It also facilitates programmable Heisenberg Hamiltonian simulations by enabling independent ZZ control in multi-qubit systems.

Conclusion: Mathieu control offers a robust framework for achieving high-fidelity quantum operations and programmable quantum simulations, advancing quantum circuit design and functionality.

Abstract: A common challenge in superconducting quantum circuits is the trade-off between strong coupling and computational subspace integrity. We present Mathieu control, which uses a non-resonant two-photon drive to create a selective nonlinear frequency shift. This shift modifies interactions while preserving qubit states, enabling continuous tuning of the ZZ coupling, including full suppression, and integrating single- and two-qubit gates with low leakage. For a qubit-coupler-qubit device, it allows independent ZZ control, facilitating a programmable Heisenberg (XXZ) Hamiltonian. Extended to a five-qubit chain, the system can be reconfigured to simulate dynamics of quantum magnetic phases. Mathieu control thus provides a framework for high-fidelity quantum logic and programmable simulation.

Abstract: The adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) provides a promising approach for simulating highly correlated quantum systems on quantum devices, as it strikes a balance between hardware efficiency, trainability, and accuracy. Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient troughs. This refers to a non-monotonic convergence of the gradients, which may become very small even though the minimum energy has not been reached. This results in difficulties finding the right operators to add to the ansatz, due to the limited number of shots and statistical uncertainties, leading to stagnation in the circuit structure optimization. In this paper, we propose ways to detect and mitigate this phenomenon. Leveraging the non-commutative algebra of the ansatz, we develop heuristics for determining where to insert new operators into the circuit. We find that gradient troughs are more likely to arise when the same locations are used repeatedly for new operator insertions. Our novel protocols, which add new operators in different ansatz positions, allow us to escape gradient troughs and thereby lower the measurement cost of the algorithm. This approach achieves an effective balance between cost and efficiency, leading to faster convergence without compromising the low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE.

Abstract: Tomographic measurements are the standard tool for characterizing quantum states, yet they are usually regarded only as means for state reconstruction or fidelity measurement. Here, we show that the same Pauli-basis measurements (X, Y, Z) can be directly employed for the certification of nonlocality at no additional experimental cost. Our framework allows any tomographic data - including archival datasets -- to be reinterpreted in terms of fundamental nonlocality tests. We introduce a generic, constructive method to generate tailored Bell inequalities and showcase their applicability to certify the non-locality of states in realistic experimental scenarios. Recognizing the stabilizer nature of the considered operators, we analyze our inequalities in the context of witnessing quantum magic - a crucial resource for quantum computing. Our approach requires Pauli measurements only and tests the quantum magic solely through the resources present in the state. Our results establish a universal standard that unifies state tomography with nonlocality certification and its application to quantum magic witnessing, thereby streamlining both fundamental studies and practical applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for identifying and classifying integrable nonlinear equations with three independent variables, one of which is discrete and the other two are continuous. A characteristic property of this class of equations, called Toda-type chains, is that they admit finite-field reductions in the form of open chains with enhanced integrability. The paper results in a theorem stating that all known integrable Toda-type chains admit reductions in the form of an open chain of length three with a family of second-order evolutionary type symmetries. Apparently, this property of Toda-type chains can be used as an effective classification criterion when compiling lists of integrable differential-difference equations in 3D.

Motivation: This paper connects different methods for solving integrable systems, which is interesting for understanding the structure of these equations.

Method: The method involves a variable transformation that links the Zakharov-Shabat equations to Lax operators in the context of KP and modified KP hierarchies.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the use of periodic DLPNO-MP2 theory for studying CO adsorption on MgO(001), showing that as the surface becomes more densely covered, the binding strength decreases due to increased lateral repulsion between CO molecules, matching experimental findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate CO adsorption on MgO(001) using an efficient computational method, demonstrating the method's capability to handle increasingly dense surface coverages while matching experimental results.

Method: The study employs the periodic DLPNO-MP2 method, which is noted for its computational efficiency, allowing for the study of surface adsorption at various coverage ratios by using large supercells to approximate the thermodynamic limit.

Result: The results show that the binding energy decreases with increasing surface coverage due to stronger lateral repulsions between CO molecules. The computed adsorption energies are found to be in agreement with both existing benchmarks and experimental data.

Conclusion: The paper conclusively demonstrates that periodic DLPNO-MP2 is a reliable method for studying CO adsorption on MgO(001) even at high coverage levels, with the findings aligning well with experimental observations

Abstract: We apply periodic domain-based local pair natural orbital second-order Møller--Plesset perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) to probe the adsorption energy of CO on MgO(001), the consensus toy model system for surface adsorption. A number of robust correlated wavefunction methods now achieve excellent agreement with experiment for the adsorption of a single CO molecule onto the MgO surface. However, studies probing denser coverage ratios are scarce because of the increased computational expense and the larger configuration space to optimize. We leverage the computational efficiency of periodic DLPNO-MP2 to perform simulations beyond a single unit cell. By using large supercells, we highlight the importance of accurately representing the thermodynamic limit of the surface, and demonstrate in turn that different coverage ratios can be consistently probed. In the dilute regime, we show that adsorption energies obtained from periodic DLPNO-MP2 agree with existing benchmarks. We then obtain adsorption energies at increasing densities approaching full monolayer coverage. Our results show a reduction in binding strength at full coverage, agreeing with experimental observations, which is explained by the increasing lateral repulsions between the COs. This study demonstrates the efficacy of periodic DLPNO-MP2 for probing increasingly sophisticated adsorption systems at the thermodynamic limit.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the influence of nuclear quantum effects on water and ice properties near the melting point using path integral molecular dynamics with various deep potentials trained on DFT data. They find that the MB-pol model accurately predicts experimental results, while DFT-based models overestimate hydrogen bond strength and incorrectly predict the density discontinuity and $T_{m dm}$.

Motivation: Understanding nuclear quantum effects on water and ice properties is crucial for accurate modeling of aqueous systems, especially near phase transitions.

Method: They perform path integral molecular dynamics simulations with different deep potentials trained on DFT data, calculate key water/ice properties, and compare with experimental data.

Result: MB-pol model matches experiments well; DFT-based models fail to predict density discontinuity and $T_{m dm}$ correctly.

Conclusion: The choice of deep potential significantly affects the accuracy of modeling water/ice properties; DFT-based models need refinement for better predictions in aqueous systems.

Abstract: Liquid water exhibits several important anomalous properties in the vicinity of the melting temperature ($T_{\mathrm{m}}$) of ice Ih, including a higher density than ice and a density maximum at 4~$^{\circ}$C. Experimentally, an isotope effect on $T_{\mathrm{m}}$ is observed: the melting temperature of H$_2$O is approximately 4~K lower than that of D$_2$O. This difference can only be explained by nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), which can be accurately captured using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). Here we run PIMD simulations driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) based on SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0, and revPBE-D3 and a DP model trained on the MB-pol potential. We calculate the \tm of ice, the density discontinuity at melting, and the temperature of density maximum ($T_{\mathrm{dm}}$) of the liquid. We find that the model based on MB-pol agrees well with experiment. The models based on DFT incorrectly predict that NQEs lower $T_{\mathrm{m}}$. For the density discontinuity, SCAN and SCAN0 predict values close to the experimental result, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 significantly underestimate it. Additionally, the models based on SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the $T_{\mathrm{dm}}$ is higher than $T_{\mathrm{m}}$, while those based on revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite. We attribute the deviations of the DFT-based models from experiment to the overestimation of hydrogen bond strength. Our results set the stage for more accurate simulations of aqueous systems grounded on DFT.

Motivation: 为了提高对水热动力学性质的理解，需要系统评估不同第一性原理方法的性能。

Method: 通过Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD)结合深度势模型（DP）使用来自密度泛函理论（DFT）的数据进行评估。

Result: MB-pol模型在所有测试性质中表现良好，而SCAN和SCAN0低估了液态密度变化，revPBE-D3和revPBE0-D3则严重低估。

Conclusion: 这些研究结果揭示了现有第一性原理方法的局限性，促使重新评估其在水系统中的预测能力。

Abstract: First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.

TL;DR: VisU is a framework that automates the analysis of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics by combining AI with human intuition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of quantum dynamics simulations necessitates efficient analysis tools, prompting the development of VisU.

Method: VisU uses a virtual research collective consisting of a Mentor, Engineer, and Student. The Mentor provides physical intuition, the Engineer constructs analysis scripts, and the Student executes the pipeline. VisU follows a four-stage workflow: preprocessing, recursive channel discovery, important-motion identification, and validation/ summarization.

Result: VisU decreases manual interpretation dependency and enhances mechanistic discovery in excited-state dynamics analysis.

Conclusion: By integrating AI with human expertise, VisU marks a new era in computational chemistry and AI collaboration.

Abstract: Analyzing nonadiabatic molecular dynamics trajectories traditionally heavily relies on expert intuition and visual pattern recognition, a process that is difficult to formalize. We present VisU, a vision-driven framework that leverages the complementary strengths of two state-of-the-art large language models to establish a "virtual research collective." This collective operates through a "Mentor-Engineer-Student" paradigm that mimics the collaborative intelligence of a professional chemistry laboratory. Within this ecosystem, the Mentor provides physical intuition through visual reasoning, while the Engineer adaptively constructs analysis scripts, and the Student executes the pipeline and manages the data and results. VisU autonomously orchestrates a four-stage workflow comprising Preprocessing, Recursive Channel Discovery, Important-Motion Identification, and Validation/Summary. This systematic approach identifies reaction channels and key nuclear motions while generating professional academic reports. By bridging visual insight with chemical expertise, VisU establishes a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration in the analysis of excited-state dynamics simulation results, significantly reducing dependence on manual interpretation and enabling more intuitive, scalable mechanistic discovery.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Defects on the surface of solar water-splitting nanocrystals trap photocarriers and limit efficiency, but the exact mechanisms are unclear. A new technique called photomodulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) was used with an optically coupled scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to directly image the distribution of photocarrier trap states. Results show that highly localized trap states at oxygen-vacancy surface sites can be mapped with angstrom-scale resolution, revealing how these defects hinder photoelectrochemical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of defects in nanoscale solar cells is crucial for optimizing their efficiency. The motivation is to directly observe where and how these defects trap light-generated carriers, which could lead to better designs for solar water splitting.

Method: The research employs photomodulated EELS in an optically coupled STEM setup. This allows for the separation of photothermal heating effects from the photoresponse, enabling mapping of carrier densities at trap states with high resolution.

Result: By using photomodulated STEM-EELS, the scientists successfully mapped the spatial distribution of surface trap states at the nanoscale, revealing their role in limiting photocatalytic efficiency.

Conclusion: This advanced imaging technique provides critical insights into the nanoscale behavior of charge transfer defects, paves the way for optimizing defect engineering in photocatalysis, and could lead to more efficient solar water-splitting devices.

Abstract: Defects trap photocarriers and hinder solar water splitting. The nanoscale photocarrier transport, trapping, and recombination mechanisms are usually inferred from ensemble-averaged measurements and remain elusive. Because an individual high-performing nanoparticle photocatalyst may outperform the ensemble average, design rules that would otherwise enhance catalytic efficiency remain unclear. Here, we introduce photomodulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an optically coupled scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map photocarrier localization. Using rhodium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Rh) solar water-splitting nanoparticles, we directly image the carrier densities concentrated at oxygen-vacancy surface trap states. This is achieved by separating photothermal heating from photocarrier populations through experimental and computational analyses of low-loss spectra. Photomodulated STEM-EELS enables angstrom-scale imaging of defect-induced photocarrier traps and their impact on photocatalytic efficiency.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop an axiomatic reconstruction of thermodynamics based entirely on two primitive components: a description of what aspects of a system are observed and a reference measure that encodes the underlying descriptive convention. These ingredients define an "information volume" for each observational cell.
  By incorporating the logarithm of this volume as an additional constraint in a minimum-relative-entropy inference scheme, temperature, chemical potential, and pressure arise as conjugate variables of a single information-theoretic functional. This leads to a Legendre-type structure and a first-law-like relation in which pressure corresponds to information volume rather than geometric volume.
  For nonequilibrium dynamics, entropy production is characterized through the relative-entropy asymmetry between forward and time-reversed stochastic evolutions. A decomposition using observational entropy then separates total dissipation into system and environment contributions. Heat is defined as the part of dissipation not accounted for by the system-entropy change, yielding a representation that does not rely on local detailed balance or a specific bath model. We further show that the difference between joint and partially observed dissipation equals the average of conditional relative entropies, providing a unified interpretation of hidden dissipation and information-flow terms as projection-induced gaps.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Panchromatic absorbing materials are widely regarded as a key strategy for enhancing solar energy utilization and photocurrent generation. However, in artificial molecular systems, broadening the absorption spectrum is often accompanied by fundamental challenges, including bandgap narrowing, poor energy-level alignment, and limited charge-transfer kinetics, indicating that pursuing broadband absorption alone is insufficient to guarantee high photovoltaic performance. This article examines the relationship between design strategies and performance of panchromatic absorbing materials from the perspectives of molecular engineering and photovoltaic devices, with particular emphasis on the delicate balance among molecular electronic structure, charge-transfer characteristics, interfacial energy-level alignment, as well as electron injection, regeneration efficiency, and energy losses. Ultimately, the molecular design of panchromatic photovoltaic materials should move beyond molecular-level optimization toward synergistic tuning among molecules, semiconductors, and electrolytes or active-layer materials, thereby providing concrete conceptual guidance for achieving efficiency optimization rather than simple spectral maximization.

TL;DR: The paper examines the behavior of [bmim][NTf2] ionic liquid in a capacitor with planar graphite electrodes. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the study reveals how the arrangement and movement of [bmim]+ and [NTf2]- ions, influenced by factors like electrostatic charge, water concentration, temperature, and pressure, affect the capacitor's performance. The ions form ion pairs that exhibit ordering perpendicular to the electrodes, linked to their dipole moments. This research could explain an observed Pockels effect and has applications in various electrochemical systems.需要更详细的信息？


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research focuses on enhancing the understanding of ionic liquid behavior in capacitors, which is crucial for improving energy storage and electrochemical devices. By investigating the ordering of ion pairs and their dynamic properties, the study aims to provide insights into optimizing these devices and potentially explaining observed phenomena like the Pockels effect.

Method: Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to study the structural and dynamical properties of [bmim][NTf2] under varying conditions. Mathematical modeling and data analysis were used to interpret the simulation results, linking ion ordering to material properties such as the Pockels effect.

Result: The study found that the arrangement of [bmim]+ and [NTf2]- ions forms stable ion pairs whose orientation correlates with their dipole moments. This ion ordering, influenced by the capacitor's electrostatic charge, water absorption, temperature, and pressure, explains the anisotropic behavior observed in the Pockels effect and offers a new perspective for designing efficient electrochemical applications.

Conclusion: This research bridges molecular-level ion behavior with macroscopic electrical properties, offering a foundational framework for optimizing ionic liquid capacitors and related electrochemical technologies. The observed ion pairing and ordering provide a plausible explanation for the Pockels effect and contribute to broader applications in energy storage and conversion systems.

Abstract: A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Structural and dynamical properties such as: (i) the density and orientation of the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions throughout the capacitor; (ii) the electrostatic double layer at the electrode / electrolyte interface; (iii) the ions' mobility perpendicular and parallel to the graphite plates are determined as a function of the electrostatic charge of the capacitor, the concentration of absorbed water, the temperature and pressure. Grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into neutral ion pairs reveals an intriguing ordering normal to the interface that is related to correlations among the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. These correlations might explain the observation of an anomalous Stark effect (Pockels effect) reported a few years ago in Langmuir, vol. 37, 5193-5201, (2021), and provides useful insight for the multitude of electro-chemical applications that involve electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A theory of cosmic ray production within the solar system (not extra-galactic) is presented. The sun's time variable magnetic flux linkage makes the sun (as well, perhaps, as Jupiter) a natural, all-purpose, betatron storage ring, with semi-infinite acceptance aperture, capable of storing and accelerating counter-circulating, opposite-sign, colliding beams.
  The puzzle of how positrons and anti-protons can be well represented at all energies, is explained, initially, by the low energy capture of particles of either sign by the sun's magnetic dipole field. Later, as the magnetic field bending has become negligible compared to the gravitational bending, both positive and negative beams will have survived the gradual transition from predominantly magnetic to predominantly gravitational bending. Later, anti-particles produced in QED beam-beam collisions of sufficiently high energy, are also accelerated.
  The high quality of cosmic ray data collected over recent decades, at steadily increasing energies, especially by the International Space Station (ISS), make the study of cosmic ray production mechanisms both timely and essential.
  The paper describes how longitudinal electric fields, explained by the Parker solar wind theory can enable the sun to serve as a ``booster'' accelerator of cosmic rays, increasing the maximum cosmic ray energies enough to produce the observed 13 orders of magnitude maximum particle energy and the energy flux needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray atmosphere equilibrium within the solar system.
  A steady state mechanism is described, based on semi-quantitative discussion of a relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, according to which the highest energy cosmic rays observed can have been produced by the Parker longitudinal electric field component, during fractionally brief, but periodic, circular or semi-circular turns centered on the sun.

Abstract: Laser wakefield acceleration, characterized by the extremely high electric field gradient exceeding 100GV/m, is regarded as a compact and cost affordable technology for the next generation of particle colliders and light sources. However, it has always been a major challenge to effectively increase the energy transfer efficiency from the laser to the accelerated beam, while ensuring the beam quality remains suitable for practical applications. This study demonstrates that the laser with shorter pulse duration allows for a two-step dechirping process of the accelerated electron beam with charge of nanocoulomb level. The electron beams with an energy spread of 1% can be generated with the energy transfer efficiency of 10% to 30% in a large parameter space. For example, one electron beam with the energy of 420MeV, the charge of 5.5nC and the RMS energy spread of 2% can be produced using an 8.3J laser pulse with 7.2fs duration.

Abstract: This work has investigated the Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) system used to produce Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). A primary challenge addressed in this study concerns the geometric limitations of traditional single-pair anti-Helmholtz coil configurations, where the magnetic field peaks occur outside the accessible inter-coil region. To overcome this limitation, we have explored the use of double-pair anti-Helmholtz coil configurations that create well-shaped magnetic field potentials centered at the experimentally accessible $z=0$ location. This investigation encompasses the three sequential processes of atom cooling: cooling in a linear external magnetic field through Doppler cooling, cooling in a well-shaped magnetic field through trapping, and evaporative cooling of atoms to achieve sub-microkelvin temperatures. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we have determined optimal geometric parameters for the coil configuration and operational parameters including laser detuning, saturation intensity, and initial atom populations for ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ BEC production. The results indicate that with the optimized configuration, the system can achieve final temperatures of approximately $T_f \sim 60\,\mathrm{nK}$ and produce condensate populations of $\sim 10^5$ atoms with a mean density of $n_0 = 4.9 \times 10^{15}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, providing systematic design guidance for experimental BEC systems

Abstract: Precision measurements of the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) are critical for testing fundamental symmetries in particle physics, and heavy polar molecules-such as barium monofluoride (BaF)-have emerged as promising candidates for advancing the sensitivity. However, the achievement of a 3D magneto-optical trap (MOT) required slowing BaF molecules to near-zero velocity by scattering over 10^4 photons per molecule, demanding a quasi-cycling transition with minimal leakage. We present a detailed study of the leakage channels, including higher vibrational and rotational states. By combining microwave remixing with optical pumping of rotational and vibrational dark states, we reduced the total leakage fraction to 10^-5. Using frequency-chirped laser slowing, we slowed a subset of buffer-gas-cooled BaF molecules from approximately 80 m/s to near-zero velocity, which is critical for efficient MOT loading. This work establishes the technical foundation for precision eEDM measurements using laser-cooled heavy molecules.

Abstract: We report a compact setup with in-series two-dimensional magneto-optical traps (2D MOTs) that provides high-flux cold lithium and rubidium atoms. Thanks to the efficient short-distance Zeeman slowing, the maximum 3D MOT loading rate of lithium atoms reaches a record value of $6.6\times 10^{9}$ atoms/s at a moderate lithium-oven temperature of 372 degrees Celsius, which is 44 times higher than that without the Zeeman slowing light. The flux of rubidium is also as high as $2.3\times10^9$ atoms/s with the rubidium oven held at room temperature. Meanwhile, the entire vacuum-chamber system, including an ultra-high-vacuum science cell, is within a small volume of $55\times65\times70~\mathrm{cm}^3$. Our work represents a substantial improvement over traditional bulky and complex dual-species cold-atom setups.

Abstract: Conventional practice of spatially resolved detection in diffusion-coupled thermal atomic vapors implicitly treat localized responses as mutually independent. However, in this study, it is shown that observable correlations are governed by the intrinsic spatiotemporal covariance of a global spin-fluctuation field, such that spatial separation specifies only overlapping statistical projections rather than independent physical components. A unified field-theoretic description is established in which sub-ensembles are defined as measurement-induced statistical projections of a single stochastic field. Within this formulation, sub-ensemble correlations are determined by the covariance operator, inducing a natural geometry in which statistical independence corresponds to orthogonality of the measurement functionals. For collective spin fluctuations described by a diffusion-relaxation Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic field, the covariance spectrum admits only a finite set of fluctuation modes in a bounded domain, imposing an intrinsic, field-level limit on the number of statistically distinguishable sub-ensembles. The loss of sub-ensemble independence is formalized through the notion of spatial sampling overlap, which quantifies the unavoidable statistical coupling arising from shared access to common low-order fluctuation modes. While multi-channel atomic magnetometry provides a concrete physical setting in which these constraints become explicit, the framework applies generically to diffusion-coupled stochastic fields.

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring is essential for managing circulatory health and disease, yet most wearable sensors are constrained by reliance on electrical transduction and built-in electronics. We present a circuit-free, wholly optical approach using diffraction from a skin-interfaced nanostructured surface to detect minute skin strains from the arterial pulse.

Abstract: We propose a novel variational phase-field model for fracture and fatigue in pseudoelastic shape memory alloys (SMAs). The model, developed in a one-dimensional setting, builds upon the Auricchio-Petrini constitutive formulation for SMAs and couples damage evolution with phase transformation. We study analytically and numerically the homogeneous and localization responses of a bar under both monotonic and cyclic loading, and we investigate various macroscopic behaviors by tuning the constitutive parameters. A key feature of the model is the introduction of a transformation strain limit, beyond which the material is fully martensitic and behaves elastically. This leads to a distinctive behavior in which the region of localized damage widens, yielding a delay of fracture. The capability of the model to predict the fatigue performance is demonstrated by simulating the uniaxial response of Ni-Ti multi-wire samples under different loading conditions. The results show promising agreement with experimental fatigue life data, enabling the discrimination between safe and critical loading scenarios.

Abstract: It is often assumed that the most general transformation between two inertial reference frames is affine linear in their Cartesian coordinates, an assumption which is however not true. We provide a complete derivation of the most general inertial frame transformation, which is indeed nonlinear; along the way, we shall find that the conditions of preserving the Law of Inertia take the form of Schwarzian differential equations, providing perhaps the simplest possible physics setting in which the Schwarzian derivative appears. We then demonstrate that the most general such inertial transformation which further preserves the speed of light in all directions is, however, still affine linear. Physically, this paper may be viewed as a reduction of the number of postulates needed to uniquely specify special relativity by one, as well as a proof that inertial transformations automatically imbue spacetime with a vector space structure, albeit in one higher dimension than might be expected. Mathematically, this paper may be viewed as a derivation of the higher-dimensional analog of the Schwarzian differential equation and its most general solution.
