Here, we show how gauge theories can defy this wisdom by yielding\nconstrained models with faster-than-diffusive dynamics. We first show how, upon\nintegrating out the gauge fields, one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theories\nare exactly mapped onto XX models with non-local constraints. This new class of\nkinetically constrained models interpolates between free theories and highly\nconstrained local fermionic models. We find that energy transport is\nsuperdiffusive over a broad parameter regime.

Density functional theory (DFT) captures the qualitative evolution,\nyet underestimates key energy scales across twist angles, highlighting the\nimportance of electronic correlations.

They can also induce long-range entanglement between\nunmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many\nnon-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and\nusing the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new\napproach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create\nshort-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a\nsuperconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range\nentanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the\nothers.

This\nresults in ultrafast charge oscillations known as charge migration. A key open\nquestion in the emerging field of attochemistry is whether these electron\ndynamics, which due to decoherence often last only for a few femtoseconds, can\ninfluence longer-time scale nuclear rearrangements. Herein, we address this\nquestion through full-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations of the coupled\nelectron-nuclear dynamics initiated by ionization and coherent excitation of\nethylene. The simulations of this prototype organic chromophore predict\nelectronic coherences with half-lives of less than 1 fs. Despite their brevity,\nthese electronic coherences induce vibrational coherences along the derivative\ncoupling vectors that persist for at least 50 fs.

In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr\nnonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon\ncoupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent\nmagnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also\neffectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies,\nresulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one\nto widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic\nfield.

We experimentally evidence frozen differential scattering in a\nrich-scattering wireless link parametrized by a programmable meta-atom.

To cope with these high rates in the\npixel trackers, per-pixel time measurements are required, which implies the\nneed for fast sensors. The inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) is one\nof the fast sensor options that is being investigated. This paper will show the\nresults of an inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) with a pitch of 55\n\\textmu m, a thickness of 250~\\textmu m and a large-area (2~cm$^2$), bump\nbonded to a Timepix4 ASIC. Timepix4 has 195~ps time binning on each pixel and\ntherefore an excellent ASIC to test the sensor. The sensor is characterised\nwith radio-active source measurements in the lab, and during beam test at the\nCERN SPS North Area H8 beamline, where the Timepix4 telescope was used. The\ntelescope has a time reference of 12~ps and a pointing resolution of 2.4 $\\pm$\n0.1~\\textmu m. The iLGAD shows an almost uniform gain of approximately 4 and an\nefficiency of 99.6 $\\pm$ 0.1\\%. Without any corrections the obtained time\nresolution is about 750~ps. After timewalk and clock corrections the time\nresolution becomes 377 $\\pm$ 7~ps.

In contrast, such a behavior is\ncompletely absent in the broken symmetry state of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ and in the\nisostructural Ta$_2$NiS$_5$, where the latter has a fully gapped normal state.\nBy contrasting the expected phonon lifetimes in the BCS and BEC limits of a\nputative EI, our results suggest that the phase transition in\nTa$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ family is closely related to strong interband\nelectron-phonon coupling. We experimentally determine the dimensionless\ncoupling $\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}\\sim10$, showing Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ as a rare\n\"ultra-strong coupling\" material.", "AI": {"tldr": "Discovery of a rare ultra-strong coupling material in the EI family of Ta2Ni(Se,S)5 supports the role of inelastic electron-phonon interactions in phase transitions of intrinsic excitonic insulators.", "motivation": "Understanding whether intrinsic excitonic insulators (EI) exist is a long-standing problem in condensed matter physics. The search for EI has been confounded by coexisting electron-phonon coupling, making it difficult to distinguish their ground states from other structural instabilities. If EI's excited states can reveal their nature through phonon signatures, this could provide a way to resolve this long-standing secret.", "method": "Used neutron scattering to study the phonon spectrum of Ta2NiSe5 and its isostructural derivative Ta2NiS5 in both the normal and symmetry-broken states. They observed extremely anisotropic phonon broadening and softening in the semimetallic normal state, but not in the broken symmetry states. They compared phonon lifetimes in BCS and BEC limits to infer the nature of the phase transition.", "result": "Observed that the phase transition in the Ta2Ni(Se,S)5 family is closely related to strong interband electron-phonon coupling. Experimentally determined a dimensionless coupling $\frac{g}{\nu_0} \tilde{} 10$, making Ta2Ni(Se,S)5 a rare ultra-strong coupling material.", "conclusion": "This work experimentally demonstrates that inelastic electron-phonon interactions can lead to phase transitions in intrinsic excitonic insulators. The ultra-strong coupling nature of Ta2Ni(Se,S)5 establishes a new class of EI materials that can be explored experimentally."}}

We study this\nphenomenon within the context of the multimode extension of the Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel, incorporating two-photon dissipation and external coherent driving.\nOperating in the weak-driving regime, we confine our analysis to the\ntwo-excitation sector of the Hilbert space, initially exploring the single-mode\ncase and then focusing on the corresponding multimode problem. Our study\ncalculates the second-order correlation function (both numerically and\nanalytically) for zero- and nonzero time delays in single- and multimode cases,\nto pinpoint and validate the conditions that lead to conventional and\nunconventional photon blockade. Our zero delay findings reveal that photon\nantibunching is comparable in both cases; however, the multimode case offers a\ngreater degree of control and applicability. Furthermore, for non-zero delay\noperation, we find that when one of the multiple modes is set at the optimal\nconventional photon blockade conditions, the behavior of the curve mimics the\nsingle-mode problem with an overall slower rate of reaching the\n$g^{(2)}(\\tau)=1$ value.

Furthermore, we analyze the motion of freely falling\nparticles in these backgrounds and comment on the geometry of the associated\nspaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9521\u7eb3\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u5982\u6768\u548c\u9521\u7eb3-\u5fb7-\u8428\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u662f\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u6cca\u677e\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u5206\u6790\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u5176\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u592a\u5927\u4f53\u79ef\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u9521\u7eb3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cca\u677e\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u5176\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This work introduces\na hybrid quantum walk model that integrates the coin mechanism of discrete\nwalks with the Hamiltonian-driven time evolution of continuous walks. Through\nsystematic analysis of probability distributions, standard deviations, and\nentanglement entropy on fundamental graph structures (2-vertex circles, stars,\nand lines), we reveal distinctive dynamical characteristics that differentiate\nour model from conventional quantum walk paradigms. The proposed framework\ndemonstrates unifying capabilities by naturally encompassing existing quantum\nwalk models as special cases. Two significant applications emerge from this\nhybrid architecture: (1) We develop a novel protocol for perfect state\ntransfer(PST) in general connected graphs, overcoming the limitations of\nprevious graph-specific approaches. A PST on a tree graph has been implemented\non a quantum superconducting processor. (2) We devise a quantum algorithm for\nmultiplying $K$ adjacency matrices of $n$-vertex regular graphs with time\ncomplexity $O(n^2d_1\\cdots d_K)$, outperforming classical matrix multiplication\n$(O(n^{2.371552}))$ when vertex degrees $d_i$ are bounded. The algorithm's\nefficacy for triangle counting is experimentally validated through the quantum\nsimulation on PennyLane.

In this work, we\ncomparatively study emission characteristics of colloidal PbS/CdS (core/shell)\nquantum dots at telecom wavelengths on different substrates, where two\ndifferent sets of quantum dots emitting within and outside the\nepsilon-near-zero region are deposited on both glass and indium tin oxide (ITO)\nsubstrates. Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the\nepsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence\nlifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a\nrelative emission cone narrowing from 17.6{\\deg} to 10.3{\\deg}. These results\nunderline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the\nspectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the\npotential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration\ninto next-generation quantum photonic devices.

Quantum or\nsemi-classical models developed to understand various configurations should\ncombine the effects of the zero-point fluctuations with those of blackbody\nradiation. In this paper, after a brief historical introduction and a rapid\nstudy of the electric field correlations in time domain, we propose exact and\napproximate expressions for the vacuum field correlations in Fourier space seen\nby moving points. We first present an exact computation of the electric field\ncorrelations, expressed in frequency space, between two points moving with\nopposite constant velocities on parallel trajectories. We also consider the\nelectric field self-correlations, i.e. on the same moving point but at\ndifferent frequencies, and comment the results related to special relativity.\nThen, we compute the exact main symmetrized quadratic electromagnetic field\ncorrelations between two points diametrically opposed on the same circular\ntrajectory, with diameter r, covered at constant angular velocity {\\Omega}. We\nderive the expressions for the electromagnetic field correlations with itself\nand with its spatial derivatives, still at the locations of the moving points.\nSince the points we consider are accelerating, both the zero-point fluctuations\nand the blackbody spectrum give non-trivial results, for two-point correlations\nas well as for self-correlations. In both cases, results are shown at any\nvacuum temperature.

Spacetime codes have emerged as a\nnatural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while\nleveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on\nchain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations\nbetween them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding\nproblems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence\nof two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain\ncomplexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits,\nfault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this\nframework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer\ncodes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be\ntransformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant\nproperties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the\nunderlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex\nconstructions.

Practically, to execute such quantum circuits, we need to pass\ncommands to a programmable quantum computer. Existing programming approaches,\ndedicated to generic unitary transformations, are inefficient in terms of the\ncomputational resources under the low-depth assumption and remain far from\nsatisfactory. As such, to realize NISQ algorithms, it is crucial to find an\nefficient way to program low-depth circuits as the qubit number $N$ increases.\nHere, we investigate the gate complexity and the size of quantum memory (known\nas the program cost) required to program low-depth brickwork circuits. We\nunveil a $\\sim N \\text{poly} \\log N$ worst-case program cost of universal\nprogramming of low-depth brickwork circuits in the large $N$ regime, which is a\ntight characterization. Moreover, we analyze the trade-off between the cost of\ndescribing the layout of local gates and the cost of programming them to the\ntargeted unitaries via the light-cone argument. Our findings suggest that\nfaithful gate-wise programming is optimal in the low-depth regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c faithful \u95e8\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u662f\u4f4e\u6df1\u5ea6 regimes \u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740 NISQ \u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f4e\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5149\u9525\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5e03\u5c40\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a optimal \u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0 faithful \u95e8\u7ea7\u522b\u7f16\u7a0b\u5728\u4f4e\u6df1\u5ea6 regimes \u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a NISQ \u8bbe\u5907\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
