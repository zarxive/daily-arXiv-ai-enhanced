Physical properties and thermodynamics of the single Kerr in the\nbubble are studied. No cosmic strings or struts are present. The binary black\nhole system displays equilibrium configurations, because the expanding bubble\nsurrounding the black holes balances the mutual gravitational attraction of the\ntwo constituents."}
