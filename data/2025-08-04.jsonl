In one setting,\nout-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe\nasymptotic freeness between Heisenberg operators: the non-commutative\ngeneralization of statistical independence. In a distinct research direction,\nthe concept of approximate unitary designs have led to efficient constructions\nof unitaries that look random according to forward-in-time protocols. Bridging\nthese two concepts, in this work we study the emergence of freeness from a\nrandom matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble. We prove that, with only\npolynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of\nhigher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely the\nobservables that lead to thermal correlations in chaotic many-body systems\naccording to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The RMPU ensemble\nprovably forms a unitary design, but, we argue, this does not account for\naverage OTOC behavior and therefore the emergence of freeness. We further\ncompute the ensemble's frame potential exactly to second order, showing\nconvergence to Haar values also with polynomial deviations, indicating that\nfreeness is also reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand,\nto reproduce the Haar-like OTOC value for local, traceless observables, the\nconsidered ensemble requires volume-law operator entanglement. Such\ncorrelations therefore lie beyond the paradigm of random unitary features which\ncan be replicated efficiently. Our results highlight the need to refine\nprevious notions of unitary designs in the context of operator dynamics,\nguiding us towards protocols for genuine quantum advantage while shedding light\non the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems."}

Intriguingly, the EL of\nthe spin-LED is discovered to be directly manipulated by spin-flip and\nspin-canting transitions. Notably, spin-flip transitions enable unprecedented\nhysteretic behaviors of EL characteristics, while spin-canting transitions\ninduce EL continuous modulation with robust anisotropy. This versatile\nmanipulation is originated from the synergy of magnetic-order mediated\nexcitonic transitions and spintronic transport. The prototype demonstration of\nspin-LED establishes an indispensable scheme of opto-spintronic devices\nleveraging 2D spin transitions and strong excitonic effects, presenting a\ncritical step towards integrated 2D opto-spintronics."}

The tracelessness of\nthe field strength involves the appropriate Fronsdal equations of motion for\nthe higher spin field. We work with spacetimes admitting Kerr-Schild\ncoordinates and give a number of examples in different dimensions. We note that\nthe multi-copy is particularly transparent in four dimensions if one uses\nspinor descriptions of the fields, relating this to the Penrose transform. The\nhigher-dimensional spinor multicopy is also explored and reveals some\ninteresting new features arising from the little group based identification of\nhigher spin field strengths and Maxwell tensor types. We then turn to the\nvector superspace formalism describing higher spin and `continuous' spin\nrepresentations given by Schuster and Toro, based on symmetric tensor fields.\nHere the Kerr-Schild higher spin fields we have used earlier naturally package\ninto a simple expression involving an arbitrary function, when the continuous\nspin scale $\\rho$ is set to zero.

Traditionally, this capability is measured\nby the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated\nwhen a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states.\nHowever, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of\nentanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric --\nentangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement\ngenerated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted\nnature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework\nthat yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis reveals a\nfundamental and previously unexplored physics: enhancing entangling capability\ninevitably increases sensitivity, or bias, toward specific input states. By\nanalyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical\nEP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of\nentanglement generation can significantly differ depending on physical\nimplementation. Extending our framework to a class of generalized\ncontrolled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary\ndimensions, we (re)affirm the inherent trade-off between the entangling\nstrength and uniformity. Moreover, we uncover a subtle\ndimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone\nfails to detect.

Indeed, we find the non-Markovianity to be negligible for\na single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing via interaction with a\nharmonic oscillator environment. In this paper, we examine a natural extension,\nnamely a pure dephasing model where a collection of two-level systems interacts\nwith a common environment. We obtain analytically the dynamics of the\ncollection of the two-level systems, and then take a partial trace over all the\ntwo-level systems except one. This remaining single two-level system is shown\nto display markedly non-Markovian dynamics, even in the weak system-environment\ncoupling regime. This is due to the indirect interaction between two-level\nsystems induced by their interaction with the common environment. In fact, this\nindirect interaction can not only increase the non-Markovianity by orders of\nmagnitude, but also display qualitatively different characteristics. For\ninstance, for a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing, the dynamics\nare Markovian for Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments.

In contrast to entanglement, the mutual information\nobtained in spacetime superposition is influenced by the proper distance\nbetween the two detectors.

We quantify quantum\ncorrelations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$\nis a given mode and subsystem $B$ the rest of the system. For initial pure\nstates, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the\nHotta-Sch\\\"utzhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Besides the\ninitial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed\nstates, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated.\nMoreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis\nis based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond\nthe validity of our numerical algorithms. Our findings reveal that the\nexpanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner\npairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. A significant conclusion is\nthat, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a\nlow-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to\nthe partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the\nboundaries, quantum entanglement decreases towards the ultraviolet modes,\nindicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and\nhence less probable to contribute in the purification process. While the\nHotta-Sch\\\"utzhold-Unruh formula offers notable computational efficiency,\npartner modes do not commute, due to the non-trivial multimode entanglement\nstructure of the system. Hence, this pairwise description is not suitable for\ndescribing the full system."}

The breakdown of these effective\nmodels, built on assumptions such as ensemble spectral homogeneity, an\nunstructured photonic density of states, and weak light-matter coupling, has\nalso recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we investigate the\naccuracy of this well-established framework beyond the most conventional, and\nextensively explored, spontaneous emission configuration. Specifically, we\nconsider a system comprising two coherently driven and detuned quantum\nemitters, embedded within a hybrid photonic-plasmonic cavity, formed by a\nmetallic nanorod integrated into a high-refractive-index dielectric\nmicroresonator. The local density of photonic states in this structure exhibits\na complex frequency dependence, making it a compelling platform for exploring\nphoton-mediated interactions beyond the assumptions above. We benchmark this\nmodeling approach for the quantum dynamics of the emitter pair against exact\ncalculations based on a macroscopic field quantization formalism, providing an\nillustrative assessment of its validity in significantly structured and\ndispersive photonic environments. Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes of\nlaser driving and frequency splitting that lead to markedly different levels of\naccuracy in the effective model."}

For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around\nthe Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted\nby recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for\nthe transition.
