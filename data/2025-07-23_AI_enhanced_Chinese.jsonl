However, due to\nthe high level of degeneracy of the outcome it is often less practical than its\nsymmetric refinements, which may single out congruences leading to physically\nsignificant spacetimes by imposing relevant symmetries. An illustrative example\nis the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to\nlead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we\npropose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the\nstationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance\nunder null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions,\nthe classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence\nis covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields\nan axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave\ndisplays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the\nexterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a\nspecial case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild\nblack hole. The Kerr-Schild transformation of the second congruence gives rise\nto a non-trivial vacuum solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 112, 024020\n(2025)]. Using circularity and appropriately fixing the reparameterization\ninvariance of the orthogonal manifold to the Killing fields, we show that the\nlatter solution corresponds to the well-known Taub-NUT spacetime with planar\ntopology.

Here, we introduce a fully automated, high-throughput CSP protocol\ndesigned to overcome these barriers. The protocol's efficiency is driven by\nLavo-NN, a novel neural network potential (NNP) architected and trained\nspecifically for pharmaceutical crystal structure generation and ranking. This\nNNP-driven crystal generation phase is integrated into a scalable cloud-based\nworkflow. We validate this CSP protocol on an extensive retrospective benchmark\nof 49 unique molecules, almost all of which are drug-like, successfully\ngenerating structures that match all 110 $Z' = 1$ experimental polymorphs. The\naverage CSP in this benchmark is performed with approximately 8.4k CPU hours,\nwhich is a significant reduction compared to other protocols. The practical\nutility of the protocol is further demonstrated through case studies that\nresolve ambiguities in experimental data and a semi-blinded challenge that\nsuccessfully identifies and ranks polymorphs of three modern drugs from powder\nX-ray diffraction patterns alone. By significantly reducing the required time\nand cost, the protocol enables CSP to be routinely deployed earlier in the drug\ndiscovery pipeline, such as during lead optimization. Rapid turnaround times\nand high throughput also enable CSP that can be run in parallel with\nexperimental screening, providing chemists with real-time insights to guide\ntheir work in the lab.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces an automated crystal structure prediction protocol that significantly improves efficiency and reduces costs, making it practical for use in early drug discovery.", "motivation": "Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is vital in pharmaceutical development but faces high computational costs and requires expert knowledge.

(2015) are a widely used technique\nin topology/freeform optimization to impose minimum lengthscales for\nmanufacturability. However, its efficacy degrades as design binarization is\nincreased, and it requires heuristic tuning of multiple hyperparameters. In\nthis work, we derive analytical hyperparameters from first principles,\ndepending only on the target lengthscale. We present results for both conic and\nPDE-based filtering schemes, showing that the latter is less robust due to the\nsingularity of its underlying Green's function. To address this, we also\nintroduce a double-filtering approach to obtain a well-behaved PDE-based\nfilter. Combined with our derived hyperparameters, we obtain a straightforward\nstrategy for enforcing lengthscales using geometric constraints, with minimal\nhyperparameter tuning. A key enabling factor is the recent subpixel-smooth\nprojection (SSP) method (Hammond et al. 2025), which facilitates the\nrapidly-converging optimization of almost-everywhere binary designs.

Understanding this behavior could lead to the development of new materials with tailored magnetic properties under controlled temperature conditions.

This paper examines how ethanol (C2H6O)\nand methanol (CH4O) additives influence formation pathways of NOx using ReaxFF\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations at temperatures of 2,000 K and 3,000 K. Ten\ncarefully designed fuel mixtures (C1-C10) were evaluated across 0%, 5%, and 10%\nalcohol concentrations. The findings show that adding alcohol can effectively\nsuppress NOx production, especially at elevated temperatures. At 3,000 K, 10%\nethanol addition and 10% methanol addition reduced the production of NOx by\napproximately 39.6% and 30.1%, respectively, compared with the base fuel. This\nsuppression is attributed to the charge redistribution and the redirection of\nnitrogen intermediates through stabilising pathways such as HNO, HNO2, and N2O.\nSimulation-derived descriptors served as the training data for machine learning\n(ML) models, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector\nRegression (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and Fully Connected\nNeural Networks (FCNN). RFR achieved superior performance compared with other\nmodels with an R2 of 0.993 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.661. The trained\nML models successfully predicted NOx emissions for both simulated alcohol\nratios (0%, 5% and 12%), and non-simulated alcohol ratios (2%, 7%, and 12%)\nwhich demonstrating how hybrid physics-informed ML algorithms can extrapolate\ncomplex chemical behaviours, along with prediction errors under 5% for most\nextrapolated ethanol cases.

Metal-organic frameworks\n(MOFs) are one of the most versatile classes of porous crystals. So far only\ntwo-photon upconverting processes have been realized in MOFs both by ligand\nbased triplet-triplet annihilation and directly in lanthanide ions. Here we\nreport on Yb3+/Er3+-trimesate-based MOFs that exhibit photon avalanche (PA)\ncharacteristics. The PA process conventionally occurs through cross-relaxation\nwithin the lanthanide emitter manifold. In contrast, here PA proceeds in the\norganic molecule part and relies on a cooperative process, involving multiple\nemission centers. The IR photons are first absorbed and upconverted into high\nenergy electronic population by the action of the lanthanide ions (Yb3+ and\nEr3+ are the sensitizer and the activator, respectively). Subsequently, the\nelectrons are funneled into electronically coupled triplet states of the\ntrimesate ligand, enabling accumulation in the organic matrix. This reservoir\nacts as source for a highly nonlinear spectrally broadband emission, arising\nmainly from ligand triplet states. The nonlinearity factor is comparable with\nthe well-established PA inorganic nanoparticles. We prove that the PA is\nstrongly related to the degree of crystallinity of the MOF: not well-formed\nframeworks support only the characteristic Er3+ emission with only linear\nincrease as a function of the excitation power.

Focusing initially\non the bosonic model -- which can accommodate particles of arbitrary integer\nspin -- we review how quantization in the spin-1 sector, performed both via\nDirac's method and BRST quantization, reproduces the free Proca field theory.\nWe then introduce coupling to an external electromagnetic field and demonstrate\nthat Maxwell's equations for the background emerge as a consistency condition\nfor the nilpotency of the BRST charge on the spin-1 sector. Encouraged by this\nresult, which proves the viability of the particle model, we proceed to\nconstruct a path integral quantization of the worldline action for the charged\nspin-1 particle on the circle. This yields the one-loop effective Lagrangian\nfor a constant electromagnetic field induced by a massive charged vector boson.\nAs expected, the result reveals a vacuum instability, which we quantify by\nderiving the pair production rate for the vector bosons, recovering previous\nresults obtained in quantum field theory. For comparison, we repeat the\nanalysis using the standard $\\mathcal{N}=2$ spinning particle model, which\ncontains fermionic worldline degrees of freedom, finding identical results.\nFinally, we comment on possible extensions of the worldline models to include\neffective interactions and briefly explore their implications for pair\nproduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u7535\u8377\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-1\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u5f62\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u632f\u8361\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u8be5\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7BRST\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u6761\u4ef6\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u77e2\u91cf\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "Worldline formulations\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u65cb-1\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7c92\u5b50\u4e0e\u573a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u632f\u8361\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u81ea\u65cb1\u7684\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Dirac\u548cBRST\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86Proca\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u540e\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86BRST\u7535\u8377\u7684\u65e0\u5e73\u65b9\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4Maxwell\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u63a5\u7740\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u73af\u6548\u5e94\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u7a7a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4ea7\u7387\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6N=2\u7ed5\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u65cb-1\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u73af\u6548\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u573a\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76 spin-1 \u7c92\u5b50\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Several\ntheoretical works have appeared based on coherent state expansions of quantum\nstate of light to investigate non-classical driving of high-harmonic generation\nin atomic gases and solids, or free-electron dynamics, but their predictions\nsurprisingly coincide with what one could expect from essentially classical\ninterpretations of the light statistics. A deeper theoretical insight into the\nunderlying physics is necessary for understanding of observed experimental\nfindings and predicting emerging effects relying on this new configuration.\nHere we present a theoretical framework to describe tunneling driven by quantum\nlight, where the properties of such light are captured by a statistical\nensemble of classical fields via a hydrodynamic, also referred to as Bohmian,\nformulation. Generalizing the quasiclassical theory of non-adiabatic tunneling\ndriven by classical light, a single tunneling event is described by a bundle of\ntunneling solutions, each driven by a classical field corresponding to one\nrealization in the ensemble. Quantum statistics of light are thus imprinted on\nthe measured current. Fully quantum description of light via the Bohmian\ntrajectories of its field provides a perfect fit to the description of the\nelectron (under-) above-barrier dynamics in terms of (complex quasiclassical)\nreal classical trajectories, resulting in a consistent and elegant theoretical\napproach.

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's\noperational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles,\ni.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum\nStirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the\nthermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat\nengine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other\ngraphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer\ngraphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal\nthat MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while\nachieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though\nthe performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and\nQSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC.

These include the synthesis of new\nprecursors, optimizing growth conditions, introducing reactive gases during the\ngrowth process, and post-deposition purification techniques.Although iron\n(Fe)-based deposits are gaining particular interest due to their potential\napplications in nanomagnetism and spintronics, FEBID of Fe has not developed\nsignificantly due to several challenges, mainly controlling the e-beam reaction\nwith Fe precursors which often results in low yield growth due to a slow\ndissociation reaction. This work advances the controlled FEBID of complex 3D Fe\nnanostructures by further refining the spatial dwell-time resolution map to\nprint complex structures within nm feature accuracy, through quantitatively\ncalibrating Monte Carlo simulations with the measured experimental growth\nprofiles.

An essential step in QA is minor\nembedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum\nprocessor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with\nincreasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often\ndeveloped for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult\nto generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by\ntreating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an\nagent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem\nvariables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor\nembedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to\nembed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two\nhardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent\nconsistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number\nof qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology.

At a much\nlower $T_N$ ~ $A^2/T_Q$, virtual electronic fluctuations mediate an effective\nnuclear-spin Ising interaction, driving a second transition that collapses the\nremaining entropy.

We\nmoreover outline how to incorporate medium effects in this framework, necessary\nfor a realistic 3D description of gravitational wave to photon conversion in\nthe magnetosphere of neutron stars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5f53\u91cd\u529b\u6ce2\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u78c1\u573a\u6240\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9006\u52a0\u5c14\u7279enshtein\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8ePrimakoff\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6781\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u78c1\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u6781\u5316\u7387\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002\u4f8b\u5b50\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u6781\u78c1\u573a\u6240\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4e0d\u6781\u5316\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6cbf\u8d64\u9053\u65b9\u5411\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u6781\u5316\u7535\u78c1\u8f90\u5c04\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u5230\u9700\u8981\u4ecb\u6559\u5ba4\u6548\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u7ef4\u5efa\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u78c1osphere\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3egravitational\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5305\u542b\u80cc\u666f\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u6362\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u8f90\u5c04\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u78c1osphere\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u78c1\u573a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6781\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u78c1\u573a\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6781\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u6563\u5c04\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e3e\u4e86\u5355\u6781\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u6781\u5316\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u88ab\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6cbf\u8d64\u9053\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6781\u5316\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8d64\u9053\u9644\u8fd1\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5927\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u3002\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4ecb\u7535\u5e38\u6570\u548c\u78c1\u5bfc\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u9006\u52a0\u5c14\u7279enshtein\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u4e0d\u6781\u5316\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6781\u5316\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u8d64\u9053\u9644\u8fd1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4ecb\u7535\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u3002/angular distribution\u548c\u6781\u5316\u7279\u6027\u88ab\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u78c1\u573a\u65f6\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u78c1\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6781\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5355\u6781\u78c1\u573a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8f90\u5c04\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6781\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728-medium\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7535\u78c1\u8f90\u5c04\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e0e\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u4e5f\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u8a00\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that chiral coupling can be utilized to achieve\nunidirectional perfect absorption. In our experiments, chiral magnon-photon\ncoupling is realized by coupling the magnon modes in yttrium iron garnet (YIG)\nspheres with spin-momentum-locked waveguide modes supported by spoof surface\nplasmon polaritons (SSPPs). These photon modes exhibit transverse spin, with\nthe spin direction determined by the propagation direction. Due to the\nintrinsic spin properties of the magnon mode, it exclusively couples with\nmicrowaves traveling in one direction, effectively suppressing the reflection\nchannel. Under the critical coupling condition, transmission is also\neliminated, resulting in unidirectional perfect absorption. By incorporating\nadditional YIG spheres, bidirectional and multi-frequency perfect absorption\ncan be achieved.

We show that\ncoarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with\nsignificantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76 explore \u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u96be\u70b9\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7ea0\u7f20\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8282\u70b9\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In particular, thanks to the\nformal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge\nmodes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the\nbulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs\nwith boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be\nassociated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in\norder to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the\nprediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall\nsystems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a\nphysical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum\nField Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have\nnon-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining\nsymmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the\nboundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which\nalso appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a\npossible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton\nquasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the\nalgebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never\nproved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter,\nelasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this\nThesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar\ngauge structure.

Yet, many optical platforms naturally generate Gaussian\nstates--the common states of continuous-variable (CV) systems, making CV-based\nQNs an attractive route toward scalable, chip-integrated quantum computation\nand communication. To bridge the conceptual gap between well-studied DV\nentanglement percolation theories and their CV counterpart, we introduce a\nGaussian-to-Gaussian entanglement distribution scheme that deterministically\ntransports two-mode squeezed vacuum states across large CV networks. Analysis\nof the scheme's collective behavior using statistical-physics methods reveals a\nnew form of entanglement percolation--negativity percolation theory\n(NegPT)--characterized by a bounded entanglement measure called the ratio\nnegativity. We discover that NegPT exhibits a mixed-order phase transition,\nmarked simultaneously by both an abrupt change in global entanglement and a\nlong-range correlation between nodes. This distinctive behavior places CV-based\nQNs in a new universality class, fundamentally distinct from DV systems.\nAdditionally, the abruptness of this transition introduces a critical\nvulnerability of CV-based QNs: conventional feedback mechanism becomes\ninherently unstable near the threshold, highlighting practical implications for\nstabilizing large-scale CV-based QNs. Our results not only unify statistical\nmodels for CV-based entanglement distribution but also uncover previously\nunexplored critical phenomena unique to CV systems, providing valuable insights\nand guidelines essential for developing robust, feedback-stabilized QNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\uff08CV\uff09\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u53d8\u91cf\uff08DV\uff09\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8losinger\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u8d1f\u6027\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684CV\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u63a2\u7d22\u5149\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3CV\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4e34\u754c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d1f\u6027\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8d8a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21CV\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8d1f\u6027\u76f8\u53d8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684CV\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, identifying suitable sensing probes and\nmeasurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires\noptimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum\nsensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum\ncircuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum\nchannel, and measured to collect classical data.

It is of significant importance\nin fields such as quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum\nsimulation. However, as the size of the quantum system increases, the number of\nmeasurement settings and sampling requirements for quantum state tomography\ngrow exponentially with the number of qubits. This not only makes experimental\ndesign and implementation more complex, but also exacerbates the consumption of\nexperimental resources. These limitations severely hinder the application of\nstate tomography in large-scale quantum systems. To reduce measurement settings\nand improve sampling efficiency, this study proposes a state tomography method\nbased on auxiliary systems. This method can be implemented through either\nentanglement between the quantum system to be measured and a quantum auxiliary\nsystem or through correlation between the quantum system and a probabilistic\nclassical auxiliary system. Measurements on the entire joint system enable more\nefficient extraction of information about the quantum state to be measured.\nThis method relies on standard quantum gate operations and requires only two\nmeasurement settings, with a total sampling complexity of $O(d^2)$,\nsignificantly simplifying experimental operations and measurement processes.\nAdditionally, this study provides two schemes for measuring purity based on the\nproposed circuit, one of which achieves measurement precision at the Heisenberg\nlimit.

Advancing towards\nquantum advantage calls for a better understanding of the efficient use of\nnon-stabiliser states. We present an approach to track the behaviour of\nnon-stabiliserness across various algorithms by pairing resource theory of\nnon-stabiliser entropies with the geometry of quantum state evolution, and\nintroduce permutation agnostic distance measures that reveal non-stabiliser\neffects previously hidden by a subset of Clifford operations.

The atoms encode qubits in the long-lived hyperfine sublevels of\nthe ground electronic state. To realize the gate, we apply a global laser pulse\nto transfer the atoms to a Rydberg state with strong blockade interaction that\nsuppresses simultaneous excitation of neighboring atoms arranged in a\nstar-graph configuration. The number of Rydberg excitations, and thereby the\nparity of the resulting state, depends on the multiqubit input state.

Our results reveal fundamental\nrestrictions on logical gates originating from highly general algebraic\nstructures, extending beyond existing knowledge only in geometrically local,\nfinite logical qubits, transversal, or 2-dimensional product cases, and may\nguide the vital study of fault-tolerant quantum computation with qLDPC codes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528Homological\u4e58\u79ef\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u901a\u7528\u7684\u969c\u788d\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u5f20\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u975eClifford\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u95e8\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u65e0\u5173\u8054\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684 fault-tolerant \u5b9e\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fqLDPC\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u51e0\u4f55\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eBravyi-K\u00f6nig\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7cfb\u5217\u969c\u788d\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u9636\u4e58\u79ef\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fClifford\u5c42\u7ea7\u95e8\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f8b\u5b50\u8bf4\u660e\u5728\u6709\u548c\u65e0\u51e0\u4f55\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u975eClifford\u95e8\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u4e58\u79ef\u4e0b\u4e0d\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u6821\u9519\u95e8\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9650\u5236Clifford\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5c40\u90e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7535\u8def\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb codes \u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

In this work, we show that if the limits of integration in the path\nintegral are finite, the perturbative series is remarkably an absolutely\nconvergent series which works well at strong coupling. For now, we apply this\nperturbative approach to $\\lambda \\,\\phi^4$ theory in 0+0 dimensions (a basic\nintegral) and 0+1 dimensions (quantum anharmonic oscillator). For the basic\nintegral, we show that finite integral limits yields a convergent series whose\nvalues are in agreement with exact analytical results at any coupling. This\nworked even when the asymptotic series was not Borel summable. It is well known\nthat the perturbative series expansion in powers of the coupling for the energy\nof the anhaorminic oscillator yields an asymptotic series and hence fails at\nstrong coupling. In quantum mechanics, if one is interested in the energy, it\nis often easier to use Schr\\\"odinger's equation to develop a perturbative\nseries than path integrals. Finite path integral limits are then equivalent to\nplacing infinite walls at positions -L and L in the potential where L is\npositive, finite and can be arbitrarily large. With walls, the series expansion\nfor the energy is now convergent and approaches the energy of the anharmonic\noscillator as the walls are moved further apart. We use the convergent series\nto calculate the ground state energy at weak, intermediate and strong coupling.\nAt strong coupling, the result from the series agrees with the exact (correct)\nenergy to within 0.1 %, a remarkable result in light of the fact that at strong\ncoupling the usual perturbative series diverges badly right from the start.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper demonstrates that finite path integral limits yield a convergent perturbative series for strong coupling in quantum anharmonic oscillators and \u03bb\u03c6\u2074 theory in 0+1D, with results matching exact solutions remarkably well.", "motivation": "The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in quantum field theory: solving theories at strong coupling, where traditional perturbation methods fail. It proposes a novel approach using finite path integrals that yield convergent series, which is a significant advancement in the field.", "method": "The authors modify the path integral by introducing finite limits of integration, effectively adding infinite walls to the potential. This allows perturbative series in the coupling constant to be absolutely convergent even at strong coupling. The method is applied to \u03bb\u03c6\u2074 theory in 0+0 and 0+1 dimensions and the quantum anharmonic oscillator in 0+1 dimensions. Perturbative series are computed for ground state energy across varying coupling strengths and compared with exact results. The method is validated by showing agreement within 0.1% at strong coupling.", "result": "The study shows that finite path integrals produce a rapidly converging series for strong coupling scenarios. For the 0+1D quantum anharmonic oscillator, the method's perturbative results match the exact energy up to 0.1% when expanded to 5th order. Similar results are obtained for \u03bb\u03c6\u2074 theory in 0+0 dimensions, confirming the approach's validity. In weak coupling, the results align with perturbative calculations, while at intermediate and strong coupling, they outperform traditional asymptotic series which diverge.", "conclusion": "This paper introduces a novel perturbative method rooted in finite path integrals that effectively addresses strong coupling issues. By confining the system within finite boundaries, the authors achieve perturbative convergence, offering a promising alternative to traditional asymptotic series. The method's success in both 0+0 and 0+1 dimensions demonstrates its broad applicability, with clear implications for solving strongly coupled quantum field theories and related problems in quantum mechanics."}}
