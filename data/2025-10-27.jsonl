Through controlled atom depletion\nvia superradiance, we analyze the sample's expansion dynamics and aspect ratio\nto identify the BEC-droplet phases distinctly, supported by Gaussian\nvariational ansatz calculations.

It is well known that, in the framework of\nNewtonian mechanics, motions are dissipative; however, when subjected to\nperiodic motion, a system can produce nondissipative motions intermittently and\nsubject to resonance. It is in resonance that turbulence occurs in fluid flow,\nsolid vibration, thermal transport, etc. In this, the findings from these\nphysical systems are analyzed in the framework of statistics with their own\nprobability space to establish their compliance to the stochastic process. In\nparticular, a systematic alignment of the inception of the stochastic process\nwith the signed measure theory, signed probability space, and stochastic\nprocess was investigated. It was found that the oscillatory load from the\ndissipative state excited the system and resulted in a quasi-periodic\nprobability density function with the negative probability regimes. In\naddition, the vectorial nature of the random velocity splits the probability\ndensity function along both the positive and negative axes with slight\nasymmetricity. By assuming that a deterministic process has a probability of 1,\nwe can express the inception of a stochastic process, and the subsequent\nbenefit is that a dynamic fractal falls on the probability density function.\nMoreover, we leave some questions of inconsistency between the physical system\nand the measurement theory for future investigation. We believe that the\nestablishment of the probability density function of resonance nondissipative\ndynamics in contemporary statistics should make many mathematical tools\navailable and the analytical formulas for the random velocity and probability\ndensity function can provide a convenient platform for the development of\nstatistics."}

Using physics-aware optimal\ntransport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the\npotential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling.\nAlongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce\nreinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the\nfinal state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are\nspecified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first,\nmodular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and\nBayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and\npractical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding\ntheoretical promise into a working engine for discovery."}

However, we show\nhere that metal dewetting inherently leads to a coupling between the nanowire\ndiameter and spacing. To overcome this limitation, we introduce two strategies\nthat are exemplified for GaN nanowires: (i) modification of the surface and\ninterface energies within the dewetting system, and (ii) thinning of the\nnanowires by lateral etching. In the first strategy, GaN(0001), SiOx, and SiNx\nsubstrate surfaces are combined with Au, Pt, and Pt-Au alloy dewetting metals\nto tune the dewetting behavior. The differences in interface energies affect\nthe relation between nanowire diameter and spacing, albeit within a limited\nrange. The second strategy adds a lateral etching step to the conventional\ntop-down nanowire fabrication process. This step at the same time reduces the\nnanowire diameter and increases the spacing, thus enabling combinations beyond\nthe constraints of metal dewetting alone.

The method\npartitions the virtual orbital space into chemically intuitive fragments and\nemploys many-body expansion techniques analogous to spatial fragmentation\nmethods. Applications to six molecular systems demonstrate that the 2-body FVO\nexpansion achieves errors below 3 kcal/mol, while the 3-body expansion provides\nsub-kcal/mol accuracy. When integrated with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver\n(VQE) and combined with the Effective Fragment Molecular Orbital (EFMO) method\nfor multi-molecular systems, the hierarchical Q-EFMO-FVO approach achieves\n96--100\\% accuracy relative to full calculations.

In all models, the\nexternal bright rings corresponding to the high-order image and the internal\ndark region associated with the event horizon are observed. At high\nobservational inclinations, the inner shadows are obscured by the radiation\nfrom the equatorial plane, which is significantly different from the thin\naccretion disk model. The primary distinction between isotropic and anisotropic\nradiation is that the latter causes distortion of the high-order image in the\nvertical direction, resulting in an elliptical structure. For the HOU disk\nmodel, due to certain regions are geometrically thinner under the conical\napproximation, the high-order images are narrower compared to the\nphenomenological model.

They are appealing for the experimental\nease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and an elegant\nmathematical description.

In terms of quantum resource theory, we can then recognize\nnon-Gaussian states as resources and Gaussian operations and states as free,\nwhich can be used and prepared easily. Given such a structure of resource\ntheory, the task of broadcasting the resource is to determine if the resource\ncontent of a state can be cloned in a meaningful way, which, if possible,\nprovides a strong operation for manipulation of the resource. In this work, we\nprove that broadcasting of non-Gaussian states via Gaussian operations is not\npossible. For this, we first show that the relative entropy of non- Gaussianity\nis not super-additive, which rules it out as a prime candidate in the analysis\nof such no-go results. Our proof is then based on understanding fixed points of\nGaussian operations and relates to the theory of control systems.

Recent\nenhancements include a ranking statistic fully based on multivariate\nclassification with eXtreme Gradient Boosting, a thorough validation of the\nstatistical significance accuracy of GWT candidates, and a measurement of the\ncorrelations of false alarms and simulated detections between different\nconcurrent searches. For the first time, we provide a comprehensive comparison\nof cWB-2G performance on data from networks made of two and three detectors,\nand we demonstrate the advantage of combining concurrent searches for GWTs of\ngeneric morphology in a global observatory. This work offers essential insights\nfor assessing our data analysis strategies in ongoing and future LVK searches\nfor generic GWTs."}

One of the main lessons is that, for a radial\ndirection to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support.\nFurthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex\ngravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to\ncombine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess\nin which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we\ncompute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched\ndisorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in\nthe large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our\nmain finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg\nmodel, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large\n$q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite\nfamily of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the\n$p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann\nalgebra.

Since $N^2/\\lambda$ is\nimaginary in all dimensions, the class of (parity-even) KFTs has no overlap\nwith the class of Wick rotations of unitary QFTs. We also make a preliminary\ninvestigation of positivity conditions, which might constrain the overall $\\pm$\nsign of $N^2$ and $\\lambda$.\n  Although SU($N$) models with adjoint matter can be defined in generic real\ndimensions $d$, several features of the class of KFTs are nicer when $d$ is\nodd, allowing $N^2$ to be real. This includes the possibility of non-oriented\nand/or open string duals, reality of the effective number of degrees of\nfreedom, and closure under RG flow beyond the leading order in a $1/N$\nexpansion. This could explain why we live in a cosmology with an even number of\nspacetime dimensions."}

First, attention is put on the\ntechnical ability of the optimization method to get more flexible series of\nGaussian exponents, in order to improve the accuracy of the fitting approach.\nSecond, an indirect fitting method is proposed, allowing for the oscillatory\nbehaviour of continuum functions to be conserved up to infinity as a factorized\nasymptotic function, while the Gaussian representation is applied to some\nappropriately defined distortion factor with limited spatial extension. As an\nillustration, the method is applied to radial Coulomb functions with realistic\nenergy parameters. We also show that the indirect fitting approach keeps the\nadvantageous analytical structure of typical one-electron transition integrals\noccurring in molecular ionization applications."}

The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter\n(SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant,\nred-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation.\nWe present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs\nquantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation\nconditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and\ntwo-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation\npowers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\\sim$95 %) and high\nsingle-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a\nshortened exciton decay time ($\\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient\nexciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both\nexcitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in\na highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by\na factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe\nbiexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized\nexciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and\nbiexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of\nbiexciton preparation under SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a\nproposed four-level theoretical model including the biexciton. We also report\nthat, strikingly, a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an\nadditional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton\nstate without altering the nominal excitation polarization. These findings\nestablish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and\nbiexciton control, with strong potential for quantum photonic applications."}

Rydberg rf sensors have a number of\ninteresting fundamental distinctions from traditional receiver technologies,\nsuch as those based on metallic antennas, since they are governed by the\nquantum physics of atom-light interactions. As Rydberg sensors quickly advance\nfrom laboratory experiments into fieldable devices, there is a need for a\ngeneral software modeling tool that fully encompasses the internal physics of\nthe sensor. The Rydberg Interactive Quantum Module (RydIQule) is a Python\npackage designed to fill this need. The initial public release of RydIQule in\nlate 2023 built the core functionality described above.
