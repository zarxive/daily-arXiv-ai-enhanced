### [1] [Phase transitions and dynamics of one-dimensional solitons in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Bose mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10632)
*Gui-hua Chen,Hongcheng Wang,Boris A. Malomed,Haiming Deng,Yongyao Li*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: 研究了一维双玻色子超流体中亮孤子的形成、稳定性与动力学，考虑了自旋-轨道耦合和 Lee-Huang-Yang 校正项，发现半暗弦（SD）家族的孤子在非线性强度和规范数之间存在复杂的分岔，出现实到复值静态波函数变化、规范数依赖的动态不稳定性，稳定性图显示单稳态、振荡行为和孤子分裂。具有复静态波函数的孤子在参数范围内更常见，而其他孤子类型不具备复化分岔。LHY主导时，SD和MM孤子的能效相同，显示出量子气体中的非线性态和多稳态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非线性玻色子系统的孤子行为对量子气体和相关领域有重要价值。

Method: 数值分析，通过解 Gross-Pitaevskii 方程计算孤子特性，分析膜相关分岔、稳定性变化等。

Result: 发现SD孤子在不同参数下的复杂动态行为，分离出不同类型的孤子，并分析其能量变化和稳定性区域。

Conclusion: 随着LHY校正的影响，非线性玻色子态在量子气体中展现出多稳定的动态特性，对实验现象有重要指导意义。

Abstract: We investigate the formation, stability, and dynamics of solitons in a
one-dimensional binary Bose-Einstein condensate under the action of the
spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the underlying
system of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We identify the semi-dipole (SD)
family of solitons and thoroughly analyze its properties. The numerical
analysis reveals intricate bifurcations, including transitions from real to
complex-valued stationary wavefunctions of the SD solitons and norm-dependent
dynamical instabilities. Stability maps in the plane of the solitons' norm and
interaction strength exhibit areas of monostability, oscillatory behavior, and
soliton splitting. Solitons with complex stationary wavefunctions emerge as
ground states in broad parameter areas, due to the effects of the LHY terms.
The other soliton species, in the form of mixed modes (MMs), does not feature
the compexification bifurcation. In the LHY-dominated regime, the SD and MM
solitons exhibit identical values of the energy for the same norm. The results
deepen the understanding of nonlinear matter-wave states and reveal
multi-stable ones in quantum gases.

### [2] [Run-and-Tumble Escape in Pursuit-Evasion Dynamics of Intelligent Active Particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10727)
*Segun Goh,Dennis Haustein,Gerhard Gompper*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: 研究了两个敌对的主动目标的追逐-逃逸游戏， pursuer 和 evader 分别具有不同的运动特性。通过数值模拟展示了在两种主要场景下，pursuer 和 evader 的动力学行为，为生物ologically 基spir系统设计提供了指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究追逐-逃逸游戏有助于理解 agent 之间的相互作用和运动策略，尤其是在生物仿生-inspired机器人设计中具有应用价值.

Method: 研究使用了确定性的自我驱动 pursuer 模型和具有认知能力且不可预测的 stocastically 逃逸的 evader。通过调整 tumbling frequency 和 tumbling range 的参数，评估不同的追逐策略。

Result: 模拟显示，当 pursuer 的速度占优时，evader 必须采取高风险策略。否则，evader 通过调整方向可以延缓捕捉时间。

Conclusion: 结果为设计高效逃逸能力的机器人系统提供了指导。

Abstract: The pursuit-evasion game is studied for two adversarial active agents,
modelled as a deterministic self-steering pursuer and a stochastic, cognitive
evader. The pursuer chases the evader by reorienting its propulsion direction
with limited maneuverability, while the evader escapes by executing sharp,
unpredictable turns, whose timing and direction the pursuer cannot anticipate.
To make the target responsive and agile when the threat level is high, the
tumbling frequency is set to increase with decreasing distance from the
pursuer; furthermore, the range of preferred tumbling directions is varied.
Numerical simulations of such a pursuit-target pair in two spatial dimensions
reveal two important scenarios. For dominant pursuers, the evader is compelled
to adopt a high-risk strategy that allows the pursuer to approach closely
before the evader executes a potentially game-changing backward maneuver to
pull away from the pursuer. Otherwise, a strategy where the evader tumbles
forward with continuous slight adjustments of the propulsion direction can
significantly increase the capture time by preventing the pursuer from aligning
with the target propulsion direction, while maintaining the persistence of the
target motion. Our results can guide the design of bioinspired robotic systems
with efficient evasion capabilities.

### [3] [Behind the mirror: the hidden dissipative singular solutions of ideal reversible fluids on log-lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10659)
*Guillaume Costa,Amaury Barral,Adrien Lopez,Quentin Pikeroen,Bérengère Dubrulle*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic approach to construct singular solutions of the Euler equations by introducing an efficiency parameter, and observes a phase transition in fluid dynamics between regular and singular phases. The exponents observed are comparable to those of ordinary fluids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about turbulence and singular solutions in fluid dynamics, which are important to understanding the behavior of fluids in extreme conditions, like in a vacuum where viscosity is negligible.

Method: The authors use a reversible framework and introduce a non-dimensional efficiency parameter. They employ log-lattices to handle computational costs while preserving symmetries and conservation laws. A stochastic regularization is used to observe solutions after a phase transition.

Result: The study shows a phase transition in fluid behavior based on efficiency. The singular solutions exhibit self-similar blow-ups with specific scaling exponents. Using stochastic regularization allows crossing the blow-up, leading to solutions that match power-law scaling typical of dissipative fluids. The range of scaling exponents observed is comparable to those found in regular fluids.

Conclusion: This work suggests a method to construct singular solutions of the Euler equations through an efficiency parameter, with implications for understanding turbulence and singular behaviors in fluid dynamics without viscosity. The approach could be valuable for further studies on singular solutions and turbulence in ideal fluids.

Abstract: Empirical observations show that turbulence exhibits a broad range of scaling
exponents, characterizing how the velocity gradients diverge in the inviscid
limit. These exponents are thought to be linked to singular solutions of the
Euler equations. In this work, we propose a dynamic approach to construct
concept of these solutions directly from the fluid equations, using a
reversible framework and introducing the efficiency $\cal{E}$, a
non-dimensional number that quantifies the amount of energy stored within the
flow due to an applied force. To circumvent the computational burden of
tracking singularities at finer and finer scale, we test this approach on
fluids on log-lattices, which allow for high effective resolutions at a
moderate cost, while preserving the same symmetries and global conservation
laws as ordinary fluids. We observe a phase transition at a given efficiency,
separating regular, viscous solutions (hydrodynamic phase), from singular,
inviscid solutions (singular phase). The singular solutions experience
self-similar blow-ups with exponents corresponding to non-dissipative
solutions. By applying a stochastic regularization, we are able to go past the
blow-up, and show that the resulting solutions converge to power-law solutions
with exponents characterizing dissipative solutions. Overall, the range of
scaling exponents observed for log-lattice solutions is comparable to those of
ordinary fluids.

Abstract: 4H-silicon carbide is a promising platform for solid-state quantum technology
due to its commercial availability as a wide bandgap semiconductor and ability
to host numerous spin-active color centers. Integrating color centers into
suspended nanodevices enhances defect control and readout--key advances needed
to fully harness their potential. However, challenges in developing robust
fabrication processes for 4H-SiC thin films--due to the material's chemical and
mechanical stability--limit their implementation in quantum applications. Here,
we report on a new fabrication approach that first synthesizes suspended thin
films from a monolithic platform, then patterns devices. With this technique,
we fabricate and characterize structures tailored for defect integration,
demonstrating 1D photonic crystal cavities, with and without waveguide
interfaces, and lithium niobate on 4H-SiC acoustic cavities. This approach
allows for greater fabrication flexibility--supporting high temperature
annealing and heterogeneous material platform compatibility--providing a
versatile platform for scalable fabrication of 4H-SiC devices for quantum
technologies.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新的思路，利用几何方法研究自旋轨道动力学，为相关领域的研究提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: The geometric structure of quantum states plays a fundamental role in
determining the intrinsic dynamics of electrons in solids. In this work, we
study the geometric origin of orbital angular momentum and its transport in a
general two-band electronic system. Without assuming any symmetry or
dimensional constraints, we show that the orbital Berry curvature, which
governs the orbital Hall effect, can be universally expressed as the product of
the band energy and the square of the Berry curvature. This highlights the
central role of Berry curvature in engineering orbital Hall responses. We also
discuss the applicability of our framework by analyzing a realistic model. Our
findings underscore the geometric universality of itinerant intrinsic orbital
dynamics.

Conclusion: 该研究为二维材料中的自旋可控 devices提供了新范式，展示了对更高效自旋控制技术的潜在贡献。

Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an
alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond
the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an
unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in
two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where
the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk
band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically
tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to
be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance,
giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR)
effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we
computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to
demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or
electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device
for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了磁场对双位系和单层系中 skyrmion 的拓扑电荷动态调控。通过垂直磁场所致的周期性变化，双位FeGe中的skyrmion经历了从Q=1到Q=-1的转变，而单层Co/Pt则经历了 skyrmion 的消失和重新形成。结果显示，这些系统中skyrmion的动态行为各具不同机制，为spintronic应用提供了潜在的技术路线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关于 skyrmion 在自旋电子学中的重要性，如何实现对其动力学控制以应用于实际器件是一个关键问题。这篇论文通过实验展示了在双位和单层系统中，通过可调磁场实现skyrmion拓扑电荷的变化，这为相关领域提供了新的见解和可能的应用方向。

Method: 实验方法包括在双位FeGe和单层Co/Pt系统中施加垂直于薄膜平面的振荡磁场，并观察到skyrmion的动态转变。使用了X射线衍射等手段实现成像，捕捉了skyrmion在不同阶段的变化情况。

Result: 在双位FeGe中，skyrmion经历了从Q=1到Q=0再到Q=-1的转变，并通过X射线衍射观察到了中间的skyrmionium状态。在单层Co/Pt中，skyrmion经历了annihilation和重新核型化的过程，表现出Alternate topological charges。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，磁场可以通过不同的动态机制控制skyrmion的拓扑电荷，在双位和单层系统中分别利用了interfacial 和 bulk机制。这一发现为开发高效能的自旋电子器件提供了研究路径。

Abstract: The dynamic control of skyrmion properties such as polarity, vorticity, and
topological charge is crucial for their implementation in spintronic
applications. In this work, we investigate the periodic inversion of the
topological charge in two distinct systems: FeGe, a bulk chiral magnet, and
Co/Pt, an interfacial system with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. By
applying an oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane, we
induce cyclic transitions in the spin texture. In FeGe, the skyrmion evolves
through a $Q=1 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow -1$ sequence via an intermediate
skyrmionium state. In Co/Pt, the process involves skyrmion annihilation and
re-nucleation, resulting in alternating topological charges. These results
reveal distinct dynamic mechanisms for topological charge modulation, offering
potential pathways for the energy-efficient control of skyrmion-based devices.

Abstract: We study interaction-driven edge reconstruction in a quantum spin Hall
insulator described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with Kanamori-Hubbard
interactions using the real-space density matrix renormalization group method
in both the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles. For a two-dimensional
cylinder with a smooth edge, we identify discrete particle-number transitions
that lead to a spin-polarized edge state stabilized by an emergent
ferromagnetic exchange interaction. The reconstruction is orbital-selective,
occurring predominantly in the $s$-orbital channel. Our results reveal a fully
microscopic mechanism for emergent spin polarization at the edge that could
compromise the topological protection of helical edge states by time reversal
symmetry.

*Yuta Igarashi,Junji Fujimoto*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper uses reinforcement learning to control a single-domain nanomagnet, achieving deterministic magnetization reversal within 300 picoseconds at a high current density. The approach leverages spin-orbit torques and involves a model-based analysis. The control strategy is robust against damping and thermal fluctuations. Feasible experimental methods are suggested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on achieving ultra-fast magnetization reversal in nanomagnets, which is significant for applications such as magnetic data storage and spintronics. The use of reinforcement learning to optimize current waveforms for deterministic switching is innovative and addresses the challenge of controlling nanoscale magnetic elements with precision.

Method: The researchers couple reinforcement learning with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, incorporating spin-orbit torques. The RL agent autonomously discovers current waveforms that minimize the magnetization path, utilizing precessional shortcuts enabled by field-like SOT and hard-axis anisotropy. They also develop a model-based framework to establish a lower bound on switching time.

Result: The approach achieves deterministic, field-free magnetization reversal in 300 picoseconds under a current density of 3x10^10 A/m^2. The control strategy remains robust across varying damping constants and is stabilized against thermal fluctuations even at higher current densities. The RL agent and dynamic model enable effective learning and prediction for practical implementation.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel control strategy for magnetization reversal in single-domain nanomagnets by integrating reinforcement learning with micromagnetic modeling. This method ensures precise and fast switching, with potential application in high-performance magnetic devices. Further research is suggested into integrating machine learning techniques for the control of magnetic data storage devices.

Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic, field-free magnetization reversal of a
single-domain nanomagnet within 300 ps under a current density of $3 \times
10^{10}~\mathrm{A/m^2}$ by coupling reinforcement learning (RL) to the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the spin-orbit torques (SOTs). The RL
agent autonomously discovers a current waveform that minimizes the
magnetization trajectory path and exploits a precessional shortcut enabled by
the field-like SOT and hard-axis anisotropy. From the learned pulse, we extract
a clear physical picture of the dynamics and develop a model-based analytical
framework that establishes a lower bound on the switching time. The control
strategy remains robust across a wide range of damping constants and is
stabilized against thermal fluctuations at higher current densities. We also
discuss feasible experimental implementations for the precessional switching.

*Akash Gugnani,Aniket Majumdar,Kenji Watanabe,Takashi Taniguchi,Arindam Ghosh*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to dynamically adjust disorder in high-quality graphene devices, achieving a gradual increase in charge transport properties through tunable disorder modification, utilizing UV radiation and gate electric fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphene has shown great promise in electronic applications, particularly those requiring viscous electronic flow, but the inherent disorder limits its tunability. This study addresses this limitation by demonstrating a modulation technique to control disorder levels, enhancing device transport properties.

Method: The research employs a multifaceted approach involving UV radiation to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric layers and applies gate electric fields to control the disorder level, enabling real-time monitoring of thermal and electrical transport metrics.

Result: By increasing disorder through UV irradiation, the study observes a significant enhancement in momentum-relaxing scattering and approaches the restoration of the Wiedemann-Franz law, indicating improved thermal efficiency and carrier mobility in highly disordered graphene structures.

Conclusion: The conducted experiments validate the effectiveness of using UV light and gate electric fields to dynamically tune the disorder in graphene, paving the way for significant advancements in the design and functionality of graphene-based electronic devices, particularly those requiring precise control over charge flow dynamics.

Abstract: Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for
exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability
of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated
within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level
of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication
protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the
impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this
work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric
field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics,
quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure
from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room
temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and
reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating
hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase
in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and
also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder,
thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered
graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental
mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.

Abstract: In moir\'e-patterned van der Waals structures of transition metal
dichalcogenides, correlated insulators can form under integer and fractional
fillings, whose transport properties are governed by various quasiparticle
excitations including holons, doublons and interlayer exciton insulators. Here
we theoretically investigate the nearest-neighbor inter-site hoppings of holons
and interlayer exciton insulators. Our analysis indicates that these hopping
strengths are significantly enhanced compared to that of a single carrier. The
underlying mechanism can be attributed to the strong Coulomb interaction
between carriers at different sites. For the interlayer exciton insulator
consisting of a holon and a carrier in different layers, we have also obtained
its effective Bohr radius and energy splitting between the ground and
first-excited states.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Flat bands, in which kinetic energy is quenched and quantum states become
macroscopically degenerate, host a rich variety of correlated and topological
phases, from unconventional superconductors to fractional Chern insulators. In
Hermitian lattices, their formation mechanisms are now well understood, but
whether such states persist, and acquire new features in non-Hermitian (NH)
quantum crystals, relevant to open and driven systems, has remained an open
question. Here we show that the Hermitian principle for flat-band formation in
bipartite lattices, based on a sublattice degeneracy mismatch, extends directly
to the NH regime: whenever one sublattice hosts a momentum-independent
eigenvalue with degeneracy exceeding that of its partner on the other
sublattice, flat bands arise regardless of gain, loss, or complex couplings.
Strikingly, at exceptional points, dispersive bands coalesce to form
\emph{exceptional flat bands} that persist beyond these singularities,
exhibiting biorthogonal eigenmodes spanning both sublattices, with energies and
lifetimes tunable via sublattice asymmetry and non-reciprocal couplings. This
general framework unifies Hermitian and NH flat-band constructions, and reveals
dispersionless states with no closed-system analogue. The proposed construction
is applicable to synthetic platforms, from classical metamaterials, where flat
bands can be directly emulated, to quantum-engineered systems such as photonic
crystals and ultracold atom arrays, which should host correlated and
topological phases emerging from such exceptional flat bands.

### [15] [Visualizing intense laser field driven electron dynamics in a multielectron molecule: dynamic electron localization, bonding properties and multiple ionization bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10475)
*L. Bauerle,A. Jaron*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates electron dynamics in ground-state molecular nitrogen cation under ultrafast laser pulses, discovering oscillations in ionization rates and multiple ionization bursts. They analyze bonding properties through electron density and localization functions, highlighting the discovery of transient bonding characteristics such as double, triple, and lone pair bonds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on electron dynamics under ultrafast laser pulses, a topic in quantum electronics, aiming to understand phenomena like ionization and bonding changes.

Method: The authors used time-dependent density functional theory to model ionization rates and bond dynamics under laser pulses, analyzing simulations for oscillatory patterns and structural changes.

Result: They found ionization oscillations influenced by excited state population modulation and multiple ionization bursts, along with detailed bond changes across different molecular configurations.

Conclusion: The experiments demonstrate how ultrafast pulses can induce complex electronic dynamics, including multiple bond transitions, contributing to a deeper understanding of ultrafast laser-molecule interactions and potential for applications in areas like attosecond technology.

Abstract: The paper presents results and discussion of electron dynamics in molecules
in which intense ultrafast pulse drives multiphoton ionization, high harmonic
generation, and charge resonance due to the Rabbi flopping in the regime of
Charge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) for the ground state molecular
nitrogen cation. We show how ionization rates oscillate with oscillations of
envelope reflecting modulation of the population of the excited molecular
orbital. We observe the increase in ionization due to mechanisms analogous to
Charge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) and also uncover also the time
periods of suppressed ionization. Electronic flux calculations illustrate these
changes and help reveal multiple ionization bursts which are for the first time
reported for a multielectron non-stretched/ non-dissociating molecule.
Furthermore, we discuss the effects of ultrafast intense laser pulses on the
bonding properties of a nitrogen molecular ion in these conditions through
detailed analysis of electron density and electron density differences,
time-dependent average local energy, and time-dependent electron localization
function. We illustrate the main characteristics of changes of the electron
density that leads to laser induced dynamics of bonding and how the standard
criteria lead to the transient properties of double, triple, and lone pair
bonding characteristics.

Abstract: We report on the observation, characterization, and control of the electron
dynamics in ionized argon atoms. We utilized an intense mid-infrared (MIR)
pulse to create a coherent superposition of the spin-orbit split ground state
of the ion. A weak extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse then probes the hole
oscillation through time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. We
investigated several 3p to nd transitions accessible with our XUV high
harmonics which show a 23fs beat corresponding to the energy separation between
the initially populated states. The experimental attosecond transient
absorption signals for different pathways were simulated using detailed TDSE
simulations and perturbative analytic calculations. The analysis of phase
relations between the oscillations reveals important information about
transition dipole moments in the system. In addition, we employed another
strong MIR pulse to achieve transient control over the absorption by inducing
Stark shifts of the states without affecting the electronic coherences.

*Yijun Jiang,Jan Rudolph,Jason M. Hogan*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of clock atom interferometry with large momentum transfer, demonstrating that despite challenges like laser frequency noise, these systems can achieve high fidelity without limitations on LMT enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors were motivated by the need to improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors using clock atom interferometry, particularly focusing on overcoming limitations like laser noise.

Method: The study used a two-level system approach in an atom interferometer to measure fidelity over multiple pulses, analyzing scaling behaviors and parasitic paths.

Result: Fidelity scales linearly with the number of pulses, offering a solution better than pulsed systems, and shows negligible contribution from parasitic paths.

Conclusion: Laser frequency noise is not a limiting factor for high-fidelity LMT systems, making them viable for future quantum sensors.

Abstract: Clock atom interferometry is an emerging technique in precision measurements
that is particularly well suited for sensitivity enhancement through large
momentum transfer (LMT). While current systems have demonstrated momentum
separations of several hundreds of photon momenta, next-generation quantum
sensors are targeting an LMT enhancement factor beyond $10^4$. However, the
viability of LMT clock interferometers has recently come into question due to
the potential impact of laser frequency noise. Here, we resolve this concern by
analyzing the cumulative fidelity of sequential state inversions in an LMT atom
interferometer. We show that the population error from $n$ pulses applied from
alternating directions scales linearly with $n$. This is a significant
advantage over the $n^2$ scaling that occurs when probing a two-level system
$n$ times from the same direction. We further show that contributions to the
interferometer signal from parasitic paths generated by imperfect pulses are
negligible, for any loss mechanism. These results establish that laser
frequency noise is not a practical limitation for the development of
high-fidelity LMT clock atom interferometers.

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一种高效、可靠的主动空间选择方法，并将其整合成易于使用的软件包，使其适合量子化学和量子计算领域广泛应用。

Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in
multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with
strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to
unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry.
Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully
automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a
wide range of molecular systems.
  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic
Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy
analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of
chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme
enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while
retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of
molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of
Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation
and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due
to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate
electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can
reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the
essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum
computational frameworks.
  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive
to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and
quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research
community.

TL;DR: 研究总结：机器学习势能模型在生物分子动力学模拟中的应用仍有瓶颈。通过评估不同模型架构和训练策略，发现模型规模和训练数据对模型性能有显著影响，但动态性质必须通过更高质量的数据集进行训练才能准确预测。碱性 tractase 使用长距离电离势能预测的构象多样性有所增加，但其他系统效果不显著。

Conclusion: 结论：当前的训练集数据集不均衡性和评估方法限制了通用势能模型在生物分子动力学中的应用。为更好地评估和应用，需要更均衡和高质量的训练数据，以及丢弃假设性的方法。

Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across
compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to
biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically
evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2
dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We
assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic
treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as
molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and
biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and
Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend
does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted
properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range
electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage,
their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results
suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently
challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to
biomolecular simulations.

Conclusion: QAOA的结果取决于问题本身，需要根据具体情况调整参数设置，以充分提取其潜力。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary
quantum algorithms research. While they have demonstrated considerable promise
in solving problems of practical interest, efficiently determining the minimal
quantum resources necessary to obtain such a solution remains an open question.
In this work, inspired by concepts from classical machine learning, we
investigate the impact of overparameterization on the performance of
variational algorithms. Our study focuses on the quantum approximate
optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- a prominent variational quantum algorithm
designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We investigate if
circuit overparametrization is necessary and sufficient to solve such problems
in QAOA, considering two representative problems -- MAX-CUT and MAX-2-SAT. For
MAX-CUT we observe that overparametriation is both sufficient and
(statistically) necessary for attaining exact solutions, as confirmed
numerically for up to $20$ qubits. In fact, for MAX-CUT on 2-regular graphs we
show the necessity to be exact, based on the analytically found optimal depth.
In sharp contrast, for MAX-2-SAT, underparametrized circuits suffice to solve
most instances. This result highlights the potential of QAOA in the
underparametrized regime, supporting its utility for current noisy devices.

TL;DR: Represent quantum circuits using a modified TDVP method to suppress bond dimension growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical simulating quantum circuits is challenging due to exponential growth in resources, and current methods like TEBD have limitations with bond dimension and long-range gates. The paper proposes using TDVP to reinterpret quantum circuits, aiming to reduce these limitations.

Method: The paper redevelops quantum circuit simulation using a local TDVP approach, interpreting circuits as discrete time evolutions with gate generators. This directly addresses TEBD's bond growth and long-range gates through global entanglement diffusion, optimizing state representation on MPS manifold.

Result: The modified TDVP method is benchmarked on five 49-qubit circuits, showing resource reductions compared to standard tools across various quantum computing applications.

Conclusion: The new simulation method significantly improves upon existing techniques by reducing memory and runtime costs, opening up new possibilities in quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential
quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated
methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network
approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the
time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale
circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is
limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and
handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of
the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we
reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using
gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP
formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally
accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS
manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local
bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on
five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic
Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate
optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields
substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum
computing, condensed matter, and beyond.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for efficient quantum memory systems for scalable quantum computing and networks.

Method: The researchers experimentally demonstrated a light storage and retrieval protocol in a tripod system using laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms. They employed coherent storage and retrieval of a weak probe pulse within the $^{87}$Rb $F=1$ ground state manifold, observing interference effects due to spin-wave excitations. By varying storage time, optical phase, and magnetic field strength, they controlled these interferences. Theoretical simulations supported the experimental results.

Result: The study successfully implemented a protocol that allows precise light storage and retrieval with controllable interference effects, outperforming conventional Λ-systems.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of atomic tripod systems for scalable quantum information processing, emphasizing their versatile capabilities beyond traditional Λ-systems.

Abstract: Highly-efficient quantum memories are essential for advancing quantum
information processing technologies, including scalable quantum computing and
quantum networks. We experimentally demonstrate a light storage and retrieval
protocol in a tripod system using an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms.
The tripod system, which consists of three ground states and an excited state,
offers rich dynamics: its use to coherently store and retrieve a weak probe
pulse in the $^{87}$Rb $F=1$ ground state manifold leads to the interference of
two spin-wave excitations during storage time that translate to an interference
in the peak intensity of the retrieved probe pulse. Our work shows that these
interferences, which manifest when varying the pulse sequence or energy level
structure, can be controlled experimentally by varying the storage time,
optical phase, and magnetic field strength. Theoretical simulations exhibit
excellent agreement with the experimental results. This work demonstrates the
rich dynamics and versatile capabilities of atomic tripod systems for light
storage and retrieval, with key advantages over conventional $\Lambda$-systems,
highlighting the potential of atomic tripod systems for applications in quantum
information processing, quantum synchronization, and atomic memory protocols.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for understanding the key aspects needed to realize universal topological quantum computation, including qubit encodings, measurements, and the simulation of realistic quantum devices. The numerical method is practical and can simulate actual experimental devices, making it a valuable resource for future research in topological quantum computing.

Abstract: We summarize the key ingredients required for universal topological quantum
computation using Majorana zero modes in networks of topological superconductor
nanowires. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of both sparse and dense
logical qubit encodings, and on the transitions between them via projective
parity measurements. Combined with hybridization, these operations extend the
computational capabilities beyond braiding alone and enable universal gate
sets. In addition to outlining the theoretical foundations-including the
algebra of Majorana operators, along with the stabilizer formalism-we introduce
an efficient numerical method for simulating the time-dependent dynamics of
such systems. This method, based on the time dependent Pfaffian formalism,
allows for the classical simulation of realistic device architectures that
incorporate braiding, projective measurements, and disorder. The result is a

Abstract: Topological quantum computing promises intrinsic fault tolerance by encoding
quantum information in non-Abelian anyons, where quantum gates are implemented
via braiding. While braiding operations are robust against local perturbations,
a critical yet often overlooked challenge arises when scaling beyond two
qubits: the naive extension of braiding based gates fails to support even the
full Clifford group. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate projective
measurements that enable transitions between different qubit encodings, thus
restoring computational universality. We perform many-body simulations of
braiding dynamics augmented with measurement-based switching, explicitly
preparing the Bell state and GHZ state for systems of two and five qubits,
respectively. Furthermore, we execute a random unitary circuit on five qubits,
achieving a fidelity exceeding 99%. We analyze the circuit's robustness by
studying its fidelity dependence on total braid duration and static potential
disorder. Our results show that the fidelity remains above 99% for moderate
disorder, underscoring the intrinsic fault tolerance of the architecture.
Finally, we demonstrate a random circuit on a ten qubit system to showcase the
scalability of our techniques.

Motivation: Understanding how to control the adiabatic evolution in open quantum systems is crucial for manipulating topo states and preserving quantum topology. This paper proposes a method to overcome previous limitations by using counterdiabatic driving, which could have broad applications in quantum computing and materials science.

Method: The paper combines theoretical analysis of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and their topology with experiments in a superconducting transmon qubit. They implemented counterdiabatic driving to suppress loss-induced decoherence and studied system trajectories using this method.

Result: Experiments showed successful adiabatic transport for systems with relative loss, preservation of complex energy spectrum topology, and shorter evolution times compared to previous methods. This indicates the robustness of their approach.

Conclusion: By applying counterdiabatic driving, the researchers demonstrated a way to achieve efficient and stable adiabatic transport in open quantum systems, enabling the exploration and protection of topological features despite dissipation.

Abstract: Open quantum systems described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibit rich
dynamics due to the topology of their complex energy spectrum. By encircling an
exceptional point degeneracy, this topology allows for topological state
transport, chiral geometric phases, and eigenvalue braiding. To access these
topological features, it is desirable to drive the system adiabatically.
However, adiabatic transport in a system with complex spectrum is
conventionally only possible for the eigenstate whose eigenenergy has the
lowest loss. Previous experiments have demonstrated such adiabatic evolution
for the quantum state with relative gain, yet observed a breakdown in
adiabaticity for quantum states with relative loss. In this work, we harness a
shortcut to adiabaticity -- counterdiabatic driving -- to avoid the effects of
loss while maintaining trajectories that follow the instantaneous eigenstates
in significantly shorter timescales. We experimentally investigate the
robustness of this control method using a superconducting transmon circuit with
engineered dissipation. We observe that counterdiabatic driving stabilizes
quasistatic transport and preserves the complex energy spectrum's topology.

Abstract: An anti-bunched photon field is produced from a thin-film ppln waveguide by
mixing the on-chip two-photon state with a weak but matched coherent state.
This is achieved by taking out the two-photon part of the coherent state via a
destructive two-photon interference with the on-chip two-photon state. We
achieve a photon rate of 100 kHz with a g2-value of 0.35. This anti-bunched
light field will have applications in high-resolution quantum imaging such as
long baseline quantum telescopy for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.

Abstract: We consider a nonstationary circuit QED system described by the quantum Rabi
model, in which an artificial two-level atom with a tunable transition
frequency is coupled to a single-mode resonator. We focus on regimes where the
external modulation takes the form $\sin[\eta(t) t]$, with the modulation
frequency $\eta(t)$ varying slowly and linearly in time near $2\nu$ and $4\nu$,
$\nu$ being the resonator frequency. Starting from the vacuum state, we
numerically compute the Quantum Fisher Information for single-mode phase and
displacement estimation, showing that it significantly exceeds the classical
limits for the same average photon number, even in the presence of dissipation.
Thus, appropriate parametric modulation of the qubit not only simulates the
dynamical Casimir effect but also enables the generation of nonclassical states
of light that offer a metrological advantage over classical states of
equivalent energy.

Conclusion: 该方法为DMFT在量子计算环境下的模拟提供了一种更有效率的途径，未来可以进一步优化算法，拓展应用范围。

Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a useful tool to analyze models of
strongly correlated fermions like the Hubbard model. In DMFT, the lattice of
the model is replaced by a single impurity site embedded in an effective bath.
The resulting single impurity Anderson model (SIAM) can then be solved
self-consistently with a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm. This procedure
involves repeatedly preparing the ground state on a quantum computer and
evolving it in time to measure the Greens function. We here develop an
approximation of the time evolution operator for this setting by training a
Hamiltonian variational ansatz. The parameters of the ansatz are obtained via a
variational quantum algorithm that utilizes a small number of time steps, given
by the Suzuki- Trotter expansion of the time evolution operator, to guide the
evolution of the parameters. The resulting circuit has constant depth for the
time evolution and is significantly shallower than a comparable Suzuki-Trotter
expansion.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: State-of-the-art free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution
(CV-QKD) protocols use phase reference pulses to modulate the wavefront of a
real local oscillator at the receiver, thereby compensating for wavefront
distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence. It is normally assumed that the
wavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the
wavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during
transmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a
relative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum
signals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key
transfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine
learning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light
conversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into
the Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase
measurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed
simulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new
algorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may
exist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference
pulses and quantum signals. We quantify the gains available in our algorithm in
terms of the CV-QKD secure key rate. We show channels where positive secure key
rates are obtained using our algorithms, while information loss without
wavefront correction would result in null key rates.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for processing frequency-encoded photons using linear interferometry and time-resolved detection, which is fully passive and compatible with multi-mode light. They successfully demonstrate this method using on-chip generated entangled photons, achieving high state fidelity and successfully performing various quantum measurements and violations of fundamental inequalities, paving the way for scalable quantum communication systems in free-space and satellite applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient, scalable, and robust methods for processing entangled photons without active components is discussed, particularly relevant for quantum communication in constrained environments like mobile or satellite systems. The challenge is to achieve this with low loss and complexity, ensuring compatibility with multi-mode light and facilitating long-distance applications.

Method: The researchers employ frequency-bin entangled photons on-chip, combining linear interferometry with time-resolved detection. Their method avoids active components, making it passive and suitable for multi-mode applications. They use interferometry to process the photons and time-resolved detection to extract information, ensuring compatibility with free-space and satellite-based systems.

Result: The study shows that their passive approach successfully processes entangled photons, demonstrating the ability to perform arbitrary projective measurements. They achieve a state fidelity of up to 91% and validate quantum states by violating the CHSH inequality, with |S| = 2.32 ± 0.05. They also produce non-classical states and outline a quantum key distribution protocol.

Conclusion: The researchers have developed a resource-efficient, scalable, and robust method for handling frequency-bin entangled photons, enabling practical quantum communication over free-space and satellite links with minimal loss and complexity.

Abstract: Frequency-bin entangled photons can be efficiently produced on-chip which
offers a scalable, robust and low-footprint platform for quantum communication,
particularly well-suited for resource-constrained settings such as mobile or
satellite-based systems. However, analyzing such entangled states typically
requires active and lossy components, limiting scalability and multi-mode
compatibility. We demonstrate a novel technique for processing
frequency-encoded photons using linear interferometry and time-resolved
detection. Our approach is fully passive and compatible with spatially
multi-mode light, making it suitable for free-space and satellite to ground
applications. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize frequency-bin entangled photons
generated from a high-brightness multi-resonator source integrated on-chip to
show the ability to perform arbitrary projective measurements over both single-
and multi-mode channels. We report the first measurement of the joint temporal
intensity between frequency-bin entangled photons, which allows us to certify
entanglement by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality,
with a measured value of $|S|=2.32\pm0.05$ over multi-mode fiber. By combining
time-resolved detection with energy-correlation measurements, we perform full
quantum state tomography, yielding a state fidelity of up to $91\%$. We further
assess our ability to produce non-classical states via a violation of
time-energy entropic uncertainty relations and investigate the feasibility of a
quantum key distribution protocol. Our work establishes a resource-efficient
and scalable approach toward the deployment of robust frequency-bin
entanglement over free-space and satellite-based links.

measurement in both quadratures and the resulting secure key gains are
calculated showing a significative increase with dimension.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is rapidly transitioning from cutting-edge
laboratory research to real-world deployment in established communication
networks. Although QKD promises future-proof security, practical challenges
stil exist due to imperfections in physical devices. Many protocols offer
strong security guarantees, but their implementation can be complex and
difficult. To bridge this gap, we present a practical and systematic framework
for implementing QKD, focused on the BB84 protocol but designed with broader
applicability in mind. The article includes key concepts for device
calibration, synchronisation,optical alignment, and key post-processing. We
outline a simple algorithm for key sifting that is easily implementable in
hardware. Our results highlight the importance of selecting the temporal window
to optimise both the key rate and the quantum bit error rate (QBER). In
addition, we show that random sampling of the sifted key bits for error
estimation yields more reliable results than sequential sampling. We also
integrate the Entrapped Pulse Coincidence Detection (EPCD) protocol to boost
key generation rates, further enhancing performance. Although our work focuses
on BB84, the techniques and practices outlined are general enough to support a
wide range of QKD protocols. This makes our framework a valuable tool for both
research and real-world deployment of secure quantum communication systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a superradiant phase transition in the Dicke lattice model with a small number of sites.

Motivation: The paper discusses the superradiant phase transition in a small Dicke lattice, which is ideal for understanding boundary effects in real experiments.

Method: They used Dicke lattice models with open boundary conditions and finite sites, analyzing the resulting phases through simulations or experiments likely.

Result: Finite systems show various superradiant phases with broken symmetry, not seen in infinite lattices.

Conclusion: Boundaries significantly affect the stationary phases in small lattices, useful for experiments to study these effects.

Abstract: The superradiant phase transition in the dissipative Dicke lattice model,
driven by on-site collective atom-photon interactions and inter-site photon
hopping, is a cornerstone of nonequilibrium quantum many-body physics. However,
little is still known about the influence of boundaries in experimental
achievable systems of finite size. Here we investigate the dissipative
superradiant phase transition in the Dicke lattice model with a small number of
sites and reveal a striking sensitivity of this model to the nature of the
boundary conditions. Specifically, we find that under open boundary conditions
a whole zoo of superradiant phases with broken translational symmetry appears,
which is not observed in the corresponding infinite lattice system. Our results
demonstrate the crucial influence of boundary effects on the stationary phases
of dissipative lattice models, which offers intriguing new opportunities for
studying these phenomena in near term experimental realizations of such models
in quantum optics and circuit QED.

Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is an important resource in quantum
information processing. We systematically study the measures of GME based on
the geometric mean of bi-partition entanglements and present a unified
construction of GME measures, which gives rise to the widely used GME measures
including GME concurrence, the convex-roof extended negativity of GME, the
geometric measure of entanglement of GME. Our GME measures satisfy the
desirable conditions such as scalability and smoothness. Moreover, we provide
fidelity-based analytical lower bounds for our GME measures. Our bounds are
tight and can be estimated experiment friendly without requiring quantum state
tomography. Furthermore, we apply our results to study the dynamics of GME. We
identify an initial condition that influences the sudden death of genuine
quadripartite entanglement under individual non-Markovian processes. The GME of
Dirac particles with Hawking radiation in the background of a Schwarzschild

Abstract: We derive a Geometric quantum speed limit (QSL) for imaginary-time evolution,
where the dynamics is governed by a non-unitary Schr\"{o}dinger equation. By
introducing a cost function based on the angular distance between the
normalized evolving state and the initial state, we obtain a lower bound on the
evolution time expressed as the ratio between this angle and the time-averaged
energy dispersion. Our bound is analytical, general, and applicable to
arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonians. We analytically evaluate this bound
for two physically motivated cases. First, we apply it to a two-level system
and derive an expression for the minimal time. Second, we analyze the
imaginary-time version of Grover search problem and rigorously reproduce the
well-known logarithmic scaling $T=\mathcal{ O}(\log N)$ within our QSL
framework.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子引力理论的建立提供了一种高级的实验支持，展示了在低能量级精确测量GUP效应的可行性和重要性。

Abstract: Several theories that attempt to unify quantum theory and gravitational
theory assume that space has an observable limiting resolution related to the
Planck length, denoted by $\sqrt{\beta_0}L_p$. Quantum mechanically, this
concept derives a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and the corresponding
modified commutator. The prediction and observation of GUP-induced new physics,
as well as the quantitative measurement of the value of $\beta_0$, may provide
substantial support for the establishment of quantum gravity theory. In this
paper, we propose a comprehensive quantum framework for measuring GUP at low
energy scales by utilizing the interference-induced bright-dark mode effect of
oscillators in an optomechanical system. The nonlinearity induced by GUP will
be amplified by the bright mode dynamics, and then be quantitatively read out
by the noise spectrum of the dark mode. The measurement limit resolution of the
scheme is not constrained by the quality factor of the oscillator. Under
experimentally achievable parameters, the measurement resolution has been shown
to reach $\beta_{\text{NL,lim}}=10^{-16.75}$, which is $10$ orders of magnitude
lower than the electroweak level.

Abstract: The idea of average of maximum teleportation fidelities was introduced in [1]
to measure the capability of the network to act as a resource for distributed
teleportation between any pair of nodes. Binary tree network, being a subclass
of Cayley tree network, is a significant topological structure used for
information transfer in a hierarchical sense. In this article, we consider four
types of binary tree repeater networks (directed and undirected, asymmetric and
symmetric) and obtain the analytical expressions of the average of the maximum
teleportation fidelities for each of these binary tree networks. Our work
investigates the role of directionality and symmetry in this measure. Like [1],
here also we have used simple Werner state-based models and are able to
identify the parameter ranges for which these networks can show quantum
advantage. We explore the role of maximally entangled states in the network to
enhance the quantum advantage. We explore the large $N$ (nodes) scenario for
each of these networks and find out the limiting value of the average of the
maximum teleportation fidelity for each of these networks. We also include the
scenarios when the Werner state parameters for each link are different and
chosen from a uniform distribution. According to our analysis, the directed
symmetric binary tree is the most beneficial topology in this context. Our
results pave the way to identify the resourceful network in transmitting
quantum information.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for macroscopic quantum states in quantum technologies, which are critical for sensing and bosonic codes.

Method: The method involves coupling a nanomechanical resonator to a qubit using both transverse and longitudinal interactions. Driving the qubit at twice the oscillator frequency enables two-phonon exchange, converting drive energy into phonon pairs which are stabilized and used to create the superposition.

Result: The result is an effective master equation derived from the full Hamiltonian, which includes engineered two-phonon loss and coherent squeezing, leading to a deterministic Schrödinger-cat state. The setup is scalable and doesn't require a cavity or additional components.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their method successfully demonstrates a scalable route to generating macroscopic quantum superpositions, which can advance quantum technologies and error correction coding.

Abstract: Macroscopic quantum superpositions, such as mechanical Schr\"odinger cat
states, are central to emerging quantum technologies in sensing and bosonic
error-correcting codes. We propose a scheme to generate such states by coupling
a nanomechanical resonator to a coherently driven two-level system via both
transverse and longitudinal interactions. Driving the qubit at twice the
oscillator frequency activates resonant two-phonon exchange processes, enabling
coherent conversion of drive energy into phonon pairs and their dissipative
stabilization. Starting from the full time-dependent Hamiltonian, we derive an
effective master equation for the mechanical mode by perturbative elimination
of the lossy qubit. The reduced dynamics feature engineered two-phonon loss and
a coherent squeezing term, which together drive the resonator into a
deterministic Schr\"odinger-cat state. Our approach requires only a single
driven qubit and no auxiliary cavity, offering a scalable and experimentally
accessible route to macroscopic quantum superpositions in circuit-QED and
related platforms.

Motivation: Understanding the limitations of QML models is critical as quantum computing advances. Efficient approximation methods and hardware optimization are key areas of research, especially in practical applications.

Method: The study empirically assesses QML models across various quantum computing platforms, using techniques like frequency selection and dimensional separation to constrain parameter growth.

Result: Experiments show improved model performance with limited parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: QML's potential for real-world applications remains, supported by optimized techniques reducing computational demands and enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC),
research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence.
Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated
Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation
capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum
circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for
improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input
dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In
practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through
two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the
relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable
parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from
double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and
dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters,
thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential
frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with
known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current
hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two
white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional
interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The
reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum
simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

Abstract: Recent advances in nanoscale and microscale photon-pair sources have enabled
quantum-light-matter interactions in regimes where standard approximations,
such as the paraxial limit, break down. Identifying quantum advantages in these
domains requires a unified, first-principles framework that treats arbitrary
quantum states of light and realistic material systems without restrictive
assumptions. Here, we present a fully relativistic, beyond-paraxial theory of
multiphoton ionization driven by quantum light, incorporating the full spatial
structure and correlations of the field alongside material properties. As a
case study, we apply the formalism to resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization
(REMPI) of neutral sodium atoms by momentum-entangled photons. We predict
cross-section enhancements of several orders of magnitude compared to coherent
light, arising entirely from non-paraxial effects and vanishing in the paraxial
limit. The enhancement is strongly channel-dependent, with odd multipole
transitions benefiting most from favorable parity and interference conditions.
The predicted enhancement is accessible with current state-of-the-art photonic
and atomic technologies, highlighting a promising avenue for exploiting quantum
light in high-precision ionization and spectroscopy experiments.

Result: 实验结果显示出与质量相关的衰减模式，这表明如果真实硬件表现出相似的模式，可能反映重力诱导的collapsing过程。否则，接近常数噪声的行为可能暗示重力影响不明显.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了测试量子力学基本问题的协议和参考框架。

Abstract: We present a quantum computing simulation study of mass-dependent decoherence
models inspired by Penrose's gravity-induced collapse hypothesis. According to
objective reduction (OR) theory, quantum superpositions become unstable when
the gravitational self-energy difference between branches exceeds a certain
threshold, leading to a collapse time $\tau \approx \hbar / E_G$. In this work,
we implement a mass-dependent dephasing noise channel, $p(m) = 1 - e^{-k
m^{\alpha}}$, within the Qiskit AerSimulator, where $m$ is a proxy for the
effective mass of a superposition, mapped to circuit parameters such as the
number of entangled qubits or branch size. We apply this model to three
canonical quantum computing experiments: GHZ state parity measurements,
branch-mass entanglement tests, and Grover's search to generate distinctive
collapse signatures that differ qualitatively from constant-rate dephasing. The
resulting patterns serve as a baseline reference: if future hardware
experiments exhibit the same scaling trends under ideal isolation, this could
indicate a contribution from mass-dependent collapse processes. Conversely,
deviation toward constant-noise behaviour would suggest the absence of such
gravitationally induced effects. Our results provide a reproducible protocol
and reference for using quantum computers as potential testbeds for probing
fundamental questions in quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了量子信息论在量子计算中的有效应用，为VQE算法的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a quantum information-inspired ansatz for the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) and demonstrate its efficacy in calculating ground-state
energies of atomic systems. Instead of adopting a heuristic approach, we start
with an approximate multi-qubit target state and utilize two quantum
information-theoretic quantities, i.e., von Neumann entropy and quantum mutual
information, to construct our ansatz. The quantum information encoded in the
target state helps us to design unique blocks and identify qubit pairs that
share maximum quantum correlations among them in the multi-qubit system,
thereby enabling us to deterministically place two-qubit entanglers in the
suitably constructed parametrized quantum circuit. We find that our approach
has the advantage of reduced circuit depth compared to the unitary
coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz (the gold standard for VQE), and yet yields
accurate results. To test the performance of our ansatz, we apply it to compute
ground-state energies of atomic systems. We find that for up to 12 qubits (or
12 spin orbitals) noiseless calculation, the proposed ansatz yields energies
with 99.99% accuracy relative to the complete active space configuration
interaction values, while utilizing only two blocks, which contain at most 99%
fewer 2-qubit gates than the UCC ansatz.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can distribute keys with guaranteed security
but remains susceptible to key exchange interruption due to physical-layer
threats, such as high-power jamming attacks. To address this challenge, we
first introduce a novel metric, namely Maximum Number of Affected Requests
(maxNAR), to quantify the worst-case impact of a single physical-layer attack,
and then we investigate a new problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment with
Minimal Attack Radius (RWA-MAR). We formulate the problem using an Integer
Linear Programming (ILP) model and propose a scalable heuristic to efficiently
minimize maxNAR. Our approach incorporates key caching through Quantum Key
Pools (QKPs) to enhance resilience and optimize resource utilization. Moreover,
we model the impact of different QKD network architectures, employing Optical
Bypass (OB) for optical switching of quantum channels and Trusted Relay (TR)
for secure key forwarding. Moreover, a tunable parameter is designed in the
heuristic to guide the preference for OB or TR, offering enhanced adaptability
and dynamic control in diverse network scenarios. Simulation results confirm
that our method significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of security and
scalability.

Abstract: In classical mechanics and electromagnetism, interference occurs when two or
more waves overlap at the same point in spacetime. However, the advent of
quantum electrodynamics (QED) and its remarkable success in describing
light-matter interactions at the microscopic level invites us to reconsider
whether interference-like effects could arise even when the waves do not
physically overlap. In this work, we extend the notion of wave interference to
a novel and unconventional regime. Building upon the fundamental description of
interference in terms of the interaction with the observer [Phys. Rev. Lett.
134, 133603 (2025)], we demonstrate that interference-like phenomena can emerge
when two independent fields interact with a single detector at different
locations in Minkowski space. We begin by developing a theoretical model in
which a spatially extended atom simultaneously couples to two distant fields.
We then propose an experimentally feasible implementation using superconducting
circuits, where a giant artificial atom interacts with two independent
resonators. Our findings open new directions for exploring interference in
quantum systems and suggest new possibilities for optical quantum technologies,
including the realization of atom-transparent devices controlled by spatially
separated laser fields.

Abstract: The low-energy isomeric transition in Thorium-229 offers a unique interface
between nuclear and atomic physics, presenting a resource for quantum
technologies that is notably resilient to environmental decoherence. While
early experiments focused on nuclei in solid-state crystals, the recent advent
of a continuous-wave vacuum ultraviolet laser at 148.4~nm now enables direct
coherent control of individual trapped Th-229 ions. Building on this
breakthrough, we present a theoretical framework for utilizing trapped
Th-229^{3+} ions as high-fidelity nuclear-level qubits, wherein quantum state
preparation, single-qubit control, and entangling operations based on nuclear
energy levels can all be efficiently realized. We analyze a scheme to generate
entanglement between the nuclear isomeric states of two ions through
phonon-mediated coupling, driven by optimized red- and blue-detuned laser
sideband pulses. Our analysis, grounded in realistic experimental parameters,
also demonstrates that high-fidelity entanglement is achievable, leveraging the
nucleus's intrinsically long coherence times. These results provide a practical
roadmap for developing nuclear-based quantum information processors and suggest
that entangled nuclear-level qubits could potentially unlock new frontiers in
precision metrology.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new cluster Monte Carlo algorithm that uses two-point correlations to solve the Max-Cut problem, showing improved efficiency over traditional methods and quantum algorithms when applied with deeper circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of finding ground states in Ising spin glasses, which is computationally difficult due to disorder and frustration. Traditional Monte Carlo methods like simulated annealing can get stuck in local minima. The motivation is to develop a more efficient algorithm, inspired by cluster algorithms used in ferromagnetic systems, to escape local minima and improve solution quality, particularly for Max-Cut problems using Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA).

Method: The method involves creating cluster-based updates using precomputed two-point correlations from the system's ground state. This approach allows for the simultaneous flipping of large clusters of spins, potentially leading to more significant changes in the energy landscape and thus a higher probability of making beneficial moves. The algorithm is tested on Max-Cut problems, utilizing QAOA to generate correlations, and its performance is evaluated against traditional Monte Carlo methods.

Result: The result shows that the new algorithm, especially when using QAOA correlations with deeper circuits, achieves higher acceptance rates for beneficial moves, leading to faster convergence and better solution quality compared to conventional Monte Carlo approaches.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed cluster Monte Carlo algorithm, by leveraging precomputed two-point correlations, effectively overcomes the limitations of local minima trapping in simulated annealing and other Monte Carlo methods. It particularly demonstrates superior performance when integrated with QAOA, resolving the Max-Cut problem more efficiently by forming clusters of spins that yield large energy transitions, increasing the acceptance probability of beneficial moves at low temperatures.

Abstract: Finding the ground state of Ising spin glasses is notoriously difficult due
to disorder and frustration. Often, this challenge is framed as a combinatorial
optimization problem, for which a common strategy employs simulated annealing,
a Monte Carlo (MC)-based algorithm that updates spins one at a time. Yet, these
localized updates can cause the system to become trapped in local minima.
Cluster algorithms (CAs) were developed to address this limitation and have
demonstrated considerable success in studying ferromagnetic systems; however,
they tend to encounter percolation issues when applied to generic spin glasses.
  In this work, we introduce a novel CA designed to tackle these challenges by
leveraging precomputed two-point correlations, aiming solve combinatorial
optimization problems in the form of Max-Cut more efficiently. In our approach,
clusters are formed probabilistically based on these correlations. Various
classical and quantum algorithms can be employed to generate correlations that
embody information about the energy landscape of the problem. By utilizing this
information, the algorithm aims to identify groups of spins whose simultaneous
flipping induces large transitions in configuration space with high acceptance
probability -- even at low energy levels -- thereby escaping local minima more
effectively.
  Notably, clusters generated using correlations from the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm exhibit high acceptance rates at low temperatures. These
acceptance rates often increase with circuit depth, accelerating the algorithm
and enabling more efficient exploration of the solution space.

Abstract: We explore the potential application of quantum annealing to address the
protein structure problem. To this end, we compare several proposed ab initio
protein folding models for quantum computers and analyze their scaling and
performance for classical and quantum heuristics. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel encoding of coordinate based models on the tetrahedral lattice, based on
interleaved grids. Our findings reveal significant variations in model
performance, with one model yielding unphysical configurations within the
feasible solution space. Furthermore, we conclude that current quantum
annealing hardware is not yet suited for tackling problems beyond a
proof-of-concept size, primarily due to challenges in the embedding.
Nonetheless, we observe a scaling advantage over our in-house simulated
annealing implementation, which, however, is only noticeable when comparing
performance on the embedded problems.

Abstract: We propose the construction of equations of motion based on symmetries in
quantum-mechanical systems, using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as a
minimal foundation. From canonical operators, two spaces of conjugate operators
are constructed, along with a third space derived from the former, which
includes the ``Symmetry-Dilation'' operator. When this operator commutes with
the main equation of motion, it defines the set of observables compatible with
a complete basis of operators (symmetry generators), organized into a Lie
algebra dependent on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle within Minkowski
spacetime. Furthermore, by requiring the dilation operator to commute with the
central operator, the wavefunction is constrained, thereby constructing known
structures. Specific cases are derived -- relativistic, non-relativistic, and a
lesser-studied case: ``ultra-relativistic (Carroll-Schr\"odinger)''. Our work
may open new avenues for understanding and classifying symmetries in quantum
mechanics, as well as offer an alternative method for deriving equations of
motion and applying them to complex scenarios involving exotic particles.

Motivation: This research establishes the computational complexity of determining whether a C-Q channel can preserve a single classical bit, which is essential for understanding quantum communication and information processing.

Method: They used matrix analysis to characterize optimal witnesses and transformed the problem into a biquadratic optimization task with orthogonality constraints.

Result: The study shows both the bit preservation problem and orthogonality optimization are QCMA-complete.

Conclusion: Understanding QCMA-completeness aids in designing efficient quantum channels for classical bit preservation.

Abstract: We prove that deciding whether a classical-quantum (C-Q) channel can exactly
preserve a single classical bit is QCMA-complete. This "bit-preservation"
problem is a special case of orthogonality-constrained optimization tasks over
C-Q channels, in which one seeks orthogonal input states whose outputs have
small or large Hilbert-Schmidt overlap after passing through the channel. Both
problems can be cast as biquadratic optimization with orthogonality
constraints. Our main technical contribution uses tools from matrix analysis to
give a complete characterization of the optimal witnesses: computational basis
states for the minimum, and |+>, |-> over a single basis pair for the maximum.
Using this characterization, we give concise proofs of QCMA-completeness for
both problems.

Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research
tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a
transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the
intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of
large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and
data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already
support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the
discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy
an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same
time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal
structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability.
Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial
for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive,
graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining
conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive
sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL
effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods
responsibly to problems across quantum physics, chemistry, and engineering.

Conclusion: 测量兼容性和不兼容性是产生非局域性的关键资源，尤其在非标准网络中需要更多资源来检测非局域性。

Abstract: It is a well-known fact that measurement incompatibility is a necessary
resource to generate nonlocal correlations in usual Bell scenario that
typically involves single quantum source. We can provide with some contrasting
findings if we consider connected structure of multiple quantum sources.
Precisely, we demonstrate that non n-locality can be detected in standard
quantum network even when only a single party performs incompatible
measurements. More interestingly, for any finite n greater than 2, non n-local
correlations can be generated in any standard linear n-local network when all
the parties perform compatible measurements. Such an observation is topology
specific as one of the parties must perform incompatible measurement to exhibit
non n-locality in any non-linear network endowed with star topology. However,
we observe that in any non-standard network(all sources independent and
nonlocal), to generate genuine non n-local correlations, all the parties must
perform incompatible measurements. Such a finding is intuitive as more resource
is required to generate stronger form of quantum non-classicality. We also
demonstrate that merely providing resource of measurement incompatibility to
all the parties is not sufficient for non n-locality detection in any quantum
network

TL;DR: Abstract discusses a quantum Otto heat engine using a finite-size Dicke-Stark model. They analyze how various parameters like Stark field strength, coupling strength, adiabatic/isochoric times, and atom count affect the engine's efficiency, work, and power. Results show max output near superradiant phase transition and asymmetric strokes optimize performance. More atoms help increase efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to optimize Quantum Heat Engine performance by tuning its parameters through the Dicke-Stark model, which could contribute to better quantum thermodynamic devices and engines.

Method: Numerical calculations of energy spectra and eigenstates under different conditions for the Dicke-Stark model, combined with thermodynamic analysis under infinite and finite time frameworks.

Result: The efficiency and output work reach maximum near the superradiant phase transition point. Asymmetric strokes lead to higher performance, and increasing the number of atoms enhances the engine's efficiency.

Conclusion: The research provides guidelines for designing high-performance quantum heat engines by varying key parameters in the Dicke-Stark model.

Abstract: We propose a quantum Otto heat engine that employs a finite-size Dicke-Stark
model as the working substance. In the extended coherent state space, the
complete energy spectrum and eigenstates of this model are obtained through
numerical calculations. Within the infinite-time and finite-time thermodynamics
frameworks, we investigate the effects of the Stark field strength, coupling
strength, adiabatic stroke time, isochoric stroke time, and number of atoms in
the DS model on the heat engine's output work, efficiency, and power. The
results show that the maximum values of the output work and efficiency appear
near the coupling strength corresponding to the superradiant phase transition
point. Regulating the Stark field strength can tune the energy level structure
of the system and the superradiant phase transition, effectively reducing
entropy generation and quantum friction during nonequilibrium evolution of the
system's states and thereby significantly increasing the engine's output work,
efficiency, and power. Asymmetric heat engines, where the two isochoric strokes
have different Stark field strengths and stroke times, are more conducive to
optimizing the heat engine's performance. Additionally, in the DS model, an
increase in the number of atoms is also beneficial for increasing the heat
engine's output work and efficiency. The results of this paper facilitate the
design of high-performance quantum heat engines.

*Varun Menon,J. Pablo Bonilla-Ataides,Rohan Mehta,Daniel Bochen Tan,Mikhail D. Lukin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces tricycle quantum LDPC codes for magic state distillation, achieving efficient, fault-tolerant protocols with a high noise threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magic state distillation is a critical component for scalable quantum computing, especially in fault-tolerant setups. This paper aims to improve the efficiency and fault tolerance of such protocols by introducing new quantum codes with higher homological dimensions and longer depth, which could allow for more robust error correction and simpler, faster distillation processes.

Method: The authors propose tricycle codes, which are a generalization of bicycle codes to three homological dimensions. They use these codes to implement logical CCZ gates between three code blocks, enabling single-shot state preparation and error correction without post-selection. They numerically simulate specific codes using BPOSD, demonstrating a high circuit-noise threshold. They also design optimal depth syndrome extraction circuits for tricycle codes and implement them on a reconfigurable neutral atom platform.

Result: The proposed tricycle codes achieve robust magic state distillation with a high circuit-noise threshold (>0.4%), avoiding the multiple rounds of distillation typically required. The fault-tolerant protocols reduce overhead and simplify the distillation process. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the decoder and the syndrome extraction circuits, showing improved performance under circuit-level noise.

Conclusion: The tricycle codes represent a significant advancement in quantum error correction, particularly for magic state distillation. This approach enhances scalability and fault tolerance, paving the way for more efficient implementation of universal quantum computation. The designed decoder and syndrome extraction circuits on a reconfigurable platform demonstrate the practicality of the method, making it a promising solution for real-world quantum computing applications.

Abstract: The preparation of high-fidelity non-Clifford (magic) states is an essential
subroutine for universal quantum computation, but imposes substantial
space-time overhead. Magic state factories based on high rate and distance
quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codes equipped with transversal
non-Clifford gates can potentially reduce these overheads significantly, by
circumventing the need for multiple rounds of distillation and producing a
large number of magic states in a single code-block. As a step towards
realizing efficient, fault-tolerant magic state distillation, we introduce a
class of finite block-length quantum LDPC codes which we name tricycle codes,
generalizing the well-known bicycle codes to three homological dimensions.
These codes can support constant-depth physical circuits that implement logical
CCZ gates between three code blocks. We show that these tricycle codes enable
magic state generation with single-shot state-preparation and error correction,
leading to a deterministic low-overhead distillation protocol without requiring

### [57] [Decoded Quantum Interferometry Under Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10725)
*Kaifeng Bu,Weichen Gu,Dax Enshan Koh,Xiang Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents DQI, a quantum optimization algorithm, initially found promising but with no noise. They find noise reduces performance exponentially based on sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original success of DQI hinges on noise, so understanding noise impact is crucial for practical applications.

Method: Mathematical analysis under local depolarizing noise, numerical simulations for specific problems.

Result: Performance decays exponentially with decreasing sparsity under noise.

Conclusion: DQI needs noise protection, but can be adapted in noisy settings.

Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum
optimization algorithm that exploits sparsity in the Fourier spectrum of
objective functions, with the potential for exponential speedups over classical
algorithms on suitably structured problems. While highly promising in idealized
settings, its resilience to noise has until now been largely unexplored. To
address this, we conduct a rigorous analysis of DQI under noise, focusing on
local depolarizing noise. For the maximum linear satisfiability problem, we
prove that, in the presence of noise, performance is governed by a
noise-weighted sparsity parameter of the instance matrix, with solution quality
decaying exponentially as sparsity decreases. We demonstrate this decay through
numerical simulations on two special cases: the Optimal Polynomial Intersection
problem and the Maximum XOR Satisfiability problem. The Fourier-analytic
methods we develop can be readily adapted to other classes of random Pauli
noise, making our framework applicable to a broad range of noisy quantum
settings and offering guidance on preserving DQI's potential quantum advantage
under realistic noise.

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered
interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target
operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into
multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively
amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding
robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate
can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in
several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class
logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a
controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto
a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer
measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples,
we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert
space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers.
This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and
control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements
of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

TL;DR: Abstract discusses a new method for generating entangled polaritons using optomechanical interactions, avoiding high losses and relying on strong exciton-phonon coupling for scalability and room-temperature operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about quantum optics and photonic entanglement, which is a hot topic in quantum information science. Efficient methods for generating entangled particles are crucial for quantum computing and communication.

Method: Double-resonant optomechanical scheme using strong exciton-phonon coupling in semiconductors, leveraging quantum coherence of polaritons for single-mode emission and unconditional state preparation.

Result:  room-temperature generation of photon pairs, scalable quantum polaritonics without conventional nonlinearities.

Conclusion: This approach opens a new avenue for room-temperature quantum optics without relying on high nonlinearity in materials, which is a significant advancement. High-quality single-photon sources are essential for quantum technologies, and this method could lead to breakthroughs in these applications.

Abstract: Entanglement generation in polariton systems is fundamentally constrained by
high losses and decoherence, which typically outweigh polariton nonlinearities.
Here, we propose a conceptually different approach that uses optomechanical
interactions, rather than polariton-polariton interactions, to generate
entangled polaritons. Our double-resonant scheme relies on strong
exciton-phonon coupling, found in both inorganic and molecular semiconductors,
enabling room-temperature generation of spectrally disparate photon pairs. The
quantum coherent and delocalized nature of polariton states inside an optical
cavity ensures efficient single-mode outcoupling and allows for unconditional
quantum state preparation--not relying on any post-selection or projective
measurements. When conditioned on exciton-polariton emission, single
phonon-polariton states can be prepared that subsequently yield bright,
heralded single-photon emission in the mid-IR. We introduce a double-resonant
optomechanical platform that enables scalable, room-temperature quantum
polaritonics without relying on conventional excitonic nonlinearities.

Motivation: The motivation is to create scalable and versatile quantum information processing systems using multilevel systems, as such systems can be integrated with existing laboratory techniques.

Method: The method involves using dipole-dipole interactions to mediate entangled gates between qudits located in optical traps. The qudits' additional levels (d=3 and d=5) are utilized to simplify gate decomposition. They test the approach with specific molecules (SrF and 87Rb133Cs).

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a promising route for scalable quantum information processing with multilevel systems, suggesting potential for practical applications with current lab facilities.

Abstract: We propose a model of a scalable qudit-based quantum processor that uses
rotational degrees of freedom of polar molecules. Entangling gates between
qudits are implemented via moving molecule in optical traps by exploiting
dipole-dipole interactions to mediate coherent coupling. We develop encoding
schemes that map single qubits (d=2) into qudits of dimensions 2 <= d <= 5, and
pairs of qubits into higher-dimensional qudits with d=4, 5. This approach
enables the realization of a universal set of quantum gates. In particular, we
exploit additional levels that are present in the d=3 and d=5 qudits, which
allows one to simplify the decomposition of multiqubit gates. We then analyze
the relevant experimental parameters to realize our schemes with SrF and
87Rb133Cs molecules. The proposed approach offers a promising route towards
scalable and versatile quantum information processing with multilevel systems,
which can be potentially realized using currently available experimental

Abstract: Ground State Energy Estimation (GSEE) is a central problem in quantum
chemistry and condensed matter physics, demanding efficient algorithms to solve
complex electronic structure calculations. This work introduces a structured
benchmarking framework for evaluating the performance of both classical and
quantum solvers on diverse GSEE problem instances. We assess three prominent
methods -- Semistochastic Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI), Density
Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), and Double-Factorized Quantum Phase
Estimation (DF QPE) -- ighlighting their respective strengths and limitations.
Our results show that fully optimized SHCI achieves near-universal solvability
on the benchmark set, DMRG excels for low-entanglement systems, and DF QPE is
currently constrained by hardware and algorithmic limitations. However, we
observe that many benchmark Hamiltonians are drawn from datasets tailored to
SHCI and related approaches, introducing a bias that favors classical solvers.
To mitigate this, we propose expanding the benchmark suite to include more
challenging, strongly correlated systems to enable a more balanced and
forward-looking evaluation of solver capabilities. As quantum hardware and
algorithms improve, this benchmarking framework will serve as a vital tool for
tracking progress and identifying domains where quantum methods may surpass
classical techniques. The QB-GSEE benchmark repository is openly available at
https://github.com/isi-usc-edu/qb-gsee-benchmark [1]. By maintaining a scalable
and open resource, we aim to accelerate innovation in computational quantum

Abstract: In 1986 Ya.V. Tatarinov presented the foundations of the theory of weakly
nonholonomic systems. Mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints
depending on a small parameter are considered. It is assumed that for zero
value of this parameter the constraints of such a system become integrable;
i.e., in this case, we have a family of holonomic systems depending on several
arbitrary integration constants. We will assume that these holonomic systems
are completely integrable Hamiltonian systems. When the small parameter is not
zero, the behavior of such systems can be considered with the help of
normalization methods.
  The behavior of such a system can be represented as a combination of the
motion of a slightly modified holonomic system with slowly varying previous
integration constants (the transgression effect). In this paper we describe the
corresponding effects in a several nonholonomic systems with a small degrees of
freedom.

Abstract: We numerically investigate the formation of axially modulated plasma strings
through the filamentation of two interfering femtosecond Bessel beams. The
constituent Bessel beams have different central spot sizes and propagate
collinearly. Our results show that filamentation of these beams in air leads to
the formation of intense axially modulated light filaments, and corrugated
plasma strings with high modulation depths and tunable modulation periods. We
find that the modulation periods of the intensity and the plasma density are
identical and comparable to the modulation period of the intensity in the
linear propagation regime. Furthermore, we show that, in the nonlinear
propagation regime, the modulation period is independent of the pulse energy
and can be tuned by selecting appropriate central spot sizes for the
interfering Bessel beams. Finally, we propose a simple interferometric
arrangement using a single axicon to generate two interfering Bessel beams with
adjustable spot sizes enabling the creation of axially-modulated plasma strings
with tunable periodicity at high input powers.

Abstract: Optical whispering gallery mode microcavity acoustic sensors have emerged
significant potential in high-sensitivity acoustic signal detection, but the
narrow dynamic range limits the application prospect. To address the challenge,
we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-sensitivity acoustic sensor in
optical whispering gallery mode microcavity. The proposed sensor integrates an
extended Mach-Zehnder polarization interferometer with postselection, extending
the dynamic range to the free spectral range. The sensing regions can be
categorized into phase-drastic and phase-enhanced regions, both of which yield
an optimal acoustic response that surpasses traditional transmission method.
Experiment results demonstrate improvements of 57.87 dB in detection
sensitivity and 26 times in minimal detectable acoustic pressure over the
transmission method. Moreover, the application of coherent state and heterodyne
detection can enhance response amplitude, further improving the detection
sensitivity. Given the wide application range for acoustic dispersion and
dissipation response, as well as the performance advantages of high sensitivity
and wide dynamic range, the proposed WGM sensor offers a promising solution for
acoustic sensing. Potentially, the structural design may be adaptable to other
application scenarios involving time-varying signals through optical
microcavity sensing.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel stable multipulse soliton attractor in fiber lasers, showing how introducing a PMF enhances stability and robustness against disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical solitons are crucial for stable signal transmission in fiber optics, so understanding their stability in fiber lasers is important for applications like telecommunications and precision metrology.

Method: Used a combination of experiments and numerical simulations to investigate robustness and dynamical behavior under disturbances from 'rogue' solitons.

Result: Multipulse soliton attractors are structurally stable and highly resistant to external disturbances.

Conclusion: This research opens possibilities for leveraging multipulse solitons in high-precision fiber lasers and advanced multipulse systems.

Abstract: The stability of optical solitons is a crucial factor in various
applications. This work reveals a novel stable multipulse soliton attractor in
fiber lasers. The attractor represents a bound state of multiple solitons,
pulling other dynamical states toward itself. By introducing a
polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF), the enhanced birefringence in the cavity
induces the differential group delay (DGD) between the polarization components
of the pulse, leading to soliton splitting and, ultimately, the formation of
multi-soliton states. These multi-solitons, affected by intracavity nonlinear
and dissipative effects, form attractors consisting of one to seven soliton
pulses. Through a combination of experiments and numerical simulations, we
systematically investigate the robustness and dynamical behavior of the
multipulse soliton attractors. In this context, we analyze disturbances
introduced by "rogue" solitons with different frequencies and conduct a
comprehensive study of their interaction with the multipulse soliton
attractors. The results show that the multipulse soliton attractors are
structurally stable and highly resistant to external disturbances, highlighting
their potential for high-precision fiber lasers and advanced multipulse
systems.

The framework integrates various models and simulations to address lunar exploration challenges.

Motivation: The paper addresses the need for continuous and high-density energy sources for lunar exploration and habitation, which is critical due to the challenges posed by the Moon's extreme environment, such as prolonged darkness and shadowed regions.

Method: The method involves creating a comprehensive analytical framework that integrates physics-based models, orbital mechanics, link availability, beam propagation, and photonic-to-electrical conversion. It focuses particularly on phased-array systems and their impact on power delivery.

Result: The study concludes that phased-array transmitter systems can significantly enhance power density and efficiency, and through various strategies like orbital configurations and real-time adjustments, lunar surface operations can be sustainably powered.

Conclusion: The research provides a clear pathway towards scalable and efficient laser power beaming infrastructures that can overcome lunar-specific challenges, enabling both robotic and crewed surface operations.

Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical framework for quantitatively
evaluating space-based laser power beaming from lunar-orbiting spacecraft to
surface receivers, addressing the critical need for continuous, high-density
energy to sustain lunar exploration and habitation. The framework integrates
physics-based models of spacecraft photovoltaic generation, precise orbital
geometries, time-dependent link availability and slant-range variations,
coherent beam propagation (including transmitter aperture diameter, beam
quality factor, path losses, and pointing jitter), and photonic-to-electrical
conversion at the lunar surface. Particular emphasis is placed on phased-array
transmitter systems, whose large effective apertures significantly reduce beam
divergence relative to single-aperture designs, resulting in
orders-of-magnitude increases in delivered surface power under equivalent
orbital and power conditions. Parametric sensitivity analyses and illustrative
numerical simulations demonstrate how phased-array architectures improve power
density and end-to-end efficiency at operational lunar distances. The study
also examines advanced orbital configurations (e.g., Near-Rectilinear Halo
Orbits, Earth-Moon Lagrange points), real-time adaptive beam steering and
wavefront control, optimized receiver geometries, and thermal/dust mitigation
strategies. The results establish a clear pathway toward scalable, efficient
laser power beaming infrastructures capable of overcoming lunar-specific
challenges - including prolonged darkness and permanently shadowed regions -
and enabling sustained robotic and crewed surface operations.

Abstract: Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and
nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal
processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave
setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the
conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it
difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety
of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method
which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous
parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the
simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply
it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency
demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed
analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable
construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections
between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The
resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including
microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to
extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired
properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.

Abstract: We construct a novel holographic duality by taking a Carrollian limit of the
AdS/CFT correspondence, relating string theory in a Carroll bulk geometry to a
Carroll $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. We further propose the
existence of an underlying triality connecting Carroll string theory,
relativistic string theory in flat spacetime, and Carroll gauge theory.
Finally, we analyse the symmetries of the Carroll gauge theory, showing that
they are non-linearly realised and do not close under ordinary Lie brackets.

### [72] [$c_\text{eff}$ from Surgery and Modularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10087)
*Shimal Harichurn,Mrunmay Jagadale,Dmitry Noshchenko,Davide Passaro*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 这篇论文讨论了$oxed{Z}$不变量在不同 plumbed 3流形上的扩展，发现现有的两种拟模和 mock 模形式方法不一致，特别是对于某些 Brieskorn 流形，这两种方法给出不同的结果。研究结果表明，$oxed{Z}$不变量对区分不同的3流形结构特别敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者们试图通过 extend $oxed{Z}$ invariant 到更普遍的 plumbed 3流形，为3流形提供一个更全面的不变量工具。

Method: 论文比较了两种不同的 extend 方法，使用有效中心电荷 $c_{	ext{eff}}$ 做为诊断工具，分析了在 Brieskorn 流形上的表现。

Result: 两种 extend 方法在某些 Brieskorn 流形上不一致，违背了预期的不变量关系。

Conclusion: $oxed{Z}$ 在研究 plumbed 3流形上的 extend 情况下，应该更加关注正向的 $oxed{Z}$-理论。

Abstract: $\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed
3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed,
oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their
definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative
definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing
proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery
conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a
construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this
note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres
$\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in
general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$,
which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we
prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is
governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery
formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower
bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing
this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds
which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by
orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the
surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between
$c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections.
These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive
side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.

Conclusion: dS静态区域可能由量子系统操控，Hilbert空间有限，系统演化是混沌的，这-pointer未来研究宇宙结构和量子引力的发展方向。

Abstract: The observable universe has undergone periods of expansion that are well
approximated by de Sitter (dS) space. Still lacking is a quantum mechanical
description of dS, both globally and when restricted to the static patch. We
develop a novel prescription for computing holographic complexity in the dS
static patch to determine its microscopic features. Specifically, we propose
that the natural candidate for dS complexity is the volume of extremal timelike
surfaces restricted to the static patch, anchored to the cosmological horizon
or an observer worldline. Our anchoring prescription provides a clear
definition of a reference state, overcoming a common ambiguity in prior
definitions of de Sitter holographic complexity. The late-time growth of our
complexity functional is linear and proportional to the number of degrees of
freedom associated to the cosmological horizon, and therefore does not exhibit
hyperfast growth. Our results imply the dS static patch is characterized by a
quantum mechanical system, with a finite dimensional Hilbert space whose
evolution is governed by a chaotic Hamiltonian.

### [74] [$c_{\rm eff}$ from Resurgence at the Stokes Line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10112)
*Griffen Adams,Ovidiu Costin,Gerald V. Dunne,Sergei Gukov,Oğuz Öner*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A paper introduces a new method using resurgent cyclic orbits to cross natural boundaries in Chern-Simons theory, specifically for Mordell-Borel integrals. The authors use resurgent analysis on the Stokes line to obtain a transseries decomposition with unary false theta functions. These functions are continued across the boundary to produce dual q-series with integer coefficients that count BPS states. A key contribution is showing that the algebraic structure of the orbits and the leading term of the q-series determine the large-order growth rate of the coefficients, involving an effective central charge from 3d N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper builds on recent work in [1,2] and connects resurgent analysis to quantum field theory, specifically Chern-Simons theory. The primary goal is to understand the behavior of BPS states through q-series.

Method: The authors use resurgent analysis on the Stokes line, decompose into resurgent cyclic orbits, and apply transseries with q-series continuation across the boundary.

Result: Demonstrates that the long-term behavior of the q-series depends on the algebraic structure of the orbits and leading terms, linking it to a central charge in 3d N=2 Chern-Simons theory.

Conclusion: This work bridges resurgent analysis and quantum field theory, providing a deeper understanding of BPS state enumeration and their asymptotic behavior with implications for boundary duals in the 3d-3d correspondence.

Abstract: In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been
proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of
Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic
orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries
decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued
across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued
coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation
of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show
that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined
with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large
order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential
exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an
effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with
$\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the
$3d$-$3d$ correspondence.

Motivation: 研究弦理论中的对偶性有助于理解不同弦理论之间的关系以及基态结构。

Method: 论文使用了圈紧致化和场重定义的方法，详细计算了M理论和IIA弦理论之间的相互作用及其对应的Supergravity coupling。

Result: 通过计算和校正，论文确认了M理论和IIA弦理论在特定维度和紧致化条件下的对偶性，包括在K3紧致化下六维的α'耦合与IIA和Heterotic弦理论的对应关系。

Conclusion: 研究提供了支持M理论与IIA弦理论对偶性的证据，并在K3紧致化下进行了严格的验证，说明该对偶性在更高维度下依然有效。

Abstract: The circle compactification of M-theory is dual to type IIA string theory,
requiring that the dimensional reduction of the M-theory couplings \((t_8 t_8 -
\frac{1}{4} \epsilon_8 \epsilon_8) R^4\) must reproduce the type IIA one-loop
effective action at order \(\alpha'^3\), including contributions from the
metric, dilaton, and RR one-form. Through compactification, we obtain 1,276
couplings involving Riemann, Ricci, and Ricci scalar tensors, along with first
and second derivatives of the dilaton and RR one-form. By employing field
redefinitions, we reduce these to a basis of 359 independent couplings.
Crucially, we observe that the dilaton cannot be entirely removed from the
couplings via field redefinitions, even in the pure metric-dilaton sector. We
validate our results by showing exact agreement between all four-field
couplings and the corresponding string-theory S-matrix elements in the string
frame.
  Further, upon compactifying on K3, we demonstrate that the resulting
six-dimensional \(\alpha'\) couplings at one-loop level transform under
S-duality into the tree-level \(\alpha'\) couplings of heterotic string theory
on \(T^4\). This match necessitates carefully chosen field redefinitions for
both the type IIA (on K3) and heterotic (on \(T^4\)) sectors, providing a
stringent test of the duality.

TL;DR: This paper deals with infrared divergences in Complex-valued Feynman integrals under zero-temperature conditions and shows how external momenta affect loop integrals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study of quantum systems, particularly those with fermionic degrees of freedom, calls for better methods to handle infrared divergences, which are problematic at zero temperature. The presence of external momenta exacerbates these issues.

Method: Analyzes infrared divergences in complex-valued integrals using Complex Bubble Feynman integrals and momentum expansions. Applies the residue theorem to explain discrepancies between integration orders and introduces a new representation to resolve these issues.

Result: Identified mechanisms leading to integration order discrepancies, proposed a new representation to avoid ambiguity, and highlighted classes of integrals not affected by external momenta.

Conclusion: New method addresses infrared divergences effectively, particularly at zero temperature, but more research is needed for classes of integrals with external momenta. Viable approach for future studies.

Abstract: Complex-valued Feynman integrals in the imaginary time formalism and
zero-temperature limit suffer from particular types of infrared divergences
that can not be regulated by integration dimension alone. Related problems
leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in
the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a
noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold
Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical
potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel
complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum
expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to
illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of
integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the
issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and
briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external
momenta.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: paper discusses conservation laws and integrable dynamics of spinning particles in Kerr black holes using the Dirac bracket framework, up to PM^3 order and with probe spin up to quartic order. Conserved quantities include energy, angular momentum, Rüdiger invariant, and Carter constant. New insights into spin-shift symmetry and asymptotic integrability are presented.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: understanding the classical dynamics of Kerr black holes, especially for spinning particles, is crucial for testing GR predictions and developing quantum gravity models.

Method: paper uses the Dirac bracket framework combined with on-shell amplitude methods, calculating conserved quantities up to 3 PM order and probe spin up to quartic order.

Result: calculations confirm the conservation of several quantities and suggest integrable dynamics, offering new perspectives on PM expansion and spin effects.

Conclusion: results are significant for studying black hole scattering and particle motion, providing foundational data for quantum gravity research.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent introduction of the Dirac bracket framework to
compute spinning observables for the scattering of Kerr black holes, we
initiate the study of conserved quantities from an on-shell amplitude
perspective. We establish new results for the conservation of energy, angular
momentum, the R\"udiger invariant and the quadrupolar Carter constant using the
spinning radial action extracted from the literature both in the probe limit
and beyond, up to third post-Minkowskian order in the conservative sector.
Furthermore, we offer a new perspective on the spin-shift symmetry of the
radial action, clarifying its role in the dynamics. Finally, we define a new
on-shell notion of asymptotic integrability in the Liouville sense and present
strong evidence that it is surprisingly satisfied by a spinning probe in Kerr
up to quartic order in the probe spin, to all orders in the post-Minkowskian
expansion. We further establish integrability beyond the probe limit at low PM
orders. Our results suggest important new implications for the dynamics of Kerr
black holes.

Motivation: 研究量子引力中的 wormhole 模型和非微扰效应，尤其是通过碎片化机制来解释 2d CFT 数据的统计特性，有助于理解量子引力与共形场理论之间的关系。

Result: 论文展示了通过碎片化机制能够构造出不同拓扑结构的wormholes，计算了多点非高斯性，如Variance, 2点非高斯性，以及pillow contraction和6j-contraction等，同时验证了这些非高斯性与扩展高斯集的OPE数据的一致性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持了 fragmentation 机制在解释3d Einstein引力中wormhole模型下的非微扰贡献中扮演的关键角色，并为理解量子引力和CFT之间的联系提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in evaluating wormhole
amplitudes in 3d Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant and
matching them to statistics of 2d CFT data. In this work, we compute
non-perturbative Gaussian and non-Gaussian gravitational contributions to the
OPE statistics using a framework that can systematically generate a class of
such non-perturbative effects - \textit{Fragmentation of knots and links by
Wilson lines}. We illustrate this idea by constructing multi-boundary wormholes
from fragmentation diagrams of prime knots and links with upto five crossings.
We discuss fragmentations of hyperbolic knots and links like the figure-eight
knot, the three-twist knot and the Whitehead link; and non-hyperbolic ones like
the Hopf link, the trefoil knot, the Solomon's knot and the Cinquefoil knot.
Using Virasoro TQFT, we show how the partition functions on wormholes
constructed from different fragmentations of the same knot or link are closely
related. Using these fragmentations, we compute gravitational contributions to
the variance, a two-point non-Gaussianity, two structures of four-point
non-Gaussianities called the `pillow contraction' and the `$6j$-contraction',
and some six-point non-Gaussianities. We also check the consistency of some of
these non-Gaussianities with the extended Gaussian ensemble of OPE data that
incorporates the Gaussian corrections to the variance from knots.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Summary: investigated the Reissner-Nordström black hole with string cloud in AdS and quintessence-like fluid. Analyzed photon and particle dynamics, ISCO, and thermodynamic properties. Results show how various parameters influence these aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of black holes and related phenomena is crucial in theoretical physics. This study extends the classic RN black hole model by incorporating quantum effects, string clouds, and other cosmological fluids, aiming to provide a more comprehensive understanding of black hole thermodynamics and particle dynamics.

Method: The research employs analytical and geometric methods. They study null geodesics and test particle motion using effective potentials, derive thermodynamic quantities, and apply these tools to explore the influence of different parameters.

Result: The effective potential method successfully reveals photon trajectories, circular orbits, shadows, and ISCO. Thermodynamic analysis shows significant effects on temperature, entropy, etc., with results depending on string cloud, AdS curvature, quintessence, and electric charge.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed framework for testing quantum gravity and string theory in RN black hole scenarios modified by AdS quintessence. The findings offer insights into black hole thermodynamics and gravitational lensing, contributing to the broader understanding of black hole physics in various theoretical models.

Abstract: Inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), we investigate the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole (BH) solution coupled with a cloud of
strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background, surrounded by a
quintessence-like fluid. We begin by analyzing the optical properties of the BH
through null geodesic motion, deriving an effective potential that governs
photon dynamics. This effective potential is central to understanding key
phenomena such as photon trajectories, circular null orbits, photon sphere, and
the resulting BH shadow. Subsequently, we study the dynamics of neutral test
particles by deriving effective potential that describes their motion. Using
the potential, we compute the specific energy and specific angular momentum of
neutral particles in circular orbits around the BH and analyze the outcomes. We
also investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and demonstrate
how various geometrical and physical properties influence the radius of ISCO.
Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic properties of the BH solution by
deriving key quantities such as the Hawking temperature, entropy, Gibbs free
energy, internal energy, and specific heat capacity. Throughout the study, we
demonstrate that the geodesic structure, scalar field behavior, and
thermodynamic properties are significantly influenced by parameters such as the
string cloud, quantum correction, electric charge, the surrounding
quintessence-like fluid, and the AdS curvature radius.

Motivation: 该论文涉及primordial black holes的研究，旨在探讨它们的质量分布及其自旋对相互作用的影响，提供了有趣的理论结果，解决了当前在PBH形成和演化方面的重大问题。

Method: 利用Zel'dovich近似的线性解和非线性的微扰，结合hoop猜想来描述PBH的形成条件。通过分析，推导出具体的量级和自旋特性。

Result: 当σ_h*远小于1时，β≈A_γσ_h*^5。自旋在σ_h*条件较小时非常小，随着σ_h*增大或功率谱变宽，自旋增大。单色功率谱下，质量分布单色，PBH数量增加约19倍。

Conclusion: 该研究通过理论计算揭示了primordial black holes在σ_h*小值时的数量级并分析了自旋特性，为后续观测和实验研究提供了理论依据。这为理解早期宇宙的演化和可能的引力波信号奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this article, we calculate the mass distribution of primordial black holes
(PBHs) formed in the matter-dominated (MD) era by the peak theory. We apply the
Zel'dovich approximation to track the nonlinear evolution of overdensities and
compute the PBH abundance and mass function by incorporating a PBH formation
criterion based on the hoop conjecture. We find that the PBH abundance $\beta$
follows the scaling law $\beta \simeq A_\gamma \sigma_h^{*5}$ for
$\sigma_h^*\ll 1$. Here, $\sigma_h^*$ is the quantity that characterizes the
variance of the density fluctuation at the horizon entry. We also find that, in
contrast to the previous estimates, the PBH spin is very small for
$\sigma_h^*\ll 1$ but could be larger for larger $\sigma_h^*$ and broader power
spectra. Finally, specializing to a monochromatic power spectrum, we prove
analytically that the PBH mass distribution becomes effectively monochromatic
and reveal that the resultant PBH abundance is approximately 19 times the
previous prediction.

TL;DR: A Poisson process leads to the Telegrapher's equation and related wave equations with a mass term, incorporating probability intrinsic to the stochastic process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a stochastic approach to wave equations, combining probability with physical fields, which could offer new insights into quantum mechanics or gravitational theories.

Method: The framework involves stochastic processes leading to wave equations, using analytic continuation and probability theory.

Result: Derives mass-dependent wave equations, recovers massless limits, embeds probability in wave fields through Planck scaling.

Conclusion: Stochastic processes offer a foundation for wave equations without relying on the Born rule or external probability, possibly explaining quantum phenomena or gravity.

Abstract: We develop a unified stochastic framework in which a velocity- and
helicity-reversing Poisson process gives rise to the Telegrapher's equation.
Analytic continuation to the complex plane results in Dirac-like evolution
equations for electromagnetic and linearized gravitational fields. A small but
nonzero mass parameter is essential to enable helicity reversals. Yet, the
correct massless wave equations are recovered as the physically relevant
massless limit is approached smoothly, with the singular point excluded from
the construction. Remarkably, probability does not enter as an external
postulate as in the Born rule in standard quantum mechanics -- but is intrinsic
to the stochastic process. This probabilistic structure becomes embedded in the
wave fields through a natural rescaling by the Planck length.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This study explores the effects of a non-zero NUT charge on black hole precession, using observations of M87* to constrain parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to connect the theoretical aspects of NUT charge in Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime with recent black hole observations, particularly jet precession, to test the no-hair theorem.

Method: The research uses theoretical modeling of spherical orbits, reflection symmetry analysis, and reflects their precession angular velocities. They model particle motion near the warp radius of an accretion disk to constrain black hole parameters based on observed jet precession.

Result: Black holes with low spin and large NUT charges are excluded. The observed jet precession cannot determine the NUT charge’s sign. The excluded parameter regions are larger for retrograde disks. The data do not clearly distinguish black holes from naked singularities.

Conclusion: The findings suggest the NUT charge cannot be determined based on jet precession alone, and further observations are needed. The results are crucial for understanding NUT spacetime and have implications for the no-hair theorem.

Abstract: Astrophysical evidence has hinted at the existence of a nonzero NUT charge,
which breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of spacetime and induces novel
features in geodesics. In this work, we investigate the Lense-Thirring
precession of the spherical orbits in the Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime, with
particular emphasis on its connection to recent observations of black hole jet
precession. We analyze the reflection symmetry breaking in trajectories of the
spherical orbits and extract their precession angular velocity. It is worth
noting that in the absence of spin, the spherical orbits reduce to tilted
circular orbits without precession, whereas for nonzero spin, the precession
angular velocity increases with the absolute value of the NUT charge. We then
model the motion of particles near the warp radius of a tilted accretion disk
using the spherical orbits and constrain the black hole parameter space based
on the observed jet precession of M87*. The results indicate that regions with
low spin and large NUT charge were excluded, and that the jet precession
measurements cannot distinguish the sign of the NUT charge. The excluded region
is larger for retrograde accretion disks than for prograde ones. We also find
that this observation do not allow a clear distinction between black holes and
naked singularities. Moreover, we also explore how black hole parameters
influence the structure of accretion disk. These results have important
theoretical and astronomical significance for us to deeply understand NUT
space-time.

Conclusion: 广义相对论下奇星质量上限可能低于该理论值，寄生于f(R,T)引力中，可能反驳爱因斯坦引力作为基础的可能性。

Abstract: We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars within the framework of
modified gravity described by $f(\tilde{R},T)=R+\alpha R^{2}+2\beta T$, where
$R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ denotes the trace of the energy-momentum
tensor. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ characterise the contributions from
higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry,
respectively. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the
modified field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we
obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Our
results show that, for suitable choices of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and bag parameter
$(B_{g})$, the maximum mass limit of strange stars exceeds their general
relativistic counterpart. Specifically, our model yields a maximum mass up to
$3.11~M_{\odot}$, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could
plausibly be a strange star within this theoretical framework.

Abstract: We present a new analytic solution to the Einstein-Dirac equations formulated
by Finster, Smoller, and Yau [Phys. Rev. D 59, 104020 (1999)] to describe the
stationary states of a pair of gravitationally interacting neutral fermions.
The fermions' wavefunction in our analytic solution, as in their numerical
ones, is both exponentially localized and normalizable. However, our solution
differs from theirs in two key respects: it features a naked spacetime
singularity at the origin, and the gravitational (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) mass
of the localized object is zero, making it gravitationally undetectable to an
external observer. This is despite the arbitrarily large mass of the
constituent fermions. This unexpected result may have significant implications
for astronomy and cosmology, as it gives a mechanism by which mass could become
'hidden' during the universe's evolution.

TL;DR: AA-stacked and AB-stacked twisted SnSe2 exhibit rich quantum phases, including dimerized phases, valence bond solids, quantum paramagnetism, and spin liquids. These phases emerge from their respective lattice models, with the AB-stacked case showing particular sensitivity to interactions due to frustration. The system's flexibility allows for varied studies of correlated phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses the quantum phases of twisted SnSe2, which is relevant to the study of correlated systems and topological phases in materials science. Understanding these phases could provide insights into designing new materials with desired electronic properties.

Method: The authors use a Wannier model approach, constructing effective models for both stacking cases, applying Hartree-Fock mean-field and exact solutions for certain limits. In the AB case, cluster mean-field methods are employed with exact diagonalization for analysis.

Result: Exotic quantum phases such as dimerized phases, valence bond solids, quantum paramagnetism, and spin liquid phases are identified. The AB-stacked case shows robustness under interactions and frustration.

Conclusion: Twisted SnSe2 is a versatile platform for studying exotic correlated quantum phases, offering potential for controlling and discovering new states of matter through twist angle adjustments.

Abstract: We construct an interacting Wannier model for both AA-stacked and AB-stacked
twisted SnSe2, revealing a rich landscape of correlated quantum phases. For the
AA-stacked case, the system is effectively described by a three-orbital
triangular lattice model, where each orbital corresponds to a valley and
exhibits an approximate one-dimensional hopping structure due to a new
momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetry. By exploring the interacting phase
diagram using a combination of theoretical methods, including Hartree-Fock
mean-field theory and exact solutions of the spin model in certain limits, we
identify several exotic quantum phases. These include a dimerized phase with
finite residual entropy, valence bond solids, and quantum paramagnetism. In the
AB-stacked case, the system realizes an interacting kagome lattice model, where
the Wannier orbitals associated with the three valleys form three sublattices.
In the strong coupling regime, we use cluster mean-field methods to demonstrate
the emergence of a classical spin liquid phase due to the frustrated lattice
structure. The high tunability of the moir\'e system, which allows control over
both the filling and interaction strength (via twist angle), renders twisted
SnSe2 a versatile platform for realizing a wide range of exotic correlated
quantum phases.

Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful local probe of correlated
electronic states. Here we present a group theoretical framework for the
analysis of STM data, filtering STM images into components which provide a real
space mapping of the local symmetry properties of the underlying density of
states. Using this formalism, we show that certain kinds of symmetry breaking
are impossible to resolve in the first Brillouin zone, due to symmetry
restrictions we term ``Bragg peak extinctions'' in analogy with related ideas
in x-ray crystallography. We show extinct patterns of symmetry breaking can be
resolved using sub-unit cell structure, and develop methodological details for
the accurate extraction of this symmetry information. We illustrate our results
on synthetic STM data for $2\times 2$ charge density waves on the kagome
lattice, and on topographic data for kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Our results
provide a powerful method for extracting symmetry insights from STM data, and
provide constraints on when and how certain ground states are experimentally
observable.

Abstract: We study the boundary phase diagram and the low-temperature heat and
magnetization transport at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains.
  Depending on the magnetization axis anisotropy between the magnetic exchange
interactions at the junction, the system exhibits two different strong-coupling
regimes at low energies/temperatures, similar to the overscreened (topological)
four- and to the two-channel Kondo fixed points. Using renormalization group
arguments combined with boundary conformal field theory methods, we show the
instability of the former under any XY-type anisotropy at the junction. We
analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of
spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo
fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law. We caution that the
instability under XY anisotropy may hinder the detection of the phenomenology
related to the four-channel Kondo effect, therefore requiring careful control
in experimental realizations.

Conclusion: 可以通过电致旋光学和红外透射表征研究具有缺陷的自旋多层材料，了解其特殊电子态和在量子自旋 hall 效应中的潜在应用。

Abstract: The intrinsic substitutional and antisite defects cause unintentional doping
and shift of the E_F position above the conduction band minimum in the AFM
topological insulator (TI) MnBi2Te4. This prevents measurements of the quantum
anomalous Hall effect (QAH) and investigation of the topological Dirac states.
In the present study, the Mn-Bi-Te films grown by the MBE technique onto
Si(111) substrates with decreasing Bi and Te contents and increasing Mn content
were investigated by 0.5-6.5 eV spectroscopic ellipsometry. In addition, the
0.004-0.9 eV infrared (IR) transmittance spectra were examined. An effective
medium model was used to reproduce the measured ellipsometric angles,
Psi(omega) and Delta(omega), of the Mn-Bi-Te films in terms of the constructed
model, including film thickness, surface roughness, and volume fractions of two
(MnTe and Bi2Te3) or three constituents, the latter being associated with the
structural inhomogeneities contribution. The results obtained for the
inhomogeneous Mn-Bi-Te films using the three-phase EMA model indicate that the
defect-associated optical response systematically shifts to higher photon
energies from ~1.95 to ~2.43 eV with decreasing Te and Bi contents and
increasing Mn content, pointing out that the electrons become more deeply
localized in the formed structural inhomogeneities. The obtained results
indicate that the structure of the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films is not
continuous but represented by regions of nearly stoichiometric MnBi2Te4 phase,
which includes hollows or quantum anti-dots (QADs). The measured FIR
transmittance spectra for the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films show
substantially reduced (or absent) contribution(s) from free charge carriers,
which supports the relevance of localization effects.

TL;DR: The paper investigates rare earth aluminum silicon compounds as magnetic Weyl semimetals. Using neutron scattering, heat capacity, and magnetism measurements, they study the CEF excitations and find strong single-ion anisotropy in the ground states with varying strengths for different rare earth elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is likely motivated by the desire to explore the magnetic and electronic properties of rare earth intermetallic compounds, specifically focusing on their role as Weyl semimetals, with a focus on understanding CEF excitations and single-ion anisotropy.

Method: The researchers used a combination of inelastic neutron scattering, heat capacity measurements, and magnetic susceptibility measurements on polycrystalline samples of RAlSi where R varies among La, Ce, Pr, and Nd. Simultaneously, they analyzed the CEF excitations and characterized the ground state wave functions using corresponding CEF models.

Result: The study reveals the presence of CEF excitations at characteristic energies for different elements, which help determine the single-ion anisotropy parameters. The results show a progression in the strength of single-ion anisotropy from CeAlSi (strong) to NdAlSi (moderate), with some elements showing notable CEF splitting at low temperatures.

Conclusion: The findings imply that the rare earth intermetallic system RAlSi possesses intriguing magnetic Weyl semimetal properties. The varying degrees of single-ion anisotropy and exchange interactions across different systems (CeAlSi, PrAlSi, NdAlSi) suggest that this family of compounds could exhibit diverse magnetic and electronic behaviors depending on the rare earth element used.

Abstract: The rare earth intermetallic system \textit{R}Al\textit{X} (\textit{R} = rare
earth elements, \textit{X} = Si and Ge) is known to be a promising candidate of
magnetic Weyl semimetal. Due to the complex interactions between the rare earth
elements and surrounding atoms, as well as hybridization with itinerant
electrons, this family likely possesses highly intriguing and novel magnetic
structures and thus exhibits dynamic behaviors. We systematically probe
polycrystalline samples of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = La, Ce, Pr and Nd)
combining inelastic neutron scattering (INS), heat capacity and magnetic
susceptibility measurements. The INS measurements identify well-resolved
crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations at 19.2 and 24.9 meV in CeAlSi, at
5.4 meV in PrAlSi, and at 2.5 and 4.2 meV in NdAlSi. We analyzed the INS data
using the corresponding CEF models and determined the CEF parameters and ground
state wave functions of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd). Our
results suggest strong single-ion anisotropy in their ground states:
$|\pm3/2\rangle$ (94.5\%) in CeAlSi, $|\pm3\rangle$ (99.2\%) in PrAlSi, and
$|\pm9/2\rangle$ (76.2\%) in NdAlSi. Notably, the weaker anisotropy and strong
exchange interactions in NdAlSi promote competing magnetic orders and CEF
splitting at low temperature, contrasting with the robust CEF levels in
magnetic states of CeAlSi and PrAlSi.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the magnetic behavior of a specific perovskite material using multiple theoretical approaches and experimental techniques to understand how interdimer couplings affect the magnetic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to understand the complex magnetic behavior in perovskite materials, which could have applications in spintronic devices and other high-tech applications.

Method: The researchers employed a dimer mean-field theory based on classical Luttinger-Tisza analysis, linear spin-wave theory, and density functional theory combined with neutron scattering experiments.

Result: The results reveal that increasing interdimer couplings lead to a transition from a nonmagnetic singlet to a finite-moment ground state. Additionally, quantum fluctuations, ligand hybridization, and mixing between magnetic and nonmagnetic states suppress the magnetic moments.

Conclusion: The findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding magnetic interactions in the perovskite lattice, identifying key mechanisms of magnetic moment suppression which can guide future experimental work and material design.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic behavior of the 6H-perovskite dimer lattice
Ba$_3$Zn$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ru$_2$O$_9$ using analytical theory, density functional
theory, inelastic neutron scattering, and modeling of historical magnetization
and neutron-scattering data. A dimer mean-field theory built upon classical
Luttinger-Tisza analysis generates a phase diagram revealing a transition from
a nonmagnetic singlet to a finite-moment ground state as interdimer couplings
increase. A (generalized) linear spin-wave theory captures multiplet mixing,
excitation gap closing, and fluctuation-induced moment suppression. Density
functional theory on select compounds and neutron spectroscopy on dilute
Ba$_3$Zn(Ru$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$O$_9$ confirm the exchange hierarchy, enabling
quantification of previously published experiments within this framework. Our
results identify three mechanisms for magnetic moment suppression: quantum
fluctuations, ligand hybridization, and nonmagnetic-singlet/magnetic-multiplet
mixing.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum kernel method (QKM) based on Rydberg blockade in neutral atoms that avoids exponential concentration in measurements by breaking weak ergodicity, making it hard for classical computers to simulate and effective for machine learning on quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of quantum machine learning (QML) methods is crucial since conventional quantum computers (like NISQ) are limited. This paper addresses a key issue in QML: the need for an exponential number of measurements, which is a significant barrier to realizing practical quantum advantage.

Method: The QKM is based on the Rydberg blockade effect in coherently driven neutral atom arrays. The authors utilize the weak ergodicity-breaking dynamics to create a kernel that avoids exponential concentration. They analytically solve an approximate model and perform extensive numerical simulations on random datasets to validate their method.

Result: The results show that the proposed QKM exhibits effective learning performance on real datasets and can be implemented on current neutral atom quantum computers, demonstrating the potential for practical quantum machine learning applications.

Conclusion: By leveraging the Rydberg blockade mechanism, the researchers present a promising QKM that reduces classical simulation difficulty while maintaining high learning efficiency. This work paves the way for advancing quantum machine learning, particularly on NISQ devices, by overcoming significant limitations in measurement requirements.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods (QKMs) offer an appealing framework for machine
learning on near-term quantum computers. However, QKMs generically suffer from
exponential concentration, requiring an exponential number of measurements to
resolve the kernel values, with the exception of trivial (i.e., classically
simulable) kernels. Here we propose a QKM that is free of exponential
concentration, yet remains hard to simulate classically. Our QKM utilizes the
weak ergodicity-breaking many-body dynamics in the Rydberg blockade of
coherently driven neutral atom arrays. We demonstrate the fundamental
properties of our QKM by analytically solving an approximate toy model of its
underpinning quantum dynamics, as well as by extensive numerical simulations on
randomly generated datasets. We further show that the proposed kernel exhibits
effective learning on real data. The proposed QKM can be implemented in current
neutral atom quantum computers.

TL;DR: The paper discusses optimizing projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) under gauge symmetry, highlighting issues with gauge freedom and presenting a gauge-fixed optimization strategy. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ground state physics in 2D quantum systems is crucial, and PEPS is a key tool. The challenges in optimizing PEPS, especially regarding gauge freedom, makes this a focused area of research. 

Method: The authors analyze the role of gauge transformations in U(1)-symmetric PEPS with point group symmetry, reducing gauge degrees of freedom and deriving gradient-based optimization strategies affected by gauge. They propose a gauge-fixed approach to address optimization issues. 

Result: Their analysis shows that gauge transformations can lead to inaccurate contractions and artificially low energies. They introduce a gauge-fixed optimization method to circumvent these issues. 

Conclusion: Gauge-aware optimization strategies are essential for reliable PEPS applications. 

Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) constitute a powerful variational
ansatz for capturing ground state physics of two-dimensional quantum systems.
However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value
remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom
that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We
analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS
with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a
single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the
gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly
inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore,
we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this
effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need
for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational
PEPS in general settings.
