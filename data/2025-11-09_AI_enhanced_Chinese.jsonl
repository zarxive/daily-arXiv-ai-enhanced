Building on a\nstatic Schwarzschild baseline in which a freely falling two-level system\ncoupled to a single outgoing mode exhibits geometric photon statistics and a\ndetailed-balance ratio set by the surface gravity, we introduce an even-parity,\naxisymmetric quadrupolar perturbation and work in an ingoing\nEddington-Finkelstein, horizon-regular framework. The perturbation corrects the\noutgoing eikonal through a gauge-invariant double-null contraction of the\nmetric, yielding a compact redshift map that, when pulled back to the detector\nworldline, produces a universal, decaying-oscillatory modulation of the\nBoltzmann exponent at the quasinormal frequency. We derive a closed boundary\nformula for the response coefficient at the sampling radius, identify the\nprecise adiabatic window in which the result holds, and prove that the\nmodulation vanishes in all stationary limits. Detector specifics (gap,\nswitching wavepacket width) enter only through a smooth prefactor, while the\ngeometric content is captured by the quasinormal pair and the response\ncoefficient. The analysis clarifies that near-horizon \"thermality\" is robust\nbut not rigid: detailed balance persists as the organizing structure and is\ngently driven by ringdown dynamics. The framework is minimal yet extensible to\nother multipoles, parities, and slow rotation, and it suggests direct numerical\nand experimental cross-checks in controlled analog settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Exceptional points have intriguing effects on the dynamics of systems\ndue to their topological properties. They have been explored in contexts\nincluding optical, microwave, optomechanical, electronic and magnonic systems,\nand have been used to control systems including optical microcavities, the\nlasing modes of a PT-symmetric waveguide, and terahertz pulse generation. A\nchallenging problem that remains open in all of these scenarios is the fully\ndeterministic and direct manipulation of the systems' loss and gain on\ntimescales relevant to coherent control of excitations. Here we demonstrate the\nrapid manipulation of the gain and loss balance of excitations of a magnonic\nhybrid system on durations much shorter than their decay rate, allowing us to\nexploit non-Hermitian physics for coherent control. By encircling an\nexceptional point, we demonstrate population transfer between coupled\nmagnon-polariton modes, and confirm the distinctive chiral nature of\nexceptional point encircling.

Our findings underscore the\ntransformative potential of combining HTS with AI-driven models in advancing\nHTSC materials, highlighting Pu and H elements (with Tc nearly 100 K) as\nsignificant predictors of high-temperature superconductivity, suggesting their\nrole as a crucial gene in these materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6750\u6599\u57fa\u56e0\u8ba1\u5212\u548cAI\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf screening\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bfb\u627e\u5176\u5173\u952e\u6210\u5206\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6750\u6599\u57fa\u56e0\u8ba1\u5212\u548cAI\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf screening\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408HTS\u6280\u672f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u529f\u80fd\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6750\u6599\u57fa\u56e0\u8ba1\u5212\u548cAI\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Revisiting the setup of Cho, Mazel, and Yin, we use\nthe formula to compute the energy of rolling tachyon solutions on unstable\nD-branes. An important aspect of the analysis is dealing with the singular\nultraviolet behavior of string vertices in Lorentzian signature, a feature we\nrefer to as transgressive locality. This forces us to carry out computations in\nmomentum space, where time and causality are somewhat obscure.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of nonadiabatic electron\ntransfer (ET) in confined electromagnetic fields studied in [J. Chem. Phys.\n150, 174122 (2019)] and present a unified rate theory based on Fermi's golden\nrule (FGR). By employing a polaron-transformed Hamiltonian, we derive analytic\nexpressions for the ET rate correlation functions that are valid across all\ntemperature regimes and all cavity mode time scales. In the high-temperature\nlimit, our formalism recovers the Marcus and Marcus-Jortner results, while in\nthe low-temperature limit it reveals the emergence of the energy gap law. We\nfurther extend the theory to include cavity loss by using an effective Brownian\noscillator spectral density, which enables closed-form expressions for the ET\nrate in lossy cavities. As applications, we demonstrate two key cavity-induced\nphenomena: (i) resonance effects, where the ET rate is strongly enhanced at\ncertain cavity mode frequencies, and (ii) electron-transfer-induced photon\nemission, arising from the population of cavity photon Fock states during the\nET process.

Using a classical Hamiltonian\nformalism, we analyze the threshold conditions for parametric instability as a\nfunction of the angle between the microwave pumping field and the external\nmagnetic field, continuously tracing the transition between parallel and\ntransverse pumping. We also describe two competing four-magnon scattering\nmechanisms that transfer parametric magnons toward the bottom of their\nfrequency spectrum: The step-by-step Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade, which is\nallowed for all magnetic field values, and the kinetic instability mechanisms\nthat provide a much more efficient single-step channel in transferring magnons\ndirectly to the lowest-energy states, but occurs within specific regions of the\npumping angle and the external magnetic field where the conservation laws\npermit it. In the experimental part, we employ microfocused Brillouin light\nscattering spectroscopy in combination with a vector magnet, allowing for\nangle-resolved mapping of the magnon population spectrum under controlled\npumping angle. We observe that transverse pumping, although characterized by a\nhigher instability threshold, yields a markedly stronger population at the\nspectral minimum compared to parallel pumping. These observations demonstrate\nthat the kinetic instability channel plays a dominant role in transferring\nmagnons to the spectral minimum under such conditions.

A traditional\nbilayer model in which the interlayer interaction is Heisenberg so that the two\nlayers can exchange spin (and energy) with each other, making it possible to\nachieve a simple dimerized valence bond liquid-like state. The resulting phase\ndiagram is rich with N\\'eel, valence bond solid and simple dimer phases, and\nboth first-order and continuous transitions, which we demonstrate are\nconsistent with the conventional Landau theory of order parameters. In the\nsecond family of models in which the layers can exchange only energy but no\nspin (reminiscent of the Ashkin-Teller coupling), the simple dimer state cannot\noccur. The phase diagrams reveal a number of phase transitions that are\naccessed for the first time.

Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic\ninvestigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the\neffect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and\nspectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated\nsurfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer\nsuppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a\nlong-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent.\nFurthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the\ncurrent-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by\na factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from\nextra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel\njunction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer.

These parameters will act as a guide to\nengineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its\nperformance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate\ntransmission level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fde\u7eed\u9897\u7c92\u4ea4\u6362\u70ed\u673a\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u53d8\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u56fa\u6001\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u81f3\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a84\u80fd\u91cf\u5e26\u6ee4\u6ce2\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u70ed\u6e90\u548c\u51b7\u5e93\u4e4b\u95f4\u6d41\u52a8\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u88ab\u52a8\u70ed\u6d41\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u70ed\u673a\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u8fd1\u5361\u8bfa\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5df2\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.7\u03b7\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ece\u5b9e\u7528\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u529f\u7387\u3001\u6548\u7387\u5728\u6700\u5927\u529f\u7387\u65f6\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u66f4\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u5bfc\u901a\u6027\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u56fa\u6709\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u70ed\u673a\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u70ed\u673a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u70ed\u673a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u89c2\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u70ed\u673a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u6291\u5236\u88ab\u52a8\u70ed\u6d41\u65f6\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u70ed\u673a\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u8fd1\u5361\u8bfa\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe0.7\u03b7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bfc\u901a\u6027\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u53c2\u6570\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53ef\u636e\u6b64\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u70ed\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u901a\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u70ed\u673a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The main result of this work is to\nshow that each member of this ensemble is weighted by a symmetry factor given\nby the invertible symmetry group of its categorical symmetry relative to the\nbulk TQFT as its SymTFT. This is the natural $\\unicode{x2014}$ uniform up to\nisomorphism $\\unicode{x2014}$ measure on the groupoid of Lagrangian algebras\nthat describe the boundary theories. We also write the sum over topologies more\nexplicitly in terms of equivalence classes of Heegaard splittings of\n3-manifolds with a given boundary and comment on their weights.

In this\nwork, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as\na novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven\ncriticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective\nmeasurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and\ndecoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits,\nMDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed\nstates rather than in quantum trajectories.

However, it can also emerge autonomously from\nsymmetry-breaking interactions between the TLS and its surrounding environment\nat a low temperature. Although such environments often consist of interacting\natoms or spins, the role of interactions within the environment in generating\nthe autonomous local coherence has remained unexplored. Here, we address this\ngap by analyzing an exactly solvable model, which comprises a target TLS\ncoupled to $N$ interacting source TLSs that represent the environment, with the\nwhole system being in thermal equilibrium.

In both\nthese regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of\nthe energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one\npresents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and\nthe second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the\nboundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free\ngeometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the\nRindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the\nboundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion\ncondensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative\neverywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and\nthe energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region.\nFor a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions\n$D\\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero.\nThis behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the\ngeometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer.

We model\ndistributed quantum processors using distributed quantum circuits with nonlocal\ntwo-qubit gates, defining the communication complexity of a unitary as the\nminimum number of such nonlocal gates required for its realization.\n  Our contributions are twofold. First, for general $n$-qubit unitaries, we\nimprove upon the trivial $O(4^n)$ communication bound. Considering $k$\npairwise-connected processors (each with $n/k$ data qubits and $m$ ancillas),\nwe prove the communication complexity satisfies $O\\left(\\max\\{4^{(1-1/k)n - m},\nn\\}\\right)$--for example, $O(2^n)$ when $m=0$ and $k=2$--and establish the\ntightness of this upper bound.

We\nintroduce the Random Access Bell Game (RABG), a task where an entangled\nparticle propagates through a sequence of identical noisy blocks, and the\nability to violate a Bell inequality is tested at a randomly chosen point\n(access node). We consider a scenario where each noisy block is composed of two\ncomplete erasure channels, an extreme entanglement-breaking channel with\nvanishing quantum and classical capacities. We investigate the performance of\nthe Random Access Bell Game in this configuration and attempt to mitigate the\neffect of noise by coherently controlling the order of each channel in the\nnoise using the quantum {\\tt SWITCH}. However, the quantum {\\tt SWITCH} in its\ncanonical setup with a coherent state in the control fails to provide any\nadvantage in the Random Access Bell Game. Our main contribution is a protocol\nthat leverages initial entanglement between the target and control of the\nquantum {\\tt SWITCH} and employs sequential, unsharp measurements on the\ncontrol system, showing that it is possible to guarantee a Bell violation after\nan arbitrarily large number of channel applications. Furthermore, our protocol\nallows for a near-maximal (Tsirelson bound) Bell violation to be achieved at\nany desired round, while still ensuring violations in all preceding rounds.

An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the\nhidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a\nquantum algorithm of cost $O(\\sqrt{n} \\log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound\nof $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$ upper bound.\n  We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a\nsubset $\\cal{Q} \\subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S =\nb$ for an arbitrary $S \\in \\cal{Q}$ and $b \\in \\{-1,1\\}^S$ of its choice, at\nunit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\\cal{Q}$ is any of the following\ncollections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full\nset.\n  All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using\nsymmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of\nlearning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization\nprogram, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd\nfunctions $f : \\{-1,1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$\nto the maximum (over $T \\in \\cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube\nwhose free variables are exactly $T$.'\n  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal\nversion of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program\ntypically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds\nwithout explicitly resorting to SDP duality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u96c6\u65cfQ\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u4e49\u201c\u9010\u5b57\u7b26\u641c\u7d22\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005 fascinated by quantum speedup for searching problems and the theoretical foundations of quantum computing are likely the primary motivation.", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005 developed a novel framework based on optimizing a specific ratio involving odd functions over the Boolean cube, which enabled them to derive near-tight bounds for several natural classes of set families Q.", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005 showed near-tight upper and lower bounds for the quantum query complexity of generalized ", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5e7f\u4e49\u9010\u5b57\u7b26\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005 \u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}
