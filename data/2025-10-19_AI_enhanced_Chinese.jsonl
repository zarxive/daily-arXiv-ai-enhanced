We identify a universal scaling form, valid across\ndifferent classes of magic initial states, and corroborate it through numerical\nsimulations and analytical calculations of the frame potential.

This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between\nintegrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a\nunified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed\nmany-body quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6563\u9038\u7387\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u674e\u4e4c\u592b\u91cf\u8c31\u7684\u7f13\u6162\u6d88\u6563\u901f\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u9038\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u6563\u9038\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709 semiclassical\u6781\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6253\u51fb\u7684\u4f0a\u8f9b\u91cf\u5b50\u94fe\u7684\u5b64\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u674e\u4e4c\u592b\u91cf\u8c31\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6563\u9038\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u674e\u4e4c\u592b\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6307\u6570\u6563\u9038\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b64\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6563\u9038\u901f\u7387\u662f\u674e\u4e4c\u592b\u91cf\u8c31\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6563\u9038\u7387\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u674e\u4e4c\u592b\u91cf\u8c31\u7684\u7f13\u6162\u6d88\u6563\u901f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5373\u6563\u9038\u7387\u7b49\u4e8e\u674e\u4e4c\u592b\u8c31\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u6700\u4f4e\u4ef7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u8f6c\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u3002\u5728\u8de8\u7f6e\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u6563\u9038\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4ecd\u7136\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u674e\u4e4c\u592b\u91cf\u8c31\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u6563\u9038\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u6563\u9038\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5de9\u56fa\u4e86\u674e\u4e4c\u592b\u91cf\u5b50\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u9038\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Our approach is based on a generalized two-level Hamiltonian model\nthat can represent various electronic state crossings - conical intersections,\navoided crossings, and elliptic intersections - through appropriate\nparameterization. We introduce a novel prelooping trajectory initialization\nscheme, allowing us to encode the memory as an initial phase accumulated due to\nthe adiabatic evolution over the potential energy surface. This is a unified\nframework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry\ncurvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate\nrepresentation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method\nincorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic\nintersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy)\nindependent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter\n(e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with\ntheoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to\ngeometric phase effects. This framework provides a valuable tool for studying\nquantum-classical interactions in molecular systems where geometric phase\neffects play a significant role.

For electric fields smaller than the\naforementioned range the twisted bilayer does not exhibit the quantum valley\nHall effect, whereas for larger electric fields the spin-valley locking is\nlifted and the emergent quantum valley Hall states are only valley-protected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u626d\u66f2\u5c42\u72b6\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5947\u5f02\u6027 hall \u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7845\u805a\u548c\u9517\u805a\u5728\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u4e0b\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9002\u5ea6\u5916\u7535\u573a\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u65cb- valley \u9501\u5b9a\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u5b50\u5c42\u5408\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5947\u5f02\u6027 hall \u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u524d\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u7535\u573a\u8c03\u63a7\u5c42\u5408\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u539f\u5b50\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u5916\u7535\u573a\u5904\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e00\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u65f6\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u4e0e valley \u5ea6\u88ab\u9501\u5b9a\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u62a4\uff1b\u5f53\u5916\u7535\u573a\u8d85\u8fc7\u8be5\u8303\u56f4\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u9501\u5b9a\u88ab\u89e3\u9664\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559 valley \u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u626d\u66f2\u5c42\u72b6\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5947\u5f02\u6027 hall \u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Sparse\nstabilizer codes -- referred to generally as quantum low-density parity-check\n(QLDPC) codes -- have risen to the forefront of QEC research in recent years.\nThis can be attributed to several key factors. First, classical LDPC codes\nadmit low-complexity belief propagation iterative decoding and near-capacity\nperformance, which contributed to the early interest in QLDPC codes. Then, the\nresult promising constant overhead fault tolerance using QLDPC codes led to the\nsearch for code families that go beyond the long-holding $\\sqrt{n}$ scaling\nbarrier of minimum distance for codelength $n$. This resulted in recent\nbreakthroughs in the construction of QLDPC codes, which, combined with\nefficient decoding algorithms and the development of fault-tolerant protocols\noperating on QLDPC-encoded quantum information, provide a promising pathway to\nlow-overhead, fault-tolerant quantum computation.

We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte\nCarlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which\nis further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show\nthat the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal\ncharacteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the\nglobal phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the\nferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as\ntwo distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI\nshows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the\nclassical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI.

In most systems where\nstability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are\nconsidered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent\nperturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal\nphenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove\nthat it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the\nevolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the\ninstantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds\nremain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This\nflexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in\nproving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration\nspaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space\ncan induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break\nergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several\nsystems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving\nstate is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time\neven under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability\nof LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In\naddition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with\nclustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum\nHamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima.

We focus on two regimes with large output power, which are based on\ntwo operational principles: exploiting information on one hand and the\nnonthermal properties of the resource on the other. We show that these regimes\nsignificantly differ in precision.

Empirically, we trained EQC-based policies on\nsmall $n-$city TSPs and evaluated them on larger instances, finding that they\nretained strong performance zero-shot and further improved with fine-tuning,\nconsistent with classical observations of positive transfer between scales.\nThese results demonstrate that embedding permutation symmetry into quantum\nmodels yields scalable QRL solutions for combinatorial tasks, highlighting the\ncrucial role of equivariance in transferable quantum learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u7f6e\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5982TSP\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u7f6e\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5229\u7528\u7f6e\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08EQCs\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u6a21TSP\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u9650\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u91cf\u5316\u4e86n\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u548cm\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u90e8\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eEQC\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3TSP\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u7f6e\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7f6e\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u67b6\u6784\uff0cresearchers\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In a\n$\\delta$-layer model with interfacial exchange and Rashba spin-orbit coupling,\ncharge transfer at a high-quality interface creates a spin-selective phase\ncondition (interfacial spin filtering) that suppresses backscattering for one\nspin projection while enhancing momentum relaxation for the other.

The cosmological constant partitions spacetime into an\ninfinite sequence of confinement domains bounded by impenetrable barriers.\nWithin the first allowed domain, the KG equation reduces to a hypergeometric\ndifferential equation, yielding closed-form expressions for both the energy\nspectra and the radial wavefunctions in terms of hypergeometric polynomials.\nTwo representative RG models, inspired by the Magueijo-Smolin framework and\nloop quantum gravity (LQG), produce Planck-scale bounded, symmetric\nparticle-antiparticle spectra. A distinctive feature of the curved magnetized\ngeometry is the collapse of all magnetic quantum states $m \\neq 0$ onto the $m\n= 0$ level for each radial excitation, a degeneracy absent in flat spacetime.\nIncreasing the cosmological constant partially lifts this collapse,\nestablishing a direct link between the global spacetime curvature and the local\nquantum structure. Radial probability density analysis further shows that\nstronger magnetic fields enhance spatial localization, confining bosons into\nstatic or rotating ring-like configurations with nodal architectures that\nevolve systematically with quantum numbers.

However, a quantitative\nanswer to the fundamental question, under what specific conditions do ND beams\nactually outperform conventional pencil beams, has remained elusive, especially\nin the emerging context of near-field communications. This paper provides the\nfirst systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND\nbeams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic\ngenerator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu)\nunder the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair\ncomparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture.\nThrough extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage\nregime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible\nlink-level gain. Our key finding is that the advantage of ND beams is a\npowerful but conditional near field phenomenon. While offering a positive\naverage gain, its performance is highly variable, with a 60-70% probability of\noutperforming the baseline in its optimal range. Crucially, this performance is\nstrongly modulated by the obstacle's geometry, revealing a significant weakness\nagainst large blockers.

End-to-end entangled pairs are created by using\nswapping processes to consume short entangled pairs and generate long pairs.\nHowever, due to environmental interference, entangled pairs decohere over time,\nresulting in low fidelity. Thus, generating entangled pairs at the right time\nis crucial. Moreover, the swapping process also causes additional fidelity\nloss. To this end, this paper presents a short time slot protocol, where a time\nslot can only accommodate a process. It has a more flexible arrangement of\nentangling and swapping processes than the traditional long time slot protocol.\nIt raises a new optimization problem TETRIS for finding strategies of\nentangling and swapping for each request to maximize the fidelity sum of all\naccepted requests. To solve the TETRIS, we design two novel algorithms with\ndifferent optimization techniques.

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We investigate current fluctuations in open quantum systems beyond the\nweak-coupling and Markovian regimes, focusing on a coherently driven qubit\nstrongly coupled to a structured bosonic environment. By combining full\ncounting statistics with the reaction coordinate mapping, we develop a\nframework that enables the calculation of steady-state current fluctuations and\ntheir temporal correlations in the strong-coupling regime. Our analysis reveals\nthat, unlike in weak coupling, both the average current and its fluctuations\nexhibit nonmonotonic dependence on the system-environment interaction strength.\nNotably, we identify a regime where current noise is suppressed below the\nclassical thermodynamic uncertainty bound, coinciding with enhanced\nanticorrelations in quantum jump trajectories and faster system relaxation. We\nfurther show that these features are linked to nonclassical properties of the\nreaction coordinate mode, such as non-Gaussianity and quantum coherence. Our\nresults provide new insights and design principles for controlling current\nfluctuations in quantum devices operating beyond the standard weak-coupling\nparadigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf-\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u6d41\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u754c\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5b50\u8df3\u8dc3\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u5176\u53cd\u5e94\u5750\u6807\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u5982\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u64cd\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u6ce2\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7535\u6d41\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9650\u5236\u610f\u5473\u7740\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5168\u8ba1\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u5750\u6807\u6620\u5c04\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u6da8\u843d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a33\u6001\u7535\u6d41\u6da8\u843d\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf-\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf-\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u6d41\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u754c\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5b50\u8df3\u8dc3\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u5176\u53cd\u5e94\u5750\u6807\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u5982\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u64cd\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u6ce2\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u64cd\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u6ce2\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002results\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this paper, we\ndiscuss and analyze in detail an alternative approach: the stepwise estimation\nstrategy. In this approach, parameters are estimated sequentially, using an\noptimized fraction of the total available resources allocated to each step. We\nderive a tight and achievable precision bound for this protocol, the stepwise\nseparable bound, and provide its closed-form analytical expression, revealing a\ncrucial dependence on the chosen measurement ordering. We provide a rigorous\ncomparison with the joint measurement strategy, deriving analytical conditions\nthat determine when the stepwise approach offers superior precision. Through\nthe analysis of several paradigmatic SU(2) unitary encoding models, we\ndemonstrate that the stepwise strategy can indeed outperform joint\nmeasurements, particularly in scenarios characterized by non-optimal probes or\nmodels with a high degree of sloppiness. Our findings establish stepwise\nestimation as a powerful alternative to joint and collective measurements,\nproving that sequential protocols can provide a genuine metrological advantage,\nespecially in resource-constrained or imperfect experimental settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6781\u9650\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7531 Holevo Cram\u00e9r-Rao \u754c\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5206\u7ea7\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6309\u987a\u5e8f\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u4f7f\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u603b\u91cf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7cbe\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u5206\u7ea7\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5f53\u6ee1\u8db3\u67d0\u4e9b\u5206\u6790\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u51e0\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u7684 SU(2) \u5355\u4f4d\u5143\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u5b9e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u982d\u6216\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5931\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u7ea7\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u8054\u5408\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u987a\u5e8f\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u786e\u5b9e Metrological \u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5206\u7ea7\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u7ea7\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7SU(2)\u5355\u4f4d\u5143\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u982d\u6216\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5931\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u5b9e\u8d85\u8d8a\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7ea7\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f30\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u982d\u6216\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5931\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u7ea7\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u9650\u5236\u8f83\u4e3a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}
