Mane"], "title": "Radiative Spin Polarization in High Energy Storage Rings", "comment": "38 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "The usual theoretical model for synchrotron radiation in circular accelerators (synchrotrons and storage rings) is to treat a single electron moving in a horizontal circle in a uniform vertical magnetic field, but the true situation in real storage rings is more complicated and exhibits much richer physics. The magnetic fields are inhomogeneous, and there is a bunch of many particles and they traverse a distribution of orbits (hence they encounter different magnetic fields). This results in so-called ``depolarizing spin resonances'' (which do not appear in a simple model of a uniform vertical magnetic field). The calculation of the equilibrium electron spin polarization requires a much more careful analysis. For example, a key insight is that, for motion in inhomogeneous magnetic fields, ``spin flip'' is in general \\emph{not} a $180^\\circ$ reversal of the spin orientation. The physics of radiative spin polarization involves a mix of many disciplines, and provides a good example of cross-disciplinary thinking. We shall also briefly note the connection to astrophysics. The astrophysics literature mainly treats electron motion in very strong magnetic fields, stronger than the Schwinger critical field (for example a neutron star). It is a problem of ongoing interest in astrophysics to study the radiation by electrons circulating in such strong magnetic fields. This article aims to provide the reader with a survey of the basic physics principles of radiative spin polarization, omitting low-level mathematical algebra as much as possible. Such details can be found in the literature, and are not relevant here.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5706\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u6781\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u5176\u4e0e\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4ea4\u53c9\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7269\u7406\u3001\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u53cd\u8f6c\u4e0d\u50cf\u5747\u5300\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u90a3\u4e48\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u53d7\u5230\u78c1\u573a\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5706\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e2d\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u6781\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4ea4\u53c9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u5728\u590d\u6742\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) appear to mix all processing, because modular solutions are difficult to find as they are vanishing subspaces in the space of possible solutions. Here, we draw inspiration from fault-tolerant computation and the Poisson-like firing of real neurons to show that activity-dependent neural noise, combined with nonlinear neural responses, drives the emergence of solutions that reflect an accurate understanding of modular tasks, corresponding to acquisition of a correct world model. We find that noise-driven modularisation can be recapitulated by a deterministic regulariser that multiplicatively combines weights and activations, revealing rich phenomenology not captured in linear networks or by standard regularisation methods. Though the emergence of modular structure requires sufficiently many training samples (exponential in the number of modular task dimensions), we show that pre-modularised ANNs exhibit superior noise-robustness and the ability to generalise and extrapolate well beyond training data, compared to ANNs without such inductive biases. Together, our work demonstrates a regulariser and architectures that could encourage modularity emergence to yield functional benefits.", "AI": {"tldr": "The brain\u2019s circuits exhibit modular architectures to factorize complex tasks, enabling compositionally generalizable solutions and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

For four representative modified entropies, namely Barrow, R\u00e9nyi, Kaniadakis, and logarithmic, we derive the corresponding effective metrics and analyze their thermodynamic and topological classification using the off-shell free energy and winding numbers. We show that Barrow and R\u00e9nyi entropies yield a single unstable sector with global charge $W=-1$, while logarithmic and Kaniadakis corrections produce canceling defects with $W=0$, revealing topological structures absent in the Schwarzschild case. Using the modified metrics, we further calculate the photon-sphere radius and shadow size, showing that each modified entropy relation induces characteristic optical shifts. Thus, by comparing with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^\\ast$, we extract new bounds on all entropy-deformation parameters.

We validate this approach on synthetic data generated by a 9-dimensional modified Lorenz-96 model and demonstrate its utility on real-world climate data, analyzing global temperature anomalies across nine regions, quantifying the dissimilarity of each 288-month time window up to July 2025 relative to the 1850-1874 baseline period.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u9006\u6270\u52a8\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6307\u6807\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u534f\u540c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6545\u969c\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 resilience \u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc79\u7ef4\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684Lorenz-96\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4fdd\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u6e29\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u671f\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528higher-order correlations\u6355\u83b7\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

The sub-bandgap illumination promotes strong photocurrent generation and substantially improved carrier collection efficiency.

Motivated by recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$ that demonstrated optical control of magnetization, we propose a protocol for probing magnetization dynamics in flat-band ferromagnets. We investigate the nucleation and dynamical growth of magnetic bubbles prepared on top of a false vaccum in both itinerant ferromagnets and spin-polarized Chern insulators. For ferromagnetic metals, we emphasize the crucial role of a non-trivial quantum geometry in the magnetization dynamics, which in turn also provides a probe for the quantum metric. Furthermore, for quantum Hall ferromagnets, we show how properties of chiral edge modes localized at domain-wall boundaries can be dynamically accessed. Our work demonstrates the potential for nonequilibrium protocols to control and probe strongly correlated phases, with particular relevance for twisted MoTe$_2$ and graphene-based flat-band ferromagnets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The photon either reaches the boundary for a first passage or is absorbed. Projecting the walk onto the axial direction produces a one-dimensional alternating process whose peaks and valleys correspond to changes in the sign of the projected step. This reduction preserves first-return and first-passage events and leads to a representation in terms of Motzkin-type polynomials. The analytical formulation is complete except for boundary-constrained return terms, which appear as high-order integrals. We treat these contributions with a single truncation factor determined from Monte Carlo simulations of first-return distributions over a wide range of anisotropy g and scattering steps ms. The resulting factor follows a Cauchy distribution. Incorporating it yields first-return probabilities in agreement with full three-dimensional Monte Carlo to within 2% for g<=0.7.

We find that increasing $\u03c3_T$ leads to a dramatic transformation in the longitudinal momentum spectrum. The well-known fringe pattern, akin to that in the multi-slit interference, gets significantly modified. The averaged spectra exhibit a robust Gaussian-like envelope with residual oscillations, which are much more prominent in the central momentum region.

Finally, numerical three-periodic wave solutions to the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation are computed using the Gauss-Newton method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Blaszak-Szum\u683c\u67b6\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u89d2\u51fd\u6570\u578b\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Hirota\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5176\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5355\u5b64\u5b50\u548c\u53cc\u5b64\u5b50\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53cc\u5b64\u5b50\u89e3\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684B\u00e4cklund\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u53d8\u6362\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u591a\u9876\u70b9\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u5bf9\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Schur\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u9020\u6563\u7126\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u547c\u5438\u89e3\uff1aAkhmediev\u547c\u5438\u89e3\u3001Kuznetsov-Ma\u547c\u5438\u89e3\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u659c\u5411\u547c\u5438\u89e3\u3002\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af-\u725b\u987f\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u4e09\u5468\u671f\u6570\u503c\u6ce2\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u683c\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u89e3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u65b0\u7684\u5b64\u7acb\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u547c\u5438\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cB\u00e4cklund\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u89e3\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6784\u9020\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Blaszak-Szum\u683c\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u591a\u7c7b\u5b64\u5b50\u89e3\u3001\u547c\u5438\u89e3\u548c\u5468\u671f\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u683c\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5b64\u5b50\u89e3\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u547c\u5438\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Traditional metrics such as ``time under tension'' are fundamentally insufficient, because they are scalar quantities that ignore the temporal history of deviations, that is, the microdynamics of posture, which has nontrivial energetic consequences. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded methodology to address this problem by introducing the concept of the \\textbf{deviation absement} ($\u0394\\mathcal{A}_\\ell$), defined as the time integral of the deviation of the muscle--tendon unit length from a reference value.\n  We rigorously prove that, for a broad class of quasi-static models, absement appears as the leading first-order state variable. For small deviations in a neighbourhood of a reference posture, the total metabolic cost $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{met}}(\\ell)$ admits a universal asymptotic expansion of the form \\begin{equation*} \\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{met}}(\\ell) = P_0 T + C_1 \u0394\\mathcal{A}_\\ell + C_2 \\int_0^T(\\ell(t)-\\ell_0)^2\\,dt + O(\\|\\ell-\\ell_0\\|_{L^\\infty}^3), \\end{equation*} where $T$ is the duration of loading, and $P_0, C_1, C_2$ are constants determined by local properties of the system.\n  Thus, the deviation absement ($\u0394\\mathcal{A}_\\ell$) is the \\textbf{unique first-order sufficient statistic} that allows one to quantify and separate the energetic contribution of systematic drift of the mean posture from the contribution of micro-oscillations (tremor), which is described by the quadratic term. This result has direct consequences for parameter identification: the proposed formalism makes it possible to recover physically meaningful coefficients $(P_0, C_1, C_2)$ by means of linear regression of experimental data obtained from standard kinematic measurements and indirect calorimetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While it is well-motivated theoretically, There has always been controversy over its actual existence. The AdS-dS transition is corresponding to a sign switching $\u039b$. We have proposed an ansatz for a negative time-varying cosmological constant $\u039b(H)$ as a function of Hubble parameter $H$, and used it in constructing a periodic model with no future singularity in a scale-invariance gravity. With the proposed Ansatz for negative $\u039b$, The model leads to a physically acceptable cosmic description, while we get unphysical parameters with the positive and zero values of $\u039b$.

In 3D, strong DDI leads to phenomena like anisotropic superfluidity, quantum droplets stabilized by Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, and supersolid states with density modulations. In 2D, we discuss a new scenario where DDI induces angle-dependent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions and potential supersolidity, as suggested by recent experimental realizations of strongly dipolar systems in quasi-2D geometries.

Schelling"], "title": "Thermal response functions and second sound in graphene", "comment": "16 pages, 12 figures, to be submitted to Journal of Applied Physics", "summary": "The propagation of second sound, and more broadly the ballistic transport of heat, is of central importance in heat dissipation from electronic devices at very short length and time scales. Specifically, there is an interest in the practical implications of violations of Fourier's law. Recently, we have developed a simulation approach based on thermal-response functions that is appropriate for elucidating physics beyond the diffusive regime, including time-dependent sources and second-sound propagation. The methods are applied to free-standing graphene simulated using molecular-dynamics (MD) with empirical potentials. The simulations predict a strong second-sound signal at T=300K for length scales of at least L=68.1nm. It is demonstrated that the second-sound dissipation time is determined primarily by decoherence that emerges from the details of the phonon band structure. It is also shown that the decay time for second sound depends sensitively on the length scale that characterizes the thermal excitation. This is in contrast with theories based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), where second-sound dissipation is determined primarily by the resistive anharmonic phonon scattering rate. Calculations using the linearized BTE are also presented, along with analysis of second sound based on the BTE. This approach results in significantly longer lifetimes for second sound in comparison to our MD simulation results. Predictions for the response due to time-dependent sources are also presented, including insight into how time-dependent sources could be tuned to result in weak or strong temperature oscillations, and how time-dependent experiments might probe the spectra associated with second sound. Results are discussed in the context of second sound in graphite in the temperature range from 100-200K.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u4f20\u64ad\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u72b6\u4f20\u70ed\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u6563\u4e86\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u7684\u5f3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728300K\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u5e76\u968f\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u58f0\u5b50\u6ce2\u56fe\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7834\u574f\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u968f\u70ed\u6fc0\u53d1\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u654f\u611f\u5730\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u8f93\u8fd0\u65b9\u7a0b(BTE)\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cBTE\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u4e3b\u8981\u7531||||", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u4f20\u64ad\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u72b6\u4f20\u70ed\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u70ed\u5728\u5fae\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236...", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u7531\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u52bf\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u6269\u6563\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e90\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u4f20\u64ad...", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728300K\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u957f\u5ea6\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3a68.1\u7eb3\u7c73\u65f6\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u58f0\u5b50\u6ce2\u56fe\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7834\u574f\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7834\u574f\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u5b50\u6ce2\u56fe\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u968f\u70ed\u6fc0\u53d1\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u654f\u611f\u5730\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u8f93\u8fd0\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02...", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u4f20\u64ad\u5728\u5fae\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u6563\u4e86\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u58f0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

We propose a model where half-filled $d_{z^{2}}$ local moments interact with itinerant $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ electrons via strong Hund's coupling $J_H$, which reduces to a bilayer type-II t-J model in the large $J_H$ limit. Using iDMRG calculations on an $L_y=4, L_z=2$ cylinder, we demonstrate that the competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange generates period-4 stripe-like SDW order-a feature absent in one-orbital t-J model with only $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Furthermore, increasing the interlayer exchange coupling suppresses magnetic order and stabilizes interlayer s-wave superconductivity. These results identify the type-II t-J model as a minimal framework for capturing the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86 La3Ni2O7 \u5c42\u72b6\u954d\u9178\u8d85\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\uff08SDW\uff09\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u970d\u5fb7\uff08Hund\u2019s\uff09\u8026\u5408 J_H\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u72b6 II \u578b Jahn-Teller \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528 iDMRG \u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u91cd\u4ea4\u6362\u6027 ferromagnetism \u548c\u5c42\u5185\u8d85\u4ea4\u6362\u4f5c\u7528\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u5468\u671f 4 \u7684\u6761\u7eb9\u72b6 SDW \u6709\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6001\u5728\u5355\u5c42 t-J \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5c42\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u5c42\u95f4\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53 s-\u6ce2\u8d85\u5bfc\u6001\uff0c\u7531\u6b64\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5c42\u72b6 II \u578b Jahn-Teller \u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c42\u72b6\u954d\u9178\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u78c1\u6027\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c42\u72b6\u8d85\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u7684\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u4e4b\u8c1c\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5c42\u72b6\u954d\u9178\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4\uff08DMRG\uff09\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6709\u9650\u957f\u7684 y \u65b9\u5411\u4f38\u957f\u7684\u67f1\u72b6\u51e0\u4f55\uff08L_y=4\uff0cL_z=2\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u72b6 II \u578b Jahn-Teller \u6a21\u578b\uff08bilayer type-II t-J model\uff09\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5c42\u72b6\u954d\u9178\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u53cc\u91cd\u4ea4\u6362\u6027 ferromagnetism \u548c\u5c42\u5185\u8d85\u4ea4\u6362\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5468\u671f 4 \u7684\u6761\u7eb9\u72b6 SDW \u6709\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6709\u5e8f\u6001\u5728\u5355\u5c42 t-J \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5c42\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u78c1\u6027\u6709\u5e8f\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u5c42\u95f4\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53 s-\u6ce2\u8d85\u5bfc\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5c42\u72b6 II \u578b Jahn-Teller \u6a21\u578b\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c42\u72b6\u954d\u9178\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u78c1\u6027\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63ed\u793a\u5c42\u72b6\u8d85\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Among available microcomb generation methods, hybrid cavities uniquely co-locate gain and Kerr dynamics, where the lasing mode directly resonates in the nonlinear microcavity, simultaneously enabling self-sustained and highly efficient microcomb generation. However, their implementation is often limited by partial integration or the need for external injection, which complicates operation architecture, raises power and hampers system miniaturization. In this work, we present a fully integrated hybrid cavity for self-sustained microcomb generation, relying solely on the co-oscillation of lasing and Kerr nonlinearity without external driving. The system collapses the pump laser, nonlinear resonator and feedback loops into a minimalist on-chip two-element cavity, consisting of a high-Q microresonator with engineered intracavity reflection and a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA).

The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory.

The fundamentally different working principle as compared to electronics requires novel approaches and concepts to control the impedance of nanoscale fluidic circuit elements, such as nanopores. For instance, previous research has focused on voltage-induced pore wetting as a means to trigger conduction in nanopores. The present study explores the opposite counter-intuitive mechanism: using voltage to dry hydrophobic nanopores and, therefore, to turn off conduction. This \"electrodrying\" concept affords exquisite, bidirectional control over the conductance of nanopores additionally showing hysteresis in the current-voltage curve that is the fingerprint of memristors. Using an analytical model and free-energy molecular dynamics simulations, we explain the physical mechanism underlying electrodrying and provide clear design criteria for solid-state and biological nanopores with bidirectional control over conductance. The electrical behaviour of electrodrying nanopores shows two unique features: i) the hysteresis loop is shifted from the origin, accounting for the fifth, previously unreported memristor type and ii) negative differential resistance is observed over a broad voltage range in which the non-conductive state is favoured by electrodrying. These properties are demonstrated in a short-term memory task and in an iontronic oscillator circuit to showcase their potential in neuromorphic applications and iontronic devices. Finally, we validate our predictions through experiments on engineered dipolar hydrophobic CytK nanopores, whose voltage-dependent conductance substantiates the electrodrying concept.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a novel 'electrodrying' mechanism for controlling nanopores in iontronic devices, enabling bidirectional conductance regulation and memristor-like behavior, with experiments validating the concept.", "motivation": "The growing need for advanced iontronic devices inspired by biological systems, such as neuromorphic devices, has driven research into alternative ways to control nanopores at the micro and nanoscale level.

We discuss two different scenarios, based on distinct truncations of the effective action. In the first scenario, the Bose glass is destabilized at any finite temperature, giving rise to a normal fluid. Nevertheless, one can distinguish a low-temperature glassy regime, where disorder plays an important role on intermediate length and time scales, from a high-temperature regime, where disorder becomes irrelevant. In the second scenario, below a temperature $T_c$, the RG flow exhibits a singularity at a finite value of the RG momentum scale. We propose that this singularity signals a lack of thermalization and the existence of a localized phase for $T<T_c$. We provide a description of this low-temperature localized phase within a droplet picture and highlight a number of possible similarities with characteristics of many-body localized phases, including non-thermal behavior, avalanche instabilities and many-body resonances, the structure of the many-body spectrum, and slow dynamics in the ergodic phase.

We represent the equations of motion in a curvature form that interprets rigid-body motion as the interaction of inertial and external curvature fields. This unified viewpoint recovers classical integrable cases (Lagrange, Kovalevskaya, Goryachev-Chaplygin) from a single geometric mechanism and clarifies their geodesic prototypes on SU(2). The central new result is the identification and geometric explanation of a pure-precession family in the inertia ratio (2,2,1), obtained from a curvature-balanced geodesic regime with the same inertia ratio. The corresponding pure-precession regime for the (2,2,1) heavy top was first identified in previous work; here we place it into a curvature-based atlas and interpret it as a balance between inertial and external curvature fields. We also exhibit a schematic curvature diagram organizing the main dynamical regimes.

The rotors are supported by a ball bearing and by a cylindrical journal bearing. The differential heating generated in the journal bearing is responsible for the thermal unbalance. The results obtained with the short rotor at 7 krpm showed an increase in the synchronous amplitudes but slight phase changes before stabilization. The pronounced hysteresis of the synchronous amplitudes obtained during coast-down proved that the amplitude increase is due to the thermal unbalance. The results obtained for the long rotor at 6.6 krpm showed the same stabilized response when start-up was performed in 180___s. However, an instability leading to journal bearing contact was triggered when the start-up time was decreased to 80___s.

The underlying cytoskeletal network presents a complex landscape that both directs particle movement and introduces quenched disorder through filament organization. We investigate the mean first encounter times for pairs of intermittently processive and diffusive particles, moving in two dimensions with and without a fixed filament network. In unstructured domains, increasing particle run-length enhances exploration of the domain, but tends to slow down the encounter times compared to equivalent diffusing particles. Encounters for long-running particles occur preferentially near the periphery, contrasting with bulk encounters for the purely diffusive case. When particles are unbiased in their runs along dense filament networks, encounters are shown to be well approximated by a continuum run-and-tumble model. For biased particles, regions of convergent filament orientation can serve as traps that slow the overall spatial exploration but can allow for faster encounter rates by funneling particles into regions of reduced dimensionality.

When such embeddings are not possible, the standard geometric intuition becomes inapplicable. In this work, we generalize the embedding procedure to slices with arbitrary polar angles $\u03b8\\neq \u03c0/2$, thereby extending the visualization and analysis of spacetimes beyond the reach of traditional methods.\n  The formalism is applied to Schwarzschild-like wormholes and to a generalized Minkowski spacetime with angular deficit or excess, which are particularly relevant since their equatorial slices cannot be consistently embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.

This study examines the scientific literature indexed in Scopus from 1983 to 2023. It reveals a striking increase in output since 2011, with nearly one hundred publications in the most recent year under review. This growth of interest has occurred in parallel with the global expansion of photovoltaics. The majority of studies in this field are classified as engineering, with 34% of publications in this area. The USA leads the way with over 160 publications, followed by China with 125. Two institutions in the USA are particularly prominent in this field: Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico with 22 publications, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado with 16 publications. The second institution is the University of Science and Technology of China, which has published 17 articles on the subject. A close examination of the evolution of keywords reveals a remarkable transformation in the scientific landscape over the past 10 years, from 2013 to 2023. The evolution of keywords suggests a maturation in the understanding of fire risks associated with photovoltaic energy. A total of seven scientific communities have been identified in which these works are grouped according to their keywords.

In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, we find that these nodal lines become gapped by finite magnetization, concentrating the Berry curvature near the gap and generating a distinctive AHE.

The condition for the radial pressure of type 1 requires the existence of a thin shell that will balance the pressure discontinuity while for type 2, the discontinuity on transverse pressure does not require the additional thin shell. It is found that the Buchdahl inequality of the resulting stellar configurations depends on the parameter related to the graviton condensate, such that we can find the ultra-compact regime of the stellar models. Moreover, the echo time and echo frequency within the ultra-compact regime are computed.

There is a significant research interest in controlling and enhancing the photonic SHE. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the microwave field control of the photonic SHE in a closed-loop $\u039b$-type atomic system. We demonstrate that both the magnitude and angular position of the photonic SHE can be controlled by varying the relative phase $\u03c6$ between the driving optical fields and the strength of the microwave coupling $\u03a9_\u03bc$. At zero probe field detuning ($\u0394_p = 0$) and $\u03c6=0,\u03c0$, the photonic SHE magnitude reaches to upper limit equal to the half of the incident beam waist, and remains largely unaffected by the microwave strength $\u03a9_\u03bc$, but its angular position shifts linearly with increasing $\u03a9_\u03bc$. At intermediate phases, especially at $\u03c6= \u03c0/2$, the magnitude of the photonic SHE exponentially decreases with the increase of $\u03a9_\u03bc$. Interestingly, we observed microwave-controlled switching of photonic SHE by tuning the relative phase $\u03c6$ at an optimized value of $\u03a9_\u03bc$ and $\u03a9_{c}$.

As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order.

The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--K\u00f6nig theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \\mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\u03c0/(4N)})$ in the logical $\\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u5c42\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u4fdd\u62a4\u95e8\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u4e8e\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u56f4\u680f\u7684\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u56f4\u680f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u5230Bravyi-K\u00f6nig\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u5b9a\u7406\u8868\u660e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u53ea\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u5c42\u7801\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u62d3\u6251\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u53cc\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6784\u9020\u6027\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u95e8\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u62d3\u6251\u6001\u548c\u7fa42-\u4e0a\u540c\u8c03\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u56f4\u680f\u7684\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5c42\u6b21\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u5c42\u7801\u548c\u7fa42-\u4e0a\u540c\u8c03\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4ec5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u5c42\u6b21\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u95e8\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u901a\u8fc7\u5de7\u5999\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u6216\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u95e8\u7535\u8def\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of the dynamics, thermodynamics, and collective excitations of shell-shaped BECs, synthesizing two decades of our group's theoretical work in light of recent experimental breakthroughs. We begin by analyzing the evolution of a BEC from filled-sphere to hollow-shell geometries, illustrating the necessity of microgravity conditions to avoid gravitational sag. We then analyze collective modes structure across this evolution and pinpoint a universal dip in the frequency spectra as well as mode reconfiguration due to inner-surface excitations as robust signatures of the hollowing-out transition. Turning to vortex physics, we show that the closed-surface topology enforces vortex-antivortex configurations in shell-shaped BECs and that the natural annihilation of these pairs can be stabilized by rotation, with the critical rotation rate depending on shell thickness. In the thermodynamic domain, we investigate the interplay between shell inflation and the BEC phase transition, where adiabatic expansions lead to condensate depletion. This behavior motivates a study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of shell-shaped BECs; we perform such a study by constructing a time-dependent dynamic technique that can capture the evolution in both adiabatice and non-adiabatic regimes.

A seemingly contradictory view is that control mechanisms have been optimized to squeeze as much information as possible out of a limited number of molecules. Here we revisit these issues in a simple model where a single transcription factor (TF) controls a large number of target genes. We include only the physically required noise sources: random arrival of TFs at their targets and counting noise in the synthesis and degradation of mRNA. If the cell has a limited total number of mRNA molecules, then the capacity to transmit information about TF concentration is maximized when these resources are distributed across the largest possible number of target genes. To realize this capacity the distribution of TF concentrations must be biased toward smaller values. Thus, in some limits, information transmission is optimized when individual expression levels are noisy. In addition, the dependence of information transmission on the parameters of this multi-gene system has a \"sloppy\" spectrum, so that optimal performance can co-exist with substantial variability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

There is in this connection a widespread need for new ways to probe the electronic properties of these layered materials, since their two-dimensional (2D) character make conventional probes less efficient. Here, we show how excitons trapped in a moir\u00e9 lattice can be used as an optical probe for spatially resolved electron spin density correlations in such materials. The electrons in the material of interest virtually tunnel to the moir\u00e9 lattice where they scatter on the excitons after which they tunnel back. This gives rise to an effective spin-dependent and spatially localised potential felt by the electrons, which in turn leads to energy shifts that can be measured spectroscopically in the exciton spectrum. Using second order perturbation theory combined with a solution to the exciton-electron scattering problem, we show that the electrons mediate an interaction between two excitons resulting in an energy shift proportional to their two-point spin density-density correlation function evaluated at the exciton positions. We then discuss two specific applications of our setup. First, we show that quantum phase transitions between different in-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders in a 2D lattice give rise to large and measurable shifts in the exciton spectrum in the critical regions. Second, we analyse how different pairing symmetries of superconducting phases can be probed. This demonstrates that our scheme opens up new ways to probe electron spin density correlations, which is a key property of many quantum phases predicted to exist in the new 2D materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "Indentifying electron spin density correlations in 2D van der Waals materials using excitons in moir\u00e9 lattices.", "motivation": "Understanding the electronic properties of 2D materials has become increasingly important due to their tunable nature and applications in emerging technologies.

We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes.

Therefore, the experimental setup provides a good simulator of the sine-Gordon quantum field theory, even out of equilibrium, if the inhomogeneous background induced by the trap is taken into account.

While existing deep learning methods can provide an accurate quantitative estimation of the T2 parameter, they still require large amounts of training data and lack theoretical support and a recognized gold standard. Thus, given the absence of PINN-based approaches for T2 estimation, we propose embedding the fundamental physics of MRI, the Bloch equation, in the loss of PINN, which is solely based on target scan data and does not require a pre-defined training database. Furthermore, by deriving rigorous upper bounds for both the T2 estimation error and the generalization error of the Bloch equation solution, we establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the PINN's quantitative accuracy. Even without access to the ground truth or a gold standard, this theory enables us to estimate the error with respect to the real quantitative parameter T2. The accuracy of T2 mapping and the validity of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated on a numerical cardiac model and a water phantom, where our method exhibits excellent quantitative precision in the myocardial T2 range. Clinical applicability is confirmed in 94 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, achieving low-error quantitative T2 estimation under the theoretical error bound, highlighting the robustness and potential of PINN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1MRI\u4e2d\u7684T2\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1T2\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002PINN\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Bloch\u65b9\u7a0b\u5d4c\u5165\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfcT2\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3aPINN\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u5728\u6570\u503c\u5fc3\u810f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6c34 phantoms \u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u3002\u572894\u4f8b\u6025\u6027\u5fc3\u808c\u6897\u6b7b\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bef\u5dee\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5b9a\u91cfT2\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8T2\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff08Bloch\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u7a0b\u5d4c\u5165\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u662f\u76ee\u6807\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86T2\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u503c\u5fc3\u810f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 myocardial T2 \u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u6c34 phantom \u4e0a\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u6837\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572894\u4f8b\u6025\u6027\u5fc3\u808c\u6897\u6b7b\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u5b9a\u91cf T2 \u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bef\u5dee\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aT2\u5b9a\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The results reveal that OAM-specific angular correlations can survive multiple scattering and be decoded through angular-domain learning.

Key features of gravitational path integrals--most notably Euclidean wormholes and the associated failure of factorization--lack a clear interpretation in the standard large-$N$ framework. A related challenge is the possibility of erratic $N$-dependence in CFT observables, behavior with no evident semiclassical gravitational counterpart.\n  We argue that these puzzles point to a missing ingredient in the dictionary: a large-$N$ filter. This filter projects out the erratic $N$-dependence of CFT quantities when mapping them to semiclassical bulk physics, providing an intrinsic boundary definition of gravitational \"averages.\" It also offers a boundary explanation of wormhole contributions and a boundary prediction of their amplitudes, thereby giving a natural resolution of the factorization puzzle. In addition, we derive an infinite tower of inequalities constraining wormhole amplitudes and argue that internal wormholes do not induce random couplings in the low-energy effective theory.\n  Beyond resolving factorization, the large-$N$ filter supplies a generalized framework from which richer Lorentzian spacetime structures can emerge, including closed universes and black hole interiors. We argue that, as a consequence of erratic large-$N$ behavior, both closed universes and black hole interiors are quantum volatile, and that an AdS spacetime entangled with a baby universe is likewise quantum volatile. This volatility may allow an observer in AdS to infer the existence of the baby universe, whereas for an infalling observer, the ability to make measurements near a black hole horizon may become fundamentally limited--even if they may not live long enough to notice.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper points out incomplete aspects of the large-N holographic dictionary and its relation to gravitational path integrals, particularly the role of Euclidean wormholes and factorization issues.

These development processes involve numerous molecules distributed at the subcellular scale, such as cell adhesion (E-cadherin), which accumulate at cell-cell interfaces to regulate intercellular connection. However, quantifying molecular distributions within specific subcellular regions across the entire embryo, where cell movement and molecular redistribution occur rapidly, is challenging due to the need for simultaneous cell morphology reconstruction and lineage tracing due to photobleaching and phototoxicity. We report a transformer-based pipeline, CTransformer, that establishes a 4D cellular morphology map before the 550-cell (late) stage. CTransformer constructed 4D cellular morphology atlases, reaching 80% accuracy at the 550-cell stage. Through this advanced architecture, we use only one channel to reconstruct cell morphology and achieve cell tracing. With each cell's morphology as a reference, the distribution of specific molecules throughout the cell body and at cell interfaces can be quantitatively measured in another fluorescence channel. We apply this methodology to track E-cadherin during embryonic development of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, from fertilization to gastrulation. Our results reveal that E-cadherin is tightly regulated across individual embryos, both within single cells and at cell-cell interfaces, displaying an anterior-posterior gradient and cell- and lineage-specific patterns. Furthermore, its spatiotemporal heterogeneity influences cell mechanics and embryonic morphogenesis, helping explain how C. elegans achieves stereotypical developmental patterns at cellular resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8367\u5149\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u80da\u80ce\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u80b2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7CTransformer\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e864D\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e86\u57c3\u67f4 nutritional Boson\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5149\u6f02\u767d\u548c\u5149\u6bd2\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ec6\u80de\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d1\u80b2\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u7684\u98de\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ec6\u80de\u95f4\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7ec6\u80de\u95f4\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0cCTransformer\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8367\u5149\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\uff08550 \u4e2a\u7ec6\u80de\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff094D \u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u5efa\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4ed6\u8367\u5149\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u80de\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53ca\u5206\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0cE-cadherin \u5728 C. elegans \u53d1\u80b2\u65e9\u671f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u5177\u6709\u4e2a\u4f53\u68af\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5176\u5206\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u7ec6\u80de\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e9a\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u521b\u6027\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8367\u5149\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5176\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u57c3\u67f4 nutritional Boson\u53d1\u80b2\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb OPTIONS \u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

We propose a hybrid acousto-optical spin control method that circumvents this problem and effectively introduces acoustic spin rotation to QDs, complementing their rich couplings with external fields and quantum registers. We show that combining continuous-wave detuned optical coupling to a trion state and acoustic modulation results in spin rotation around an axis defined by the acoustic field. The optical field breaks spin conservation, allowing phonons to drive transitions between disrupted spin states when at resonance with the Zeeman frequency. Our method is compatible with pulse sequences that mitigate quasi-static noise effects, which makes trion recombination the primary limitation to gate fidelity under cooled nuclear-spin conditions. Numerical simulations indicate that spin rotation fidelity can be very high, if the trion lifetime is long and Zeeman splitting is sufficiently large, with a currently feasible 50~ns lifetime and 44~GHz splitting giving 99.9\\% fidelity.

However, such control is typically limited to magnetization transverse to light's polarization plane, or out-of-plane magnetism in 2D materials, while in-plane magnetic moments have remained largely unexplored. This is due to the difficulty of generating electronic orbital angular momentum components within light's polarization plane. Here we overcome this limitation, demonstrating complete three-dimensional, all-optical control of magnetism in 2D materials. Using first-principles simulations, we show that a tailored, two-color laser field can induce and steer magnetic moments in any direction with the relative angle between the laser polarizations playing a key parameter in coherent control. We analyze the physical mechanism of this process and show that it arises from a simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries in the two-color laser. In-plane orbital moments are introduced via non-zero out-of-plane longitudinal photogalvanic currents enabled by broken inversion and mirror symmetries, while time-reversal symmetry breaking enables build-up of spin-rotation processes through spin-orbit coupling, translating the orbital moments to transient magnetism. Our findings demonstrate a full 3D coherent control scheme for transient magnetic states on femtosecond timescales driven by tailored lasers, and can be used to develop novel spectroscopies for magnetism, all-optical magnetic switching for ultrafast spintronics, and novel information storage capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7 tailor-made \u4e8c\u7ef4\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u5728\u5149\u6781\u5316\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u6027\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u7684\u5168\u5149\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u64cd\u63a7\u78c1\u6027\u5728\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9006\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u8d85\u5feb\u53bb\u78c1\u5316\u6280\u672f\u53ea\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u78c1\u6027\u5782\u76f4\u4e8e\u5149\u6781\u5316\u5e73\u9762\u6216\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5916\u6cd5\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u78c1\u6027\u5728\u590d\u6742\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5149\u6781\u5316\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8272\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u6027\u4efb\u610f\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0e\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u6fc0\u5149\u5149\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5939\u89d2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53cd\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7834\u574f\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u63a7\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6253\u7834\u7a7a\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u3001\u5e73\u9762\u53cd\u8f6c\u7b49\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5e73\u9762\u8f68\u9053\u78c1\u77e9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8f68\u9053\u77e9\u80fd\u88ab\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u77ac\u6001\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u3002", "result": " authors presented a \u5b8c\u5168\u4e09\u7ef4\u7684\u5168\u5149\u5bf9\u78c1\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u78c1\u77e9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5171\u7ebf\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u8272\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u7834\u574f\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53cd\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86inersense \u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u77ac\u6001\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u63a7\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6253\u78343D\u7a7a\u95f4\u53cd\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u78c1\u6027\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0e\u8c03\u63a7\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u6b21\u6027\u539f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u78c1\u6027\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u5149\u573a\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7 tailor-made \u7684\u591a\u5149\u675f\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4cale \u7684\u78c1\u6027\u64cd\u63a7\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u4e3a\u64cd\u63a7\u78c1\u6027\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 Active Spin Transfer (AST)\u3001Optical Spin Paramagnetic Resonance (OSPR) \u7b49\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u78c1\u6027\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a future \u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914.

In a first step we use the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which takes into account purely local correlations, to calculate the magnetic susceptibilities of the Hubbard model on three (3d-sc) and four dimensional (4d-sc) simple cubic/hypercubic, as well as on three dimensional body- (bcc) and face-centered (fcc) cubic lattices, and determine the transition temperature to the corresponding magnetically-ordered state. In a second step, we exploit the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\u0393$A), a diagrammatic extension of DMFT, to include the effect of nonlocal correlations which are particularly important in the vicinity of the corresponding phase transition. For the bipartite 3d-sc, 4d-sc and bcc lattices nonlocal fluctuations lead to a substantial reduction of the DMFT transition temperature consistent to the overall tendency of mean-field approaches to overestimate the stability of ordered phases. As expected, the magnitude of the difference between the DMFT, being exact in the limit of large connectivity/dimensions, and D$\u0393$A transition temperatures decreases with increasing coordination number. On a more practical perspective, these results also provide a reasonable guidance to evaluate the expected overestimation of the DMFT ordering temperature for different material geometries.

We develop a detailed model of the satellite-to-ground channel that accounts for the primary physical processes affecting transmittance: atmospheric absorption and scattering, free-space diffraction, and turbulence-induced fluctuations. The study introduces a general method for computing transmittance along a slant path between a satellite and an optical ground station, incorporating zenith angle, slant range, and altitude-dependent attenuation. The proposed framework is intended to support the design and evaluation of space-based optical links and serves as a critical tool for defining technical specifications in satellite communication demonstrators and simulations. Numerical estimates are provided to illustrate the magnitude of losses under typical operational conditions, including the role of aperture averaging. In addition to the link budget analysis, we introduce a satellite-based quantum use case.

Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise.

In a graphene p-n junction, a strain-induced nanobubble generates a pseudo-magnetic field that forms double quantum dots with gate-tunable level hybridization. Tight-binding quantum transport simulations and a four-band model reveal two distinct avoided crossings: spin-conserving gaps at zero detuning and spin-flip gaps at finite detuning, the latter increasing with SOC strength while the former decreases. Time-domain simulations confirm detuning-dependent Rabi oscillations corresponding to these two operational regimes.

While such dielectric material has an extremely low second order nonlinear susceptibility, we observe 105-fold boosting in the nonlinear SHG process mainly due to the surface nonlinear susceptibility of the gold metal aided by the significant electric field enhancement that occurs in the nanogaps due to the formed nanocavity resonance.

However, its application in qubit control is limited by residual intensity crosstalk at neighboring sites and by a nonzero background floor in the far wings of the addressing beam, leading to accumulated errors from many exposed qubits. Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\\,\\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit.

In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $\u03c0$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces.

However, if the Backlink shows asymmetry between the two propagation directions, the effective optical pathlengths of the counter-propagating beams can introduce a differential phase noise, called non-reciprocity, into the main interferometric measurement that will limit the achievable accuracy in time-delay interferometry (TDI) post-processing. Hence, it is important to understand the properties of the Backlink to ensure that it will not compromise the interferometric detection. The Three-Backlink Experiment (3BL), which consists of an optical test facility with two rotatable benches, was designed under the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) framework to study the performance of three Backlink configurations: two fiber-based and one free-beam scheme. In this paper, we report recent experimental results from the 3BL. We describe the commissioning and the subsequent noise mitigation. We achieve a setup noise floor below $1\\text{ pm}\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ across most of the LISA measurement band, and provide an understanding of the current technical limitations. With this low-noise baseline, we measured the performance of the three Backlink implementations under non-rotational conditions. We show that all three Backlinks reach sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels across most of the frequency band, with the remaining part dominated by the mentioned testbed noise.

They admit extra parameters beyond mass, charge, and angular momentum, leading to a richer phenomenology. Characterizing their allowed parameter space is therefore crucial, especially in light of the available data from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations. The rotating hairy black hole solutions studied here are inspired by the gravitational decoupling method and satisfy the Einstein field equations with a conserved energy-momentum tensor that respects the strong energy conditions (SECs). We explore in detail the horizon structure of such black holes and report for the first time certain unique features, not observed in Kerr BHs. We investigate the sensitivity of the hairy parameters on the fundamental frequencies associated with the motion of matter in the hairy Kerr spacetime, and compare them with the Kerr scenario. The theoretical models aimed to explain the observed high-frequency observations (HFQPOs) in BHs are associated with the fundamental frequencies. Hence, such a study enables us to constrain the parameter space of the hairy Kerr spacetime by comparing the model-dependent HFQPO frequencies with the available observations. By comparing the kinematic models of HFQPOs with the observations of six BH sources, we report the most favored parameter space for each of these BHs. Our analysis also provides a framework to discern the most suitable model for each of these sources.

Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c0f\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u524d\u4e86\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u56f0\u6270\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53bb\u8026\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Thompson\u7fa4F\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684RL\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u754c\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u51cf\u5c0f\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u53bb\u8026\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u8109\u51b2\u8bef\u5dee\u6216\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u8026\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Our black brane solutions carry two kinds of gauge charges but still are exact, which extends the recent developments in classification of heterotic branes. The solutions offer a novel method to embed previously known noncritical 2-D or 3-D solutions to the critical dimensions. Furthermore, by performing a perturbative analysis of the non-Abelian gauge field on this exact background, we analytically find that as the temperature decreases, a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to a dynamical instability accompanied by gauge field condensation. This instability embodies a phase transition of black branes in heterotic supergravity, and analytically predicts the existence of unknown black hole solutions to be unveiled. Our results suggest that phase transition phenomena can be used to explore and analyze the phase structure of black hole solutions, for systematically discovering and classifying stringy black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u572810\u7ef4\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u65b0\u89e3\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86Heterotic\u5f26\u819c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u81ea\u53d1\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u610f\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b0\u578b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8610\u7ef4\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u6cd5\u548c\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6e29\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u7f3a\uff0c\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u51dd\u805a\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These mathematical constructions provide the essential tools for general relativity, in which the curvature of spacetime;described by the Einstein field equations;is most elegantly formulated using the Cartan calculus of differential forms. Another important subject in this discussion is the notion of conformal geometry, where the relevant invariants of a metric are characterized by Elie Cartan's normal conformal connection. The previous analysis is then used to develop the null surface formulation (NSF) of general relativity, a radical framework that postulates the structure of light cones rather than the metric itself as the fundamental gravitational variable.

Boller"], "title": "Blue-shifted dispersive waves and broadband UV emission using dual-core SiN waveguides", "comment": null, "summary": "We show that using strongly coupled dual-core waveguides for supercontinuum generation shifts the wavelength of the high-frequency dispersive waves towards shorter wavelengths, as compared to generation in a single-core waveguide having the same core dimensions. In a demonstration experiment, we launch ultrashort infrared pump pulses at 1-$\u03bc$m wavelength (285-THz frequency) into silicon nitride waveguides, where soliton formation and fission leads to generation of dispersive waves in the visible range. Efficient input coupling and controlled excitation of the fundamental supermodes of the dual-core waveguide is provided with adiabatic tapers and a dual-prong input structure. For the dual-core waveguide, the short-wavelength dispersive wave is located at 540~nm (green, 555~THz), which is blue-shifted by 80~nm (70~THz) compared to that of the single-core waveguide. Simultaneously, the dual-core waveguide generates broadband radiation spanning from the blue into the UV range, reaching to below 350~nm (above 855~THz), with typically a spectral density 25~dB below that of the dispersive wave.

This framework encompasses several families of quantum codes, including stabilizer and subsystem codes, provides a natural extension of generalized distances in quantum codes, and yields new invariants that capture local algebraic and combinatorial features. The notion of anticodes also naturally leads to operations such as puncturing and shortening for symplectic codes, which in turn provide algebraic interpretations of key phenomena in quantum error correction, such as the cleaning lemma and complementary recovery and yield new descriptions of weight enumerators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Specifically, we study a scalar field in an asymmetric double well potential during inflation, coupled to environmental degrees of freedom provided either by heavy spectator fields or by short-wavelength modes as they cross out the Hubble scale. This setup enables a systematic derivation of both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations, along with their stochastic unravelings, which we solve numerically. We find that, while decoherence is essential for suppressing quantum interference between vacua, its impact on the relative vacuum populations is limited. Fields heavier than the Hubble scale relax adiabatically toward the true vacuum with high probability, while lighter fields exhibit non-adiabatic enhancements of false-vacuum occupation. Once the system has decohered, quantum tunneling between vacua becomes strongly suppressed, effectively locking the system into the stochastically selected local minimum.

In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u5e8f\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u904d\u5386\u6027\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u957f\u7a0b\u8df3\u8dc3\u9879Hn\uff0c bridging \u5384\u7c73\u548c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u9699\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u3001Krylov\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Hn\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4ece\u53ef\u79ef\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6df7\u6c8c\u540e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u975e\u70ed\u5316\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6001(nonthermal eigenstates)\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5f3a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u957f\u7a0b\u8df3\u8dc3\u548c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u9879\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u91cf\u5b50\u904d\u5386\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ef4\u6301\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u904d\u5386\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u6709\u5e8f\u5230\u65e0\u5e8f\u8f6c\u53d8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u73b0\u8c61\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u501f\u52a9\u957f\u7a0b\u8df3\u8dc3\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u5e8f\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u904d\u5386\u6027\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4spin\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u957f\u7a0b\u8df3\u8dc3\u9879\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u80fd\u9699\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u3001Krylov\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5384\u7c73\u548c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u70ed\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002", "result": "1) \u7531\u957f\u7a0b\u8df3\u8dc3\u9879Hn\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\uff1a\u5384\u7c73\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u4ecePoissonian\u5230Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5f15\u53d1\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u30022) \u53d1\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u540e\u9057\u75c7\uff1a\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u975e\u70ed\u5316\u6001\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5f3a\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u30023) \u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u957f\u7a0b\u8df3\u8dc3\u548c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u9879\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u91cd\u5851\u91cf\u5b50\u904d\u5386\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u6301\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u957f\u7a0b\u8df3\u8dc3\u9879Hn\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u5e8f\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u904d\u5386\u6027\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Hn\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53 after states\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Depending on the symmetry and dimensionality of the bulk systems, different edge states emulating soliton, quantum integer and quantum spin Hall effects have been realized. A major concern in photonics is how one can shape the strength and polarisation of electromagnetic fields to suit different applications. Here, we show zero-dimensional (0D) interface state arising from one-dimensional (1D) dissipative topological photonic crystals exhibit strong field localisation and spin-momentum locking thanks to its complex classical analogue Dirac mass parameter. By using spatiotemporal coupled mode theory to formulate 1D photonic crystals and their corresponding Jackiw Rebbi-like (JR) interface state, we find the interaction between two energy bands at high symmetry points plays a major role in defining not only the topological triviality of the crystals but also its complex Dirac mass parameter. More importantly, when two topological trivial and nontrivial bulk systems are brought together to form a JR state, while the real part of the Dirac mass parameter governs the spectral and spatial field localisations of the interface state, the imaginary part gives rise to a net flow of energy towards the interface and a transverse spin angular momentum, resulting in a strong spin-momentum locking. We verify our theory by 1D plasmonic crystals using finite-difference time-domain simulations as well as far-field angle-resolved spectroscopy and imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ef4\u8017\u6563\u62d3\u6251\u5149\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u754c\u9762\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u573a\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u65cb-\u52a8\u91cf\u9501\u5b9a\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u7406\u8bba\u548cJackiw Rebbi\u7c7b\u754c\u9762\u6001\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u5e26\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u79f0\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u6676\u4f53\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u72b6\u548c\u754c\u9762\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6781\u5316\u6765\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u901a\u8fc70D\u754c\u9762\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e861\u7ef4\u5149\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u548cJackiw Rebbi\u7c7b\u754c\u9762\u6001\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u91cf\u5e26\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u79f0\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u65f6\u57df\u6cd5\u548c\u8fdc\u573a\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u754c\u9762\u6001\u7684\u5f3a\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u65cb-\u52a8\u91cf\u9501\u5b9a\u662f\u7531\u5b9e\u90e8\u7684Dirac\u52bf\u53c2\u6570\u63a7\u5236\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u865a\u90e8\u52bf\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u5411\u754c\u9762\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u6a2a\u5411\u81ea\u65cb\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u5149\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Magic state cultivation offers an efficient alternative to resource-intensive distillation protocols; however, testing the proposal's assumptions represents a challenging departure from quantum memory experiments. We present an experimental study of magic state cultivation on a superconducting quantum processor.

Using both the worldline effective field theory for extended gravitating bodies and second-order perturbations of relativistic stellar models, we derive the nonlinear tidal deformation induced by an external gravito-electric tidal field to quadratic order. Through a suitable matching procedure, we provide for the first time the leading nonlinear tidal corrections to the conservative dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of binary systems. Quadratic Love numbers are enhanced more than the linear ones in the small-compactness limit. Because of this, despite entering the gravitational-wave phase at 8th post-Newtonian (PN) order, the leading quadratic Love number can be as important as the next-to-next-to-leading order linear tidal correction, which enters at 7th PN order, and is larger than the subleading point-particle contribution entering at 4th PN order. In particular, quadratic Love numbers can be as large as ~10% of the linear Love numbers in the late inspiral phase.

This description is equivalent to assuming that the effective positive-operator-valued measurement (POVM) is diagonal in the measurement basis, and therefore completely insensitive to quantum coherences. We relax this assumption and derive a fully general expression for the observed measurement probabilities under arbitrary completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) noise preceding a computational-basis measurement. Writing the ideal post-circuit stat $\\tilde\u03c1$ in terms of its populations $x$ and coherences $y$, we show that the observed probability vector $z$ satisfies $z = A x + C y$, where $A$ is the familiar classical assignment matrix and $C$ is a coherence-response matrix constructed from the off-diagonal matrix elements of the effective POVM in the computational basis. The classical model $z = A x$ arises if and only if all POVM elements are diagonal; in this sense $C$ quantifies accessible information about coherent readout distortions and interference between computational-basis states, all of which are invisible to models that retain only $A$.

Frolov"], "title": "Quasitopological gravity and double-copy formalism", "comment": "8 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "We propose a new approach to the quasitopological theory of gravity based on a modified classical double--copy construction. Focusing on static, spherically symmetric configurations, we show that all vacuum solutions of $D$--dimensional quasitopological gravity can be obtained from an auxiliary non--linear electrodynamics defined in a flat $(D+1)$--dimensional spacetime. The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7ecf\u5178\u53cc\u590d\u5236\u6784\u9020\u7684\u51c6\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u529b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5728(D+1)\u7ef4\u5e73\u5766\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f85\u52a9\u573a\u83b7\u5f97\u6240\u6709D\u7ef4\u51c6\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u529b\u771f\u7a7a\u89e3\u3002\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u7535\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7531\u70b9\u8377\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7ea6\u675f\u652f\u914d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f7f\u66f4\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bfc\u6570\u9879\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Born-Infeld\u548cHayward\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7c7bde~Sitter\u6838\u5fc3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u53cc\u590d\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u91cd\u529b\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e00\u7c7b\u8f83\u5e7f\u7684\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u53cc\u590d\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u91cd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7ecf\u5178\u53cc\u590d\u5236\u6784\u9020\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728(D+1)\u7ef4\u5e73\u5766\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97D\u7ef4\u51c6\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u529b\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7Born-Infeld\u548cHayward\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7c7bde~Sitter\u6838\u5fc3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53cc\u590d\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u91cd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e00\u7c7b\u8f83\u5e7f\u7684\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Here, we propose a low-depth quantum neural network architecture with linear scaling, inspired by memory-enabled photonic components, for variational entanglement engineering. The network incorporates physically motivated non-linear activation functions, enhancing expressivity beyond linear variational circuits at fixed depth. By Monte Carlo sampling over circuit topologies, we identify architectures that efficiently generate highly entangled pure states, approaching the GHz limit, and demonstrate a clear advantage of non-linear networks up to 20 qubits. For the noisy scenario, we employ the experimentally accessible Meyer-Wallach global entanglement as a surrogate optimization cost and certify entanglement using bipartite negativity. For mixed states of up to ten qubits, the optimized circuits generate substantial entanglement across both symmetric and asymmetric bipartitions. These results establish an experimentally motivated and scalable variational framework for engineering multipartite entanglement on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the combined role of non-linearity and circuit topology.", "AI": {"tldr":

By using a specific crossed module a set of transformations arise, which are known as the \"thin\" and \"fat\" transformations. The \"fat\" transformations are the ones introduced by hand to construct the S-dual theory. By utilizing crossed modules and higher gauge theory, we arrive at transformations referred to by some as \"third-type transformations\", giving these transformations a geometric interpretation, as transformations of a local 2-connection in a 2-principal bundle.

The recent observation of multiple quasinormal modes (QNMs) in GW250114 marks a major advance for observational black hole spectroscopy. This clear signal, together with the growing number of GW detections, highlights the need for accurate predictions of QNM spectra in beyond-GR theories in order to carry out precision searches for new physics. In this work, we continue to lay the foundation for such predictions using a modified Teukolsky formalism in conjunction with the eigenvalue perturbation method. We compute the spectral shifts of slowly rotating Johannsen-Psaltis black holes for $2 \\leq \\ell \\leq 10$, all $m$, and overtones $n = 0, 1, 2$, and confirm the large-$\\ell$ behavior of the modes by comparing with the WKB approximation. We find that these black holes admit definite-parity modes but break the isospectrality between even- and odd-parity QNMs at all spins, and that the shifts depend linearly on $m$ for slow spins. We further derive a general parity condition that any beyond-GR modification to the metric must satisfy to support definite-parity modes, providing new insights into isospectrality breaking and parity structure in gravitational perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although the nuclei in these systems naturally lead to electron spin decoherence, they can be repurposed, if they are controllable, as long-lived quantum memories. Prior work showed that a metric known as the one-tangling power can be used to quantify the entanglement dynamics of sparse systems of spin-1/2 nuclei coupled to color centers in diamond and SiC. Here, we generalize these findings to a wide range of electron-nuclear central-spin systems, including those with spin > 1/2 nuclei, such as in III-V quantum dots (QDs), rare-earth ions, and some color centers. Focusing on the example of an (In)GaAs QD, we offer a procedure for pinpointing physically realistic parameter regimes that yield maximal entanglement between the central electron and surrounding nuclei. We further harness knowledge of naturally-occurring degeneracies and the tunability of the system to generate maximal entanglement between target subsets of spins when the QD electron is subject to dynamical decoupling. We also leverage the one-tangling power as an exact and immediate method for computing QD electron spin dephasing times with and without the application of spin echo sequences, and use our analysis to identify coherence-sustaining conditions within the system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.

To overcome this barrier, this paper introduces an efficient Frozen Gaussian Sampling (FGS) algorithm based on the Wigner-Fokker-Planck phase-space formulation. The proposed algorithm exhibits two transformative advantages. First, for the computation of physical observables, its sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter $\\varepsilon$, thus fundamentally breaking the prohibitive computational scaling faced by grid methods in the semiclassical limit. Second, its mesh-free nature entirely eliminates the boundary-induced instabilities that constrain long-time grid-based simulations. Leveraging these capabilities, the FGS algorithm serves as a powerful investigatory tool for exploring the long-time behavior of open quantum systems. Specifically, we provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of steady states in strongly non-harmonic potentials-a regime where rigorous analytical results are currently lacking.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should strive for, not a descriptive \"law of nature.\" Second, all probabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they never tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum states thus have no \"ontic hold\" on the world, which implies a more radical kind of indeterminism in quantum theory than other interpretations understand. Third, quantum measurement outcomes just are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Thus all quantum measurement outcomes are local in the sense of the agent enacting them. Through these tenets, we explain four points better than previously: 1) how QBism contrasts with Bohr's concern over unambiguous language, 2) how QBism contrasts with the Everett interpretation, 3) how QBism understands the meaning of Bell inequality violations, and 4) how QBism responds to Wigner's \"suspended animation\" argument.

Typically, the theoretical modeling has been conducted in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, where results are only obtainable under certain approximations, while, in contrast, the Heisenberg picture has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we develop an accurately controlled perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture and derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to the emitter dynamics due to the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field, capturing effects of the quantum fluctuations present in the latter. We focus on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), where the approach is accurate in parameter regimes of current interest and it gives closed-form expressions for key observables. This formulation not only simplifies numerical calculations compared to the Schr\u00f6dinger-picture approach but also provides a clear correspondence between nonclassical features of the emitted light and the underlying induced dynamics of the generating medium including quantum fluctuations. Moreover, the Heisenberg framework naturally yields scaling relations with the number of independent emitters, enabling us to assess whether nonclassical behavior should persist under typical experimental conditions involving large emitter ensembles. Interestingly, we find that the degree of squeezing increases with the number of emitters, whereas the photon statistics approaches a classical Poissonian distribution in the many-emitter limit. We also find that the beyond-semiclassical emitter dynamics significantly enhances the degree of squeezing of the emitted light. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum-optical HHG and introduces an accessible and well-controlled framework to describe realistic experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": " papers introduce a new theoretical framework using the Heisenberg picture to study high-order harmonic generation, yielding new insights into nonclassical light emission and practical implications for experiments.", "motivation": " studying quantum-optical phenomena like high-order harmonic generation (HHG) is crucial for advancing ultrashort laser technology and understanding fundamental nonlinear processes in quantum mechanics.", "method": " developed a perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture to derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to emitter dynamics, particularly focusing on HHG.", "result": " the new framework shows improved accuracy in predicting key observables in parameter regimes relevant to current experiments, reveals how nonclassical light characteristics (e.g., squeezing) depend on the number of emitters, and provides scaling relations for nonclassical behavior in large ensembles of emitters.", "conclusion": " this work bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations in quantum optics, offering a powerful new tool for studying complex quantum phenomena such as HHG."}}

A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders.

The key novelty of this work lies in the proposed n--bit encoding routine, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first explicit and scalable recipe for constructing quantum circuits for n--bit Superdense Coding, minimizing errors through a simple circuit design. The protocol was tested on real quantum hardware using Qiskit 2.0 and the IBM--Torino quantum computer for message lengths of 4, 6, 8, and 10 bits. Results show that success rates decrease as message length, circuit depth, and gate count increase, largely due to increased Pauli--X gate usage for messages with more ``1\" bits.

We discover that the principal eigenvalue governing nonlocality is rigorously dictated by a low-dimensional manifold parameterized by merely two fundamental angular variables, $\u03b8$ and $\u03c6$, whose symmetry leads to further simplification. This geometric distillation establishes a precise mapping connecting external control parameters directly to optimal measurement configurations. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the geometric angles against the principal eigenvalue spectrum, including its magnitude, susceptibility, and nonlocal gap, reveals a fundamental dichotomy in quantum criticality. While transitions involving symmetry sector rotation manifest as geometric criticality with drastic operator reorientation, transitions dominated by strong anisotropy exhibit geometric locking, where the optimal basis remains robust despite clear signatures of phase transitions in the spectral indicators.

While the global quantum state remains coherent, the observer's local reality becomes singular and definite. This work introduces reality steering, a protocol that allows an observer to probabilistically access a different reality already supported by the initial quantum state, without reversing decoherence on the environment. The mechanism relies on locally erasing the 'which-outcome' information stored in the observer's brain. Here, 'local' means operations confined to the observer's memory, excluding the environment, which may be cosmically large. Reality steering nevertheless faces intrinsic constraints: successful navigation requires coherent participation from the observer's counterparts across the relevant branches, and any transition is operationally indistinguishable from non-transition. After arriving in a new reality, all memory records are perfectly consistent with that reality, leaving no internal evidence that a switch occurred.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Classical thermodynamics is a theory based on coarse-graining, meaning that the thermodynamic variables arise from discarding information related to the microscopic features of the system at hand. In quantum mechanics, however, where one has a high degree of control over microscopic systems, information theory plays an important role in describing the thermal properties of quantum systems. Recently, a new approach has been proposed in the form of a quantum thermodynamic gauge theory, where the notion of redundant information arises from a group of physically motivated gauge transformations called the thermodynamic group. In this work, we explore the geometrical structure of quantum thermodynamics. Particularly, we do so by explicitly constructing the relevant principal fibre bundle. We then show that there are two distinct (albeit related) geometric structures associated with the gauge theory of quantum thermodynamics. In this way, we express thermodynamics in the same mathematical (geometric) language as the fundamental theories of physics. Finally, we discuss how the geometric and topological properties of these structures may help explain fundamental properties of thermodynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7528\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7eb3\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b63\u5728\u5c06\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u89c4\u8303\u4e3b\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u89c4\u8303\u7fa4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7Norman 67 this\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7eb3\u5165\u73b0\u4ee3\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5316\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We ran a state preparation and energy measurement protocol on an ion-trap quantum computer, without any non-scalable off-loading of computational tasks to classical computers, and show that leakage errors are the main obstacle to chemical accuracy. More specifically, we apply adiabatic state preparation to prepare the ground state of a six-qubit encoding of the H3+ molecule and extract its energy using a noise-resilient variant of iterative quantum phase estimation. Our results improve upon the classical Hartree-Fock energy. Analyzing the effect of hardware noise on the result, we find that while coherent and incoherent noise have little influence, the hardware results are mainly impacted by leakage errors.

Two leading methods in solving the ground state problem are the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) algorithms. VQE often struggles with convergence due to the energy landscape being highly non-convex and the existence of barren plateaux, and implementing AQC is beyond the capabilities of current quantum devices as it requires deep circuits. Adiabatically-inspired algorithms aim to fill this gap. In this paper, we first present a unifying framework for these algorithms and then benchmark the following methods: the Adiabatically Assisted VQE (AAVQE) (Garcia-Saez and Latorre (2018)), the Variational Adiabatic Quantum Computing (VAQC) (Harwood et al (2022)), and the Adiabatic Quantum Computing with Parametrized Quantum Circuits (AQC-PQC) (Kolotouros et al (2025)) algorithms. Second, we introduce a novel hybrid approach termed G-AQC-PQC, which generalizes the AQC-PQC method, and combines adiabatic-inspired initialization with the low-memory BFGS optimizer, reducing the quantum computational cost of the method. Third, we compare the accuracy of the methods for chemistry applications using the beryllium hydride molecule (BeH$_2$). We compare the approaches across a number of different choices (ans\u00e4tze types, depth, discretization steps, initial Hamiltonian, adiabatic schedules and method used). Our results show that the G-AQC-PQC outperforms conventional VQE. We further discuss limitations such as the zero-gradient problem and identify regimes where adiabatically-inspired methods offer a tangible advantage for near-term quantum chemistry applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this system, strong dipole--dipole interactions profoundly modify the collective optical response, leading to the emergence of ultranarrow subradiant resonances. Through an eigenmode analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive a universal scaling law for the decay rate of the most subradiant state, which exhibits an $ N^{-3} $ scaling with even-odd oscillatory behavior in the deep-subwavelength regime. This scaling is directly observable in the single-photon scattering spectrum, enabling the detection of minute changes in atomic separation with a figure of merit that scales as $ N^3 $. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) scales as $N^6$ and can be closely approached by measuring spectral shifts near the steepest slope of the most subradiant resonance. These enhancements remain robust under realistic positional disorder, confirming that dipole--dipole-engineered subradiance provides a viable resource for quantum metrology.

The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

PINN outperforms baselines, with marked improvements in moderately high-dimensional systems, superior noise robustness (slower performance degradation), and consistent dimensional robustness.

While experiments are limited to 5-qubit systems due to computational constraints, our theoretical framework (convergence guarantees, generalization bounds, scalability theorems) justifies PINN's advantages will persist and strengthen in larger systems (6+ qubits), where constraint-induced dimension reduction benefits grow with system size.

While quantum optimization heuristics such as quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are known to induce biased sampling, hybrid quantum-classical MCMC incorporates quantum dynamics only as a proposal transition and enforces detailed balance through classical acceptance steps. Using small Ising models, we show that MCMC post-processing corrects the sampling bias of quantum dynamics and restores near-uniform sampling over degenerate ground states. We then apply the method to random $k$-SAT problems near the satisfiability threshold. For random 2-SAT, a hybrid MCMC combining QAOA-assisted neural proposals with single spin-flip updates achieves fairness comparable to that of PT-ICM. For random 3-SAT, where such classical methods are no longer applicable, the hybrid MCMC still attains approximately uniform sampling.

This result motivates the identification of the sum of two-tangles as a natural and effective entanglement quantifier for the W-class states.

This forms a new type of attack on the economics of cloud-based quantum computers. All major quantum computing companies today offer access to their hardware through some type of cloud-based service. Due to the noisy nature of quantum computers, a quantum circuit is run many times to collect the output statistics, and each run is called a shot. The fees users pay for access to the machines typically depend on the number of these shots of a quantum circuit that are executed. Per-shot pricing is a clean and straightforward approach as users are charged a small fee for each shot of their circuit. This work demonstrates that per-shot pricing can be exploited to get circuits to run for free when users abuse recently implemented mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset operations. Through evaluation on real, cloud-based quantum computers this work shows how multiple circuits can be executed together within a shot, by separating each user circuit by set of reset operations and submitting all the circuits, and reset operations, as one larger circuit. As a result, the user is charged per-shot pricing, even though inside each shot are multiple circuits. Total per-shot cost to run certain circuits could be reduced by up to $900$\\% using methods proposed in this work, leading to significant financial losses to quantum computing companies. To address this novel finding, this work proposes a clear approach for how users should be charged for their execution, while maintaining the flexibility and usability of the mid-circuit measurement and reset~operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper reveals attacks on quantum computing companies that exploit reset operations to free-run quantum circuits, potentially reducing costs by 900%.", "motivation": "The paper addresses concerns about the economic impacts of quantum computing, particularly the pricing models used by cloud-based quantum computing services.", "method": "The research demonstrates that by using mid-circuit qubit measurements and resets, users can execute multiple circuits within a single shot, effectively reducing the cost per circuit.", "result": "The findings suggest that users can exploit these features to execute multiple circuits within a single shot, significantly reducing the cost per circuit.", "conclusion": "Attackers can abuse reset operations to run quantum circuits for free, negatively impacting the financial models of quantum computing companies."}}

In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this paper, we mathematically describe these problems via adaptive sequence of instruments (ASI) and show how any instrument can be decomposed into it. Number of steps $N$ and number of ancillary qubits $n_A$ needed for actual implementation are crucial parameters of any such ASI.

This also enables us to draw natural comparisons with classical AC$^0$ circuits, which can compute PARITY exactly in depth $2$ using exponential size. Our proof techniques further suggest that, for inherently classical decision problems, constant-depth quantum circuits do not necessarily provide more power than their classical counterparts.
