The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $\u03c3$, and take the limit $\u03c3\\to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $\u03c3> 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These vdW gaps can guide the migration of intercalated ions and thus regulate filament growth in resistive switching (RS) devices. Vertically aligned 2D materials and their heterostructures provide vdW gap-mediated ion transport in memristor crossbars, providing great potential for high-density integration and reliable RS performance. Nevertheless, the fundamental switching mechanisms and their contributions to the RS remain inadequately understood. In this work, we investigate silver (Ag) filament-based threshold switching (TS) in heterostructures comprising vertically aligned 2D molybdenum disulfide (VAMoS${_2}$) grown via sulfurization and silicon oxide (SiO${_x}$). Compared to SiO${_x}$-only devices, the SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$ devices exhibit TS with higher on-threshold and hold voltages, each approximately 0.4 V, faster switching times down to 356 ns under a 4 V pulse, and a lower cycle-to-cycle on-current variability of 3.0%. A physics-based, variability-aware model reveals that confined Ag ion migration within the vdW gaps in VAMoS${_2}$ forms ultrathin seed filaments, which guide filament growth in the SiO${_x}$ layer. These findings establish SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$ heterostructures as a promising concept for reliable TS in vertical device architectures for emerging memories and neuromorphic computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "2D\u6750\u6599\u5728RS\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a762D\u6750\u6599\u5728RS\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u548c\u7c7b\u8111\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Sb\u5316\u548cSiOx\u751f\u957fVAMoS2\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Ag\u57fa\u4f53\u4f1a\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76TS\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "SiOx/VAMoS2\u7ec4\u5408\u6bd4SiOx\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9608\u503c\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u7535\u538b\uff0c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5f00\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u95f4\u6d41\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528VAMoS2\u4e0eSiOx\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584RS\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5782\u76f4\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

In this case, our proposal is based on two copies of an $\\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)$ Q-system, glued through the branch cuts of the Q-functions in a minimal way. We study in detail the ensuing analytic properties of the Q-functions in this proposal.\n  Focusing on purely massive excitations, we consider the large worldsheet limit in which the QSC leads to a set of Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) equations, yielding strong constraints on the (so-far unfixed) dressing factors of the worldsheet S-matrix.\n  In a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric sector, our proposal is consistent with all previous results on the worldsheet S-matrix. However, in the non-symmetric case, we found a subtle incompatibility between the analytic constraints arising from the proposed QSC, the crossing equations present in the literature, and braiding unitarity.\n  We discuss possible explanations for this mismatch: either our minimal QSC proposal does not hold beyond the symmetric sector, or the crossing unitarity equations receive a nontrivial correction that needs to be understood.\n  Finally, we also propose a generalisation of the Q-system for the case of $\u03b1\\neq 1/2$, corresponding to the superalgebra $\\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\u03b1)$.

Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability.

Specifically, studying the variation of thermal resistance across grain boundaries is of critical importance in designing effective thermal interface materials for heterogeneous integration. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping at the micrometer length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantifying local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (<100 nm). However, challenges in accurately converting the raw signal to thermal conductivity and accounting for surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated modulation of thermal properties in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of parasitic heat transport pathways; this calibration enables accurate measurement of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature change to extract the thermal resistance of the film (Rth). Following calibration, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited by e-beam evaporation on a SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using a finite-element-modeling-based calibration approach, where the average of the pixel-level Rth values yields an effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W m^-1 K^-1, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks describing heat transport in ultrathin Al.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\u03bc_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\u03bc_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\u03bc_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by > 34% in large-angle scenarios.

They have gained significant interest due to their potential as alternative energy resources and their applications in gas storage, transportation, and carbon sequestration. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation, especially the influence of gas bubbles, remain poorly understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how methane nanobubble size modulates hydrate formation in supercooled water. Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines. The work provides new molecular-level insight into how nanobubble size modulates gas hydrate nucleation and growth dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cmethane\u6c14\u6ce1\u5927\u5c0f\u5f71\u54cd\u6c14\u6c34\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u751f\u957f\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6c14\u6ce1\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6291\u5236\u5408\u7269\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u6c14\u6ce1\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u5176\u751f\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u6c14\u6ce1\u5927\u5c0f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6c14\u6c34\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u751f\u957f\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u4e3a\u6c14\u6c34\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u6c14\u6ce1\u5927\u5c0f\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u6c14\u6c34\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u751f\u957f\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u6c14\u6ce1\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6c14\u6c34\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8f83\u5927\u6c14\u6ce1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u7269\u751f\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u8d85\u8fc7\u67d0\u4e00\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u751f\u957f\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c14\u6ce1\u5927\u5c0f\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6c14\u6c34\u5408\u7269\u5f62\u6210\u957f\u548c\u751f\u957f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6c14\u6ce1\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism,\" has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \\sim L^{-\u03b3}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($\u03c1\\sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($\u03c3(\u03c9) \\sim \u03c9^{\u03b3-1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u7684`\n`\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5bfc\u7535\u6807\u5ea6\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u96f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u5ea6\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u53ef\u4ee5 experimentally\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u968f\u6e29\u5347\u7684\u7535\u963b\u7387\u548c\u975e\u9ed1\u4f53\u5149\u5b66\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u3001\u4eba\u5de5 Hamiltonians\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u6750\u6599\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u6807\u5fd7\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6e38\u79bb\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u6742\u8d28\u8f68\u9053\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u56fa\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u666e\u904d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u96f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5bfc\u7535\u6807\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5982 graphene \u548c\u591a Weyl \u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6307\u6570\u7684\u5bfc\u7535\u6807\u5ea6\u6cd5 G \u223c L^{\u2212\u03b3} \u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d \u03b3 \u7531\u8282\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08D_{node}\uff09\u3001\u5176\u9636\u6570\uff08n\uff09\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08D\uff09\u6216\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08D^F\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u6570\u5b57\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5728\u96f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfc\u7535\u6807\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed galactic rotation curves. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We then assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue.

We discuss how particle-hole excitations of a Fermi sea can induce long-range interactions between heavy impurities or atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Conversely, phonon excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate induce interactions between fermionic atoms. These mediated interactions exhibit different short-range and long-range scaling regimes with distance and, if strong enough, can induce fermion superfluidity. We discuss the prospects for observing new phenomena that could arise from mediated interactions. Experimentally, we outline recent studies of the 133Cs-6Li Bose-Fermi mixture, a platform well-suited for investigating fermion-mediated interactions. A Cs Bose-Einstein condensate immersed in a degenerate Li Fermi gas is prepared with tunable interspecies interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, precision measurements of condensate properties reveal fermion-mediated attractions between bosons, matching theoretical predictions. In the strong-coupling regime, we observe suppression and revival of sound modes and novel many-body resonances.

However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies.

Tight integration with the Bluesky control infrastructure at the NSLS-II Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline enables real-time, closed-loop scan orchestration. Applied to a chemically heterogeneous urban PM2.5 sample, X-AutoMap reduced high-resolution acquisition time from over 44 hours to approximately 10 hours by targeting compositionally significant features identified from coarse scans. High-resolution results revealed diverse particle types, including fully mixed, partially overlapping, and spatially distinct multi-element structures, demonstrating the ability of the framework to isolate chemically relevant features with minimal user intervention. The framework supports interactive and autonomous modes, operates within hardware constraints via grid-based scanning, and is robust across varying sample conditions.

Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level.

Widefield interferometric approach provide a cost-effective, non-destructive solution for characterizing semiconductor optical waveguides, which are fundamental to nanophotonic devices. This work presents a Bayesian inference framework, implemented using Dynamic Nested Sampling, for estimating geometric parameters - such as width and height - of a semiconductor optical waveguide from a single widefield interferogram. The proposed framework reduces the need of leveraging near field scanning microscopy methods for measurements. The notable advantage is that Bayesian statistics not only provide the estimated parameter values but also quantify the uncertainty of the inference results and the fitness of the used model. The proposed full-field, single-shot interferometric approach, supported by Bayesian-based data analysis, achieves high accuracy and sensitivity - down to successful measurement of 8 nm rib waveguide - while remaining resilient to noise. Thus, the demonstrated methodology provides a cost-effective, robust, and scalable tool for semiconductor fabrication monitoring and process verification, as confirmed by both numerical simulations and experimental validation on optical waveguides.

While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffusion models excel in chemical accuracy but are slow to sample, while flow models are fast but less accurate.

Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants.

In this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). Prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-Newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from NR simulations during the ringdown. To obtain a better match with NR waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. Specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. The waveform is determined by evolving a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified Poschl-Teller potential. By tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match NR waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u4e8c\u4f53\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6444\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce2\u5f62\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\uff08NR\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5339\u914d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u7ea61e-3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u540e\u6fc0\u52b1\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u662f\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4e2d\u6700\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5176\u6ce2\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e8c\u4f53\u8fd1\u786e\u7acb\u6d1e\u6444\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e24\u533a\u57df\uff08\u4e8c\u4f53\u533a\u57df\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u533a\u57df\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u4f53\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u6709\u6548\u9ed1 Hole \u6444\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u754c\u9762\u5904\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u754c\u9762\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8c03\u6574\u8fc7\u7684 Poschl-Teller\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u6709\u6548\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5339\u914d\u533a\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e NR \u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u540e\u6fc0\u52b1\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u5c06\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u7ea61e-3\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\uff081:8\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u4f53\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u6444\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u9002\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Root Mean Square (RMS) Bandwidth is a generalization of bandwidth that overcomes some of the limitations encountered with conventional bandwidth, including the prerequisite of linearity, single-mode response, and light damping. However, its mathematical form does not reveal much about the physics behind it. In this paper, we extend RMS Bandwidth to multiple degree-of-freedom, linear, time-invariant, classically damped systems by deriving an Analytical Root Mean Square (ARMS) Bandwidth in terms of a system's modal parameters and initial modal energy distribution. We demonstrate that ARMS Bandwidth reliably and accurately computes a single measure for a practical structure's dissipative capacity. Also, a purely data-driven methodology for assessing the modal energy distribution is developed. We apply ARMS Bandwidth to single and multiple degree-of-freedom systems and an experimental model aircraft to demonstrate its broad applicability.

Choosing between different entanglement purification protocols generally involves weighing up a trade-off between the ratio of strongly entangled pairs produced to weakly entangled pairs consumed, which we call the rate of the protocol, and the degree of the entanglement of the strongly entangled pairs, typically measured by the fidelity of those pairs to maximally entangled states. By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate.

In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry.

Similar to geometry-dependent plasmon and Mie resonances, these intrinsic material resonances offer coherent and tunable light scattering. Thus far, the impact of the excitons temporal dynamics on the performance of such excitonic metasurfaces remains unexplored. Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2. By isolating the coherent exciton radiation from the incoherent background in the focus of the lens, we obtain a direct measure of the role of exciton radiation in wavefront shaping. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering by characterizing the focusing efficiency as a function of temperature, demonstrating an increased optical efficiency at cryogenic temperatures.

Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods.

In this work, we explore post-merger detectability and inference through an alternative detector readout scheme for data dominated by quantum-noise, which is the case above $1$\\,kHz: photon-counting. In such a readout, signals and noise become quantized into discrete distributions corresponding to the detection of single photons measured in a chosen basis of modes.

In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present. Since many reported record-performance 2D FETs employ back-gate geometries that inherently include contact gating, these results establish contact gating as a critical and previously underappreciated determinant of device performance in the 2D FET landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We construct a Hilbert space whose states are associated with configurations of thin shells or end-of-the-world branes, with state overlaps defined by the gravitational path integral. By considering states which are indistinguishable to an observer, we find that the variance of microstate overlaps is dominated by Lorentzian wormhole topologies with conical singularities.

Extending this analysis to Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, we show that both the cosmological and black hole horizons contribute to the total entropy.

The well-known competitive exclusion principle (CEP) states that two species competing for the same resource cannot stably coexist, and more generally, that the number of consumer species is bounded by the number of resource species at steady state. However, the remarkable species diversity observed in natural ecosystems, exemplified by the paradox of the plankton, challenges this principle. Here, we show that interspecific social information use among predators provides a mechanism that fundamentally relaxes the constraints of competitive exclusion. A model of predation dynamics that incorporates interspecific information use naturally explains coexistence beyond the limits imposed by CEP. Our model quantitatively reproduces two classical experiments that contradicts the CEP and captures coexistence patterns documented in natural ecosystems, offering a general mechanism for the maintenance of biodiversity in ecological communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "The model fits the data well and the main achievement is a significant relaxation of CEP constraints.", "motivation": "Understanding species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance is a fundamental question in ecology.", "method": "A mathematical model of predation dynamics incorporating interspecific social information use was developed.", "result": "The model reproduces classical experiments conflicting with CEP and explains coexistence in natural ecosystems.", "conclusion": "Interspecific social information use provides a mechanism for biodiversity maintained beyond CEP constraints."}}

Circuit-level simulations show that they can achieve the same logical error rate as surface codes with a reduced qubit overhead. They have been extensively optimized by importing classical techniques such as the progressive edge growth, or through random search, simulated annealing or reinforcement learning techniques. In this work, instead of machine learning (ML) algorithms that improve the code performance through local transformations, we impose additional global symmetries, that are hard to discover through ML, and we perform an exhaustive search. Precisely, we focus on the hypergraph product of two cyclic codes, which we call CxC codes and we study C2 codes which are the product a cyclic code with itself and CxR codes which are the product of a cyclic codes with a repetition code. We discover C2 codes and CxR codes that significantly outperform previously optimized HGP codes, achieving better parameters and a logical error rate per logical qubit that is up to three orders of magnitude better. Moreover, some C2 codes achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a smaller qubit overhead than state-of-the-art LDPC codes such as the bivariate bicycle codes, at the price of a larger block length.

The TOF detector electronics were upgraded and refurbished, while processing algorithms for data quality control, reconstruction, calibration, and analysis were rewritten.

Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR.

We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Solvaformer is a geometric-aware graph transformer for predicting small molecule solubility and solvation free energy, outperforming existing models.", "motivation": "Understanding and predicting solubility is crucial for chemical synthesis and process optimization.", "method": "Solvaformer uses SE(3)-equivariant attention for intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, trained in a multi-task setting on quantum mechanical and experimental data.", "result": "Solvaformer achieves state-of-the-art performance, with interpretable molecule-level attributions.", "conclusion": "This tool offers an accurate and interpretable approach for solution-phase property prediction through integration of geometric inductive biases and mixed datasets."}}

The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs).

While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincar\u00e9 patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u6b63\u5219\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u80cc\u666f\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u672a\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\uff1a\u56f4\u7ed5\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u968f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u9694\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5148\u540e\u5728Minkowski\u65f6\u7a7a\u548cde Sitter\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6307\u6570\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u4f55\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u9694\u800c\u8d8b\u4e8e\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u7279\u5f02\u7684\u6781\u9650\u503c\u3002\u5728Minkowski\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u8d8b\u4e8e\u8d1f\u6570\uff1b\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u8d8b\u4e8e\u96f6\uff1b\u975e\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u8d8b\u4e8e\u6b63\u6570\u3002\u5728de Sitter\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6b64\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5224\u522b\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u5224\u522b\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5224\u522b\u53ef\u91cd\u6574\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

However, limitations imposed by the intrinsic properties of conventional materials hinder the fabrication of interference-based absorbers with desired optical properties. Herein, a high-performance solar absorber with a Dallenbach-type dielectric-metal tandem structure was fabricated using an ultrathin, subquarter-wavelength thickness single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) membrane with tailored optical spectra as the absorbing layer. By mixing multiple SWCNT chiral structures, the optical response of the absorbing layer was tailored to approximate a theoretical complex refractive index spectrum of dielectrics; therefore enabling high solar absorptance, low infrared emittance, and a low angular dependence with a simple bilayer structure. The fabricated proof-of-concept 1 cm$^2$ absorber exhibited excellent spectral selectivity (solar absorptance/infrared emittance of 0.84/0.03), and an equilibrium temperature of $\\approx 190^\\circ$C ($270^\\circ$C) under nonconcentrated ($2\\times$ concentrated) sunlight, considerably outperformed a blackbody-like absorber.

However, research on the associated Imbert-Fedorov or spin Hall shifts, driven by the spin-orbit interaction of structured light in structured interfaces, has been comparatively scarce and limited. We explore the reflection characteristics of generic polarized, non-paraxial light beams from a corrugated silver (Ag) interface, since surface corrugation can naturally couple the incident radiation modes to the surface excitations. In the vicinity of SPR, we report a significant enhancement in the beam shifts, attributed to the rapid variation of the specular reflection coefficient near its minima, resulting in amplified weak values. By carefully selecting the incident and projected polarization states of the beam, we achieve a pronounced spatial spin Hall effect. We also investigate vortex-induced beam shifts within this resonant regime, revealing distinctive signatures of the angular momentum of the beam. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis is also presented for the conical diffraction geometry, wherein polarization conversions between p and s states are fully incorporated. Our work establishes the interplay of the spin-orbit interaction of light and the weak measurement approach as an important methodology in amplifying SPR effects, which may have important connotations in applications involving light at nanoscales.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We begin by examining time-like periodic geodesic orbits for various configurations characterized by different energy and angular momentum values, represented by the integers $(z, w, v)$. Furthermore, we explore the effects of the King DM halo on time-like periodic geodesics, marginally bound orbits, and innermost stable circular orbits, thereby providing a deeper understanding of how the DM halo environment modifies the behavior of these stable orbits and timelike particle geodesics. Finally, we analyze the null geodesics and the accretion disk properties by studying their direct and secondary images, redshift distributions, and radiation fluxes as observed at infinity for a range of inclination angles.

This approach captures the antenna-limited wave-vector spectrum and the component-selective driving fields (perpendicular to the static magnetisation) that simplified uniform-field models cannot.

Validation against experimental AEPSWS on a $48\\,nm$ YIG film shows quantitative agreement in dispersion ridges, group velocities, and spectral peak positions, establishing that the antenna acts as a tunable k-space filter.

This work shows that liquid-metal based micro-pipette printing is suited for fabricating superconducting lumped-element resonators with high internal quality factors.

Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable.

Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested.

Diamagnets and paramagnets lack spontaneous long-range order, whereas ordered magnets develop such order below their Curie or N\u00e9el temperature and support single spin-wave excitations (magnons). Magnons have found applications in radio-frequency technologies and computation, magneto-optics, and foundational quantum experiments. Above the Curie/N\u00e9el temperature, long-range order is lost and the material transitions to a paramagnetic phase, with localised spin alignment in small patches, producing paramagnons with only short-range propagation. Here we show that long-range coherence is preserved in the organic free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl above the N\u00e9el temperature using all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy in external magnetic fields.

We obtain the Landau levels analytically and find that intra-spin and/or inter-spin Landau level crossing occurs. We compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory. We find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in longitudinal conductivity appears that can be made purely spin polarized by adjusting the Fermi level suitably. We observe a beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation in the intra-spin branches, which arises due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to two bands in each spin branch. This is contrary to the conventional Rashba system, where such beating is due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to the two spin-branches. On the other hand, we note that quantum-Hall conductivity exhibits usual quantization in units of $e^2/h$ corresponding to each spin dependent Landau level.

First, we use a set of unequal-mass simulations to extract the self-force contributions to the scattering angle. Our main result is that using information up to second-order in the symmetric mass ratio (2SF) reproduces numerical relativity within the error bars across the full range of mass-ratios, including equal mass.

Here we propose a different route to photonic spacetime crystals based on modulation of the anomalous velocity in low-symmetry conductors, particularly Weyl semimetals. We show that when driven by a strong optical pump, the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons induces an ultrafast spacetime modulation that propagates with a superluminal phase velocity relative to the dielectric background. This self-induced modulation enables unidirectional light transport below the optical gap and, near the epsilon-near-zero point, gives rise to collective parametric resonance and stimulated emission of volume plasmons.

Then we give a variety of numerical and analytical examples which explore different ways in which local arrows of time can manifest in quantum many-body dynamics, including exotic arrows of time arising from quantum thermalization and quantum error correction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u65f6\u95f4t\uff0c\u5b83\u7531\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6f14\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u91cf\u5b50\u71b5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u548c\u5256\u6790\u4e30\u7855\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7531\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u65f6\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u91cf\u5b50\u71b5\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u91cf\u5b50\u71b5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u548c\u5256\u6790\u4e30\u7855\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7531\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u65f6\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u91cf\u5b50\u71b5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u548c\u5256\u6790\u4e30\u7855\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7531\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u65f6\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u65f6\u95f4t\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u51fa\u73b0\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u65f6\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u91cf\u5b50\u71b5\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $\u03c9= -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($\u03c9= -1$) with a subdominant $\u03c9= -5/3$ fluid (around $5\\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $\u03c9= -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $\u03a9_{\\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $\u03c9_{\\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $\u039b$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $\u039b$CDM ($\u0394\\text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model.

In a symmetric subsector, we find agreement with previously known results and furthermore extend the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz to include massless modes. Beyond this sector, we identify an interesting puzzle regarding the compatibility of crossing equations with braiding unitarity for individual dressing phases, which warrants further investigation and may require additional physical insights or novel structures not previously encountered in related systems.

Although computational refocusing can potentially provide sharp images outside the DOF, signal reduction by the confocal effect still limits the imaging depth in practice in point-scanning OCT. In addition, standard OCT cannot visualize intra-tissue activities. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrated a spatially coherent full-field OCM (SC-FFOCM) with computational refocusing. In addition, a repetitive acquisition protocol was designed to visualize intra-tissue activities (i.e., dynamic OCT imaging). The in-focus lateral resolution is 1.4 um, and the axial resolution is 6.5 um (in air) at full-width at half-maximum intensity. Three-dimensional structure and the dynamic OCT imaging using SC-FFOCM with computational refocusing was applied to human breast adenocarcinoma spheroids (MCF-7 cell line).

After imposing integrability, cluster adjacency (or extended Steinmann), first- and last-entry conditions, the solution space is already highly restrictive: e.g. for MHV case there are exactly $1,1,2,3,4$ parity-invariant solutions for $L=1,2,\\cdots, 5$, which automatically satisfy dihedral symmetry. Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we introduce and experimentally validate a novel strategy to circumvent noise by exploiting the phenomenon of metastability, where a dynamical system exhibits long-lived intermediate states. We demonstrate that if quantum hardware noise exhibits metastability, both digital and analog algorithms can be designed in a noise-aware fashion to achieve intrinsic resilience. We develop a general theoretical framework and introduce an efficiently computable noise resilience metric that avoids the need for full classical simulation of the quantum algorithm. We illustrate the use of our framework with applications to variational quantum algorithms and analog adiabatic state preparation. Crucially, we provide experimental evidence supporting the presence of metastable noise in gate-model quantum processors as well as quantum annealing devices.

We specialize in the case of Gravitational Wave searches, and use autoencoders for non-linear compression of the space of waveforms after these have been represented by a finite number of basis functions using an SVD decomposition. To ensure that the autoencoder is suitable for geometric placement we try to find a coordinate system describing the manifold of SVD coefficients such that distances in the latent and embedding space are equal. We show that the curvature of the banks is negligible and that such a system can be found. We then show that a geometric placement algorithm via a uniform grid in the latent space combined with rejection of unphysical points using a normalizing flow results in templates that, while slightly less in number than the similar construction using random forests of Ref.~\\cite{Wadekar:2023kym}, perform slightly better in the effectualness tests, especially for high-mass binary systems.

The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile.

When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state).

In this work, we investigated atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC using a scanning tunneling microscope. Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule. The hopping can be reversibly controlled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip, allowing the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Defect hopping further allows us to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species.

One such anomaly, known as the \"ballooning effect\" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal.

In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings. Conceptually, this can be viewed as a \"compression\" of the information in the QPF algorithm, which enables period-finding from $n$ one-qubit marginals.

The first-order gravitational perturbations backreact with the background metric at second-order, creating a wormhole opening. The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed. For superluminal sound channels, the wormhole opens for an extremely brief duration at late insertion times, rendering it non-traversable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers.

Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics.

For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model.

Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (<50 $\u03bc$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities.

Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \\sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings.

An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2.

Experimental observation of backflow has remained elusive due to two main challenges: (i) the effect is intrinsically small, with less than 4% of the probability able to flow backward, and (ii) it requires wave packets with a well-defined momentum direction, which are difficult both to prepare and to verify under realistic, noisy conditions. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone.

The supercritical regime of black hole thermodynamics remains a relatively unexplored area, and recent applications of this theory to charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes have initiated probes into this regime, revealing a simple structure partitioned by a single Widom line. In this paper, we apply Lee-Yang theory to charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, which feature complex phase diagrams (e.g., triple points), to determine how such structures are reflected in the supercritical regime. Notably, we observe a key dimensional difference in that the five-dimensional (5d) system, which lacks a triple point, confirms the known single Widom line structure, while the six-dimensional (6d) system, which admits a triple point, generates two distinct Widom lines. These lines partition the supercritical domain into three sectors (small-, intermediate-, and large- black hole-like phases), corresponding to the three phases coexisting at the triple point.

Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$.

By adding a procedure for FT magic state preparation, we show quantitatively how to realize an FT universal gate set in $d=3$ LCS codes.

Working in the Hamiltonian formalism on the plane, we derive the symmetry algebra of the deformed theory, which consists of a local Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra in the left-moving sector and a non-local counterpart in the right-moving sector. This algebraic structure guides the definition of two operator classes: dressed operators, which transform as primaries under the deformed symmetries, and local physical operators. While dressed operators are local only in the left null direction, physical operators maintain locality in both directions and are constructed from dressed operators and currents. This formulation allows the powerful constraints of conformal symmetry to be leveraged for computing physical observables. Consequently, we employ conformal perturbation theory to compute the two-point and $N$-point functions of physical operators. In momentum space, we sum the most UV-sensitive contributions to all orders; the results show precise agreement with string theory predictions. Furthermore, a non-perturbative analysis of the position-space correlator reveals an instanton contribution, providing a complete characterization of the correlation functions.", "AI": {"tldr":

By applying the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the scattering coefficients for single photons incident from different directions are obtained, which present different scattering spectra in the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The conversion contrast characterizing the nonreciprocity is also analyzed in both regimes. It is found that the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion vanishes as long as the emission from either transition pathways for single photons is suppressed, but it is enhanced and even reach unity by introducing the nonreciprocity.

In this work, we revisit the connection between Markovian open-system dynamics and averages of Hamiltonian real-time evolutions, which we refer to as Hamiltonian twirling channels. Focusing on the class of Lindbladians with a single Hermitian jump operator $H$ recently studied in Shang et al. (arXiv:2510.06759), we show that the time-$t$ evolution map can be expressed exactly a Gaussian twirl over the unitary orbit ${\\{\\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i} Hs}\\}}_{s\\in\\mathbb{R}}$. This structural insight allows us to design a fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation that achieves diamond-norm error $\\varepsilon$ with time complexity $O\\big(\\sqrt{t\\log(1/\\varepsilon)}\\big)$ -- matching the performance of Shang et al. while requiring no auxiliary registers or controlled operations. The resulting ancilla-free and control-free algorithm is therefore more amenable to near-term experimental implementation. By purifying the Gaussian twirl procedure and performing a conjugate measurement, we derive a continuous-variable quantum phase estimation algorithm. In addition, by applying the L\u00e9vy-Khintchine representation theorem, we clarify when and how a dissipative dynamics can be realized using Hamiltonian twirling channels. Guided by the general theory, we explore Hamiltonian twirling with compound Poisson distributions and their potential algorithmic implications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates.

In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware.

We propose a modular architecture using SNAIL-based parametric coupling to interface Brillouin M2O transducers with long-lived 3D cavities, while maintaining plug-and-play compatibility. Through numerical simulations incorporating realistic noises, including laser heating, propagation losses, and detection inefficiency, we demonstrate raw entangled bit fidelities of F~0.8 at kHz-level rates over 30 km using the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol.

Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels.

However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory.

This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $\u039b=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u96c6\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u81ea\u53d1\u540c\u6b65\u65cb\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u73af\u5f62\u8154\u5ba4\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u539f\u5b50\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7535\u78c1\u8154\u5ba4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5728\u5408\u9002\u8154\u5ba4\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8026\u5408\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u539f\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\u65cb\u5ea6\u548c\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8154\u5ba4\u4e2d\u7531\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u5f15\u8d77\u6709\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5f62\u8154\u5ba4\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u54c8\u5bc6\u5c14\u987f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6838\u578b\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u65cb\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u73af\u5f62\u8154\u5ba4\u4e0b\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u7a97\u53e3\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u65cb\u5ea6\u6709\u5e8f\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7aef\u53e3\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u65cb\u5ea6\u6709\u5e8f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ade\u4e89\u4f20\u64ad\u5728\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}
