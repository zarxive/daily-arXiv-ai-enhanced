Through controlled atom depletion\nvia superradiance, we analyze the sample's expansion dynamics and aspect ratio\nto identify the BEC-droplet phases distinctly, supported by Gaussian\nvariational ansatz calculations.

It is well known that, in the framework of\nNewtonian mechanics, motions are dissipative; however, when subjected to\nperiodic motion, a system can produce nondissipative motions intermittently and\nsubject to resonance. It is in resonance that turbulence occurs in fluid flow,\nsolid vibration, thermal transport, etc. In this, the findings from these\nphysical systems are analyzed in the framework of statistics with their own\nprobability space to establish their compliance to the stochastic process. In\nparticular, a systematic alignment of the inception of the stochastic process\nwith the signed measure theory, signed probability space, and stochastic\nprocess was investigated. It was found that the oscillatory load from the\ndissipative state excited the system and resulted in a quasi-periodic\nprobability density function with the negative probability regimes. In\naddition, the vectorial nature of the random velocity splits the probability\ndensity function along both the positive and negative axes with slight\nasymmetricity. By assuming that a deterministic process has a probability of 1,\nwe can express the inception of a stochastic process, and the subsequent\nbenefit is that a dynamic fractal falls on the probability density function.\nMoreover, we leave some questions of inconsistency between the physical system\nand the measurement theory for future investigation. We believe that the\nestablishment of the probability density function of resonance nondissipative\ndynamics in contemporary statistics should make many mathematical tools\navailable and the analytical formulas for the random velocity and probability\ndensity function can provide a convenient platform for the development of\nstatistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5171\u632f\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u632f\u8361\u8f7d\u8377\u6fc0\u52b1\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8d1f\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u901f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u6982\u73871\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u7acb\u968f\u673a\u5171\u632f\u975e\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5171\u632f\u4e0b\u975e\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8d1f\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u632f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u5177\u6709\u8d1f\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u65b9\u5411\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u5f62\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e3a1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u5171\u632f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5171\u632f\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8d1f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6d4b\u5ea6\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This paper demonstrates scalable memristors with volatile and nonvolatile RS behavior under different conditions, including stable characteristics in an intermediate resistive state (>2500 cycles, >10^6 s retention), and synaptic-like current response, suggesting potential for neuromorphic applications.

The development of scalable and reliable 2DM-based memristors, especially those based on MoS2, is crucial for advancing this field. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of RS in MoS2 memristors and overcoming current limitations (e.g., variability, scalability) would enhance their applicability in Neuromorphic systems.", "method": "In this study, we synthesized, characterized, and fabricated metal-organic chemical vapor-deposited (MOCVD) MoS2-based memristors on chip-scale devices.

Additionally, rate-dependent phenomena were analyzed by performing direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) bias measurements.", "result": "The research finds that MoS2-based memristors exhibit both volatile and nonvolatile RS behavior, which is tunable by adjusting current compliance. They show stable RS characteristics in the intermediate resistive state (IRS), including high endurance (>2500 cycles) and long-term stability (>10^6 s), which is beneficial for applications requiring reliability. Furthermore, the devices emulate synaptic plasticity, with currents responding on the microsecond timescale. The scalable fabrication technique opens up its potential for integration into standard semiconductor processes. However, the stochastic nature of RS and insufficient characterization of its underlying mechanisms still need to be addressed.", "conclusion": "This work advances the development of 2DM-based memristors, particularly MoS2-based ones, by demonstrating scalable devices with reliable RS properties and synaptic-like characteristics suitable for Neuromorphic systems. While current limitations (e.g., variability, scalability challenges) indicate areas needing further exploration, the findings pave the way for more practical applications of memristors in hardware implementations of biological neural networks."}}

The algorithm\ncategorizes orbits into four types: weakly chaotic, strongly chaotic, and\nregular orbits (which are further subdivided into resonant and non-resonant\norbits), thereby creating a valuable dataset required for deep learning models.\nSecond, we demonstrate that a well-trained 2D-CNN achieves high performance in\naccurately classifying orbits, largely because it effectively leverages the 2D\nstructural information of the phase space relation.

Despite extensive experimental\nobservations across diverse platforms - including transport junctions,\nphotoemission, and enantioselective chemistry - a comprehensive theoretical\nframework is still lacking. In this perspective, we critically examine the\nspinterface mechanism as a unifying explanation for the CISS effect. The\nspinterface model, which hypothesizes a feedback interaction between electron\nmotion in chiral molecules and fluctuating surface magnetic moments, is shown\nto quantitatively reproduce experimental data across various systems and\nconditions.

The method combines worm\nupdates with event-chain Monte Carlo moves. We explicitly prove its validity\nand quantify its performance.

Various mechanisms of cell\ncompetition have been identified, including active elimination via mechanical\nforces or induced apoptosis, as well as competition for nutrients and other\nbeneficial factors. A recent experiment demonstrated hallmarks of cell\ncompetition, associated with cell cycle dynamics, between liver progenitor\ncells and colorectal cancer cells [Krotenberg Garcia et al., iScience 27,\n109718 (2024)]. However, a mechanistic explanation for this form of competition\nremains lacking. Here, we present a mean-field model of competition for\nsignaling ligands, coupled with cell cycle dynamics, to provide such an\nunderstanding. Our model captures the salient features of the experiment,\nincluding population dynamics and cell cycle variations. We demonstrate that\nsecretion of a beneficial factor by cells, coupled with the enhanced uptake\nefficiency of cancer cells, suffices to reproduce the experimental outcome. Our\nmodel, reminiscent of competition for secreted growth factors, provides insight\ninto the minimal level of complexity required to achieve the observed\ncompetitive outcome as well as its link to cell cycle dynamics.

Advantageously, the nanowire\ndiameter can be tailored by the initial metal film thickness. However, we show\nhere that metal dewetting inherently leads to a coupling between the nanowire\ndiameter and spacing. To overcome this limitation, we introduce two strategies\nthat are exemplified for GaN nanowires: (i) modification of the surface and\ninterface energies within the dewetting system, and (ii) thinning of the\nnanowires by lateral etching. In the first strategy, GaN(0001), SiOx, and SiNx\nsubstrate surfaces are combined with Au, Pt, and Pt-Au alloy dewetting metals\nto tune the dewetting behavior. The differences in interface energies affect\nthe relation between nanowire diameter and spacing, albeit within a limited\nrange. The second strategy adds a lateral etching step to the conventional\ntop-down nanowire fabrication process. This step at the same time reduces the\nnanowire diameter and increases the spacing, thus enabling combinations beyond\nthe constraints of metal dewetting alone. When in addition different initial\nnanowire diameters are employed, it is possible to independently control\ndiameter and spacing over a substantially extended range.

Furthermore, the Ruppeiner\ncurvature becomes negative at very small horizon radii before turning positive\nand progressively vanishing at larger radii. By contrast, below the critical\nvalue of the coupling, the intermediate black hole phase disappears, and the\nsystem shows a simpler small/large first-order/coexistence behaviour driven by\nfree-energy competition. In this regime, the Ruppeiner curvature remains\npredominantly positive.

Our work particularly addresses\nthe long-standing concern regarding strong absorption of EUV radiation in\nbiological specimens. Using an established dose-resolution model, we compare\nhydrated and dehydrated cellular states and quantify the fluence required for\nnanoscale imaging. Our analysis identifies a protein window spanning photon\nenergies from 70 eV up to the carbon K-edge (284 eV), where EUV microscopy\ncould in principle achieve sub-10 nm half-pitch resolution in dehydrated\nsamples at doses well below the Henderson limit, thereby eliminating the need\nfor cryogenic conditions.

One of the main lessons is that, for a radial\ndirection to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support.\nFurthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex\ngravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to\ncombine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess\nin which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we\ncompute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched\ndisorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in\nthe large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our\nmain finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg\nmodel, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large\n$q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite\nfamily of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the\n$p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann\nalgebra.

This\nresearch has revealed intriguing similarities between the regularization\nmechanisms used in black hole models and those employed in quantum field\ntheory, such as the introduction of exponential suppression or energy cutoffs.\nWe propose a systematic exponential cutoff regularization scheme for static,\nspherically symmetric black hole solutions in general relativity. The method\nexplored in this paper serves as an alternative to the black-bounce singularity\nsuppression mechanism proposed by Simpson and Visser, which involves a\ncoordinate remapping $r \\rightarrow\\sqrt{r^2+a^2}$, as well as to the mechanism\nproposed by Bronnikov, which employs a Bardeen-type remapping in the metric.\nThe method presented here introduces exponential factors in the mass function,\nsmoothing curvature divergences and ensuring geodesic completeness under\nspecific conditions. This approach allows the regularization of known singular\nspacetimes without altering their asymptotic structure.

They are appealing for the experimental\nease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and an elegant\nmathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies\nrequire us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian\nelements. In terms of quantum resource theory, we can then recognize\nnon-Gaussian states as resources and Gaussian operations and states as free,\nwhich can be used and prepared easily. Given such a structure of resource\ntheory, the task of broadcasting the resource is to determine if the resource\ncontent of a state can be cloned in a meaningful way, which, if possible,\nprovides a strong operation for manipulation of the resource. In this work, we\nprove that broadcasting of non-Gaussian states via Gaussian operations is not\npossible. For this, we first show that the relative entropy of non- Gaussianity\nis not super-additive, which rules it out as a prime candidate in the analysis\nof such no-go results. Our proof is then based on understanding fixed points of\nGaussian operations and relates to the theory of control systems. The no-go\ntheorem also states that if two initially uncorrelated systems interact by\nGaussian dynamics and non-Gaussianity is created at one subsystem, then the\nnon-Gaussianity of the other subsystem must be reduced. Further, keeping the\nset of free operations fixed to Gaussian operations, we can also comment on the\nbroadcasting of Wigner negativity and genuine quantum non-Gaussianity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter\n(SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant,\nred-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation.\nWe present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs\nquantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation\nconditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and\ntwo-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation\npowers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\\sim$95 %) and high\nsingle-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a\nshortened exciton decay time ($\\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient\nexciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both\nexcitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in\na highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by\na factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe\nbiexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized\nexciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and\nbiexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of\nbiexciton preparation under SUPER.

Indeed, as we showed in a recent\npaper (PRB 111, 024501 (2025)), the usual Josephson threshold detector (JTD)\noperated in an equilibrium state can be utilized to implement a weak microwave\nsignal, just approaching (but not arriving at) its energy quantum limit, even\nthough its physical parameters have been optimized. In this letter, we further\ndemonstrate numerically that the phase dynamics of a current-biased Josephson\njunction (CBJJ) can be insensitive to the always-on thermal noise if the sweep\nrate of the biased current is significantly high. As a consequence, the JTD can\nbe operated alternatively in a non-equilibrium state. Based on the statistical\nbinary detection criterion, we demonstrate how such a non-equilibrium JTD\n(NEJTD) can be utilized to implement the weak microwave signal, arriving at its\nenergy quantum limit level.

This inspiring fact suggests quantum batteries\nas plausible sources of power for future quantum devices, at least in\nprinciple. However, thermodynamically not all of the energy stored in a quantum\nbattery is useful for doing work. By considering a class of models based upon\nquantum continuous variables, here we show how the maximum extractable energy\nfrom a bosonic quantum battery can be intimately related to Heisenberg's\nuncertainty principle. We found that realizing minimum uncertainty essentially\nguarantees that all of the energy stored in a Gaussian quantum battery can be\nwithdrawn and used to do work. For a standard system where the charger and\nbattery are coupled linearly, this criterion is satisfied rather trivially.\nHowever, our theoretical results demonstrate that - for a quantum battery with\nnonlinear coupling - a state of minimum uncertainty can also be achieved\nnontrivially via the generation of quantum squeezing. We characterize the\ncharging performance of our proposed continuous variable quantum batteries in\ndetail, and we hope that our theory may be useful in the design of a new\ngeneration of efficient quantum batteries harnessing bosonic excitations, such\nas those built with photonic architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6700\u5927\u63d0\u53d6\u3002\n", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5907\u7528\u80fd\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\n", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0minimum uncertainty\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u80fd\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u63d0\u53d6\u7528\u4e8e\u505a\u529f\u3002\n", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cminimum uncertainty\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u52a8\u6ee1\u8db3\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0minimum uncertainty\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u6c60\u6548\u7387\u3002\n", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5149\u5b50 architectures\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u50a8\u80fd\u548c\u505a\u529f\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
