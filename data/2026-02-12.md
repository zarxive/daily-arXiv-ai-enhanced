### [1] [Generalized Kramers-Wannier Self-Duality in Hopf-Ising Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10183)
*Da-Chuan Lu,Arkya Chatterjee,Nathanan Tantivasadakarn*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于有限维半单 Hopf 代数的广义 1+1 维 Ising 模型，并通过非交换非共轭的 ZX-图解法构造了不反转对称性：包含非交换的 Hamiltonian 和对称操作。该模型在自对偶点时构造了广义 Kramers-Wannier 对偶算符，可交换参数磁性和非参数磁性相。非局域对称性包含空间平移，并在红外区域与其他任何已知的非整数融合类别结构融合，形成以 Rep(H) 为规范的弱积分融合类别。在 H_8 代数为具体案例的情况下，数值研究了相图并确认了六种 Rep(H 8) 对称紧致相中的四种，这四者被 Ising 临界线分开，并交汇在多临界点。通过 H-余代数代数形式实现了所有六种 Rep(H 8) 对称紧致相。这些结果为非反转对称性、对偶性和张量格点模型提供了统一的 Hopf 代数框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在推广自偶对称性（例如自偶性）以应用非交换 Hopf 代数结构，特别是在比 Azumaha 群代数更广的 Hilbert 空间框架下。在 20 世纪 90 年代，Kramers-W^n'^{^	ext{ann}} er 式发现的自偶性在 1+1 维 Ising 模型中作为对偶性对称的关键性作用奠定了非交换性和对称性研究的基础。朝着这一目标，该研究构思了一个基于 Hopf代数的广义 Ising 模型，并构建了非交换的 ZX-图表形式，以更好地理解非反转对称性、对偶性和张量格点模型如何实现它们。这种研究不限于传统的 Abel 对称性，而是扩展到了更普遍的 Hopf 代数结构，为更复杂的对称性问题提供了新的视角。

Method: 该研究主要方法是基于 Hopf 代数结构，构建了一个基于有限维半单 Hopf 代数 H 的广义 1+1 维 Ising 模型，并通过非交换的 ZX-图表法构造了 Hamiltonian 和对称操作。通过设定了 H 双自我对偶，且具体以 Kac-Paljutkin 代数 H_8 作为实例，研究了相图，识别了其相的对称性和临界现象，并通过余代数代数实现了这些相。该方法利用了_hopf_代数的对称性质、非交换图论框架以及张量网络模型的构造，以全面探索非反转对称性及相关的相变行为。

Result: 研究结果证明，基于有限维半单 Hopf 代数的广义 Ising 模型能够实现非反转对称性，并通过局域和非局域的操作显示对称性对相的分裂和对偶性的作用。特别是，当前对于 H_8 代数的构造，识别了六种 Rep(H_8) 对称性紧致相中的四种，它们由 Ising 临界线分开，并交汇在一个多临界点。结果还证实了局部和非局域对称操作的结合，以及这些对称操作如何指导构建相应的张量网络模型，这些网络模型得以在实验中实现各种对称性紧致相。还可以基于这些构建，在更广泛的 Hopf 代数系统中重复这些结果，进一步扩展给其他宽广的非交换对称性问题研究提供理论框架和技术方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为非反转对称性和对偶性在 1+1 维格点模型中的应用提供了新的 Hopf 代数框架。通过引入半单 Hopf 代数和非交换 ZX-图表法，研究者扩展了传统的 Abelian 对称性框架，探索了更普遍的非反转和非整数对称性及其相的分裂方式。特别是在 Hopf 代数代数的对偶性和局部非相反对称之间的平衡方面，研究者取得了显著成果，并通过实例 H_8 的构造，验证了所有 Rep(H) 对称性紧致相的实现，并通过张量网络模型实现了这些相。该框架不仅为非反转对称性相关领域提供了一个统一的分析范式，还为后续研究指明了发展方向。

Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier transformation of the 1+1d transverse-field Ising model exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and, at criticality, manifests as a non-invertible symmetry. Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point. We also realize all six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases on the lattice via the $H$-comodule algebra formalism, in agreement with the module-category classification of $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$. Our results provide a unified Hopf-algebraic framework for non-invertible symmetries, dualities, and the tensor product lattice models that realize them.

### [2] [Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141)
*Igor Rivin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a study on the computation and behavior of permanents across various mathematical structures, revealing computational optimizations and statistical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work likely stems from the computational challenges and theoretical interests surrounding the permanent, a fundamental problem in computational mathematics with applications in quantum physics and optimization.

Method: The study employed a combination of computational and experimental methods. Computationally, a GPU was utilized to accelerate the calculation of permanents over different fields, enabling the computation of permanents for large matrices. Experimentally, statistical properties of permanents were analyzed by generating random matrices from different ensembles and observing their behavior in both prime and composite dimensions.

Result: The key results include the revelation of a universal scaling function for the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group, which is particularly prominent for prime dimensions, indicating a geodesic fingerprint of primality. Additionally, it was observed that permanents of Haar-distributed unitary matrices follow a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distribution, while those of orthogonal matrices exhibit different behavior with positive excess kurtosis decaying as 1/n. Furthermore, computations of permanents for DFT and Schur matrices extended beyond previous known ranges were provided.

Conclusion: This research uncovers novel computational techniques for permanents and unveils intriguing statistical properties that link the dimensionality of the matrices to the behavior of their permanents, with potential implications in quantum information theory and random matrix theory.

Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ In particular, we use this to compute the permanents of DFT and Schur matrices far beyond the ranges hitherto known. On the experimental side, we present two new observations. First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,σ^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $α$-stable distribution with stability index $α\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $α=2$.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(γ(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(γ({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. For the geodesic to the DFT matrix, the permanent recovers $10$--$40$ times above its valley minimum when $n$ is prime, but not when $n$ is composite -- a geodesic fingerprint of primality.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of quantum tokens, their history, and their potential applications in quantum information security. It discusses various physical realizations using integrated quantum memories and their applicability in different scenarios, concluding with a consideration of their role in the broader information security ecosystem and their relationship to post-quantum cryptography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing importance of quantum security and the potential for novel applications in finance and payments motivate this comprehensive review of quantum tokens.

Method: The paper surveys existing quantum token technologies, evaluates their physical realizations, and assesses their relevance in the information security landscape, particularly in light of post-quantum cryptography.

Result: The paper highlights the diverse applications and promising future of quantum tokens while pointing out challenges in scaling and standardization.

Conclusion: The paper acknowledges the significant advancements in quantum tokens but also underscores the need for further research to address scalability, interoperability, and regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: The concept of quantum tokens dates back alongside quantum cryptography to Stephen Wiesner's seminal work in 1983[1]. Already this initial work proposes society-relevant applications such as secure quantum banknotes, which can be exchanged between a bank and a customer. This quantum currency is based on various physical states that can be easily verified but is protected from being copied by the fundamental quantum laws. Four decades later, these ideas have flourished in the field of quantum information, and the concept of quantum banknotes has not only adopted many varying names, such as quantum money, quantum coins, quantum-digital payments, and quantum tokens, but also reached its first experimental demonstrations. In this perspective article, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of quantum tokens in the field of quantum information, as well as their future perspectives. We present a number of physical realizations of quantum tokens with integrated quantum memories and their applicability scenarios in detail. Finally, we discuss how quantum tokens fit into the information security ecosystem and consider their relationship to post-quantum cryptography.

### [4] [Entanglement percolation in random quantum networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10189)
*Alessandro Romancino,Jordi Romero-Pallejà,G. Massimo Palma,Anna Sanpera*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Entanglement percolation improves quantum network entanglement by incorporating node connectivity and existing entanglement levels. For classical percolation, network structure suffices. Quantum percolation struggles with varying entanglement, suggesting room for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum network capabilities under real-world conditions (heterogeneous entanglement levels) is crucial for practical applications. This could enhance secure communication and distributed quantum computing.

Method: Examined the effects of junction architecture and initial entanglement discrepancies using both quantum and classical percolation models.

Result: Quantum percolation performs less effectively than classical methods when initial entanglement is inconsistent.

Conclusion: Adopting classical-like methods with incremental network enhancements may bridge the gap in quantum entanglement management.

Abstract: Entanglement percolation aims at generating maximal entanglement between any two nodes of a quantum network by utilizing strategies based solely on local operations and classical communication between the nodes. As it happens in classical percolation theory, the topology of the network is crucial, but also the entanglement shared between the nodes of the network. In a network of identically partially entangled states, the network topology determines the minimum entanglement needed for percolation. In this work, we generalize the protocol to scenarios where the initial entanglement shared between each two nodes of the network is not the same but has some randomness. In such cases, we find that for classical entanglement percolation, only the average initial entanglement is relevant. In contrast, the quantum entanglement percolation protocol generally performs worse under these more realistic conditions.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between genuine entanglement harvesting and communication mediated correlations for local particle detectors in expanding cosmological spacetimes. Focusing on a conformally coupled scalar field in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze how spacetime expansion induces interference between these two sources of entanglement when the detectors are in causal contact. We compare two physically distinct detector models: detectors whose spatial profile expands with the Universe, and detectors whose proper size remains fixed despite cosmological expansion. We find that the lack of time-reversal symmetry in cosmological settings generically leads to constructive or destructive interference between communication mediated correlations and harvested field correlations, dramatically affecting the entanglement that detectors can acquire. In particular, rapid expansion can suppress entanglement entirely for expanding detectors through destructive interference, even when both communication and field correlations are individually large, whereas detectors that maintain a fixed proper size remain capable of acquiring significant entanglement. Our results show that cosmological expansion qualitatively reshapes the balance between communication and harvesting, and that the detector internal cohesion (whether it expands with the Universe or not) plays a crucial role in determining whether detectors' entanglement can survive in rapidly expanding universes.

Method: 基于互信息公理化，推导扩展的信息因果性原则。

Result: 给出了简化方法计算函数通信复杂度，及推广到量子纠缠约束。

Conclusion: 揭示了量子技术信息论的潜在极限。

Abstract: Communication complexity, which quantifies the minimum communication required for distributed computation, offers a natural setting for investigating the capabilities and limitations of quantum mechanics in information processing. We introduce an information-theoretic approach to study one-way communication complexity based solely on the axioms of mutual information. Within this framework, we derive an extended statement of the information causality principle, which recovers known lower bounds on the communication complexities for a range of functions in a simplified manner and leads to new results. We further prove that the extended information causality principle is at least as strong as the principle of non-trivial communication complexity in bounding the strength of quantum correlations attainable in Bell experiments. Our study establishes a new route for exploring the fundamental limits of quantum technologies from an information-theoretic viewpoint.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A phase-space approach for simulating large qubit registers with classical computers is presented, achieving a quadratic cost in system size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient simulation of large quantum systems, particularly in the context of quantum computing and quantum many-body physics.

Method: A phase-space approach using a statistical ensemble of independent mean-field trajectories, replacing quantum fluctuations with classical ones.

Result: The method allows simulation of up to several thousand qubits with acceptable accuracy for one-qubit observables, though less so for multi-qubit observables.

Conclusion: This approach provides a useful reference for understanding and benchmarking other techniques in quantum spin systems simulation.

Abstract: A phase-space approach is used and benchmarked for the simulation of the continuous-time evolution of large registers of qubits. It is based on a statistical ensemble of independent mean-field trajectories, where mean-field is introduced at the level of the qubits, substituting quantum fluctuations/correlations with classical ones. The approach only involves at worse a quadratic cost in the system size, allowing to simulate up to several thousands of qubits on a classical computer. It provides qualitatively accurate description of one-qubit observables evolutions, making it a useful reference in comparison to techniques limited to small qubit numbers. The predictive power is however less robust for multi-qubits observables. We benchmark the method on the $k$-local transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), considering a large variety of systems ranging from local to all-to-all interactions, and from weak to strong coupling regimes, with up to 2000 qubits. To showcase the versatility of the approach, simulations on 2D and 3D Ising models are also made.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，不定因果顺序可以被用来整合传感和计算任务。这在量子信息处理领域具有重要理论价值和潜在应用前景。

Abstract: Quantum operations with indefinite causal order (ICO) represent a framework in quantum information processing where the relative order between two events can be indefinite. In this paper, we investigate whether sensing and computation, two canonical tasks in quantum information processing, can be carried out within the ICO framework. We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Ions can be 'shelved' in metastable states to control trapped-ion qubit interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how to modify ion lattice geometries is key to tuning qubit interactions, especially in quantum computing applications.

Method: Use of a triangular lattice of three $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions, optical pumping to specific metastable states, and application of an Ising-like Hamiltonian.

Result: Shelved qubits no longer participate in quantum dynamics, metastable state lifetimes found to be significantly long.

Conclusion: This method allows for dynamic control of qubit-qubit interactions by shelving ions, potentially enabling more flexible quantum operations.

Abstract: Trapped-ion lattice geometries, which determine the interactions between trapped-ion qubits, are typically governed by the balance of Coulomb repulsion forces with the external trapping potential. Here we demonstrate how the effective ion lattice geometry and resulting qubit-qubit interactions may be reconfigured in-situ, by shelving specific ions in metastable states outside the qubit subspace. Using a triangular lattice of three $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions, we optically pump selected ions into the long-lived $^2F_{7/2}$ state. We then apply a global Ising-like Hamiltonian to the system and verify that the shelved qubits are fully removed from participation in the quantum dynamics. We characterize the metastable state lifetime in the presence of laser-driven ion-ion interactions, finding a deshelving rate that is orders of magnitude slower than the spin-spin interaction rate and scales quadratically with applied laser intensity.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Classical mechanics, in the Koopman-von Neumann formulation, is described in Hilbert space. It is shown here that classical canonical transformations are generated by Hermitian operators that are in general noncommutative. This naturally brings about uncertainty relations inherent in classical mechanics, for example between position and the generator of space translations, between momentum and the generator of momentum translations, and between dynamical time and the Liouvillian, to name a few. Further, it is shown that the Wigner representation produces a quasi-probability distribution that can take on negative values. Thus, two of the hallmark features of quantum mechanics are reproduced, and become apparent, in a Hilbert-space formulation of classical mechanics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate modeling of open quantum systems with non-Markovian dynamics, which are common in many physical, chemical, and biological processes.

Method: A methodology that builds on memory kernel coupling theory and Mori-Zwanzig projection to transform the memory kernel hierarchy into a system of coupled linear differential equations. It ensures numerical stability by spectral projection onto stable eigenmodes and systematically eliminates unstable modes while preserving the relevant dynamics.

Result: The method shows excellent agreement with exact results from the spin-boson model while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: This approach provides a versatile and reliable framework for simulating non-Markovian dynamics in complex quantum systems.

Abstract: We present a projection-based, stability-preserving methodology for computing time correlation functions in open quantum systems governed by generalized quantum master equations with non-Markovian effects. Building upon the memory kernel coupling theory framework, our approach transforms the memory kernel hierarchy into a system of coupled linear differential equations through Mori-Zwanzig projection, followed by spectral projection onto stable eigenmodes to ensure numerical stability. By systematically eliminating unstable modes while preserving the physically relevant dynamics, our method guaranties long-time convergence without introducing artificial damping or ad hoc modifications. The theoretical framework maintains mathematical rigor through orthogonal projection operators and spectral decomposition. Benchmark calculations on the spin-boson model show excellent agreement with exact hierarchical equations of motion results while achieving significant computational efficiency. This approach provides a versatile and reliable framework for simulating non-Markovian dynamics in complex systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Control pulses that nominally optimize fidelity are sensitive to routine hardware drift and modeling errors. Robust quantum optimal control seeks error-insensitive control pulses that maintain fidelity thresholds and obey hardware constraints. Distinct numerical approximations to the first-order error susceptibility include adjoint end-point and toggling-frame approaches. Although theoretically equivalent, we provide a novel, systematic study demonstrating important numerical differences between these two approaches. We also introduce a critical discretization correction to the widely-used toggling-frame robustness estimator, measurably improving its estimate of first-order error susceptibility. We accomplish our study by positioning robustness as a first-class objective within direct, constrained optimal control. Our approach uniquely handles control and fidelity constraints while cleanly isolating robustness for dedicated optimization. In both single- and two-qubit examples under realistic constraints, our approach provides an analytic edge for obtaining precise, physics-informed robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spectral methods are a leading approach for tensor PCA with a ``spiked" Gaussian tensor. The methods use the spectrum of a linear operator in a vector space with exponentially high dimension and in Ref. 1 it was shown that quantum algorithms could then lead to an exponential space saving as well as a quartic speedup over classical. Here we show how to accelerate both classical and quantum algorithms quadratically, while maintaining the same quartic separation between them. That is, our classical algorithm here is quadratically faster than the original classical algorithm, while the quantum algorithm is eigth-power faster than the original classical algorithm. We then give a further modification of the quantum algorithm, increasing its speedup over the modified classical algorithm to the sixth power. We only prove these speedups for detection, rather than recovery, but we give a strong plausibility argument that our algorithm achieves recovery also.
  Note added: After this paper was prepared, A. Schmidhuber pointed out to me Ref. 3. This improves the best existing bounds on the spectral norm of a certain random operator. Because the norm of this operator enters into the runtime, with this improvement on the norm, we no longer have a provable polynomial speedup. Our results are phrased in terms of certain properties of the spectrum of this operator (not merely the largest eigenvalue but also the density of states). So, if these properties still hold, the speedup still holds. Rather than modify the paper, I have left it unchanged but added a section at the end discussing the needed property of density of states and considering for which problems (there are several problems for which this kind of quartic quantum speedup has been used and the techniques here will likely be applicable to several of them) the property is likely to hold.

Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $ω_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=λC_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-λ\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}ω_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $λ$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $λ$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $Δ(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $Δ$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.

TL;DR: 在本研究中，我们构建了14个超双曲面CSS三维体码，分别来自 {8,3}、{10,3} 和 {12,3} 的多面体展开和11个半超hyperbolic codes。我们模拟了全部25个编码在电路级去化和量子 noise下的表现。结果表明，针对电路级 Pauli 错误，伪阈值会随着代码的增大而提高（{8,3} 码：0.24%-0.49%，{10,3} 码：0.11%-0.43%，{12,3} 码：0.07%-0.13%）。针对去化错误，大多数码的临界错误概率 p_E^*>5%。对于每个可观察的码族，阈值在 Pauli 下为 erasure 到 Pauli 的比率 2.7-3.9 倍。更精细的标量的编码族在 Pauli（0.67%-0.68%）和 erasure（3.0%-3.5%）阈值上更具竞争力，比率分别为4.5-5.2。在泛函噪声下，基于 Z-Channel 的临界阈值约为 {8,3} 码：2%、{10,3} 码：1%、{12,3} 码：<0.5%。

Abstract: We construct 14 hyperbolic CSS surface codes from $\{8,3\}$, $\{10,3\}$, and $\{12,3\}$ tessellations and 11 semi-hyperbolic (fine-grained) codes. We simulate all 25 codes under circuit-level erasure and Pauli noise. Under circuit-level Pauli noise, pseudothresholds increase with code size within each family ($0.24$--$0.49\%$ for $\{8,3\}$, $0.11$--$0.43\%$ for $\{10,3\}$, $0.07$--$0.13\%$ for $\{12,3\}$). For erasure noise, most codes have $p^*_{\mathrm{E}} > 5\%$. Per-observable family thresholds give erasure-to-Pauli ratios of $2.7$--$3.9\times$ for the base code families. Fine-grained scaling families achieve higher thresholds in both Pauli ($0.67$--$0.68\%$) and erasure ($3.0$--$3.5\%$), with ratios of $4.5$--$5.2\times$. Under phenomenological noise, per-logical $Z$-channel thresholds are ${\sim}2\%$ for $\{8,3\}$ and ${\sim}1\%$ for $\{10,3\}$; the $\{12,3\}$ threshold lies below $0.5\%$.

Abstract: When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\varepsilon,δ)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $Θ((\varepsilon β)^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $β$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.

### [18] [Pilot-Wave Theories as Hidden Markov Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10569)
*Jacob A. Barandes*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Bohmian mechanics interprets the pilot wave as a physical entity rather than a law. However, the pilot wave is best seen as hidden variables unlike typical ones in physics. Several challenges exist for interpreting the pilot wave as physical, especially related to gauge transformations and canonical transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interpretation of pilot waves has been a key point in the debate surrounding Bohmian mechanics. This paper aims to clarify the status of the pilot wave as a physical entity.

Method: The paper employs critical analysis of existing theories and evaluates different interpretations based on foundational physics concepts.

Result: The paper concludes that treating the pilot wave as hidden variables is more coherent than as a physical law or typical hidden variables.

Conclusion: Bohmian mechanics can coexist with the idea that pilot waves are hidden variables, which broadens its interpretational flexibility.

Abstract: The original version of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory, also called Bohmian mechanics, attempted to treat the wave function or pilot wave as a part of the physical ontology of nature. More recent versions of the de Broglie-Bohm theory appearing in the last few decades have tried to regard the pilot wave instead as an aspect of the theory's nomology, or dynamical laws. This paper argues that neither of these views is correct, and that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is best understood as a collection of latent variables in the sense of a hidden Markov model, a construct that was not available when de Broglie and Bohm originally formulated what became their pilot-wave theory. This paper also discusses several other challenges for the ontological view of the pilot wave. One such challenge is due to Foldy-Wouthuysen gauge transformations, which connect up with the Deotto-Ghirardi ambiguity in the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Another challenge arises from the freedom to carry out canonical transformations in the wave function's own notion of phase space, as defined by Strocchi and Heslot.

Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for characterizing stable quantum resources between microwave and optical modes in the dynamics of multipartite hybrid quantum systems with intermediary modes. The effective Hamiltonian for microwave-optical (MO) squeezing is formulated via strong interactions in the microwave-intermediary-optical hybrid system, and based on which rigorous solutions for the dynamics of MO entanglement and quantum steering are derived analytically. Remarkably, it is found that stable MO quantum resources can survive in the unsteady evolution beyond the steady one, and the unsteady evolution can exhibit the enhanced quality over the limit of quantum resources in the steady-state case. Furthermore, the stable MO entanglement as well as one-way and two-way quantum steerings are efficiently controllable by modulating the effective coupling strength. The validity of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to the typical models of electro-optomechanical and cavity optomagnomechanical hybrid systems.

Abstract: Block encoding is a successful technique used in several powerful quantum algorithms. In this work we provide an explicit quantum circuit for block encoding a sparse matrix with a periodic diagonal structure. The proposed methodology is based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) framework and on an efficient unitary operator used to project the complex exponential at a frequency $ω$ multiplied by the computational basis into its real and imaginary components. We demonstrate a distinct computational advantage with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(n))$ gate complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits, in the worst-case scenario used for banded matrices, and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ when dealing with a simple diagonal matrix, compared to the exponential scaling of general-purpose methods for dense matrices. Various applications for the presented methodology are discussed in the context of solving differential problems such as the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics, using quantum algorithms with optimal scaling, e.g., quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). Numerical results are used to validate the analytical formulation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The no-cloning theorem forbids the creation of identical copies of qubits, thereby imposing strong limitations on quantum technologies. A recently-proposed protocol, encrypted cloning, showed, however, that the creation of perfect clones is theoretically possible - if the clones are simultaneously encrypted with a single-use decryption key. It has remained an open question, however, whether encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise and thus practical as a quantum primitive. This is nontrivial because spreading quantum information widely could dilute it until barely exceeding the noise level, leading to catastrophic fidelity decay. Given the complexity of hardware noise, theory and classical simulation are insufficient to settle this. Here, we settle this question experimentally, on IBM Heron-R2 superconducting processors using up to 154 qubits. We find that encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise, even when used as a module, namely in parallel, series or interleaved, while preserving pre-existing entanglement. This establishes it as a versatile quantum primitive for practical use, and it necessitates a refinement to our understanding of the no-cloning theorem: quantum information can be spread at will, in theory and in practice, without dilution or degradation, if encrypted or obscured. The actual constraint is that the decryption mechanism must be single-use.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了量子学习的理论框架，还为实际应用中的资源优化提供了指导。

Abstract: Quantum learning from state samples is often benchmarked in a fixed-budget paradigm, relating error to a prescribed number of copies. We instead adopt a stopping-time viewpoint: in minimal-feedback learning, the learning completion can be defined by an online run-length certificate extracted from a one-bit-per-copy record. As an instantiation, we analyze single-shot measurement learning (SSML), introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 98, 052302 (2018)] and [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 170504 (2021)], which tunes a unitary and halts after $M_H$ consecutive successes. Viewing the halting as a sequential certification linking the observed counter to infidelity, we derive sample-complexity bounds that separate search (driving success probability toward unity) from certification (run statistics of consecutive successes). The resulting trade-off among $M_H$, dimension $d$, and one-bit reliability clarifies when performance is control-limited versus certificate-limited. With label-flip noise probability $q$, we find a sharp feasibility threshold: once $qM_H \gtrsim 1$, the expected halting time grows exponentially, making the learning completion impractical even under ideal control. More broadly, this shows that under severely constrained feedback, the certification can dominate sample complexity and small label noise becomes the information bottleneck. Finally, the near-optimal accuracy enabled by run-length certification aligns with the quantum-state-estimation (and equivalently, no-cloning) limits, expressed in the stopping-time terms.

TL;DR: They introduce two new inequalities, WSM and MRSM, which improve upon the generalized Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequality by using weight coefficients instead of exponents and focusing on maximal entanglement. They show how these can distinguish separable states and provide examples using multi-qubit states to demonstrate the trade-offs between entanglement components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original paper likely aimed to explore and better understand the monogamy of multiqubit entanglement, seeking more precise tools to measure and distinguish different entanglement types.

Method: They introduced a new approach by using coefficients rather than exponents to weight contributions and considered maximum residual entanglement. They tested their new inequalities on specific multiqubit states to demonstrate their effectiveness.

Result: WSM and MRSM provide sharper inequalities than the original, allowing for better distinction of separable states and clear illustration of entanglement trade-offs in various multiqubit configurations.

Conclusion: These findings strengthen the understanding of monogamy of entanglement, particularly in multipartite systems, providing clearer methods to quantify and compare entanglement properties.

Abstract: We establish two new inequalities, the weighted strong monogamy (WSM) and the maximum residual strong monogamy (MRSM), which sharpen the generalized Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequity for multiqubit states. The WSM inequality distinguishes itself from the strong monogamy (SM) conjecture [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 110501 (2014)] by using coefficients rather than exponents to modulate the weight allocated to various m-partite contributions. In contrast, the MRSM inequality is formulated using only the maximum m-partite entanglement. We find that the residual entanglement of the MRSM inequality can effectively distinguish the separable states. We also compare the tightness of various SM inequalities and provide examples using a four-qubit mixed state and a five-qubit pure state to illustrate the MRSM inequality. These examples characterize the trade-off relations among entanglement components involving varying numbers of qubits. Our results provide a rigorous framework to characterize and quantify the monogamy of multipartite entanglement.

### [24] [Dimensional advantage in network cooling with hybrid oscillator-qudit systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10683)
*Mrinmoy Samanta,Debkanta Ghosh,Rivu Gupta,Aditi Sen De*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the cooling mechanism for networks of oscillators in a quantum system, where oscillators interact with an auxiliary system via the Jaynes-Cummings interaction. The study reveals that when the auxiliary system is a qubit, perfect cooling is theoretically impossible. However, using higher-dimensional auxiliary systems provides a dimensional advantage, reducing the number of required quantum cycles and efficiently cooling oscillators with higher initial energies. The paper also shows that linear network configurations allow for near-perfect cooling, whereas star networks are less effective. Additionally, the protocol is adaptable to hybrid continuous- and discrete-variable systems, enabling resource generation for non-Gaussian and entangled states.

motivation: The motivation behind this research stems from the challenges in quantum thermodynamics, particularly in achieving efficient cooling of quantum systems, which could have applications in quantum computing and simulation.

method: The researchers employed a combination of theoretical analysis and quantum simulation methods. They derived a mathematical model based on the Jaynes-Cummings interaction and used numerical simulations to analyze the cooling efficiency under various auxiliary system dimensions and network configurations.

result: The key results indicate that qubit auxiliaries limit the cooling efficiency, but higher-dimensional auxiliary systems enhance the cooling process. Linear network configurations are more effective for achieving near-perfect cooling compared to star networks. The protocol is versatile and can be applied to hybrid systems to generate non-Gaussian and entangled quantum resources.

conclusion: This research establishes fundamental limitations and advantages in using different auxiliary systems for cooling quantum oscillator networks. The findings suggest that choosing appropriate network configurations and auxiliary dimensions is crucial for efficient quantum cooling and resource generation in quantum computing and simulation setups.

The researchers also found that linear network configurations allow for near-perfect cooling, while star networks are less effective. Furthermore, the protocol is shown to be adaptable to hybrid continuous- and discrete-variable systems, enabling the generation of non-Gaussian and entangled quantum resources.

Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the limitations and advantages of different auxiliary systems in cooling quantum oscillator networks. The findings demonstrate that the choice of network configuration and auxiliary dimensions plays a crucial role in achieving efficient cooling and resource generation in quantum technologies such as quantum computing and simulation.

Abstract: We examine the cooling of networks of oscillators through repeated unitary evolution followed by conditional measurement on a finite-dimensional auxiliary system, coupled via Jaynes-Cummings type interaction. We prove that near-perfect cooling of the oscillator to vacuum is fundamentally impossible when the auxiliary system is a qubit, establishing a no-cooling theorem for a two-level regulator. Moving beyond this limitation, we reveal a twofold dimensional advantage of higher-dimensional auxiliaries - reducing the number of required cycles, and enabling the efficient cooling of oscillators with higher initial energies. We further show that, while extending the network leads to a saturation of this dimensional advantage at moderate auxiliary dimensions, near-perfect cooling remains achievable for linear network configurations but fails for star networks. Moreover, we highlight the adaptability of the proposed protocol by demonstrating efficient cooling of hybrid continuous- and discrete-variable systems that naturally support the generation of non-Gaussian and entangled quantum resources.

### [25] [Magneto-optical properties of the neutral silicon-vacancy center in diamond under extreme isotropic strain fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10690)
*Meysam Mohseni,Gergő Thiering,Adam Gali*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates the neutral silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{0}$) center in diamond under various strains, showing that it maintains its optical and symmetry properties despite significant compressional and tensile strains. The SiV$^{0}$ center exhibits structural instabilities due to doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels, modeled by a quadratic Jahn-Teller framework. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line shifts blue, and the dark transition shows limited activity. In tensile strain, vibronic effects dominate. The center remains photostable up to about 100 GPa, where the radiative lifetime increases due to reduced transition dipole moment despite rising optical energy. This provides a tunable quantum emitter for optically controlled applications in extreme strains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving and controlling extreme mechanical strains in diamond-based systems for optically-controlled applications is a critical goal in quantum optics and solid-state physics. Such a system could enable novel optomechanical effects and robust quantum emitters under strain.

Method: First-principles density-functional theory calculations with explicit modeling of vibrational modes and electronic structure under isotropic strain conditions.

Result: The findings reveal a symmetry-protected quantum emitter whose optical emission properties remain stable under isotropic compressional strain but show enhanced structural instability and increased spin-orbit coupling under tensile strain. Additionally, the radiative lifetime is found to increase at high compression, despite increased optical transition energies.

Conclusion: The SiV$^{0}$ neutral center in diamond exhibits resilience to isotropic compression (up to ~80 GPa) and strain舞蹈 (up to ~180 GPa) while maintaining its functionality as a robust two-dimensional optical quantum emitter. This strain-tunable property along with its high symmetry provides a foundation for asymmetric strain engineering of other diamond-centered vacancy defects, opening new avenues in ultra-large strain optics and strain-tunable devices.

Abstract: The neutral silicon--vacancy (SiV$^{0}$) center in diamond combines inversion symmetry with optical emission, making it a robust quantum emitter resilient to stray electric fields. Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy. These trends yield compact calibration relations linking optical and spin observables to isotropic strain and establish SiV$^{0}$ as a symmetry-protected, strain-tunable quantum emitter operating into the multi-megabar-equivalent regime.

Abstract: We develop error-tolerant quantum state discrimination(QSD) strategies that maintain reliable performance under moderate noise. Two complementary approaches are proposed: CrossQSD, which generalizes unambiguous discrimination with tunable confidence bounds to balance accuracy and efficiency, and FitQSD, which optimizes the measurement outcome distribution to approximate that of the ideal noiseless case. Furthermore, we provide a unified hybrid-objective QSD framework that continuously interpolates between minimum-error discrimination (MED) and FitQSD, allowing flexible trade-offs among competing objectives. The associated optimization problems are formulated as convex programs and efficiently solved via disciplined convex programming or, in many cases, semidefinite programming. Additionally, a circuit synthesis framework based on a modified Naimark dilation and isometry synthesis enables hardware-efficient implementations with substantially reduced qubit and gate resources. An open-source toolkit automates the full optimization and synthesis workflow, providing a practical route to QSD on current quantum devices.

By combining these tools, we demonstrate a computationally efficient protocol that enables the construction of an approximate ground state from a unitary coupled cluster ansatz via a single sweep over the operator pool. Utilizing efficient classical pre-processing to select the majority of relevant operators, this approach reduces the computational complexity associated with traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, we show that this method can be seamlessly integrated with one-variational-parameter couple exchange operators, thereby further reducing the number of required CNOT operations. Overall, we empirically observe a quadratic convergence speedup beyond state-of-the-art methods, advancing the realization of quantum advantage in quantum chemistry.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems, due to the existence of exceptional point (or ring, surface), exhibit exotic topological features which are inaccessible with the Hermition ones. Current studies on NH topology mainly focus on pure states at zero temperature, while those on mixed states remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the topological properties of mixed states in two-dimentional NH systems, by use of the Uhlmann phase and the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number which are structured via the Uhlmann connection at specific temperatures, revealing distinct topological features compared to their pure state counterparts. We further extend our study to the mixed states in the three-dimensional Abelian and four-dimentional non-Abelian NH systems and verify the high-order mixed-state topology. Our study provides a conceptual and practical pathway for exploring topological properties in the mixed-state regime of NH physics.

Abstract: Controlling ensembles of weakly coupled spins typically requires computationally expensive multispin optimisations. We present a compact framework that enables control of weakly coupled spin systems (of any spin), but using RF pulses optimised for a single spin-1/2. We do this by explicitly creating a GRAPE pulse with fixed 'active' evolution times using single spin-1/2 methods, and pulsing on one spin at a time. By enforcing this form uniformly across offsets ('band-schematic' pulses),chemical shift and scalar coupling evolution of the entire system can be precisely controlled. We demonstrate the approach by constructing band-schematic pulses and a continuously irradiated joint INEPT (JINEPT) that achieves band-selective transfer $I_z \rightarrow 2I_zS_z$. The framework is implemented in the software Seedless, which both rapidly generates such pulses and analyses the schematic form of arbitrary pulses, enabling robust multi-spin control, without multi-spin optimisation.

Abstract: Quantum technologies are powered by platforms to generate complex non-classical states of matter or light to realize applications. We investigate the non-classical properties of high-harmonic generation in semiconductors, an emerging photonic platform. Measuring the click statistics of three double-digit orders, we evaluate witness operators to certify the non-classicality of the generated states. We show that higher-order harmonics driven by a coherent laser are squeezed and entangled. The properties of the emission are well retrieved with an entangled Gaussian state model, obtained by numerical state optimization to multiple observables. Additionally, we perform inter-order heralded measurements to engineer the quantum state of the emission. The heralded states have distinct properties, showing anti-bunched photon statistics. Further, we witness the generation of a quantum non-Gaussian state, a resource highly relevant for quantum information. With this, we establish high-harmonic generation as a platform for generating quantum optical resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors motivate the use of QUBO formulations given the growing interest in quantum computing and the need for efficient solutions to NP-hard optimization problems.

Result: The QUBO formulations are effective, and WS-QAOA with warm-start strategies outperforms classical methods, demonstrating potential in quantum optimization.

Conclusion: This work bridges QUBO formulations with quantum hardware, offering practical benchmarks and insights for future quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and the increasing availability of quantum hardware have substantially enhanced the practical relevance of quantum approaches to discrete optimization. Among these, the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation provides a unifying modeling framework for a broad class of $\mathbf{NP}$-hard problems and is naturally suited to quantum computing and quantum-inspired algorithms. Location science, network design, and logistics represent core application domains of discrete optimization, combining high practical impact with substantial computational challenges. In this work, we develop QUBO formulations for several fundamental problems in these domains, including a nonlinear integer formulation of the Discrete Ordered Median Problem (DOMP). Beyond their modeling relevance, these QUBO formulations serve as representative benchmark problems for assessing quantum algorithms and quantum hardware. We further derive a tight bound for the penalty parameter ensuring equivalence between the QUBO formulation and its underlying integer program. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive computational study using QAOA, WS-QAOA, and classical heuristics for QUBO instances of the $p$-Median Problem and the Fixed-Charge Facility Location Problem (FCFLP), and introduce two effective warm-start strategies for WS-QAOA based on its linear programming relaxation.

Abstract: Finding optimal solutions of conflicting objectives is a daily matter in many industrial applications, with multi-objective optimization trying to find the best solutions to them. The advent of quantum computing has led to researchers wondering if the promised exponential advantage can be obtained for these problems by variational quantum multi-objective optimization (QMOO) algorithm. Here, we improve it by introducing a Pareto Archive and dominated solutions substitution, clearly improving in hyper-volume convergence at additional quantum and classical cost. We propose the use of RMNK-landscapes as a unifying testbed for benchmarking QMOO, as it is common in classical multi-objective field. By devising a generic classical-to-quantum mapping of these landscapes, we perform a numerical hyperparameter tuning of QMOO, significantly enhancing its performance. Finally, we compare QMOO against well-known classical solvers for multi-objective tasks, NSGA-II/III, showing comparable results in small instances. Our results demonstrate that QMOO, when carefully tuned for the task at hand, might be advantageous on harder problems than its classical counterparts.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a recirculating quantum photonic network (RQPN) that significantly reduces the temporal overhead of multi-qubit gates, enabling deterministic photonic quantum information processing with reduced requirements on nonlinear interaction rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic quantum information processing using photons presents challenges due to decoherence and loss. This paper addresses this by proposing a novel architecture that enhances efficiency.

Method: The authors developed a RQPN architecture consisting of all-to-all connected nonlinear cavities with dynamically controlled waveguide couplings. They demonstrated the architecture's advantage by implementing faster operations for multi-qubit gates and achieving significant speedups in loss correction.

Result: The RQPN proved faster than single- and two-qubit decompositions of the Toffoli gate and achieved up to seven-fold speedups in measurement-free loss correction, with improved hardware efficiency.

Conclusion: The RQPN architecture effectively reduces temporal overhead, making multi-qubit gate operations and quantum error correction more feasible, thus advancing deterministic photonic quantum computing.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in photonics-based deterministic quantum information processing is to realize key transformations on time scales shorter than those of detrimental decoherence and loss mechanisms. This challenge has been addressed through device-focused approaches that aim to increase nonlinear interactions relative to decoherence rates. In this work, we adopt a complementary architecture-focused approach by proposing a recirculating quantum photonic network (RQPN) that minimizes the duration of quantum information processing tasks, thereby reducing the requirements on nonlinear interaction rates. The RQPN consists of a network of all-to-all connected nonlinear cavities with dynamically controlled waveguide couplings, and it processes information by capturing a photonic input state, recirculating photons between the cavities, and releasing a photonic output state. We demonstrate the RQPN's architectural advantage through two examples: first, we show that processing all qubits simultaneously yields faster operations than single- and two-qubit decompositions of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. Second, we demonstrate implementations of a measurement-free correction for single-photon loss, achieving up to seven-fold speedups and significantly improved hardware efficiency relative to state-of-the-art architecture proposals. Our work shows that a single hardware-efficient recirculating architecture substantially reduces the temporal overhead of multi-qubit gates and quantum error correction, thereby lowering the barrier to experimental realizations of deterministic photonic quantum information processing.

*Kevin Shen,Susanne Pielawa,Vedran Dunjko,Hao Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the trainability and potential quantum advantage of IQP-QCBMs by deriving analytic expressions for loss gradient variances and demonstrating how initialization parameters affect their ability to scale polynomially and avoid exponentially vanishing gradients. It also supports the notion that sparse IQP families may provide classically intractable distributions at least in the initial training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the trainability and quantum advantage of quantum generative models is crucial for advancing quantum machine learning.

Method: Analytical derivations of gradient variances, analysis of generator sets and kernel spectra, initialization studies including uniform initialization, theoretical bounds, and sparse IQP family analysis.

Result:  IQP-QCBMs with certain kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression, small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial gradient behavior, and sparse IQP families may offer quantum tractability.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to addressing the barren plateau issue and support the use of IQP-QCBMs in quantum machine learning scenarios.

Abstract: Instantaneous quantum polynomial quantum circuit Born machines (IQP-QCBMs) have been proposed as quantum generative models with a classically tractable training objective based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and a potential quantum advantage motivated by sampling-complexity arguments, making them an exciting model worth deeper investigation. While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.

TL;DR: 研究发现，量子马姆巴效应中存在所谓“热力学能动性马姆巴交点”（EMC），即两种量子电池的能动性变化趋势交点。对于二能级电池，在经历耗散噪声后，EMC的产生与初始态的相干性有关，并且对三能级电池不适用。进一步研究表明，非马尔可夫环境可能产生多处EMC，而马尔可夫环境只能产生一处。最后发现，对于二能级体系，EMC必然伴随着通常的马姆巴效应，而对于高能级体系则可能不对应。

Motivation: 量子马姆巴效应是一个违反直觉的现象，尤其是在有限维量子电池与环境相互作用的情况下。通过引入“能动性马姆巴交点”这一概念，研究者探讨了不同初态条件下EMC的产生条件及其对初态空间区域的影响。基于这一研究，进一步推导出在受各向异性保罗噪声作用下，EMC的产生与初态的相干性及能量共同关联。

Method: 研究采用数学分析和数值模拟的方法。利用对二能级和三能级系统进行态的参数化，设定初始态的参数范围及噪声模型，进而推导和分析EMC的条件。

Result: 1. 初态的相对相干性决定了二能级电池是否与固定参考态存在EMC。2. 在受各向异性保罗噪声作用下，初态的能动性与相干性共同决定EMC的存在与否。3. 在多能级系统中，非马尔可夫环境可能导致多处EMC，而马尔可夫环境只能产生一处。4. 对于二能级系统，EMC必然伴随着马姆巴效应，但对于高能级系统则不一定。

Conclusion: 这一研究扩展了马姆巴效应的研究范围，揭示了能动性的马姆巴效应与传统状态马姆巴效应的区别。特别发现，二能级系统中，EMC必然伴随着马姆巴效应，而高能级体系则不一定。这为量子电池在复杂环境中的性能研究提供新视角。

Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.

Conclusion: 该方法为超导量子计算中的TLS分析提供了一种有效且灵活的工具，在无需调整Transmon频率的情况下，能够识别和分析TLS对频率稳定性的影响。

Abstract: Transmon qubits are a cornerstone of modern superconducting quantum computing platforms. Temporal fluctuations of energy relaxation in these qubits are widely attributed to microscopic two-level systems (TLSs) in device dielectrics and interfaces, yet isolating individual defects typically relies on tuning the qubit or the TLS into resonance. We demonstrate a novel spectroscopy method for fixed-frequency transmons based on multilevel relaxation: repeated preparation of the second excited state and simultaneous $T_1$ extraction of the first and second excited states reveals characteristic correlations in the decay rates of adjacent transitions. From these correlations we identify one or more dominant TLSs and reconstruct their frequency drift over time. Remarkably, we find that TLSs detuned by $\gtrsim 100\,\mathrm{MHz}$ from the qubit transition can still significantly influence relaxation. The proposed method provides a powerful tool for TLS spectroscopy without the need to tune the transmon frequency, either via a flux-tunable inductor or AC-Stark shifts.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发基于α-T3材料的分层间距状器件提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The sublattice-symmetry breaking in the $α-T_3$ lattice leads to a bandgap opening. A defect line in the substrate on which the $α-T_3$ lattice is deposited can be viewed as a topological change in the substrate that induces translational in-plane symmetry breaking, resulting in mid-gap states. These topologically protected states are confined along the defect line and exhibit preferential directional motion, with different signs for the different Dirac valleys. Within this context, we investigate how these unidirectional interface chiral states are affected in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and how they can be tuned by varying the controlling system parameter $α$. The latter tunes the $α-T_3$ structure from a honeycomb-like lattice ($α=0$) to a dice lattice ($α=1$). Our theoretical framework is based on the continuum approximation described by a $3\times 3$ matrix Hamiltonian with a sublattice symmetry-breaking term given by $Δ(x) diag(1,\quad -1,\quad 1)$, assuming $Δ(x)$ as a kink-like mass potential profile. Results for dispersion relations and wavefunction distributions for different $α$ parameters and magnetic field amplitudes are discussed. We demonstrate lifting of Landau levels degeneracy and of valley degeneracy. Our findings pave the way for proposing valley filter devices based on any evolutionary stage between the honeycomb-like and dice lattice structures of the $α-T_3$ phase, controlled by external fields.

Abstract: In this work, we numerically investigate linear thermal noise in a four-terminal system with a finite Berry curvature dipole (BCD) using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. By comparing with the semiclassical results for bulk systems, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between terminal-resolved linear noise in multi-terminal systems and direction-resolved noise in bulk transport. Specifically, the auto-correlation function scales as $2 k_B T$ when the driving field is perpendicular to the BCD and vanishes when they are parallel, whereas the cross-correlation scales as $k_B T$. Both the auto- and cross-correlation functions exhibit pronounced peaks near the band edges, consistent with BCD-induced features. In addition, the linear thermal noise increases approximately linearly with $T$ at low temperatures and is suppressed by dephasing effect at high temperatures. Our work bridges semiclassical bulk theory and quantum multi-terminal theory for linear thermal noise, highlighting the symmetry(geometry)-selection rule in quantum transport.

Abstract: We investigate fractional edge modes in moire fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, focusing on the role of lattice momentum conservation and umklapp scattering. For the hierarchical nu=2/3 state, we show that, for a class of microscopic edge realizations, moire-enabled umklapp processes can stabilize the Kane-Fisher-Polchinski fixed point even in the absence of disorder.Our results illustrate how lattice momentum constraints can qualitatively reshape the interaction structure and low-energy behavior of fractional edge modes. The study of Umklapp processes in edge reconstruction serves as a crucial bridge to understanding thermal and electrical transport in the hierarchical fractional quantum anomalous Hall states found in lattice systems of quantum simulators.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the use of high-impedance edge plasmons in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator for dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the application of edge plasmons in cavity quantum electrodynamics, particularly in achieving high-impedance interactions for quantum state manipulation and detection.

Method: The authors use a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator with edge plasmons to interact with a double quantum dot system, measuring the phase shift in microwave transmission to detect the qubit state.

Result: The experiment shows good agreement with cQED theory, confirming the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state. The high impedance of the plasmon resonator allows for spectroscopy with a broad bandwidth.

Conclusion: This work establishes two-dimensional topological insulators as a promising platform for cavity quantum electrodynamics applications, particularly in qubit detection and manipulation.

Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides strong light-matter interactions that can be used for manipulating and detecting quantum states. The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ νe^2$ that can exceed 10 k$Ω$ for the Landau-level filling factor $ν\leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED.

Abstract: In twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs), atomic reconstruction gives rise to moiré domains with alternating ferroelectric polarization, whose domain size and overall electric dipole moment are tunable by an out-of-plane electric field. Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moiré domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moiré domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moiré domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moiré domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs).

Abstract: The dispersion of Rashba-split heavy-hole subbands in GaAs two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) is difficult to access experimentally because strong heavy-hole-light-hole mixing produces non-parabolicity and breaks the usual correspondence between carrier density and Fermi wave vector. Here we use low-field magnetotransport (B < 1 T) to reconstruct the dispersions of the two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole branches (HH-, HH+) in undoped (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunction 2DHGs operated in an accumulation-mode field-effect geometry. The dopant-free devices sustain out-of-plane electric fields up to 26 kV/cm while maintaining mobilities up to 84 m$^2$/Vs and exhibiting a spin-orbit polarization as large as 36%. Fourier analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations resolves the individual HH-/HH+ subband densities; fitting the temperature dependence of the corresponding Fourier amplitudes yields both branch-resolved SdH effective masses over the same magnetic field window. SdH regimes in which reliable subband parameters can be extracted are delineated. Over 2DHG densities (0.76-1.9) $\times$ 10$^{15}$ /m$^2$, the HH- mass is nearly density independent ($\approx 0.34m_e$), implying a near-parabolic HH- dispersion below the first LH+/HH- anticrossing, whereas HH+ exhibits strong non-parabolicity with an effective mass that increases with density. Combining the extracted dispersions yields a transport-based determination of the spin-orbit splitting energy $Δ_\text{HH}$ between HH and HH+ as a function of in-plane wave vector. Parameter-free Luttinger-model calculations reproduce the qualitative trends but underestimate both masses by a common factor $\approx$ 2, suggesting a many-body renormalization of the heavy-hole mass in this strongly asymmetric regime.

Abstract: Open quantum systems are often described by a Lindblad master equation, which relies on a set of approximations, most importantly the rotating-wave approximation which is only valid for weak damping. In the Lindblad setting, dissipative processes are described through jump operators, distinguishing between absorption and emission of photons. This enables the simple identification of emitted photons which provides a straightforward way to obtain the radiation statistics. Outside the rotating-wave limit, the Lindblad approach does not work. Open quantum systems can then be described by, e.g., the quantum Langevin equation. However, in this framework the number of emitted photons is not easily accessible. In this work, we point out how to obtain the photon counting statistics from a quantum Langevin equation and provide an expression for the photon current operator, for arbitrary systems coupled to linear environments. As an example, we employ the method to study the radiation statistics of a damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature beyond the rotating-wave approximation. We show that even outside the rotating-wave limit, the most important contribution to the radiation statistics can be captured by an effective Lindblad equation, thus extending the range of possible applications of the Lindblad framework.

Abstract: Isomerization in molecular systems almost invariably occurs through 3-dimensional motion due to the nature of chemical bonding. Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM "kite" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., "teardrop"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally.

Abstract: This work investigates the Floquet dynamics of electrons and excitons (particle-hole pairs) in a Dirac material referred to as Kekulé-distorted graphene. Specifically, we examine the role played by a high frequency driving electromagnetic field on the tunneling and blocking by a potential barrier on both the charged single particles as well as the neutral composite particles. We demonstrate that the small effective masses of the electron and hole for the energy spectrum of this Kekulé distorted graphene leads to practically almost perfect transmission across a symmetric potential barrier for any angle of incidence of impinging excitons. However, this unexpected Klein paradox for excitons does not hold for the single-particle electrons. The reduced total transmission of electron due to Kekulé distortion is more suppressed due to irradiation. Additionally, we calculate and investigate the exciton binding energy since the quantum tunneling of a bound electron-hole pair across a potential barrier is governed by its mass measured in the center of mass and binding energy of the composite pair. Thus, irradiation with circularly polarized light fundamentally modifies exciton formation, coherence and transport properties, thereby producing unusual topological behaviors. These behaviors are unlike conventional Dirac materials. Possible technical applications of the results arising from our investigation include valleytronics due to the folding of the valleys, thereby making intervalley coupling feasible. Other practical applications include optoelectronics due to Floquet tuning of energy spectrum and transport properties.

Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to boundary conditions, typically manifesting as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under open boundaries. By bridging the boundaries with a tunable impurity bond, one can access intermediate regimes where scale-free localization (SFL) can emerge. Here, we investigate the competition between such boundary coupling and quasiperiodic disorder in a non-reciprocal lattice. Our analyses reveal a quasiperiodicity-induced breakdown of the SFL regime, which evolves into either the NHSE or an extended regime, depending on boundary conditions. These results uncover the crucial role of quasiperiodicity in non-Hermitian systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-precision laser frequency stabilization is crucial for metrology and coherent signal generation.

Method: Two 1550 nm lasers are used, with one frequency-doubled to 775 nm. The second-harmonic (SH) signal (f_Sh) maps the frequency of one laser to an electronic signal via microwave detection. The technology's sensitivity and noise stability are evaluated.

Result: The frequency mapping SH accurately represents frequency drift, and the technique shows sensitivity to enhance long-term stability.

Conclusion: This method provides a robust method for achieving long-term frequency stability in compact laser sources.

Abstract: The resonant modes of optical cavities provide a powerful resource for laser-frequency stabilization, underpinning high-precision metrology and coherent signal generation. Photonic resonators in which the optical mode propagates through material offer a compact alternative to vacuum Fabry-Perot cavity systems, but their performance is limited by sensitivity of the material to the ambient environment. In this work, we explore second-harmonic (SH) stabilization, which exploits the interplay of a dispersive mode structure against the strict energy conservation of second-harmonic generation. Operationally, we use two, 1550 nm lasers to PDH-detect octave-spaced resonant modes of an ultra-high-Q photonic resonator with one laser frequency-doubled to 775 nm. Under SH stabilization, the microwave frequency offset between the 1550 nm lasers, which we refer to as the SH signal ($f_{SH}$) maps the absolute frequency of the 1550 nm laser to an electronic signal. We characterize this mapping through comparison of the absolute optical frequency inference provided by $f_{SH}$ to an out-of-loop optical measurement, and our results suggest $f_{SH}$ accurately proxies frequency drift. We evaluate the sensitivity and noise floor of this technique, considering contributions from laser locking and bulk material properties, and conclude that $f_{SH}$ is sufficiently sensitive to enhance long-term laser-frequency stability with respect to the resonator. These results demonstrate SH stabilization as a useful technique that infers absolute drift, thereby enabling the increased stability of future compact, precision frequency references.

Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics predicts that the vacuum must behave as a nonlinear optical medium:the vacuum optical index should increase when vacuum is stressed by intense electromagnetic fields.The DeLLight (Deflection of Light by Light) project aims to measure it by using intense and ultra-short laser pulses delivered by the LASERIX facility at IJCLab (Paris-Saclay University). Theprinciple is to measure by interferometry the deflection of a low-intensity probe pulse when crossingthe vacuum optical index gradient produced by an external high-intensity pump pulse. The detectionof the expected signal requires measuring the position of the interference intensity profile with a highspatial resolution, limited by the ultimate quantum noise. However, the spatial resolution is highlydegraded by the phase noise induced by the mechanical vibrations of the interferometer. In order tosuppress this interferometric phase noise, we have developed a new method, named High-FrequencyPhase Noise Suppression (HFPNS) method, based on the use of a delayed reference signal to correctany noise-related signal appearing in the probe beam. In this work, we present the experimentalvalidation of this novel method. The results demonstrate a robust path toward picometer-scalesensitivity and provide a key step toward the observation of QED-induced vacuum refraction.

Abstract: Inverting design method of solving passive graded materials from predefined amplitude and phase was developed along the line of transformation optics (TO), which however precludes the presence of source and sink in the pragmatic world. So in this Letter we extend such an inverse method to non-Hermitian media, offering more freedom to manipulate the wave flows. Our principle of a curved-space analogue picture powered with gain and loss, is exemplified by three types: amplitude controlling, phase conversion, and direction shunting. Our numeric examples showcase precise wave manipulation in a surprisingly simple manner, which goes beyond convectional paradigms of TO and is readily implementable in realistic photonic platform.

Abstract: We present a reference-free computational wavefront sensor based on binary amplitude modulation and phase retrieval. The method employs Digital Micro-mirror Device as a programmable amplitude modulator and reconstructs the complex optical field from multiple far-field intensity measurements using the Reweighted Amplitude Flow algo-rithm with Optimal Spectral Initialization. Unlike classical pupil-plane wavefront sen-sors, the proposed architecture does not include any wavelength-specific optical elements, enabling straightforward adaptation across a broad spectral range. The achievable spatial resolution of the reconstructed wavefront is scalable with the modulator resolution. We experimentally demonstrate wavefront reconstruction at 650 nm and at 2116 nm, where commercial wavefront sensors are not widely available. The reconstructed wavefront is validated against a commercial lateral shearing interferometer at 650 nm, and the method is further integrated into a closed-loop adaptive optics system using a deformable mirror. The approach is particularly suited for applications requiring high spatial resolution and large dynamic range in slowly varying or quasi-static laser fields, where computational reconstruction speed is not of the primary concern.

Abstract: Coherent virtual absorption refers to time-limited storage of optical energy in lossless configurations due to excitation of a complex zero frequency through proper temporal engineering of the incident wave. Given the dynamics underlying the effect and the storage-release mechanism occurring for finite excitation pulses, studying and understanding the associated time dynamics are crucial for enabling future applications. In this work, we carefully investigate this phenomenon in symmetric and asymmetric geometries, shedding light on practical considerations in situations when a closed-form analytical solution is not readily available. Combinations of time domain analysis and spectral filtering are used to enable systematic analysis of these structures. Our approach can be generalized to more complex structures, including multilayered and inhomogeneous cases, providing new opportunities for optimized energy storage and advanced sensing applications utilizing complex-frequency dynamics in lossless designs.

Motivation: Interpreting NMR spectra at scale is challenging and requires expert knowledge. The success of machine learning in other domains motivates addressing this issue.

Method: They constructed NMRSpec by mining experimental NMR spectra from literature and developed NMRTrans, a Transformer that models spectra as unordered peak sets with inductive bias aligned with NMR physics.

Result: NMRTrans outperforms the strongest baseline by +17.82 points (61.15% top-10 accuracy), demonstrating the effectiveness of experimental data and structure-aware architectures.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the importance of using experimental data and physics-informed models for enhancing NMR structure elucidation.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is fundamental for molecular structure elucidation, yet interpreting spectra at scale remains time-consuming and highly expertise-dependent. While recent spectrum-as-language modeling and retrieval-based methods have shown promise, they rely heavily on large corpora of computed spectra and exhibit notable performance drops when applied to experimental measurements. To address these issues, we build NMRSpec, a large-scale corpus of experimental $^1$H and $^{13}$C spectra mined from chemical literature, and propose NMRTrans, which models spectra as unordered peak sets and aligns the model's inductive bias with the physical nature of NMR. To our best knowledge, NMRTrans is the first NMR Transformer trained solely on large-scale experimental spectra and achieves state-of-the-art performance on experimental benchmarks, improving Top-10 Accuracy over the strongest baseline by +17.82 points (61.15% vs. 43.33%), and underscoring the importance of experimental data and structure-aware architectures for reliable NMR structure elucidation.

TL;DR: FIB irradiation can be used to control spin-wave dispersion in YIG, and the dispersion changes can be explained by magnetoelastic effects due to lattice dislocations. The phenomenon is supported by experimental data and micromagnetic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spin waves are important for analog computing, and FIB irradiation allows precise control of their properties. Understanding the mechanisms behind this control is essential for developing new computing technologies.

Method: Experiments were conducted using FIB irradiation on YIG samples, followed by AFM imaging to measure local height profiles. These profiles were used as geometric constraints in trMOKE measurements to analyze spin-wave dispersion. A magnetoelastic field term was added to the dispersion model to fit the data.

Result: The study reveals that FIB-induced spin-wave steering occurs through magnetoelastic effects, with three distinct deformation regimes (elastic, plastic, partial amorphization). The non-monotonic dependence of spin-wave wavelength on ion dose is explained by these regimes. Experimental data, including spin-wave dispersion curves and magnetoelastic field trends, align with micromagnetic simulations.

Conclusion: This work provides a physical foundation for using FIB to create graded-index spin-wave landscapes and magnetoelastically programmable magnonic devices, paving the way for novel analog computing applications.

Abstract: Spin waves are promising information carriers for analog and wave-based computing, requiring compact and precisely engineered scattering landscapes. Focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation enables such control by locally modifying the spin-wave dispersion in yttrium iron garnet (YIG), yet the underlying crystallographic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present an experimentally validated framework that attributes FIB-induced spin-wave steering to magnetoelastic effects arising from irradiation-induced lattice dislocations. Following FIB irradiation and wet-chemical etching, local height profiles were obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and used as fixed geometric constraints in fits of spin-wave dispersion relations measured by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (trMOKE) microscopy. The dispersion relation was extended by an explicit magnetoelastic field term, treated as a fit parameter. Its evolution reveals three successive deformation regimes, elastic, plastic, and partial amorphization, explaining the observed non-monotonic dependence of the spin-wave wavelength on ion dose. A three-phase deformation scenario based on SRIM simulations reproduces the extracted magnetoelastic field trends, validating the fitting approach. Micromagnetic simulations incorporating strain tensors derived from the experimental magnetoelastic field reproduce the characteristic non-monotonic wavelength behavior. These results establish a physical basis for FIB-engineered graded-index (GRIN) spin-wave landscapes and magnetoelastically programmable magnonic devices.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate four-wave mixing (FWM) of matter waves in two geometric configurations in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates with the atomic interaction tuned via Feshbach resonances. For one configuration with the single-spin component, the FWM yield increases with a larger scattering length. For the two-spin component configuration, we specifically investigate FWM in both the droplet and gas parameter regimes. We find that the FWM yield reaches its maximum near the critical parameter region between the gas and droplet phases. Our research can help to optimize the FWM yield for matter-wave amplification and entangled atom pair generation, making it conducive to applications in quantum information processing and precision measurement.

Abstract: We investigate a weakly interacting two-component Bose--Einstein condensate in the miscible regime in the presence of \emph{altermagnetism}, i.e., a collinear and globally compensated magnetic order that breaks spin-rotation symmetry while maintaining zero net magnetization. Within Bogoliubov theory, we derive the quasiparticle spectrum and coherence factors and show that altermagnetic order generically induces an angular dependence of the low-energy excitations. As a result, the sound velocity, momentum-resolved magnetization in the quantum depletion, and density--spin response functions acquire anisotropic components. We show that these anisotropic contributions vanish after angular averaging, consistent with the defining feature of altermagnetism: nontrivial local spin polarization without a global magnetization. Finally, we evaluate the Lee--Huang--Yang correction to the ground-state energy in the altermagnetic phase. Our results should be testable with ultracold-atom experiments in the foreseeable future.

Abstract: We present the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a radio-frequency based time-to-position conversion system for keV electrons incorporating a helical deflector operating in the 400-1000 MHz range. The device performs circular deflection of the electrons when driven by a single RF frequency and enables spiral scanning when two phase-locked RF voltages with slightly different frequencies are applied. The superposition of the two phase-locked RF voltages produces an amplitude-beating field whose slowly varying envelope modulates the deflection radius, transforming the circular scan into a controlled spiral on the detector plane. A detailed theoretical model describing the electron dynamics under two phase-locked RF voltages with different frequencies was derived, yielding analytical expressions for the transverse velocity and radius-vector components at the deflector exit. Spiral scanning will allow measurements with picosecond resolution in a time range 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the period of the circular scanning.

Abstract: A generalization for the quantum information retrieval protocol recently illustrated by Verlinde and van der Heijden for evaporating black holes is provided to inclusions of type III von Neumann factors. The physical interest of such scenario arises in Quantum Field Theory, where local algebras are type III von Neumann algebras. The formula obtained can be easily interpreted in terms of the statistical dimension of superselection sectors in the case of black holes undergoing charge evaporation, thanks to the index-statistics theorem, leading to a thermodynamic interpretation. A constraint on the values of the index leads to a final remark about the quantization of the charge emitted by the black hole during the evaporation process.

Abstract: We numerically construct a one-parameter family of critical spacetimes in arbitrary continuous dimensions D>3. This generalizes Choptuik's D=4 solution to spherically symmetric massless scalar-field collapse at the threshold of D-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole formation. We refer to these solutions, which share the discrete self-similarity of their four-dimensional counterpart, as critical spacetime crystals. Our main results are the echoing period and Choptuik exponent of the crystals as continuous functions of D, with detailed data for the interval 3.05<D<5.5. Notably, the echoing period has a maximum near D=3.76. As a by-product, we recover the echoing periods and Choptuik exponents in D=4 (5): Delta=3.445453 (3.22176) and gamma=0.373961 (0.41322). We support these numerical results with analytical expansions in 1/D and D-3. They suggest that both the echoing period and Choptuik exponent vanish as D approaches 3 from above. This paves the way for a small-(D-3) expansion, paralleling the large-$D$ expansion of general relativity. We also extend our results to two-dimensional dilaton gravity.

Abstract: We show that scalar field fluctuations alone can drive cosmic acceleration, provided the universe is spatially closed and the Compton wavelength of the field exceeds the radius of curvature. This mechanism may open new perspectives on inflation and dark energy, which could arise from a gas of sufficiently light bosons in a closed universe.

Conclusion: This work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production as a potential dark matter mechanism and demonstrates the power of analog experiments in studying quantum effects in curved spacetimes.

Abstract: This thesis investigates cosmological particle production within Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes, both as a dark matter mechanism and through analog simulations using Bose-Einstein condensates. While a full theory of Quantum Gravity remains elusive, studying quantum fields on curved backgrounds provides essential insights into the early Universe. We focus on how dynamical spacetimes, particularly during inflation, generate particles from spectator fields influenced solely by geometry.
  The work is divided into four parts. Part I establishes the theoretical framework, covering cosmology, inflation, and the principles of analog gravity. Part II analyzes particle production in various inflationary models, showing that scalar and vector fields can account for observed dark matter abundance, especially through tachyonic instabilities. Part III explores BEC experiments, mapping phonons to scalar fields in expanding universes. We demonstrate the reconstruction of expansion histories, reinterpret production as a scattering problem, and propose methods to measure entanglement between produced pairs. Finally, Part IV addresses quantum vacuum ambiguities and the impact of non-adiabatic transitions during the "switch-on" and "switch-off" of expansion.
  Ultimately, this work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production for dark matter and the power of analog experiments to enhance our understanding of quantum effects in curved spacetimes.

### [62] [A class of $d$-dimensional regular black holes: Shadows, Thermodynamics and Gravitational collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10269)
*A. Sadeghi,F. Shojai*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates a class of regular black holes formed from polytropic star collapse in arbitrary dimensions, discusses their electromagnetic properties and thermodynamics, and examines their stability and collapse processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the behavior of black holes formed from stars and understanding their thermodynamic properties and stability is crucial for advancing gravitational theory and high-energy physics.

Method: Analyzing a nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian in various dimensions, mathematically deriving energy conditions, photon sphere positions, shadows, and thermodynamic quantities.

Result: The black holes are shown to be sourced by specific electromagnetic fields, regular due to magnetic charges, satisfy energy conditions, have stable photon spheres, distinct shadow properties, and specific thermodynamic behaviors.

Conclusion: These findings expand our knowledge of black hole physics, particularly in higher dimensions, and offer insights into stellar collapse and electromagnetic spacetime interactions.

Abstract: This paper examines a recently introduced class of regular black holes that can form from the collapse of a polytropic star with an arbitrary polytropic index. This class has a de Sitter core and reduces to the Bardeen and Hayward black holes when the polytropic index is chosen appropriately. We demonstrate that this class of black holes is sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian in $d$ dimensions and that its regularity stems from the presence of magnetic charge. We analyze the energy conditions and study the photon spheres analytically and the shadows numerically. Then, we compare our results with observations. Additionally, we present the thermodynamic properties of this class of black holes, including their temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. We also examine their thermodynamic stability. Finally, we generalize the Oppenheimer-Snyder-Datt collapse scenario to this $d$-dimensional class of black holes and study stellar collapse into them, as well as the evolution of the star's surface, the apparent horizon, and the event horizon.

Conclusion: 该研究为解释 galaxy超大黑洞周边盘和喷流同步偏转现象提供了理论模型，得出的Precession效应与观测值相符，验证了Kerr度量下无电荷、无自旋物体加速的计算结果。

Abstract: Motivated by recent accurate measurements of disk/jet coprecessions around some galactic supermassive black holes, the accelerations experienced by an uncharged, spinless object in the Kerr metric, written in harmonic coordinates, are analytically calculated up to the formal second post-Newtonian order. To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\ast$ are displayed.

Abstract: Massive scalar charges are ubiquitous in extensions to General Relativity and the Standard Model in particle physics. We describe spectral methods which can accurately construct the spacetime of rotating black holes with dimensionless spin up to $a \leq 0.8$ surrounded by massive scalar fields nonminimally coupled to spacetime curvature. We consider axi dilaton, dynamical Chern Simons, and scalar Gauss Bonnet couplings, and obtain leading order solutions for both the scalar field and the associated metric modifications. Our method accurately resolves massive scalar fields with Compton wavelengths as short as 5 times the black hole mass, achieving residual errors $\lesssim 10^{-5}$, and yields the corresponding leading order spacetime modifications with residual errors $\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Using the constructed spacetimes, we computes the leading-order shifts in the surface gravity and the angular velocity of the event horizon, important information for computing the quasinormal modes. These results pave the way to incorporate massive scalar charges into electromagnetic observations and gravitational-wave detections of black holes, potentially enabling new probes of fundamental scalar degrees of freedom.

### [65] [Geometric properties of slowly rotating black holes embedded in matter environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10579)
*Sayak Datta,Chiranjeeb Singha*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies the effects of surrounding dark matter halos on black hole spacetimes, showing that the halo's rotation and anisotropic properties significantly modify key orbital features like frame-dragging and geodesics, with implications for precision gravity tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how dark matter halos affect black hole spacetimes is crucial for testing alternative theories of gravity and improving models of extreme astrophysical systems.

Method: The authors use an analytical approach, modeling the dark matter halo as an anisotropic fluid within the slow-rotation approximation of black hole theory.

Result: The study reveals that the surrounding matter distribution induces deviations in the black hole's inertial frame-dragging and orbital resonances, with the epicyclic frequency ratios showing nonmonotonic behavior.

Conclusion: The results suggest that environmental effects like halos can produce observable signatures in future gravitational wave observations, highlighting their importance in strong-field gravity tests.

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are embedded in surrounding dark and baryonic matter that can measurably perturb the spacetime. We construct a self-consistent spacetime describing a slowly rotating black hole embedded in an external matter distribution, modeling the surrounding dark matter halo as an anisotropic fluid. Working within the slow-rotation approximation, we capture leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects while retaining analytic transparency. We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances. In particular, the epicyclic frequency ratios develop nonmonotonic behavior, such as local minima. We further demonstrate that these features depend on the angular velocity of the surrounding fluid, reflecting the interplay between environmental gravity and frame dragging. Our results demonstrate that environmental and rotational effects can leave observable imprints on precision strong-field probes, particularly extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where small corrections accumulate over many orbital cycles. This work provides a minimal and extensible framework for incorporating realistic astrophysical environments into strong-field tests of gravity with future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.

Conclusion: 研究展示了如何在广义相对论框架下扩展并解释宇宙演化，尤其是能量与时空相互作用对早期宇宙的影响。

Abstract: The $f(R, T)$ theory of gravity extends general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational Lagrangian to depend on both the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. The resulting matter-geometry coupling introduces additional dynamical effects that may account for the late-time acceleration of the universe without invoking dark energy. In the present work, we focus instead on the early-time regime and investigate the corresponding quantum cosmological dynamics. We analyze a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) universe within the $f(R, T)$ framework, employing Schutz's perfect fluid formalism to extract a time parameter emerging from the matter sector itself. This approach is particularly well motivated in $f(R, T)$ gravity, where the coupling between geometry and the energy-momentum tensor's trace makes matter an active participant in the dynamics of spacetime and the evolution of cosmic time. The gravitational Hamiltonian, canonical momenta, and potential are derived, leading to the corresponding Schrödinger--Wheeler--DeWitt (SWDW) equation. The wave function of the universe is obtained for specific forms of $f(R, T)$, and the results are compared with previous studies in $f(R)$ and $f(R, T)$ models, highlighting the role of matter-geometry coupling in the emergence of quantum cosmological dynamics.

Abstract: We present the first fully non-linear evolutions of binary neutron star mergers in a moving-punctures approach in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We study both linear and quadratic-type couplings between the scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, and uncover new post-merger phenomena. These include an enhancement of the prompt collapse of a long-lived hyper-massive neutron star remnant and cases where the remnant develops a scalar configuration due to different scalarisation instabilities. This study initiates the exploration of beyond-General-Relativistic effects enhanced by the non-linear dynamics of the neutron star's fluid.

Abstract: We present a class of exact, dynamical, and fully analytic solutions describing regular black holes formed via the gravitational collapse of matter obeying a generalized polytropic equation of state. Starting from a Vaidya-type geometry with a radially dependent mass function, we demonstrate that regularization of the Kiselev solutions can be achieved through a physically motivated modification of the energy density profile. This procedure leads to nonsingular spacetimes with a de~Sitter core and finite curvature invariants at the center.
  We show that the resulting matter content is naturally described by a generalized polytropic equation of state of the form $P=αρ-ζρ^γ$, where the polytropic index $γ$ is uniquely determined by the regularization scheme. Within this framework, we obtain exact dynamical generalizations of several well-known regular black hole solutions, including the Hayward and Bardeen spacetimes, as particular cases corresponding to specific values of the polytropic parameters.
  Remarkably, the requirement that the equation of state remains coordinate independent imposes a universal constraint relating the regularization scale to the mass function, which in turn guarantees the existence of a regular de~Sitter core with a curvature scale independent of the black hole mass. Our results provide a unified analytic description of Hayward-like and Bardeen-like black holes emerging from gravitational collapse, offering a consistent effective-matter interpretation rooted in generalized polytropic matter.

*Douglas M. Gingrich*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the collapse and possible bounce of dust in quantum-inspired gravity models using covariant Hamiltonian constraints. They derived equations for dust boundary and apparent horizons, studied various quantum gravity effects, and obtained bounce results using different metrics. This suggests that quantum gravity can prevent collapse and initiate a bounce, avoiding classical singularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing the singularity issue in general relativity. Quantum gravity effects are introduced to study singularity resolution through dust collapse scenarios.

Method: The researchers employed covariant Hamiltonian formalism with spherical symmetry, analyzing various quantum gravity models and numerically/symbolically solving the constraint equations to obtain bounce conditions.

Result: They found that in many cases, quantum gravity prevents collapse, leads to a dust bounce, avoiding classical singularities. This is verified through multiple metrics.

Conclusion: Quantum gravity can prevent dust collapse and induce a bounce, offering a potential path to resolve the singularity problem in general relativity.

Abstract: We study the collapse and possible bounce of dust in quantum-inspired gravity models with spherical symmetry. Starting from a wide class of spherically symmetric spacetimes, we write down the covariant Hamiltonian constraints that under dynamical flow give rise to metrics of many spherically symmetric gravity models. Gravity is minimally coupled to a dust field. The constraint equations are solved for the Hamiltonian evolution and simple equations for the location of the outer boundary of the dust versus time and the apparent horizons in terms of shape functions are obtained. The dust density is not assumed to be homogeneous inside the collapsing ball. In many cases, the effective quantum gravity effects stop the collapse of the dust matter field, then causes the dust field to expand thus creating a bounce at a minimum radius and avoiding the classical singularity. Using this formalism, we examine several quantum-inspired gravity metrics to obtain bounce results either previously obtained by different methods or new results.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the propagation of massless scalar waves in static, spherically symmetric Lorentz-violating wormhole spacetimes within a geometric-optical framework. Starting from a general metric characterized by an arbitrary lapse function and areal radius, we derive curvature invariants, establish regularity conditions at the wormhole throat, and reduce the Klein-Gordon equation to a Helmholtz-type radial wave equation. This formulation naturally leads to a position- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index determined by the underlying spacetime geometry and Lorentz-violating structure, resulting in effective frequency-dependent wave-optical behavior. We show that divergences of the refractive index coincide with Killing horizons, while curvature-induced turning points control reflection, transmission, and confinement of scalar waves. By analyzing constant, linear, and quadratic lapse profiles, we identify horizonless transmission regimes, asymmetric wave propagation, and multi-horizon trapping structures. Our results reveal that Lorentz violation can significantly modify wave-optical properties of curved spacetime, generating graded-index analogues and geometric confinement of modes without curvature singularities. This unified optical perspective provides a robust framework for investigating wave scattering, resonances, and potential observational signatures in Lorentz-violating gravitational backgrounds.

Abstract: We investigate vacuum polarization on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole carrying a global monopole. For a massless scalar field $Ψ$ in the Hartle-Hawking state and with arbitrary curvature coupling, we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation value $\langle Ψ^2 \rangle_{\textrm{ren}}$. The monopole produces a solid-angle deficit and makes the spacetime non-Ricci-flat. Working perturbatively in the monopole parameter $η$ and retaining terms through $O(η^2)$, we find that $\langle Ψ^2 \rangle_{\textrm{ren}}$ on the horizon splits into two contributions: a genuinely monopole-induced term evaluated at the horizon and the usual Schwarzschild result - with the event horizon radius modified by the presence of $η$. Our result parallels earlier analyses for Schwarzschild black holes pierced by a cosmic string.

Abstract: Using the convergent Leaver method, we investigate the quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field propagating in the background of the Casadio--Fabbri--Mazzacurati brane-world black hole. We show that the spectrum exhibits two distinct types of modes, depending on their behavior as the field mass $μ$ increases. In one class, the real oscillation frequency decreases and eventually approaches zero, while in the other the damping rate tends to vanish. When either the real or imaginary part of the frequency reaches zero, the corresponding mode disappears from the spectrum, and the first overtone replaces it.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of EMRIs to probe near-horizon dissipation through tidal heating. A Bayesian analysis reveals that EMRIs can constrain reflectivity parameters and detect black hole event horizons with precision. Neglecting tidal heating can lead to systematic biases in EMRI system parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to use EMRIs as precision probes for studying black hole event horizons, particularly through tidal heating effects which can reveal near-horizon physics.

Method: The method involves a Bayesian analysis using injection-recovery studies with two-year signals and an SNR of 50, sampling the full EMRI parameter space while inferring constraints on the reflectivity parameter |mathcal{R}|^2.

Result: The results show that EMRIs can constrain |mathcal{R}|^2 to levels of 10^{-3}–10^{-4} for rapidly spinning black holes. Additionally, neglecting tidal heating can introduce systematic biases in EMRI system parameters.

Conclusion: The study concludes that EMRIs are promising precision probes for detecting and constraining black hole event horizons, leveraging tidal heating effects for near-horizon physics research.

Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) provide unique probes of near-horizon dissipation through the tidal heating. We present a full Bayesian analysis of tidal heating in equatorial eccentric EMRIs by performing injection-recovery studies and inferring posterior constraints on the reflectivity parameter $|\mathcal{R}|^2$ while sampling in the full EMRI parameter space. We find that in the strong-field regime the posterior uncertainties are smaller, indicating a stronger constraining capability on the tidal heating. Using two-year signals with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $ρ=50$, EMRIs can put bounds on $|\mathcal{R}|^2$ at the level of $10^{-3}$--$ 10^{-4}$ for a rapidly spinning central object. Moreover, we show that neglecting the tidal heating can induce clear systematic biases in the intrinsic parameters of the EMRI system. These results establish EMRIs as promising precision probes for detecting and constraining black hole event horizons.
