*V. Apinyan,T. Kopeć*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

Abstract: We have studied the electron-electron interactions in the system composed of
two metallic wires, placed in the external magnetic and electric fields. The
interactions between the electrons in the wires have been taken into account
within the usual Hubbard model. We have considered both half-filling and
partial-filling limits for the occupation of the atomic lattice sites. We show
the existence of the excitonic pairing in this low-dimensional system and
calculate the excitonic order parameter in different electron-electron
interaction regime, magnetic field and temperature. We demonstrate that the
usual Hubbard-$U$ interaction leads to strong electron localization which
enhance the local antiferromagnetic order in the system.

TL;DR: 研究展示了任意包含非可逆自对偶对象a的融合范畴都会生成一个可积的亚纯链，并讨论了其能隙问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究融合范畴与量子态链的应用，探讨能隙问题，理解材料相变的可能性。

Method: 通过研究融合过程的投射和温特尔-李布代数结构，结合ADE模型构建，运用有限大小效应分析。

Result: 发现能隙存在且受影响于a的量子维数，特殊融合范畴（如Fib×Fib、Haagerup）有限大小效应显著。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了可积模型的范畴理论框架，提出了分析类似融合系统的新方法，并对量子材料中的相变问题提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual
object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density
satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the
projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We
relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then
exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of
these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension
of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the
dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion
categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the
numerical analysis of the gap.

### [3] [Canted antiferromagnetism and excitonic order in gated double-layer graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19881)

Abstract: We study the effects of the electron-electron interactions on the excitonic
properties and charge-density modulations in the AB stacked double-layer (DL)
graphene, placed in the external gate-potential $V$. The coexistence of the
canted antiferromagnetic order and excitonic pairing gap has been studied with
the help of the generalized Hubbard model. We calculate the chemical potential
$\mu$, the average charge density difference between the layers
$\delta{\bar{n}}$, the antiferromagnetic gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and
the excitonic order parameters $\Delta_{\sigma}$ in the zero temperature limit.
We found that the excitonic pairing order parameter has a larger energy scale
than the canted antiferromagnetic gap-function. The charge neutrality, in the
DL graphene system, occurs only in the absence of the external gate-potential
$V$. Moreover, we have shown that the values of the antiferromagnetic
gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and excitonic order parameter $\Delta_{\sigma}$
are always increasing at the large values of inter-layer Coulomb interaction,
while they are decreasing for large values of the applied gate-potential $V$.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在三角形格子霍夫stadter-哈布巴特模型中，当电子密度为每 site one且磁场对应四分之一的通量密度时，IQH相与CSL相之间发生了一种伊 sing型二维相变。研究方法的有效性为探索同类体系提供了可靠的基础。有关第一性原理计算的相关详细结果可以进一步探讨不同体系参数下的相变行为及其相关应用。

Abstract: We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the
intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the
transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a
density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to
one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan
and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and
lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact
diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on
the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra
degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to
study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of
flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences
between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength
scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a
bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also
extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH
side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter
and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are
consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain
excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a
charge neutral momentum $\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the
dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but
gaps to other excitations remain large.

### [5] [Dimensionality-Changing Transition from a Non-Fermi Liquid to a Spin-Solid in a Multichannel Kondo Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19937)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A multichannel Kondo system, where a single quantum spin couples to multiple
channels of an electronic bath, provides one of the simplest examples of a
zero-dimensional non-Fermi liquid. It is natural to ask: what happens when an
extensive number of such systems are coupled together? A simple renormalization
group argument implies that in a chain of SU(N) multichannel quantum systems,
where each spin is coupled to its own bath of K channels, the individual spins
dynamically decouple at low energy when N>K, resulting in a 'sliding' non-Fermi
liquid. Using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we find evidences of a
continuous, 'dimensionality-changing' phase transition out of this non-Fermi
liquid into a valence-bond solid phase as the intersite coupling is increased.
Remarkably, at the critical point, correlations exhibit a power-law behavior
even along the direction in which the spins are coupled, indicating the
breakdown of dynamical decoupling at the transition. We also develop an RG
scheme to understand the universal aspects of this transition.

### [6] [Kondo breakdown induced by the non-Hermitian complex hybridization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20186)

Conclusion: 研究结论为非厄米 Anderson 热化子模型中的 Kondo 散射机制提供新的解释，并为理解非厄米量子系统的散射行为提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Recently, a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss has been
studied in [Phys. Rev. B 111, 125157 (2025)}], and it has been demonstrated
that the renormalization effect generated by strong correlations
counterintuitively changes the nature of dissipation into an emergent many-body
dissipation that causes a Kondo breakdown. In a closely related context, it is
also known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo
breakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson
impurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model
that provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the
slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo
breakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact
Bethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson
mean-field theory. Finally, we point out that the Lehmann representation for
the non-Hermitian Green function cannot be obtained by the analytic
continuation to the complex energy upon the Kondo breakdown, where the
analyticity of the non-Hermitian Green function in the half-complex-$\omega$
plane no longer holds.

Abstract: The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding
non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of
such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise
constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit
algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in
a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By
representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct
dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction.
Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana
modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results
demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for
studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on
currently available quantum processors.

Conclusion: 立方 lam 是一种在磁场作用下的量子磁体，并通过本构实验首次证明了临界磁体状态的存在。

Abstract: A field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) state is an extraordinary
phenomenon, hitherto unobserved in metallic frustrated compounds. Recent bulk
measurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic
frustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states,
potentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed
microscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed
the transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$\mu$SR) technique,
applying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline
CePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $\mu$SR data indicate
that field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$
exhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B>$B_{c2}$ they yield
contrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate
($\lambda_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with
an indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature
independent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical
spin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Furthermore, at 4.3
T, a non-Fermi liquid state is observed where frustration is absent. This
comprehensive microscopic study strongly suggests the existence of a CSL state
in a metallic frustrated system.

Conclusion: 适合的量子临界点可以是奇金属材料的潜在生成机制，未来需要考虑奇异性与约瑟夫森效应等关联。

Abstract: The origin of the strange metallic behavior observed in a wide range of
quantum materials is an open challenge to condensed matter physics.
Historically, strange metals were uniquely associated with antiferromagnetic
quantum critical points (QCPs), but a new generation of materials reveals their
association with uniform order parameters, such as ferromagnetism, valley or
nematic order, suggesting a deeper common denominator. At a QCP, order
parameter fluctuations are characterized by the dynamical critical exponent
$z$, which quantifies the space-time scaling asymmetry. Here, we report the
observation of a divergence in the Gr\"uneisen ratio at the QCP of the
strange-metal ferromagnet CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ with a dynamical critical exponent
$z=3$, signaling that the underlying quantum singularity involves a conserved
degree of freedom. Yet the magnetization of this easy-plane ferromagnet is not
conserved. We argue that the $z=3$ strange criticality requires a description
beyond the Landau paradigm, proposing a link with the gauge modes of the
small-to-large Fermi surface transition and the associated gauge charge of the
delocalizing heavy electrons.

### [10] [Metallic island array as synthetic quantum matter: fractionalized entropy and thermal transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20491)
*Nitay Hurvitz,Gleb Finkelstein,Eran Sela*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses arrays of Coulomb-blockaded metallic islands, demonstrating that they exhibit unique thermodynamic properties and new physics, such as quantized entropy and finite heat flow without temperature differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the thermodynamic and electronic properties of arrays of Coulomb-blockaded metallic islands is important for advancing the field of strongly correlated electron systems and quantum transport phenomena.

Method: The study is conducted theoretically, using exact diagonalization and analytical methods to analyze the thermodynamic signatures like entropy and conductance, and discuss the emergence of exotic excitations.

Result: The key results include quantized entropy, $rac{1}{2}k_B 	imes$ natural log of (number of islands plus one) scaling, and finite heat transport without conventional temperature differences. The findings could open new directions in quantum thermodynamics and fractionalization studies.

Conclusion: This work contributes to a deeper understanding of quantum many-body phenomena in correlated electron systems and offers potential for future experimental verification of unconventional heat transport properties.

Abstract: The surprisingly rich physics of a single Coulomb-blockaded metallic island,
when coupled to quantum Hall edge channels, is now well established -- giving
rise to charge fractionalization and multi-channel quantum impurity behavior.
Here, we show that qualitatively new physics emerges in arrays of such
elements. We consider a 1D chain of $N$ metallic islands, focusing on
thermodynamic signatures such as quantized entropy and anomalous thermal
conductance. Universal and robust behavior emerges for energy scales smaller
than the charging energy of the islands. In particular, we demonstrate that for
the bulk filling factor of $\nu=1$, the islands could support a finite heat
flow without temperature difference between them. Upon pinching the array with
a quantum point contact, we predict an entropy change that scales with the
number of islands as $\Delta S = \frac{1}{2}k_B \log (N+1)$, which can be
measured using charge detection. This fractional entropy suggests the emergence
of a novel type of excitations in the array.

### [11] [Monte Carlo Sampling for Wave Functions Requiring (Anti)Symmetrization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20577)
*Koyena Bose,Steven H. Simon,Ajit C. Balram*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study introduces a Monte Carlo method to calculate energies and correlators for many-body wave functions that require anti-symmetrization of multiple clusters. The approach avoids the factorial scaling of exact anti-symmetrization, enabling the study of larger systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding strongly correlated quantum systems is a key challenge in modern physics. The fractional quantum Hall effect and spin liquids pose particular complexities, requiring sophisticated methods to analyze their wave functions and physical properties.

Method: The authors propose a Monte Carlo simulation-based approach to compute quantities like energies and correlators for many-body systems. The method involves constructing wave functions by dividing particles into clusters, evaluating wave functions within each cluster, and anti-symmetrizing across clusters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to handle the computational complexity of these calculations without explicitly performing the anti-symmetrization, which would otherwise grow factorially with the number of clusters.

Result: The framework presented in the study effectively circumvents the computational bottleneck associated with anti-symmetrization, allowing for the numerical analysis of larger systems than previously feasible using exact diagonalization methods. This opens new avenues for studying complex many-body systems in condensed matter physics and beyond.

Conclusion: In summary, this work provides a novel and efficient computational tool for studying strongly correlated quantum states, significantly expanding the scope of systems that can be analyzed with high accuracy.

Abstract: Many strongly correlated states, such as those arising in the fractional
quantum Hall effect and spin liquids, are described by wave functions obtained
by dividing particles into multiple clusters, constructing a readily evaluable
wave function in each cluster, and (anti)symmetrizing across these clusters. We
introduce a method to compute quantities such as energies and correlators,
using Monte Carlo simulations for these states. Our framework overcomes the
factorial scaling of explicit (anti)symmetrization, allowing for studies of
systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解 Kagome 网络中磁性束缚态的稳定性机制提供了新的理论视角，同时也为实验中探测和研究磁性束缚态提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of multi-magnon bound states (MBSs) in the
spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ FM-AFM $J_1$-$J_2$ chain under magnetic fields using the
density-matrix renormalization group method. As a quantitative measure of
stability, we compute the magnon binding energy $E_{\rm b}(M,p)$ for bound
clusters of size $p$ over wide ranges of the frustration ratio $J_2/|J_1|$ and
the normalized magnetization $M/M_{\rm s}$. Near saturation, we benchmark our
data against the analytic two-magnon result and map out a clear hierarchy of
$p$-magnon states, whose phase boundaries follow an empirical scaling
$J_{2,{\rm c}}(p;p\!+\!1)/|J_1|\!\approx\!0.34\,p^{-2.3}$ for large $p$. We
further quantify the relation between the most stable $p$ and the zero-field
pitch angle $\theta$, verifying the conjectured inequality
$1/p>\theta/\pi>1/(p+1)$ up to $p \lesssim 9$. The binding energy shows
pronounced suppression as $J_2/|J_1|\!\to\!1/4^+$ and, for some frustration
values, attains a maximum below full saturation, indicating that partial
depolarization enhances bound-magnon mobility. Close to the FM instability,
$E_{\rm b}(M_{\rm s},p)$ exhibits an empirical power-law vanishing consistent
with a quantum-Lifshitz scenario. Our results provide a comprehensive,
experimentally relevant map of MBS stability across field and frustration,
offering concrete guidance for inelastic probes in quasi-one-dimensional
magnets.

Conclusion: 研究提供了对表面态介于铁磁体和整流态的详细理论解释，认为自旋-动量锁定和范斯磁悟性是温度升高的关键因素，并通过对比不同厚度的试管，未来实验可以进一步确认此假设。

Abstract: We theoretically analyze the topological insulator (TI) surface state
mediated interactions between local moments in a proximate 2D ferromagnetic
insulator (FMI) motivated by recent experiments that show a significant
increase in the Curie temperature Tc of FMI-TI heterostructures. Such
interactions have been investigated earlier with a focus on dilute magnetic
dopants in TIs. Our problem involves a dense set of moments for which we find
that the short range Bloembergen-Rowland interaction, arising from virtual
particle-hole transitions between the valence and conduction bands, dominates
over the oscillatory Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. We show
that the Tc enhancement is proportional to the Van Vleck susceptibility and
that the spin-momentum locking of surface states leads to out-of-plane
ferromagnetic order in the FMI. We investigate how the hybridization between
top and bottom surfaces in a thin TI film impacts Tc enhancement, and show how
our results can help understand recent experiments on atomically thin
Cr2Te3-(Bi,Sb)2Te3.

### [14] [Fresnel's Mechanical Legacy Recovered: How Bubble Acoustics Unifies Partial Drag, Velocity Addition, and Atomic Polarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19833)
*Shiva Meucci*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Sound waves in bubbly water, light in special relativity, and relativistic velocity addition are all governed by the same first-order transport laws, with wave coupling to compliant components determining a universal partial entrainment equation. This reveals a deep connection between wave mechanics, relativity, and material dynamics, suggesting a unified principle of wave propagation through deformable inclusions, with Fresnel drag, Lorentz contraction, and atomic polarization as specific manifestations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to bridge insights from acoustics, optics, and special relativity, proposing a unified principle that connects wave phenomena with the motion of deformable media, which could lead to new applications in materials science and technology.

Method: The authors analyze the mathematical equivalence of the transport laws in the three systems, derive a universal equation, and validate it through experimental evidence from acoustic compliance and spectroscopic data.

Result: A universal partial entrainment equation is established, showing that the same physical principle underlies wave propagation in deformable media and relativistic velocity addition. This provides a unified framework for understanding relativistic effects and wave phenomena across different domains.

Conclusion: This work bridges acoustics, optics, and special relativity, revealing a fundamental connection between wave propagation and the mechanical properties of materials. It opens new avenues for materials design and testing predictions based on wave-compliance interactions.

Abstract: Sound waves in bubbly water and light in special relativity obey identical
first-order transport laws. This equivalence is not approximate or analogical
but mathematically identical to first order in $U/v$, sharing the same form
discovered by Fresnel in 1818 for light in moving transparent media. We
demonstrate that all three systems-bubble acoustics, optical drag, and
relativistic velocity addition-are described by a universal partial entrainment
equation where wave coupling to compliant components determines the drag
coefficient. In bubbly liquids this physics is directly observable: waves
couple to compressible bubbles rather than rigid liquid. Since bubble dynamics
reproduces the relativistic result, velocity addition itself admits mechanical
interpretation. Von Laue's 1907 derivation abstracted mechanics into
kinematics; we reverse this, showing relativistic effects preserve mechanical
content in abstract form. Beyond first-order equivalence, we show Fresnel's
dispersive term encodes group velocity (energy transport) versus phase velocity
(wave-crest motion)-a distinction mechanical models naturally capture but pure
kinematic velocity addition cannot address. The rigidity-based interpretation
of dispersion, established in acoustic metamaterials, provides cross-domain
insights for materials design and suggests testable predictions linking
acoustic compliance to optical drag. This three-way equivalence reduces
independent phenomena to a single principle: waves riding compliant inclusions.
Fresnel drag, Lorentz contraction, and atomic polarization all emerge as
aspects of this one mechanism, traced through the historical
density-versus-rigidity fork that shaped aether theory's trajectory. The
compliant-inclusion principle shows striking quantitative agreement with
isotope mass-dependence and resonance structure in existing spectroscopic data.

*Pengzhuo Wang,Jose Sanjuan,Moritz Mehmet,Felipe Guzman*

TL;DR: A laser frequency stabilization system using an iodine-filled hollow-core photonic microcell improves frequency stability significantly by suppressing parasitic interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving laser frequency stability is crucial for precision metrology and metrology in quantum optics. The use of gases in photonic microcells opens new possibilities for stable frequency references.

Method: An iodine-filled hollow-core photonic microcell (PMC) was used. A 532 nm laser is locked to the a1 component of the R(56) 32-0 transition of molecular iodine. Noise analysis identified and suppressed three types of parasitic interference.

Result: Frequency stability improved by more than an order of magnitude, achieving 3.5e-13 fractional stability for integration times around 1000 seconds. This represents the best achieved using gas-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fibers.

Conclusion: This system offers a novel approach to laser frequency stabilization, leveraging the unique properties of iodine in a PMC to create a highly stable frequency reference.

Abstract: We present a laser frequency stabilization system based on an iodine-filled
hollow-core photonic microcell (PMC), which is a sealed version of a
hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF). A 532 nm laser is locked to the a1
component of the R(56) 32-0 transition of molecular iodine in the fiber cell,
and its frequency stability is compared to that of the same component in a
free-space iodine cell. Noise analysis reveals that the system is limited by
parasitic beams that interfere with the beam of interest and degrade the error
signal. We have identified and characterized three types of parasitic
interference and designed suppression methods for each. After applying these
suppression methods, the frequency stability improved by more than an order of
magnitude. The system achieves fractional frequency stability of
$3.5\times10^{-13}$ for integration times around 1000 s. To our knowledge, this
represents the best frequency stability achieved using a gas-filled hollow-core
photonic crystal fiber frequency reference.

Abstract: Magneto-optical effects in structured anisotropic media have attracted
significant attention due to their potential in tunable photonic devices. In
particular, dichroic cholesteric liquid crystals (i.e., cholesterics in which
the real parts of the local dielectric permeability tensor are equal each
other, and the imaginary parts differ) provide a unique system in which
absorption anisotropy rather than anisotropy of real pars of the local
dielectric permeability controls the optical response. In this work, we
investigated the magneto-optical properties of dichroic cholesteric liquid
crystals under oblique light incidence. To analyze the optical characteristics,
we used the Berreman method, which is a matrix approach to solving Maxwell's
equations. The unique properties of such structures were revealed, namely,
resonant Bragg diffraction transmission instead of diffraction reflection and
higher orders of diffraction reflection under oblique light incidence at
grazing angles. It was shown that at light oblique incidence in the presence of
an external magnetic field, new Dirac points appear in the spectra of such
structures at each order of diffraction reflection. Furthermore, it is shown
that an external magnetic field suppresses the shift of the polarization of
eigenmodes from circular to linear polarization as the angle of incidence
increases. This system can be used as a narrowband filter with a widely tunable
wavelength.

Motivation: 随着光子ics和量子通信的发展，光轨道动量（OAM）模式在测量、通信和微粒操控中具有广泛的应用。然而，FOAM在传播过程中由于螺旋相位的不连续性易受衍射影响，导致OAM识别精度下降，限制了其在光学通信中的应用。因此，开发能够在衍射条件下实现FOAM模式识别的机器学习方法具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 本研究通过深度学习技术，成功开发了一种能够在大气湍流环境下高精度识别FOAM模式的方法。该方法不仅克服了传统方法的局限性，还展示了在复杂环境下光通信应用的潜力。未来的工作可以进一步优化模型结构，扩大其应用场景和提高识别性能。

Abstract: Fractional-order vortex beams possess fractional orbital angular momentum
(FOAM) modes, which theoretically have the potential to increase transmission
capacity infinitely. Therefore, they have significant application prospects in
the fields of measurement, optical communication and micro-particle
manipulation. However, when fractional-order vortex beams propagate in free
space, the discontinuity of the helical phase makes them susceptible to
diffraction in practical applications, thereby affecting the accuracy of OAM
mode recognition and severely limiting the use of FOAM-based optical
communication. Achieving machine learning recognition of fractional-order
vortex beams under diffraction conditions is currently an urgent and unreported
issue. Based on ResNet, a deep learning (DL) method of accurately recognizing
the propagation distance and topological charge of fractional-order vortex beam
diffraction process is proposed in this work. Utilizing both experimentally
measured and numerically simulated intensity distributions, a dataset of vortex
beam diffraction intensity patterns in atmospheric turbulence environments is
created. An improved 101-layer ResNet structure based on transfer learning is
employed to achieve accurate and efficient recognition of the FOAM model at
different propagation distances. Experimental results show that the proposed
method can accurately recognize FOAM modes with a propagation distance of 100
cm, a spacing of 5 cm, and a mode spacing of 0.1 under turbulent conditions,
with an accuracy of 99.69%. This method considers the effect of atmospheric
turbulence during spatial transmission, allowing the recognition scheme to
achieve high accuracy even in special environments. It has the ability to
distinguish ultra-fine FOAM modes and propagation distances, which cannot be
achieved by traditional methods.

Abstract: When generating light with orbital angular momentum by imprinting orbital
phase onto a standard Gaussian beam, it is often assumed that the propagation
of the generated spatial mode is a Laguerre-Gaussian. However, the true
propagation of this beam in a realistic, aperture-limited optical system is
non-trivial and has not been thoroughly explored in existing literature. We
explore a numerical model that shows the development of an optical vortex mode,
propagating from the plane of phase modulation, and the relation of these
dynamics to the orbital phase factor $\ell$ and the spatial bandwidth of the
optical system. The results of this model are compared to experimental data for
beams with $\ell$ values 1, 2, 5, and 10 propagating through a range of spatial
filters, with the described model showing agreement in the near field regime.

Abstract: We investigate the Casimir effect in a system of two twisted photonic
gratings made of uniaxially anisotropic materials. Two distinct configuretions
are explored: a stack of symmetric gratings and a stack of in-plane chiral
gratings, with the latter realized by choosing specific orientaton of
anisotropy axis relative to stripes. We apply the reflection-matrix-based
Casimir Lifshitzformalism to explore hoe twiat angle, material anisotropy, and
the separation between gratings influence Casimir energy, force and torque. Our
calculations reveal that the equilibrium orientation of the gratings is
governed by the anisotropy rotation angles, leading to a chiral configuration
where the anisotropy axes of the upper and lower gratings are mutually
parallel. These findings demonstrate that material anisotropy provids a pwerful
mechanism for controlling rotational alignment forces in nanophotonic system.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We derive an end-to-end framework connecting steady-state photon transport in
highly scattering porous slabs to surface-bound photocatalytic rates. Starting
from the diffusion approximation (DA) with extrapolated (partial-current)
boundary conditions, we solve the finite-slab Green's function with an
isotropic internal plane source that rigorously maps external illumination to
internal fluence. Using photon units for the fluence rate, Phi(z,lambda)
[photons m-2 s-1], the local absorption is qa = mu_a * Phi and the primary
carrier/radical generation is G = phi_int * qa. Site-limited and
Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics are driven by G and closed via an accessible
surface per macroscopic volume, S_accessible, yielding intrinsic volumetric
(per-volume) and areal (per-area) rate constants. We then specialize to
air-core/silica-shell monoliths whose shells host anatase TiO2 nanoparticles
(NPs): shell refractive indices are calculated by Maxwell-Garnett/Bruggeman
mixing; scattering is obtained from Mie theory (PyMieScatt); absorption follows
mu_a = n_NP * sigma_abs with n_NP set by NP packing fraction in the shell. The
exact slab solution reduces to a compact, design-useful predictor - our Eq.
(14) - in a controlled asymptotic that clarifies when the rate scales as l*l/L
(strongly diffusive, l << L) versus proportional to l (optically thin, l >> L).
We detail measurement and validation protocols (diffuse R/T inversion of mu_s'
and mu_a on the same slab, boundary extrapolation accuracy, lateral-loss
control) drawing on prior art, and provide a turnkey recipe to compute rates
for NP packing-fraction series. The result is a reproducible workflow that
preserves design simplicity while resting on a rigorous finite-slab solution.

Abstract: We study two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of elliptical dielectric
rods arranged according to stealthy hyperuniform point patterns. These patterns
are characterized by the structure factor, which vanishes for 0 < |k| <= K,
where k is the wave number and K denotes the cutoff wave number specifying the
stealthiness of the pattern. The optical properties of the photonic crystals
are analyzed by applying the plane-wave expansion method to Maxwell's
equations. We demonstrate that photonic crystals composed of elliptical
dielectric rods can exhibit larger photonic band gaps than those with
cylindrical rods when both the rod orientation and aspect ratio are properly
optimized. This behavior contrasts with that of periodic lattices such as
triangular or square arrays. These findings shed light on the crucial role of
structural anisotropy and aperiodic structure in enhancing photonic band-gap
formation.

Abstract: Multipole expansion methods have been primarily used for analyzing the
electromagnetic scattering from non-magnetic isotropic dielectric scatterers,
and studies about the scattering from magnetic objects seem to be lacking. In
this work, we used the multipolar expansion framework for decomposing the
electromagnetic scattering by dielectric particles with magnetic properties.
Magnetization current contributions were explicitly accounted for by using the
vector spherical harmonics to compute the electric and magnetic multipole
contributions of arbitrary order. The exact analytical expressions for the
corresponding spherical multipole coefficients were employed, with the
scattering efficiencies being used to distinguish the dielectric and magnetic
contributions of each multipole. This enables the analysis of scattering from
arbitrarily shaped, anisotropic, and inhomogeneous magnetic scatterers. It also
provides a tool for studying non-reciprocal devices that exploit magnetic
resonances in magnetic-dielectric materials. Calculations were made for an
experimentally feasible system, namely for ferrite-based scatterers operating
in the microwave regime. These materials are of interest in radio frequency
(RF) applications due to their magnetic activity. We demonstrated analytically
that the magnetic circular dichroism in a magnetic-dielectric scatterer in the
Faraday geometry can be decomposed into individual multipole contributions. The
analytical results indicate that multipole resonances associated with
magnetization currents can be even stronger than multipole contributions from
conventional dielectric currents. It is worth noting that these analytical
results were verified through comparison with numerical results from finite
element method (FEM) simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how to manipulate the g^(2)(0) peak value of the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect in HBT systems using a holographic projection scheme.

Motivation: This paper is motivated by the need to better understand and control the HBT effect for applications in imaging systems, leveraging holography.

Method: The authors used a phase-only holographic projection scheme to design target patterns and experimentally measured the g^(2)(0) peak value, analyzing both theoretical and practical aspects.

Result: The experiments successfully achieved a g^(2)(0) peak value of 39.77 using designed sparse target patterns. They also observed super-bunching effects and discussed how holographic noise could enhance the peak value.

Conclusion: The work presents a method to predict and manipulate the HBT effect's peak value, applicable to various projection systems, including lenses and holograms, indicating potential for practical applications in imaging.

Abstract: The Manipulation of g^(2)(0) peak value of Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect
is discussed with a holographic projection scheme. By the aid of target pattern
artificially designed in the projection imaging system, the statistical
distribution of projection pattern will be highly controllable. In this work,
we theoretically point out key factors influencing the g^(2)(0) peak value of
HBT effect in a single-lens incoherent imaging system. We find the peak value
is not only decided by statistical property and coherence length of target
pattern but also depends on the intrinsic characteristics of projection system,
such as numerical aperture and projection quality. Then, we experimentally
measured the g^(2)(0) peak value of HBT effect with a phase-only holographic
projection scheme and demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical analysis
on the holographic scheme. Here, the super-bunching effect in the projection
plane has been observed, when target patterns originated from chaotic speckle
or it's function transformation patterns. Moreover, we design some sparse
target patterns, whose holographic reconstruction patterns show the
super-bunching effect achieving g^(2)(0)=39.77. Finally, we discussed the
positive influence of holographic noise on increasing the g^(2)(0) peak value.
The presented work predicting the peak value of HBT effect not only is
applicable for the lens imaging system but also in other projection systems,
such as the holographic projection.

telecom-band optical modes and a 9.6-GHz phonon mode, achieving a maximum
cooperativity of $0.41$ and a phonon quality-factor-frequency product of
$10^{13}\,\mathrm{Hz}$. The momentum-matching condition inherent to
traveling-wave Brillouin interactions establishes a one-to-one mapping between
optical wavelength and phonon frequency, enabling multi-channel parallel
operations across nearly $300\,\mathrm{MHz}$ in phonon frequency and
$40\,\mathrm{nm}$ in optical wavelength. Our suspension-free architecture
provides a coherent photon-phonon interface compatible with wafer-scale

and driven by a separate coherent beam, and analyze the mechanisms that govern
their soliton interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, the system supports
multiple soliton clusters characterized by distinct soliton separations and

alter soliton separations or destroy these states, while the imposed pump phase
difference plays a key role in cluster selection. Together, these findings

Motivation: Integrated waveguide devices have become increasingly important for on-chip optical systems, but traditional waveguides face two major issues: mode symmetry mismatch and size constraints. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a new type of topological waveguide.

Method: The researchers developed a parity-protected supermode by combining ridge waveguide modes and valley kink states, creating an exotic odd-symmetric supermode. They also implemented a perfect electric conductor boundary to reduce dimensions. The key innovation is the use of a valley-ridge interface that allows direct mode matching with conventional waveguides without additional structures.

Result: The proposed waveguide demonstrates exceptional performance, with reflection losses lower than -15 dB in simulations and experiments, and exhibits unique robustness against backscattering and good compactness, specifically subwavelength dimensions.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant breakthrough in topological photonics, demonstrating a new class of waveguides that combine backscattering immunity with compactness, thus opening new possibilities for compact and reliable integrated optical systems.

Abstract: Topological photonics offers transformative potential for robust integrated
waveguide devices due to their backscattering-immune properties. However, their
integration faces two fundamental challenges: mode symmetry mismatch with
conventional waveguides and prohibitive dimensions. We successfully overcome
these two critical challenges by introducing a novel valley-ridge gap waveguide
based on topological half-supermode engineering. By strategically hybridizing
ridge waveguide modes and valley kink states, we create an exotic odd-symmetric
supermode enabling robust propagation and ultra-compact operation. The further
implementation of a perfect electric conductor boundary halves lateral
dimensions while eliminating radiation loss. Crucially, our proposed
valley-ridge interface achieves direct transverse electric mode matching with
standard waveguides without transition structures, enabling seamless
integration. Experimental results demonstrate reflection losses lower than -15
dB in realistic telecommunication scenarios with super-robust signal
propagation through sharp bends. This work innovatively conceptualizes
topological half-supermodes and pioneers their practical applications for
integrated waveguide devices, establishing a completely new waveguide class
that uniquely combines robust backscattering immunity with deep subwavelength
compactness.

investigated the nanocone-patterned sapphire resonator array, with specific
attention to its in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components. Through
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurement and full-wave photonic
simulations, we identified a range of optical excitations in the RBs, including
three SPhPs, two hyperbolic volume phonon polaritons (HVPhPs), and one
epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode. The depth-resolved confocal Raman spectroscopy
revealed strongly enhanced Raman signals on the nanostructured surface,
suggesting the mode coupling between phonons and phonon-polaritons, which was
further confirmed by the finite element modeling of polarizability. This
exploratory study provides in-depth insights into the dynamics of LWIR phonon
polaritons and ENZ modes in the nanostructured sapphire, indicating its great
potential for innovative nanophotonic applications.

Motivation: The study aims to explore the computational potential of biological organisms, particularly focusing on unconventional computing methods using non-neural organisms like Physarum.

Method: Through analyzing growth dynamics, the study applies the Margolus-Levitin theorem, using time-series data of Physarum's morphological properties to compute its maximum computational capacity.

Result: Physarum polycephalum surpasses traditional computers by performing more operations in a day, potentially offering new insights into unconventional computing and biological systems.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that biological organisms, particularly unicellular ones, may hold immense computational capabilities when considering diverse physical and energetic constraints.

Abstract: While computational capacity limits of the universe and carbon-based life

established. Physarum polycephalum, a unicellular, multinucleated amoeba, is
capable of complex problem-solving despite lacking neurons. By analyzing growth
dynamics in two distinct Physarum strains under diverse biological conditions,
we map morphological evolution to information processing. As the
Margolus-Levitin theorem constrains maximum computation rates by accessible
energies, we analyze high-throughput time-series data of Physarum's
morphology--quantified through area, perimeter, circularity, and fractal
dimension-to determine upper bounds on the number of logical operations
achievable through its hydromechanical, chemical, kinetic, and quantum-optical
degrees of freedom. Based on spatial distribution of ATP and explored areas,
Physarum can perform up to ~$10^{36}$ logical operations in 24 hours, scaling
linearly in the non-equilibrium steady state. This framework enables comparison
of the computational capacities of life, exploiting either classical or quantum

Abstract: We present two new quantum algorithms for reaction-diffusion equations that
employ the truncated Chebyshev polynomial approximation. This method is
employed to numerically solve the ordinary differential equation emerging from
the linearization of the associated nonlinear differential equation. In the
first algorithm, we use the matrix exponentiation method (Patel et al., 2018),
while in the second algorithm, we repurpose the quantum spectral method (Childs
et al., 2020). Our main technical contribution is to derive the sufficient
conditions for the diagonalization of the Carleman embedding matrix, which is
indispensable for designing both quantum algorithms. We supplement this with an
efficient iterative algorithm to diagonalize the Carleman matrix.
  Our first algorithm has gate complexity of
O(d$\cdot$log(d)+T$\cdot$polylog(T/$\varepsilon$)). Here $d$ is the size of the
Carleman matrix, $T$ is the simulation time, and $\varepsilon$ is the
approximation error. The second algorithm is polynomial in $log(d)$, $T$, and
$log(1/\varepsilon)$ - the gate complexity scales as
O(polylog(d)$\cdot$T$\cdot$polylog(T/$\varepsilon$)). In terms of $T$ and
$\varepsilon$, this is comparable to the speedup gained by the current best
known quantum algorithm for this problem, the truncated Taylor series method
(Costa et.al., 2025).
  Our approach has two shortcomings. First, we have not provided an upper
bound, in terms of d, on the condition number of the Carleman matrix. Second,
the success of the diagonalization is based on a conjecture that a specific
trigonometric equation has no integral solution. However, we provide strategies
to mitigate these shortcomings in most practical cases.

TL;DR: This paper describes a novel superconducting weak link using niobium nitride to overcome challenges in qubit design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quest for improved superconducting qubits for quantum processors

Method: Treated niobium nitride films to induce a superconductor-insulator transition, using atomic layer techniques and planar structures.

Result: Achieved a transmon qubit with anharmonicity of 235 MHz and κ/2π of 15 MHz. High gap potential for future applications.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in qubit design opens new avenues for scalable and high-performance quantum computing.

Abstract: Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for realizing
practical quantum computers. One requirement to create a quantum processor is
nonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by
sandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a
Josephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that
hinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum
necessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead
to dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for
high-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations
using a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator
transition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit
its thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link
employing only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching. We utilize our
weak links to produce a transmon qubit, '$planaron$', with a measured
anharmonicity of $\alpha/2\pi = 235$ MHz; at present, the linewidth is
$\kappa/2\pi = 15 \mathrm{\: MHz}$. The high superconducting gap of niobium
nitride can enable operation at elevated temperatures in future devices, and
the fully planar geometry of the weak link eliminates superfluous material
interfaces and capacitances. The investigation of small patches of material
near the SIT can shed new light on the nature of the transition, including the
role of dissipation and finite-size effects.

### [35] [Quantum Sensing of Gravitational Frame-Dragging with a Superfluid $^4$He Gyrometer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20772)
*Kai-Isaak Ellers,Marios Christodoulou,K. C. Schwab,K. Birgitta Whaley*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Highly sensitive laboratory device measures general relativistic frame-dragging effect on Earth using a superfluid helium single Josephson junction gyrometer.  This device has the potential, at millikelvin temperatures, to achieve extremely precise frame-dragging measurements using future Josephson junction technologies such as those composed of nanoporous 2D materials. Assuming low mechanical losses, the device reaches a noise spectral density of 5×10^-17 rad/s/√Hz at 10 mK, enabling precise measurement of the frame-dragging rate.  The device's sensitivity is sufficient to detect frame-dragging rotations corresponding to proper time differences as small as 10^-35 s in the lab frame.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General relativity is one of the most successful and experimentally verified theories in physics, and the direct local measurement of its basic effect, the frame-dragging (Lense-Thirring) effect, is relevant to potentially very precise metrology. The ability to directly measure this effect in the lab could impact technology, metrology, and different areas of fundamental physics by pinning down a key prediction of general relativity and offering a direct link between it and technology applications.

Method: The authors designed a macroscopic quantum device, a superfluid helium single Josephson junction gyrometer, to measure the frame-dragging and related geodetic and Thomas precession effects. They derived theoretical expressions to describe the frame-dragging effect in the superfluid and presented a procedure for experimental measurement. They also calculated the expected thermal noise floor to prove the device's high sensitivity.

Result: The calculations show that the thermal noise floor is sufficiently low at millikelvin temperatures, suggesting that the device could achieve extremely precise measurements of the frame-dragging effect. The predicted noise spectral density of 5×10^-17 rad/s/√Hz at 10 mK implies that the rotation rate could be measured with 0.2% accuracy within one second. The device's sensitivity corresponds to a measurement of proper time differences as small as 10^-35 s.  This result demonstrates the feasibility of designing macroscopic quantum devices for ultra-sensitive tests of general relativity.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for testing the predictions of general relativity through macroscopic quantum devices designed for such high sensitivity, which could impact metrology, technology, and fundamental physics. The use of superfluid helium single Josephson junctions represents a promising approach for detecting these minute relativistic effects.

Abstract: We propose a laboratory-scale experiment to locally measure the general
relativistic frame-dragging effect on Earth using the macroscopic quantum
properties of a novel superfluid $^4$He single Josephson junction gyrometer. We
derive the frame-dragging and related geodetic and Thomas effects in the
superfluid gyrometer and present a procedure for their experimental
measurement. We compute the expected thermal noise floor and find that very
high sensitivity can be expected at millikelvin temperatures, where near-future
Josephson junctions using nanoporous 2D materials are expected to operate.
Assuming utilization of the lowest mechanical loss materials, we find a noise
spectral density of $5\times 10^{-17}$ rads/s/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 mK,
which is sufficient to resolve the frame-dragging rate to 0.2% within one
second of measurement, giving a rotational sensitivity of 1 revolution in 4
Byrs. This extreme sensitivity to rotation corresponds to a measurement of
proper time differences as small as $10^{-35}$ s.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Encoding in a high-dimensional Hilbert space improves noise resilience in
quantum information processing. However, such an approach may result in
cross-mode coupling and detection complexities, thereby reducing quantum
cryptography performance. This fundamental trade-off between correctness and
secrecy motivates the search for new error-correction approaches to better
exploit the advantages of high-dimensional encoding. Here, we introduce the
method of reduced state embeddings to quantum key distribution (QKD): a
k-dimensional signal set embedded in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, where k<d.
In the framework of quantum error correction, our reduced-state embedding
realizes an explicit erasure-type error-correction within the quantum channel.
We demonstrate the advantage of our scheme in realistic quantum channels,
producing a higher secure key rate. We validate our approach using a d=25 QKD
experimental data, derive closed-form expressions for the key rate and
threshold, and determine the optimal key rate at k=5. These findings advance
high-dimensional QKD and pave the way to error correction and modulation for
quantum cryptography.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the emergence of quantum nonlinearities in the
optical response of lattices of two-level quantum emitters coherently driven by
a laser. For subwavelength lattice periods, where the system behaves as a
quantum metasurface, we find that a resonant incident plane wave can populate
excitonic Bloch states with parallel wavevectors different from the incident
field, including those lying outside the light cone. Closely related to
resonance fluorescence, the far-field emission from the system in the
strong-driving regime is dominated by a broadband background of photons
spanning a wide range of frequencies and wavevectors. Moreover, we show that,
for periods approaching the driving wavelength, the emitter lattice enters in a
bistable regime due to the renormalization of the driving rate, in striking
contrast with its classical (bosonic) analog. This bistable behavior enables
the selective activation and deactivation of the optical quantum nonlinearities
of the system.

Abstract: Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that quantum computing has the
potential to revolutionize numerical linear algebra by enabling algorithms with
complexity superior to what is classically achievable, e.g., the seminal HHL
algorithm for solving linear systems. Efficient execution of such algorithms
critically depends on representing inputs (matrices and vectors) as quantum
circuits that encode or implement these inputs. For that task, two common
circuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state
preparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices
in the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine
methods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical
form, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations.
Two key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for
efficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in
classical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b)
low-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and
state preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially
equivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our
constructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously
multiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an
algorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in
the standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli
matrices.

Abstract: Open quantum systems host a wide range of intriguing phenomena, yet their

combination of Hamiltonian simulation, which converts non-unitary dynamics into
a weighted sum of unitary evolutions. With the further introduction of a
simplified quantum circuit for loss-function evaluation, our scheme is suitable
for near-term quantum hardware, with the circuit depth independent of the
simulation time. We illustrate our scheme by simulating the collective dynamics
of a dissipative transverse Ising model, as well as an interacting
Hatano-Nelson model, on the superconducting quantum processor Wukong. Our work

Abstract: Superconducting protected qubits aim to achieve sufficiently low error rates
so as to allow realization of error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computers.
A recent proposal encodes a protected qubit in the quasicharge degree of
freedom of the conventional transmon device, here referred to as the
`quasicharge qubit'. Operating such a protected qubit requires implementing new
strategies. Here we show that an electronically-controllable tunnel junction
formed by two topological superconductors can be used to implement single- and
two-qubit gates on quasicharge qubits. Schemes for both these gates are based
on dynamical $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and therefore have gate speeds of
the same order. The simulation of the dynamics of a topological Josephson
junction in a parameter regime with non-negligible charging energy is the key
novelty of this work. We also characterize the robustness of such gate
operations against charge noise using Fermi's golden rule. Our results point to
a compelling strategy for implementation of quasicharge qubit gates based on
junctions of minimal Kitaev chains of quantum dots.

Abstract: Real-valued band structures are foundational to analyzing periodic systems
within the Hermitian description and have been experimentally well-established
over recent decades. In contrast, non-Hermitian systems exhibit complex band
structures where both energy and momentum have imaginary parts, underpinning
phenomena like the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous bulk-boundary
correspondence that defy conventional Bloch theory. Experimentally mapping
these complex bands-relating complex momentum to complex energy-and identifying
their associated eigenstates is crucial for understanding these systems but
remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a non-Bloch supercell
framework designed to overcome this challenge by decoupling Bloch phase control
from the imaginary part of momentum. Our method combines an exponent-flattening
protocol with twisted boundary conditions, enabling system-size-independent
control of imaginary momentum while preserving high-resolution Bloch phase
sampling. Implemented in programmable one- and two-dimensional acoustic
crystals, our approach acquires momentum-resolved complex energy surfaces and
biorthogonal eigenmodes by Green's function measurements.Data obtained using
this framework accurately predict open-boundary spectra and eigenstates,
findings we verify through separate open-geometry experiments. Our work
provides a broadly applicable experimental toolkit for exploring non-Hermitian
band geometry and topology in diverse engineered classical and quantum
platforms.

*Ji-Ze Xu,Yin Zhong,Miguel A. Martin-Delgado,Hao Song,Ke Liu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Three-dimensional topological codes offer fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate implementations but their performance under realistic noise is yet to be fully explored. This work investigates the fault-tolerance thresholds of the 3D toric code under Pauli and measurement errors. By deriving two randomly coupled lattice gauge models and utilizing a generalized duality technique, the thresholds are found to be approximately 11% for bit-flip errors and 2% for phase-flip errors. These threshold values demonstrate the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors compared to perfect measurements. This study advances the practical assessment of 3D topological codes, aligns with rapid hardware advancements, and highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation, quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research contributes to our understanding of fault-tolerant quantum computation by advancing the thresholds of topological codes, which are crucial for assessing their practical performance under realistic noise models.

Method: The study employs 3D topological code analysis, incorporating lattice gauge theory, generalized duality, and threshold determination through error analysis under Pauli and measurement noise.

Result: The research identifies specific fault-tolerance thresholds for bit-flip (11
desimal) and phase-flip (2
desimal) errors, demonstrating the code's resilience despite realistic noise conditions.

Conclusion: This work establishes new benchmarks for 3D topological codes and underscores the importance of error correction techniques in advancing quantum computing scalability and reliability.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes offer the advantage of supporting
fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates, yet their performance
against realistic noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on
the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds
in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled
lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived,
including a random 2-form $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a
generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal
thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \approx 11\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \approx 2\%$
against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values
show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements,
establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors.

*Alejandro Hnilo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores why quantum and classical phenomena differ by comparing them to vectors, showing that quantum phenomena can violate classical intuitions despite seeming similar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand the fundamental differences between quantum and classical phenomena by analyzing their similarities and dissimilarities using vector comparisons.

Method: The authors use vector analysis to explain quantum phenomena like Bell's inequalities, teleportation, the Kochen-Specker theorem, and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger theorem, drawing parallels with classical vector spaces.

Result: By using vector models, the paper provides a new perspective on why quantum mechanics deviates from classical physics, highlighting the non-intuitive nature of quantum phenomena.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that viewing quantum phenomena through the lens of vector spaces can help explain their unique characteristics and departure from classical theories.

Abstract: Years ago, Itamar Pitowski asked two relevant questions: Why microphysical
(quantum) phenomena and classical phenomena differ in the way they do? and,
what kind of explanation could qualify as a reasonable one? I argue that both
questions can be answered by the comparison of quantum phenomena with some
features of vectors in real space. In particular, I show how violation of
Bell's inequalities, Teleportation, Kochen-Specker and
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger theorems can be understood in terms of vectors.
This does not mean that the difference between quantum and classical phenomena
is illusory. This means that vectors are stranger objects that they may seem to
be at first sight.

TL;DR: 研究分析了基于纠缠的量子密钥分发（QKD）协议的可行性和实现性，考虑了常见的自发性参数 down-转换（SPDC）源和新颖的量子点（QD）源。研究了SPDC源中的多光子发射和量子点源中的精细结构分离（FSS），以及不完善检测包括暗计数和有限效率。对于 SPDC 源，研究确认了真空状态和多光子对的存在使它们不适于在标准检测策略下安全地实施设备独立（DI）QKD。相反，对于 QD 源，考虑 FSS 效应后，协议的性能有所下降。这些发现对于基于实际源和检测器实现纠缠型 QKD 协议至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果对于在实际应用中实现可靠的纠缠型 QKD 协议具有重要意义，尤其是在选择合适的源和检测器时需要充分考虑各种复杂性因素。

Abstract: We theoretically analyze the feasibility of entanglement-based quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocols considering widely used spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) and novel quantum dot (QD) sources. We account for
multiphoton emission in SPDC sources and fine-structure splitting (FSS) in QD.
In addition, we incorporate imperfect detection, including dark counts and
limited efficiency. For SPDC sources, we confirm that the presence of vacuum
and multiphoton pairs renders them unsuitable for secure device-independent
(DI) QKD implementations under standard detection strategies. Conversely, in
the case of QD sources, accounting for the effects of FSS, results in reduced
performance of protocols. Our findings are crucial for the practical
implementation of entanglement-based QKD protocols using realistic sources and
detectors.

Motivation: Improving floating-point encoding for quantum computing applications to enhance algorithm efficiency.

Method: Two's Complement fixed-point mantissas and integral exponents are used; quantum algorithms for arithmetic operations are developed to test the method.

Result: The encoding converges quickly to exact solutions and reduces qubit usage in certain operations.

Conclusion: This method provides a promising approach for efficient floating-point operations on quantum computers, particularly in terms of convergence and ancilla qubit reduction.

Abstract: We propose a novel floating-point encoding scheme that builds on prior work
involving fixed-point encodings. We encode floating-point numbers using Two's
Complement fixed-point mantissas and Two's Complement integral exponents. We
used our proposed approach to develop quantum algorithms for fundamental
arithmetic operations, such as bit-shifting, reciprocation, multiplication, and
addition. We prototyped and investigated the performance of the floating-point
encoding scheme on quantum computer simulations by performing reciprocation on
randomly drawn inputs and by solving first-order ordinary differential
equations, while varying the number of qubits in the encoding. We observed
rapid convergence to the exact solutions as we increased the number of qubits
and a significant reduction in the number of ancilla qubits required for
reciprocation when compared with similar approaches.

### [50] [Phase Transitions and Virtual Exceptional Points in Quantum Emitters Coupled to Dissipative Baths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20571)
*Stefano Longhi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores controlling atom-photon interactions in engineered environments using non-Hermitian photonic baths. It demonstrates that even simple dissipative bosonic lattices can exhibit rich dynamical phase transitions and optimal conditions for accelerated spontaneous emission. The dynamics are attributed to spectral restructuring of the resolvent, linked to virtual exceptional points and infinite-dimensional non-Hermitian systems. This work has broader implications for dissipation engineering in quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling dissipation in quantum systems is crucial for advancing quantum optics and technologies. This paper provides insights into how non-Hermitian baths can be engineered to achieve desired relaxation dynamics, which is essential for applications like quantum computing and communication.

Method: The study employs a combination of theoretical analysis, mathematical modeling, and numerical simulations to investigate the relaxation dynamics of a quantum emitter coupled to a dissipative bosonic lattice.

Result: The paper identifies specific conditions and mechanisms under which dissipation enhances spontaneous emission rates, offering a framework for optimizing quantum systems through controlled dissipation.

Conclusion: This research establishes a theoretical foundation for leveraging non-Hermitian dissipation in quantum technologies, highlighting the potential of such systems for advancing quantum optics and related fields.

Abstract: Controlling atom-photon interactions in engineered environments is central to
quantum optics and emerging quantum technologies. Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic
baths, where dissipation fundamentally reshapes spectral and dynamical
properties, provide versatile platforms for such control. Here we investigate
the relaxation dynamics of a single two-level quantum emitter coupled to the
edge of a semi-infinite dissipative bosonic lattice with uniform loss. Despite
the simplicity of this bath, we uncover rich dynamical phase transitions, i.e.
qualitative changes in spontaneous emission decay as system parameters are
varied. In particular, we establish the existence of an optimal dissipative
environment for accelerated spontaneous emission. The phase transitions are
traced to spectral restructuring of the resolvent, in some cases governed by
the coalescence of resonance states on the second Riemann sheet. We identify
these coalescences as virtual exceptional points (EPs) of resonance origin,
providing a conceptual bridge with EP physics while highlighting distinctive
features of infinite-dimensional NH systems. More broadly, our results
illustrate how the specific nature of dissipation -- whether uniform losses,
staggered losses, or dephasing -- can profoundly impact emitter relaxation,
pointing to dissipation engineering as a versatile tool for quantum
technologies.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子模拟和量子位操作提供了灵活的控制手段。

Abstract: Parametric modulation is widely employed in superconducting circuits for
quantum simulations and high-fidelity two-qubit gates, valued for its
versatility. Conventionally, the qubit coupling strength is determined by the
amplitude of the parametric flux pulse, which affects qubit parameters
dramatically. In this article, we propose and implement a phase modulation
scheme to tune the interaction strength via adjusting the relative phase
between the parametric flux pulses applied to two coupled qubits. We
characterize this modulation for sideband couplings, at both sweet and offsweet
spots, achieving a broad range of coupling strengths as confirmed by both
population dynamics and spectroscopy methods. This approach enables
phase-controlled modulation of coupling strength, providing a promising
candidate for parametrically driven quantum simulations and gate operations.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are typically present in the dynamics of open quantum
systems. Despite the rich structure of non-Markovian dynamics, their relevance
to quantum information processing (QIP) has been rarely discussed. In this
work, we demonstrate that the negativity of the dynamics, a characteristic of
non-Markovian dynamics, naturally arises in quantum error correction (QEC) and
quantum teleportation. The negativity in open quantum systems is naturally
attributed to the information backflow from the environment. We partition the
whole Hilbert space into the logical subsystem and the gauge subsystem. The
logical subsystem stores the quantum information for QIP, while the gauge
subsystem stores the information for recovery of the logical information, i.e.,
the syndrome measurement outcomes for quantum error correction and Bell
measurement outcomes for successful teleportation. We then show that the
negativity in quantum information processing appears as a consequence of the
feedback operation based on the measurement outcomes of the gauge subsystem.
Finally, we show that the negativity of non-Markovianity in QIP reduces the
sampling cost of quantum error mitigation (QEM), shedding light on the
importance of combination strategies of QEC and QEM in a practical QIP.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子序列判别提供了一种简洁有效的分解方法。

Abstract: We consider the discrimination of quantum sequences under maximum-confidence
measurements and show that the optimal discrimination of a quantum sequence
ensemble can always be factorized into that of each individual ensemble. In
other words, the optimal quantum sequence discrimination under
maximum-confidence measurements can be achieved just by performing a
maximum-confidence discrimination independently at each step of the quantum
sequence. We also show that the maximum confidence of identifying a quantum
sequence is to achieve the maximum confidence of identifying each state
comprising the quantum sequence. We further provide a necessary and sufficient
condition for the optimal quantum state discrimination under maximum-confidence
measurements.

provide a necessary and sufficient characterisation of state conversions in

conditions reduce to the majorisation conditions under unital channels and
provide a thermodynamic version of Nielsen's theorem in entanglement theory. We
show how this result establishes the first universal resource certification
class based on thermodynamics, and how it can be employed to quantify general
quantum resources based on work extraction.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In quantum optics and condensed matter physics non-Hermitian phenomena are
often studied under the assumption of an open physical system. However, there
are examples of intrinsically non-Hermitian, though often $\mathcal{PT}$
(parity-time) symmetric, not necessarily open systems, in which case the
concept of gain and loss relative to an underlying environment is not
primordial. A particularly intriguing example with experimental consequences in
the literature is QCD at finite density. Motivated by the existence of such
inherently non-Hermitian systems, here we study the critical behavior of a
$U(1)$-invariant Lagrangian perturbed by a complex, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric
$Z_{4}$ anisotropy. We find real critical exponents both in the region of
unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. In the former the coupling
constants for fixed points or lines are real, whereas in the latter they become
complex. Importantly, the most stable fixed point corresponds to the flow at
large distances towards an effectively Hermitian $U(1)$ symmetric system. This
constitutes an example where both the $U(1)$ and the Hermitian character are
emergent features of the theory. This tells us about the importance and
physical meaning of some non-Hermitian systems beyond interpretations involving
gain and loss.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Noisy quantum illumination can achieve the same resolution as classical methods when certain conditions related to the energy spectrum in the presence of local quantum noise are met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses a fundamental issue in quantum radar: whether quantum illumination remains effective when quantum noise is present.

Method: The authors go beyond the Born-Markov approximation, examining the energy spectrum of the system affected by local quantum noise.

Result: The study shows that when a bound state exists in the system's energy spectrum, the resolution of noisy quantum illumination asymptotically approaches the ideal level.

Conclusion: This research establishes a physical principle for maintaining quantum superiority in noisy environments, paving the way for practical quantum radar applications in intermediate-scale quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum illumination uses quantum entanglement as a resource to enable
higher-resolution detection of low-reflectivity targets than is possible with
classical techniques. This revolutionary technology could transform modern
radar. However, it is widely believed that the decoherence induced by the
ubiquitous quantum noise destroys the superiority of quantum illumination,
severely constraining its performance and application in our present noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we propose a method to restore the
quantum superiority of the quantum illumination in the presence of quantum
noises. Going beyond the widely used Born-Markov approximation, we discover
that the resolution of noisy quantum illumination is highly sensitive to the
energy spectrum of the composite system formed by each of the two light modes
and its local quantum noise. When a bound state is present in the energy
spectrum, the resolution asymptotically approaches its ideal form. Our result
establishes a physical principle to preserve the quantum superiority and paves
the way for the realization of high-resolution quantum illumination in noisy
situations.

TL;DR: Multiplexed temporal mode multiplexing enhances heralded entanglement generation between trapped-ion quantum nodes, achieving a 4.59-fold speedup and 95.9±1.5% entanglement fidelity over 1.2 km of fiber.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the presented work is the need for efficient entanglement distribution in large-scale quantum networks. The demonstrated multiplexing strategy addresses this challenge by significantly accelerating the generation of entanglement, thereby facilitating the scalability and practical implementation of quantum networks.

Method: The method used in this study involves the multiplexing of 10 temporal photonic modes within a single ion-string state. This approach enables the simultaneous generation of multiple entangled pairs, effectively enhancing the overall rate of entanglement generation while maintaining high fidelity.

Result: The implementation of the described multiplexing technique allows for a notable improvement in the speed of entanglement generation, achieving a 4.59-fold increase. Additionally, the system maintains an entanglement fidelity of 95.9±1.5% over a distance of 1.2 km, demonstrating robust performance even at longer optical fiber lengths.

Conclusion: This study presents a groundbreaking advancement in the field of quantum networking by introducing a scalable and efficient method for entanglement distribution. The successful demonstration of multiplexed temporal mode multiplexing paves the way for future developments in large-scale quantum networks, paving the way for practical applications in distributed quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication.

Abstract: Quantum networks and quantum repeaters represent the promising avenues for
building large-scale quantum information systems, serving as foundational
infrastructure for distributed quantum computing, long-distance quantum
communication, and networked quantum sensing. A critical step in realizing a
functional quantum network is the efficient and high-fidelity establishment of
heralded entanglement between remote quantum nodes. Multiplexing offers a
powerful strategy to accelerate remote entanglement distribution, particularly
over long optical fibers. Here, we demonstrate the first multiplexing-enhanced
heralded entanglement between two trapped-ion quantum network nodes. By
multiplexing $10$ temporal photonic modes, we achieve a 4.59-fold speedup in
ion-ion entanglement generation and attain an entanglement fidelity of
$95.9\pm1.5\%$ over $1.2$ km of fiber. Employing a dual-type architecture, our
system is readily scalable to multiple nodes, thereby establishing a key
building block for future large-scale quantum networks.

Conclusion: 研究为了解量子纠缠与重力之间的关系提供了理论框架，显示出动态机制的需要在生成量子纠缠中，以及在某些模型中重力的质量独立行质。

Abstract: We employ the quantum Boltzmann equation to analyze the gravitationally
generated entanglement between two remote qubits by considering two explicit
microscopic models. A graviton propagator is employed as the mediator of the
interactions, while the qubits are considered in a spatial superposition state.
Such a setup, in the case of any entanglement generation, could potentially
offer experimental evidence for the quantization of gravity. By treating the
qubits as spin-1/2 particles in wave packets, we establish that the
entanglement arises from forward scattering processes involving graviton
exchanges. In our study, we consider both static and dynamical limits of the
propagator and show that only in the dynamical limit such entangled states can
be generated. We also show that for the microscopic model based on the fermion
particles in the background of magnetic field, the amount of entanglement
depends on the Larmor frequency of the qubits, rather than their masses. These
effects are observed to diminish in both models as the wave packet size
increases. Our findings sheds more light into the gravity mediated entanglement
between two spin-1/2 particles.

Abstract: Sub-picotesla level magnetometry has been demonstrated using
negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond by increasing the
number of spins simultaneously used for sensing in an NV ensemble. However,
such scale-up often introduces spatial inhomogeneities in detuning and control
field amplitudes, which degrade sensitivity. Although several techniques have
been utilized to overcome these challenges, including pulsed dynamical
decoupling or shaped pulses, these are not generally compatible with the
current state-of-the-art techniques for GHz-range AC magnetometry with NV
ensembles, which are typically based on Rabi oscillations. In this work we
experimentally demonstrate GHz-range AC magnetometry using a large ensemble of
NV centers under spatially inhomogeneous drive fields by employing concatenated
continuous dynamical decoupling, which is designed for robustness against such
imperfections. We compare its performance with the conventional direct Rabi
method and show that the robust dressed states in our method extend
significantly the measuring range to weaker signals in GHz-range AC
magnetometry.

Abstract: Probing quantum dynamics in the strong-field regime is critical for advancing
our understanding of controlled quantum systems and developing robust quantum
technologies. In this work, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of a
trapped ion where the Rabi frequency (Omega) approaches the vibrational mode
frequency (nu), pushing the system beyond the weak-field regime, where
non-trivial quantum correlations emerge. We begin by setting the detuning
(delta) - the frequency offset between the qubit transition and the driving
field - to zero and varying Omega from low to high values, eventually reaching
the vibrational frequency. Using quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the
density matrix and track its evolution to assess non-Markovianity, revealing
significant memory effects governed by the interplay between internal and
motional degrees of freedom. Furthermore, by exploring the dynamics across
various parameter pairs (Omega, delta), we find that non-Markovianity does not
always increase monotonically with Omega for a fixed delta. Strikingly, when
the condition delta squared plus Omega squared equals nu squared is met, the
non-Markovianity exhibits a circular pattern of maxima. At this parameter
combination, the system's Hamiltonian takes a form similar to the
Jaynes-Cummings model, enabling the possibility of analytical insights into the
observed dynamics. These results go beyond the conventional carrier and
sideband regimes, uncovering novel features of strong-field quantum dynamics.
Our findings establish a pathway for using trapped-ion platforms to investigate
non-Markovianity, coherent control, and the fundamental behavior of open
quantum systems in extreme regimes.

Abstract: Stabilizer states are a central resource in quantum information processing,
underpinning a wide range of applications. While they can be efficiently
generated via Clifford circuits, the presence of coherent errors, such as
small-angle miscalibrations in native gate implementations, can significantly
impact their quality. In this work, we introduce Variational Coherent Error
Mitigation (VCEM), a method that employs the stabilizer formalism to suppress
coherent errors through variational optimization of native gates parameters.
VCEM demonstrates robust performance, remaining largely unaffected by
incoherent noise, enabling pre-compensation of coherent errors prior to the
application of standard incoherent error mitigation techniques. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and robustness of VCEM through numerical simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses practical contexts in quantum computing where fixed input states can be advantageous, such as unitary programming.

Method: A variant of higher-order quantum computing is analyzed, comparing scenarios with fixed versus unknown input states.

Result: Classical knowledge of the input state improves performance, and the variant can enable deterministic implementation for specific mixed states.

Conclusion: Fixed input states offer practical benefits, and the analysis provides insights for protocol design in quantum computing.

Abstract: In higher-order quantum computing (HOQC), one typically considers the
universal transformation of unknown quantum operations, treated as blackboxes.
It is also implicitly assumed that the resulting operation must act on
arbitrary, and thus unknown, input states. In this work, we explore a variant
of this framework in which the operation remains unknown, but the input state
is fixed and known. We argue that this assumption is well-motivated in certain
practical contexts, such as unitary programming, and show that classical
knowledge of the input state can significantly enhance performance. Moreover,
this assumption allows us to distinguish between protocols designed for pure,
bipartite, and mixed states, which enables us to identify the class of mixed
states for which deterministic and exact implementation becomes possible.

Abstract: In recent years, quantum simulators of topological models have been
extensively studied across a variety of platforms and regimes. A new promising
research direction makes use of meta-atoms with multiple intrinsic degrees of
freedom, which to date have been predominantly studied in the classical regime.
Here, we propose a superconducting quantum simulator to study an extension of
the well-known "Zig-Zag" model with long-range cross-polarization couplings
using polarization transmons hosting degenerate dipole orbitals. We map the
phase transitions of the extended "Zig-Zag" model both numerically and
analytically using inverse participation ratios and topological invariants. We
demonstrate the existence of in-gap localized trivial and Tamm edge states.
With linearized meta-atoms, we show via electromagnetic modeling that the
proposed arrangement closely reproduces the extended "Zig-Zag" model. This work
paves the way towards experimental investigation of the previously inaccessible

Conclusion: 基于电流快速扫描的非平衡Josephson 结合器为提高单光子探测灵敏度提供了新方案，具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: It is well known that the current-biased Josephson junction (CBJJ) can serve
as a Josephson threshold detector (JTD) for the sensitive detection of weak
microwave signals. Based on the recent work (PRB {\bf 111}, 024501 (2025)) on
the detection sensitive limit of the usual equilibrium JTD, here we numerically
demonstrate that a non-equilibrium JTD can be alternatively utilized to
implement the higher sensitive detection of a weak microwave signal, arriving
at its energy quantum limit. In the presence of thermal noise, we numerically
simulate the phase dynamics for the CBJJ in the JTD with the different sweep
rates of the biased currents, and find that the SCDs of the JTD with and
without the microwave signal input show different behaviors. It is demonstrated
that, depending on how high the sweep rate of the biased current being applied,
the JTD can be operated in either the equilibrium- or the non-equilibrium
state. Specifically, under the rapidly non-adiabatic driving, the SCDs of the
JTD are obviously insensitive to the thermal noises, which means that the
non-equilibrium JTD can possess a higher achievable detection sensitivity,
compared with its equilibrium state counterpart. Consequently, the
non-equilibrium JTD can be utilized to implement the desired single
microwave-photon detection. Also, some of the achievable performance indexes,
such as the dynamic range, detection bandwidth, and the photon-number
resolvability, etc., of the non-equilibrium JTD have been estimated, when it
serves as a wideband microwave single-photon detector.

TL;DR: A perturbed Harper model on a torus generates approximate 3-designs with uniform control parameter distributions, even with drifting parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding pseudo-random unitary operators is vital for quantum information and computing.

Method: Used perturbed Harper model's ergodic Floquet system on a torus, varying control parameters uniformly, analyzed using k-frame potentials.

Result: Achieved approximate 3-designs with 4 control parameters regardless of drift, fewer required if parameters drift.

Conclusion: Perturbed Harper model can efficiently generate approximate 3-designs for quantum applications under controlled parameter changes.

Abstract: We explore using an ergodic Floquet quantum system on a torus to generate
pseudo-random unitary operators. We choose a regime of the perturbed Harper
model with strong perturbations and perturbation frequency exceeding the
libration frequency to ensure that the system has an ergodic region that covers
phase space and lacks resonant substructure. We generate a sample of unitary
operators in a finite dimensional space by computing Floquet propagators from a
distribution of its control parameters. To compare the distribution of
unitaries to that of a Haar-random distribution, we compute k-frame potentials
from samples of numerically generated unitaries. We find that uniform
distributions of 4 control parameters can generate an approximate 3-design.
Distributions of fewer control parameters are required to create an approximate
3-design if the Floquet system parameters drift.

Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as a new computing paradigm with the
potential to improve decision-making, optimization, and simulation across
industries. For industrial engineering (IE) and operations research (OR), this
shift introduces both unprecedented opportunities and substantial challenges.
The learning curve is high, and to help researchers navigate the emerging field
of quantum operations research, we provide a road map of the current field of
quantum operations research. We introduce the foundational principles of
quantum computing, outline the current hardware and software landscape, and
survey major algorithmic advances relevant to IE/OR, including quantum
approaches to linear algebra, optimization, machine learning, and stochastic
simulation. We then highlight applied research directions, including the
importance of problem domains for driving long-term value of quantum computers
and how existing classical OR models can be reformulated for quantum hardware.
Recognizing the steep learning curve, we propose pathways for IE/OR researchers
to develop technical fluency and engage in this interdisciplinary domain. By
bridging theory with application, and emphasizing the interplay between
hardware and research development, we argue that industrial engineers are
uniquely positioned to shape the trajectory of quantum computing for practical
problem-solving. Ultimately, we aim to lower the barrier to entry into quantum
computing, motivate new collaborations, and chart future directions where
quantum technologies may deliver tangible impact for industry and academia.

Motivation: 本文的动机是解决量子物理中难以处理的随机相位率和多激发态问题。传统的展开方法在弱耦pling假设下有其局限性，不能广泛应用于各个领域。作为替代方案，该论文提出了一种不依赖于耦pling强度假设的新方法，旨在更广泛地适用。

Conclusion: 该论文提供了一种在量子物理和复杂动力系统研究中适用的新方法，该方法无需弱耦pling假设，能够在线性时间内提供高准确度的结果。该方法不仅适用于量子物理问题，还扩展到了其他复杂动态研究领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for approximating the dynamics of a
large autonomous system projected onto a fixed subspace. The core contribution
is a novel recursive algorithm to construct an effective time-dependent
generator that is polynomial in the time variable, ensuring accuracy for short
time scales. The derivation is based on the Taylor expansion of the exponential
map and a new result for computing the time-ordered exponential of polynomial
generators. This work is motivated by the challenge of deriving
time-convolutionless master equations in quantum physics and the proposed
method offers an alternative to typical derivations based on expansions in the
coupling strength. The resulting approximation is accurate for small times,
does not require a weak-coupling assumption, performs better than a truncation
of the exponential map at low orders, and crucially, guarantees a completely
positive and trace-preserving map at the lowest orders. The proposed method is
validated against several prototypical models: a dephasing spin-boson model, a
central spin model, and an Ising spin chain.

### [69] [Classical Noise Inversion: A Practical and Optimal framework for Robust Quantum Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20686)
*Dayue Qin,Ying Li,You Zhou*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: CNI offers a way to mitigate quantum noise without expensive quantum sampling, even under realistic gate-dependent noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error mitigation is vital due to noisy processors, but traditional methods have high costs and unrealistic assumptions.

Method: CNI inverts noise classically, avoids quantum sampling, and works under realistic noise conditions.

Result: Reduces statistical variance and provides unbiased estimates in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: CNI enables scalable quantum applications with manageable classical costs and without unrealistic noise assumptions.

Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is a critical technology for extracting reliable
computations from noisy quantum processors, proving itself essential not only
in the near term but also as a valuable supplement to fully fault-tolerant
systems in the future. However, its practical implementation is hampered by two
major challenges: the expansive cost of sampling from quantum circuits and the
reliance on unrealistic assumptions, such as gate-independent noise. Here, we
introduce Classical Noise Inversion (CNI), a framework that fundamentally
bypasses these crucial limitations and is well-suited for various quantum
applications. CNI effectively inverts the accumulated noise entirely during
classical post-processing, thereby eliminating the need for costly quantum
circuit sampling and remaining effective under the realistic condition of
gate-dependent noise. Apart from CNI, we introduce noise compression, which
groups noise components with equivalent effects on measurement outcomes,
achieving the optimal overhead for error mitigation. We integrate CNI with the
framework of shadow estimation to create a robust protocol for learning quantum
properties under general noise. Our analysis and numerical simulations
demonstrate that this approach substantially reduces statistical variance while
providing unbiased estimates in practical situations where previous methods
fail. By transforming a key quantum overhead into a manageable classical cost,
CNI opens a promising pathway towards scalable and practical quantum
applications.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the implementation of quantum algorithms for solving differential equations and demonstrates their effectiveness on a quantum computer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differential equations play a crucial role in engineering and science, and the paper explores how quantum computing can improve their solution efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces a variational approach called Differentiable Quantum Circuits (DQC) and Quantum Extremal Learning (QEL) for solving differential equations. It then implements a closed-loop experiment on an analog quantum computer using neutral atoms.

Result: The implementation shows that both DQC and QEL can solve differential equations and run effectively on quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that quantum computing offers a promising alternative for solving differential equations, leveraging quantum hardware advancements.

Abstract: Solving and optimizing differential equations (DEs) is ubiquitous in both
engineering and fundamental science. The promise of quantum architectures to
accelerate scientific computing thus naturally involved interest towards how
efficiently quantum algorithms can solve DEs. Differentiable quantum circuits
(DQC) offer a viable route to compute DE solutions using a variational approach
amenable to existing quantum computers, by producing a machine-learnable
surrogate of the solution. Quantum extremal learning (QEL) complements such
approach by finding extreme points in the output of learnable models of unknown
(implicit) functions, offering a powerful tool to bypass a full DE solution, in
cases where the crux consists in retrieving solution extrema. In this work, we
provide the results from the first experimental demonstration of both DQC and
QEL, displaying their performance on a synthetic usecase. Whilst both DQC and
QEL are expected to require digital quantum hardware, we successfully challenge
this assumption by running a closed-loop instance on a commercial analog
quantum computer, based upon neutral atom technology.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 在量子基础理论中，确定观测统计量不能被合理解释为任何经典模型的中心问题是不合理的。进行实验Purple光量子准备和测量出现非classical性统计的典型性很高。通过数值线性规划测试广义非contextual模型的存在性，发现即使在少量随机准备和测量的情况下，上下文环境出现的概率超过99%。此外，甚至是在准备的纯度（清晰度）下降时，上下文环境的典型性也有所下降，但这种变化并不明显。实验中的噪声只会略微削弱上下文环境的典型性。最后，我们发现虽然存在某种程度的上下文环境并非很典型，但在给定实验参数下，达到较好典型性的上下文环境需要更复杂的参数配置。我们还提供了用于分析上下文环境典型性的开源工具包。它能够根据可调参数（例如纯度的下限和上限以及其他约束）输出上下文环境的典型性。该工具可以指导设计实现特定实验约束的典型性上下文环境的实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文研究的是量子基础理论中的上下文环境问题，具体来说，是研究实验中随机选择的量子准备和测量出现的非classical性统计量的典型性。通过数值线性规划分析，得出的结论是，即使在实验参数较少的情况下，上下文环境的出现概率也相当高。此外，处理噪声对上下文环境的影响并不显著，但这些发现为量子实验的设计提供了指导意义。

Method: 该研究使用了数值线性规划方法来测试广义非contextual模型的存在性。通过模拟不同参数下的实验配置，计算上下文环境发生的概率。这种方法能够有效地量化上下文环境的典型性。

Result: 论文的主要结果表明，上下文环境在实验中的表现相当典型。具体来说，即使在实验参数较少的情况下，上下文环境的出现概率也在99%以上。此外，处理噪声对上下文环境的影响并不显著，尤其是在准备的纯度下降时，上下文环境的典型性仍然保持较高。

Conclusion: 通过数值线性规划方法分析，论文得出了大规模量子优势情况罕见的结论。而至少存在少量上下文环境的高典型性情况则非常常见。这为量子实际实现提供了重要的理论指导。

Abstract: Identifying when observed statistics cannot be explained by any reasonable
classical model is a central problem in quantum foundations. A principled and
universally applicable approach to defining and identifying nonclassicality is
given by the notion of generalized noncontextuality. Here, we study the
typicality of contextuality -- namely, the likelihood that randomly chosen
quantum preparations and measurements produce nonclassical statistics. Using
numerical linear programs to test for the existence of a
generalized-noncontextual model, we find that contextuality is fairly common:
even in experiments with only a modest number of random preparations and
measurements, contextuality arises with probability over 99%. We also show that
while typicality of contextuality decreases as the purity (sharpness) of the
preparations (measurements) decreases, this dependence is not especially
pronounced, so contextuality is fairly typical even in settings with realistic
noise. Finally, we show that although nonzero contextuality is quite typical,
quantitatively high degrees of contextuality are not as typical, and so large
quantum advantages (like for parity-oblivious multiplexing, which we take as a
case study) are not as typical. We provide an open-source toolbox that outputs
the typicality of contextuality as a function of tunable parameters (such as
lower and upper bounds on purity and other constraints on states and
measurements). This toolbox can inform the design of experiments that achieve
the desired typicality of contextuality for specified experimental constraints.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum
codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum
Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis
strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)
equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented
within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that
supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow
reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,
edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.
Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates
the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics
into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and
the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with
nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits,
systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic
logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$
at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring
structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities
for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue
degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal
controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts
diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,
combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It
yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger
$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

Conclusion: 该论文提供了一种高效、低能耗的算法，实现了任意长度克里夫特序列的最佳门次数，为量子计算中的多体门操作优化提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We investigate quantum circuits built from arbitrary single-qubit operations
combined with programmable all-to-all multiqubit entangling gates that are
native to, among other systems, trapped-ion quantum computing platforms. We
report a constant-cost of no more than four applications of such Clifford
entangling multiqubit gates to realize any sequence of Clifford operations of
any length, without ancillae, which is the theoretically optimal gate count
cost. We do this by implementing any sequence of CNOT gates of any length with
four applications of such gates, without ancillae, and show that the extension
to general Clifford operations incurs no additional cost. We investigate the
required qubit drive power that is associated with our implementation and show
that it is lower than that of a standard approach. Our work introduces a
practical and computationally efficient algorithm to realize these
compilations.

Conclusion: 论文为量子态分类问题的求解提供了理论框架，并展示了不同情况下的计算难度。

Abstract: The problem of quantum state classification asks how accurately one can
identify an unknown quantum state that is promised to be drawn from a known set
of pure states. In this work, we introduce the notion of $k$-learnability,
which captures the ability to identify the correct state using at most $k$
guesses, with zero error. We show that deciding whether a given family of
states is $k$-learnable can be solved via semidefinite programming. When there
are $n$ states, we present polynomial-time (in $n$) algorithms for determining
$k$-learnability for two cases: when $k$ is a fixed constant or the dimension
of the states is a fixed constant. When both $k$ and the dimension of the
states are part of the input, we prove that there exist succinct certificates
placing the problem in NP, and we establish NP-hardness by a reduction from the
classical $k$-clique problem. Together, our findings delineate the boundary
between efficiently solvable and intractable instances of quantum state
classification in the perfect (zero-error) regime.

Abstract: We present a quantum-native approach to quantum feature selection (QFS) based
on analog quantum simulation with neutral atom arrays, adaptable to a variety
of academic and industrial applications. In our method, feature
relevance-measured via mutual information with the target-is encoded as local
detuning amplitudes, while feature redundancy is embedded through
distance-dependent van der Waals interactions, constrained by the Rydberg
blockade radius. The system is evolved adiabatically toward low-energy
configurations, and the resulting measurement bitstrings are used to extract
physically consistent subsets of features. The protocol is evaluated through
simulations on three benchmark binary classification datasets: Adult Income,
Bank Marketing, and Telco Churn. Compared to classical methods such as mutual
information ranking and Boruta, combined with XGBoost and Random Forest
classifiers, our quantum-computing approach achieves competitive or superior
performance. In particular, for compact subsets of 2-5 features, analog QFS
improves mean AUC scores by 1.5-2.3% while reducing the number of features by
75-84%, offering interpretable, low-redundancy solutions. These results
demonstrate that programmable Rydberg arrays offer a viable platform for
intelligent feature selection with practical relevance in machine learning
pipelines, capable of transforming computational quantum advantage into
industrial quantum usefulness.

Abstract: Accurate thermal modeling of Terminal Test Masses (TTMs) is crucial for
optimizing the sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometers like Virgo. In
fact, in such gravitational wave detectors even minimal laser power absorption
can induce performance-limiting thermal effects. This paper presents a detailed
investigation into the steady-state thermal behavior of TTMs. In particular,
future scenarios of increased intracavity laser beam power and optical coating
absorption are considered. We develop and compare two numerical models: a
comprehensive model incorporating volumetric heat absorption in both the
multilayer coating and the bulk substrate, and a simplified reduced model where
the coating's thermal impact is represented as an effective surface boundary
condition on the substrate. Our simulations were focused on a ternary coating
design, which is a candidate for use in next-generation detectors. Results
reveal that higher coating absorption localizes peak temperatures near the
coating--vacuum interface. Importantly, the comparative analysis demonstrates
that temperature predictions from the reduced model differ from the detailed
model by only milli-Kelvins, a discrepancy often within the experimental
uncertainties of the system's thermo-physical parameters. This finding suggests
that computationally efficient reduced models can provide sufficiently accurate
results for thermal management and first-order distortion analyses. Moreover,
the critical role of accurately characterizing the total power absorbed by the
coating is emphasized.

Abstract: A reproducible deep learning framework is presented for surface metrology to
predict surface texture parameters together with their reported standard
uncertainties. Using a multi-instrument dataset spanning tactile and optical
systems, measurement system type classification is addressed alongside
coordinated regression of Ra, Rz, RONt and their uncertainty targets
(Ra_uncert, Rz_uncert, RONt_uncert). Uncertainty is modelled via quantile and
heteroscedastic heads with post-hoc conformal calibration to yield calibrated
intervals. On a held-out set, high fidelity was achieved by single-target
regressors (R2: Ra 0.9824, Rz 0.9847, RONt 0.9918), with two uncertainty
targets also well modelled (Ra_uncert 0.9899, Rz_uncert 0.9955); RONt_uncert
remained difficult (R2 0.4934). The classifier reached 92.85% accuracy and
probability calibration was essentially unchanged after temperature scaling
(ECE 0.00504 -> 0.00503 on the test split). Negative transfer was observed for
naive multi-output trunks, with single-target models performing better. These
results provide calibrated predictions suitable to inform instrument selection
and acceptance decisions in metrological workflows.

Abstract: Monochromators are an essential component in electron microscopy and
spectroscopy for enhancing the spatial and energy resolution. However, its
adoption in scanning electron microscopes remains limited because of its high
cost and operational complexity. Through a thin-deflector analysis of an
electrostatic homogeneous-field deflector, the extreme sensitivity of current
monochromators to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections is
demonstrated. These stringent alignment requirements for achieving optimal
energy resolution often necessitate the use of additional correcting elements,
adding to both cost and complexity. We demonstrate that the fringe-field
deflector is instead less sensitive to these issues. Hence, a cost effective
and simple monochromator design approach based on pure fringe fields is
proposed. This monochromator does not need extra correcting elements and its
optimal energy resolution is achieved by including momentary deceleration
lenses surrounding the main deflector. This fully electrostatic design could be
realized using MEMS technology, offering a simpler and more accessible approach
for filtering beam energies.

Abstract: Voltage control of magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) induced by charge accumulation
is typically considered as an ultrafast process, enabling energy-efficient and
high-speed magnetization switching in spintronic devices. In this work, we
investigate the real-time dynamics of VCMA-assisted switching of magnetic
tunnel junctions via relaxation in a magnetic field. We show that
device-dependent charging effects and magnetic granularity in the free layer
limit the switching speed at applied voltages close to the critical switching
threshold. Increasing the voltage or the applied magnetic field reduces the
incubation delay and total switching time to below a few ns. Micromagnetic
simulations incorporating the finite charging times of the tunnel junction and
the granularity of the magnetic film reproduce the experimental results,
providing critical insights into optimizing VCMA-driven magnetization control
for memory and logic applications.

Abstract: We demonstrate a method to generate application-ready truly random bits from
a magnetic tunnel junction driven by a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We
implement a real-time feedback loop that stabilizes the switching probability
near 50\% and apply an XOR operation, both on the FPGA, to suppress short-term

This combined approach enables NIST-compliant random bit generation at 5~Mb/s
without post-processing, providing a practical hardware solution for fast and
reliable true random number generation. Beyond cryptographic applications,
these capabilities open opportunities for stochastic hardware accelerators,
probabilistic computing, and large-scale modeling where real-time access to

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding trapped Fermi gases' breathing modes is crucial for exploring quantum many-body physics and cold atom systems.

Method: The authors use mathematical derivations involving associated Laguerre polynomials, contact-weighted products, and finite temperature analysis.

Result: Explicit expressions for fractional shifts ( Q^{-1}), anomaly corrections ( Q^{-2} ), and finite temperature behaviors, including low-T plateau and high-T tail.

Conclusion: The derived laws provide a precise framework for experimental validation of breathing mode dynamics in harmonically trapped Fermi gases.

Abstract: We derive universal, experiment ready analytic laws for the breathing
(monopole) mode of harmonically trapped Fermi gases. Within a fixed
hyperangular channel $s>0$, contact-weighted products of associated Laguerre
polynomials reduce to an elementary gamma ratio, yielding: (i) a level resolved
fractional breathing mode shift with scaling $\delta\omega/(2\omega)\propto
Q^{-1}$, where $Q\equiv 2q+s+1$, with $q$ the radial quantum number; (ii) a
first order quantum anomaly correction involving exactly two intermediate
states, producing a $Q^{-2}$ falloff of the leaked monopole strength with an
explicit prefactor; and (iii) a closed form finite temperature average
exhibiting a low-$T$ plateau and a $1/T$ high-$T$ tail. We also obtain a mixed
anomaly\nobreakdash-quartic correction for weak anharmonicity. All expressions
become parameter free after a single per-channel calibration of the Tan contact
$\lambda_s$ at $q=0$.

Conclusion: LLPS在缓冲浓度波动方面具有固有的动态限制，这不仅揭示了活系统如何适应波动环境，还为合成LLPS提供了设计指南。

Abstract: Living systems must maintain robust biochemical function despite fluctuations
that span a wide range of timescales. Biomolecular condensates formed by
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been shown to buffer concentration
fluctuations, but the principles governing their dynamic regulation remain
unclear. We address this by probing the response of LLPS to oscillatory
perturbations that mimic fluctuations across different timescales, establishing
the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of concentration buffering by
condensates. We find that condensates act as frequency-selective filters: the
perturbed dilute phase behaves as a high-pass filter, while the dense phase
attenuates both low- and high-frequency perturbations. We establish
quantitative links between LLPS parameters including interaction strength,
droplet size, and molecular diffusivity, and the timescale range over which
condensates effectively buffer concentration fluctuations. These findings
establish the fundamental dynamical limits of concentration buffering by LLPS,
with implications for how cells may use LLPS to adapt to fluctuating
environments and for the design of synthetic condensates with programmable
control properties.

Abstract: Features of complex vector light become important in any interference
effects, including scattering, diffraction, and non-linear processes. Here we
are investigating the role of polarization-structured light in atomic state
interferometers. Unlike optical or atomic path interferometers, these
facilitate local interference between atomic transition amplitudes and hence
the orthogonal optical polarization components driving these transitions. We
develop a fully analytical description for the inter action of generalized
structured light with an atomic four state system, that is multiply connected
via optical as well as magnetic transitions. Our model allows us to identify
spatially dependent dark states, associated with spatially structured
absorption coefficients, which are defined by the geometry of the polarization
state and the magnetic field direction. We illustrate this for a range of
optical beams including polarization vortices, optical skyrmions and
polarization lattices. This results in a new interpretation and an enhanced
understanding of atomic state interferometry, and a versatile mechanism to
modify and control optical absorption as a function of polarization and
magnetic field alignment.

Abstract: We present a depletion imaging technique to map out the spatial and temporal
dependency of the density distribution of an ultracold gas of Rydberg atoms.
Locally resolved absorption depletion, observed through differential ground
state absorption imaging of a $^{87}\text{Rb}$ cloud in presence and absence of
pre-excited Rydberg atoms, reveals their projected two-dimensional
distribution. By employing a closed two-level optical transition uncoupled from
the Rydberg state, the highly excited atoms are preserved during imaging. We
measure the excitation dynamics of the $\vert48S\rangle$ state of
$^{87}\text{Rb}$, observing a saturation of the two-dimensional Rydberg
density. Such outcome can be explained by the Rydberg blockade effect which
prevents resonant excitation of close-by Rydberg atoms due to strong dipolar
interactions. By combining the superatom description, where atoms within a
blockade radius are represented as collective excitations, with a Monte Carlo
sampling, we can quantitatively model the observed excitation dynamics and
infer the full three-dimensional distribution of Rydberg atoms, that can serve
as a starting point for quantum simulation of many-body dynamics involving
Rydberg spin systems.

Abstract: Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is typically formulated as an
open-ended random walk in an overcomplete space of Slater determinants,
implemented through a Langevin equation. However, the explicit form of the
underlying Fokker-Planck equation governing the walker population distribution
has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation for
AFQMC and propose a novel numerical scheme to solve it. The solution of the
Fokker-Planck equation reveals the wavefunction actually sampled by the AFQMC
algorithm. Interestingly, we find that even when the exact ground state is used
as a guiding wavefunction in constrained path AFQMC, contrary to the common
assumption, the wavefunction sampled by AFQMC is not exact. Beyond clarifying
several fundamental aspects of AFQMC, the availability of a Fokker-Planck
equation formulation opens new avenues for systematically improving its
accuracy, which we outline in this paper.

Abstract: The present study presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of atom

formalism. The proposed methodology establishes a rigorous framework for
treating inelastic collisions in the space-fixed coordinate system. The
excellent numerical performance of the method is demonstrated through the
comparison of state-to-state rotationally inelastic R-matrix cross sections for

accuracy while achieving substantially reduced computation times. The method is
furthermore shown to achieve more than one order-of-magnitude speedup by
exploiting GPU-accelerated diagonalisation through the MAGMA library. This
combination of accuracy and computational efficiency positions the R--matrix

Abstract: The implicit solvent approach offers a computationally efficient framework to
model solvation effects in molecular simulations. However, its accuracy often
falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise
thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML)
present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural
networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse
applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on
force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an
arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy
comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network
(GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network
(LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the
derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can
be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of
approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions
with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while
offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for
future applications in drug discovery.

TL;DR: The study explores using machine learning for modeling aerosol properties, highlighting the need for interpretable molecular descriptors like ATMOMACCS that combine molecular substructure motifs with other features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding atmospheric aerosols is crucial for improving air quality and climate models. However, machine learning approaches face limitations in interpreting molecular descriptors tied to specific substructures, which often fail to capture fully complex atmospheric compounds, especially large and highly oxidized ones.

Method: The researchers developed a new descriptor, ATMOMACCS, which integrates the MACCS fingerprint with motifs inspired by the SIMPOL method. They trained models on four atmospheric compound datasets and evaluated their performance against existing methods.

Result: ATMOMACCS significantly improved the accuracy of predicting key aerosol properties including saturation vapor pressure, partition coefficients, glass transition temperatures, and enthalpy of vaporization. The enhanced performance was evident across datasets, demonstrating the descriptor's versatility.

Conclusion: ATMOMACCS represents a valuable tool for atmospheric research, offering interpretable and effective descriptors to model complex molecular properties.

Abstract: The study of aerosol formation and chemistry using machine learning is
limited by the lack of molecular descriptors suited to atmospheric compounds.
Interpretable models are particularly affected because they often rely on
dictionary-based descriptors tied to specific molecular substructures, which
currently fail to capture the full range of organic atmospheric compounds,
including large, highly oxidized molecules common in the atmosphere. We
introduce ATMOMACCS, an interpretable descriptor combining the 166 binary keys
of the MACCS fingerprint with motifs inspired by the SIMPOL method for
estimating saturation vapor pressures. We show that ATMOMACCS based models
improve predictions of saturation vapor pressures (7-8 % error reduction),
equilibrium partition coefficients (5 % and 9 % error reduction), glass
transition temperatures (22 % error reduction), and enthalpy of vaporization
(61 % error reduction) on four datasets with atmospheric compounds. Feature
analysis shows that saturation vapor pressure and partition coefficients are
governed by carbon number and oxygen-related features, whereas other
phase-transition properties (e.g., enthalpy of vaporization, glass transition
temperature) depend on carbon-hydrogen bond types and the presence of
heteroatoms other than oxygen. This highlights the generalizability of
ATMOMACCS across different datasets and properties as an interpretable
molecular descriptor.

Abstract: A data-driven computational method is introduced to extract chemical reaction
mechanisms from time series chemical concentration data. It is realized through
the use of dynamic symbolic regression in which a sparse analytical form for a
dynamical system is discoverable from the underlying data. We specifically
develop the stoichiometrically-informed symbolic regression (SISR) method to
address a standing challenge in complex chemical reaction networks: Given a
time-series dataset of concentrations of several components, what is the
mechanism and the associated rate constants? SISR finds the optimal mechanism,
kinetic equations and rate constants by combining differential optimization
with a genetic optimization approach that searches a symbolic space of possible
reaction mechanisms. Use of SISR in several paradigmatic examples spanning
linear and nonlinear reaction schemes results in excellent agreement between
true and predicted mechanisms, including when the method is applied to noisy
data. The advantages of a stoichiometrically-informed approach such as SISR to
address reaction discovery is illustrated through comparison with the use of
generic state-of-the-art data-driven approaches.

Abstract: We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity
magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a
ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC
resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the
magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we
show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and
deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a
purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a
minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which
corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the
mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model.
We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum
quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations
associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy,
providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum
resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further
demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon
band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the
way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.

TL;DR: The first Shapiro step in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions was shown to be suppressed under intrinsic nonlinearities, providing a diagnostic tool for Majorana physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the suppression mechanisms of Shapiro steps in Josephson junctions under different conditions, especially in the context of Majorana bound states, is crucial for advancing topological superconductivity research.

Method: The research involved microwave measurements on Al/WTe2 junctions and numerical simulations of a non-linear resistively and capacitively shunted junction model.

Result: Microwave measurements and simulations revealed that the intrinsic non-linear current-voltage characteristic of low-to-moderate transparency junctions can suppress the first Shapiro step, accompanied by distinctive zigzag boundaries between the zeroth and first step at intermediate driving frequencies.

Conclusion: The zigzag signature provides a crucial diagnostic tool for identifying the suppression of the first Shapiro step due to intrinsic nonlinearities, emphasizing the necessity of comprehensive analysis of microwave spectra before attributing the absence of the first Shapiro step to Majorana physics.

Abstract: The missing first Shapiro step in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions
has been widely interpreted as a hallmark of Majorana bound states. However,
conventional mechanisms like junction underdamping or Joule heating can produce
similar signatures. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsic non-linear
current-voltage characteristic of low-to-moderate transparency junctions can
also suppress the first step, accompanied by distinctive zigzag boundaries
between the zeroth and first step at intermediate driving frequencies.
Microwave measurements on Al/WTe2 junctions and numerical simulations of a
non-linear resistively and capacitively shunted junction model reveal the first
step collapse induced by switching jumps of current, together with zigzag
features absent in scenarios solely driven by finite \b{eta} or Joule heating.
This zigzag signature therefore provides a crucial diagnostic tool, emphasizing
the necessity of comprehensive analysis of microwave spectra before attributing
the absence of the first Shapiro step to Majorana physics.

### [94] [Electric field induced Berry curvature dipole and non-linear anomalous Hall effect in higher wave symmetric unconventional magnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20237)
*Srimayi Korrapati,Snehasish Nandy,Sumanta Tewari*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper discusses the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional magnets, particularly those with collinear spin textures like altermagnets. When subjected to symmetry-breaking electric fields, a second-order nonlinear Hall effect is observed, which could help distinguish different symmetry classes of the magnets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding magnetoresistance phenomena, especially in systems with symmetry-breaking electric fields, is important for both fundamental physics and potential applications in spintronic devices. This work focuses on a lesser-studied class of magnets, seeking to uncover new physical phenomena and their implications.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis, applying concepts of Berry curvature and quantum metrics in the context of higher-order symmetric magnetic systems. They model the effect of both AC and DC electric fields and predict the resulting Hall responses based on symmetry considerations.

Result: The application of symmetry-breaking electric fields induces a finite nonlinear Hall effect. Specifically, an AC electric field leads to a second harmonic response, while a DC field can generate a finite transverse Hall response. The presence of these effects is linked to the symmetry of the magnetic order parameters, allowing for the distinction between even and odd order symmetries in square-lattice magnets.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for probing the symmetry of unconventional magnets through their response to electric fields, potentially offering a new diagnostic tool for materials science and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: We investigate the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional
higher-wave-symmetric magnets, including the recently discovered class of
collinear magnets known as altermagnets, when subjected to a symmetry-breaking
external electric field. In these systems, the first- and second-order
anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of
the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a
symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole
by coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry
connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a
finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic
response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of
higher-order-symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$
symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the
electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric
magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the
occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and
odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice.

Abstract: A superlattice of multilayer graphene and hBN has proven to be a promising
pathway for engineering electronic band structures and topologies. In this
work, we experimentally demonstrate the role of hBN alignment in inducing
topological band reconstruction in bilayer graphene (BLG) superlattices. Our
study establishes that while the primary band retains its massive chiral naure,
the secondary bands host massless, chiral fermions. Magnetotransport
measurements, including Quantum Hall, temperature-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations, and Berry phase analysis, confirm the distinct topological nature
of these bands. A significantly reduced Fermi velocity in the moir\'{e}
secondary band indicates band flattening induced by the moir\'{e} potential.
Our study provides a pathway for controlling topological quantum transport in
BLG/hBN superlattices.

Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of an interacting
parallel double quantum dot in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Building on an
analytical solution based on an equation-of-motion technique, we extend the
formalism for the asymmetrically coupled situation and provide compact
closed-form expressions for steady-state currents together with the
differential conductance, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductance. We
determine the operating points that maximize efficiency and output power of the
system, clarifying their relation to standard near-equilibrium ZT expressions.
We further study the thermal rectification in both the open- and closed-circuit
configurations and derive an expression for the open-circuit case.
Interaction-induced resonances are understood in terms of the poles of the
resulting Green's function, generating gate and bias dependent regions of
enhanced efficiency at finite power, negative differential thermal conductance,
and finite thermal rectification.

TL;DR: EMCD offers better spatial resolution than XMCD but requires careful analysis to achieve accurate results, especially with convergent probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether EMCD can quantitatively match XMCD results for small samples.

Method: Using EMCD measurements on a specially designed FeRh material to compare with XMCD.

Result: EMCD shows good agreement with XMCD for TEM probes under ~6 nm, but not as accurate for smaller or highly convergent probes.

Conclusion: EMCD is a valuable tool for studying local magnetic moments in materials but requires precise sample preparation and analysis.

Abstract: Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) enables element-specific measurement of spin and orbital
magnetic moments, analogous to X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). While
the EMCD technique offers unmatched spatial resolution, its quantitative
accuracy remains under scrutiny, particularly in beam-splitter geometries with
convergent probes. Here, we systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative
EMCD analysis using the first-order magnetostructural transition in the
functional phase-change material FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference. Unlike
previous EMCD studies primarily focused on elemental ferromagnets such as Fe,
we demonstrate its applicability to a correlated material exhibiting coupled
structural and magnetic order. We demonstrate that the extracted
orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) remains consistent with
XMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, thereby establishing
the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher
convergence angles, we observe an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$, which we
attribute to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale
heterogeneity within the probed volume. Our results confirm that EMCD provides
quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions,
while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic
moments in functional magnetic materials, and allowing the study of
interfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism that is inaccessible
to photon-based methods.

TL;DR: 保护量子位免受干扰是量子计算中的核心挑战。半奇整超导体在分离的 Majorana 边界态（MBS）提供了一种强保护机制，其保护性仅取决于干扰的局部性。虽然关于 MBS 分离、稳健退化和保护性互绕的基础关系在非相互作用系统中已知，但对相互作用系统中的 rgba 性质缺乏明确联系。为此，我们从多体基态出发定义 MBS，研究它们如何受环境的量子耦合限制，这量化了能量简并性的保护性及非 Abel 互绕的可实现性。

Motivation: 研究量子计算中 qubit 的保护机制对于提升量子计算的可靠性和扩展实际应用具有重要意义。特别是在半奇整超导体环境下，MBS 提供了一种强保护机制，但对其在相互作用系统中的性质和应用仍需深入研究。

Method: 通过定义基于多体基态的 Majorana 边界态（MBS），研究其与环境的耦合性及其对能简并性以及非 Abel 互绕性的影响。

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解 Majorana 边界态在相互作用系统中的作用和应用提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Protecting qubits from perturbations is a central challenge in quantum
computing. Topological superconductors with separated Majorana bound states
(MBSs) provide a strong form of protection that only depends on the locality of
perturbations. While the link between MBS separation, robust degeneracy, and
protected braiding is well understood in non-interacting systems, recent
experimental progress in short quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains highlights the
need to establish these connections rigorously for interacting systems. We do
this by defining MBSs from many-body ground states and show how their locality
constrains their coupling to an environment. This, in turn, quantifies the
protection of the energy degeneracy and the feasibility of non-abelian
braiding.

Conclusion: 该研究在时域中应用了唯一的非平衡方法，展示了与空间域braiding不同，强调时间维度在量子体系中的独特角色。

Abstract: We use a braiding nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation linking the
DC noise to the response function inferred from the braiding constraint in the
time-domain with a phase $\theta$ within the UNEPT (Unified Non equilibrium
Perturbative Theory). By applying the Kramers-Kr\"onig relations, we obtain an
integral equation connecting DC current and noise that involves $\theta$. By
specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical
solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the
time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This
questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge
dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the
space domain.

Abstract: Molecular-scale materials with bistable behavior and tunable properties are
increasingly relevant for next-generation nanoscale electronic devices. Helical
foldamers are promising candidates, but their structural and mechanical
properties are highly sensitive to conformational stability and environmental
conditions. A systematic methodology based on quantum-chemical calculations is
proposed for assessing solvent-dependent mechanical behavior, combining
analysis of $\pi-\pi$ stacking interactions, conformational energetics, and
environmental effects. Using this methodology we identified simple design
principles for the rapid screening of new compounds, allowing evaluation of
their conformational stability and effective mechanical rigidity. Applying
these principles, we identify a modified helical aromatic foldamer that
exhibits improved mechanical and stability characteristics compared to the
initial reference compound.

Conclusion: 电子相互作用通过 Friedel 振荡直接修改了导电性，适用于解释实验中的异常现象。

Abstract: We demonstrate that conductance anomalies can arise in a clean, adiabatic
quantum point contact when a channel is partially open. Even for a smooth
barrier potential, backscattering induces Friedel oscillations that, via
electron interactions, generate a singular correction to the conductance. This
correction is maximized when the channel is half-open, resulting in a reduction
of conductance. In addition, a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the
spin-orbit axis modifies the single-particle spectrum, resulting in conductance
oscillations via Fabry-P\'erot-type interference, as well as a non-monotonic
field dependence of the anomaly. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by
which interactions modify the conductance of an ideal partially open channel
and offer a possible explanation for the anomalous features observed in
experiments.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene
and the observation of the anomalous Hall effect in a spontaneous spin-valley
polarized quarter metal state, we calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity for
this system in the presence of two types of impurities: weak and dense as well
as sparse and strong. Our calculation of $\sigma_{xy}$ is based on the
Kubo-Streda diagrammatic approach. In a model with Gaussian disorder applicable
to weak dense impurities, this involves all non-crossing diagrams (intrinsic,
side-jump and Gaussian skew-scattering contributions) and additionally diagrams
with two intersecting impurities, X and $\Psi$, representing diffractive
skew-scattering processes. A "Mercedes star" diagram (non-Gaussian skew
scattering) is furthermore included to treat in the case of strong, sparse
impurities. We supplement our asymptotically exact analytical solutions for an
isotropic model without warping effects by semi-numerical calculations
accounting perturbatively for warping, which plays a crucial role in the
low-energy band structure.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, here we identify valley-coherent
charge-density wave (VC-CDW) order in the non-degenerate quarter-metal for the
entire family of chirally-stacked $n$ layer graphene, encompassing rhombohedral
multi-layer, Bernal bilayer, and monolayer cousins. Besides the hallmark broken
translational symmetry, yielding a modulated charge-density over an enlarged
unit-cell with a characteristic $2{\bf K}$ periodicity, where $\pm {\bf K}$ are
the valley momenta, this phase lacks the three-fold ($C_3$) rotational symmetry
but only for even integer $n$. The VC-CDW then represents a stripe order, as
observed in hexalayer graphene [arXiv:2504.05129], but preserves the $C_3$
symmetry for odd $n$ as observed in trilayer graphene [Nat. Phys. 20, 1413
(2024) and arXiv: 2411.11163]. From a universal Clifford algebraic argument, we
establish that the VC-CDW and an anomalous Hall order can lift the residual
valley degeneracy of an antiferromagnetically ordered spin-polarized
half-metal, when these systems are subject to perpendicular displacement
fields, with only the latter one displaying a hysteresis in off-diagonal
resistivity, as observed in all the systems with $2 \leq n \leq 6$. We showcase
a confluence of VC-CDW and anomalous Hall orders within the quarter-metal,
generically displaying a regime of coexistence, separating the pure phases.

Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves and advances in black hole imaging have
opened new opportunities to probe exotic physics in strong-field regimes.
Building upon a recent black hole solution in Einstein gravity coupled with
nonlinear electrodynamics and exotic matter sources-specifically a cloud of
strings and a quintessence field--we study the perturbative dynamics,
thermodynamic behavior, and quantum transmission characteristics in anti-de
Sitter spacetime. The black hole, defined by its mass, nonlinear magnetic
charge, string cloud, and quintessence parameters, exhibits modified spacetime
geometry, horizon structure, Hawking temperature, and effective potentials
governing field propagation. We derive Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations for
massless scalar, electromagnetic, and fermionic perturbations, exploring how
these sources jointly shape the potential barriers. The Hawking temperature
shows strong dependence on the horizon radius and nonlinear charge, differing
markedly from asymptotically flat cases due to the cosmological constant.
Greybody factors, describing Hawking radiation transmission probabilities, are
computed for all field spins via turning point analysis. A notable result
arises in the fermionic sector: positive and negative helicity modes attain
maximal transmission at distinct quintessence normalization values, revealing
helicity-dependent coupling absent in bosonic channels. This asymmetry suggests
a potential observational signature of spin-exotic matter interactions,
offering new insights into detecting quintessence through black hole radiation
spectra. Our results extend previous perturbative analyses by incorporating
nonlinear electrodynamics, cosmic strings, and quintessence effects--linking
quantum radiation studies to gravitational wave astronomy and early-universe
cosmology.

Abstract: The recently-developed "scalar-scaffolding" formulation of gluon amplitudes
casts the Yang-Mills (YM) amplitude as a well-defined Laurent series expansion
in scalar variables, valid for any spacetime dimension and helicity
configuration. In this letter, we exploit this new perspective to develop
conceptually novel methods of computing YM tree amplitudes. First, using
standard gluon factorization to determine all terms with poles, we show how
gauge invariance uniquely fixes the piece with no poles (the "contact term")
from only terms that have a single pole. This allows us to write a YM recursion
not only for the full amplitude but also for the amplitude up to any order in
the Laurent series. Next, by imposing gauge invariance for terms with poles, we
write down relations which compute numerators recursively in the amplitude's
Laurent series expansion. Starting from an initial set of cuts depending only
on the $(n-1)$-point amplitude, these formulae allow us to determine the
remaining terms in the $n$-point amplitude. Finally, we use this "Laurent
series recursion" to derive a recursion solely for the contact term. We
speculate on the possibility that this and analogous recursions for any term in
the amplitude may be solved. In attached Mathematica notebooks, we give
implementations of these three recursions.

*Luis F. Alday,Elisabetta Armanini,Kelian Häring,Alexander Zhiboedov*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the scattering amplitude on the Coulomb branch of planar ℕ=4 SYM at finite 't Hooft coupling, studying its behavior from weak to strong coupling. Key findings include the presence of nonlinear Regge trajectories, dual conformal invariance, bound states, and a two-particle cut. The study connects the Regge trajectories to the Maldacena-Wilson cusp Hamiltonian using integrability and computes leading and subleading Regge trajectories at finite coupling. At strong coupling, the worldsheet bootstrap is used for the first AdS-curve amendment to the Veneziano amplitude. Dispersion relations and bootstrap techniques yield bounds on Wilson coefficients and couplings, suggesting the ℕ=4 amplitude saturates these bounds at weak and strong couplings, with a smooth interpolation in between. A Padé approximation is proposed for finite-coupling behavior, and the complete monotonicity of the scattering amplitude is confirmed beyond perturbation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of scattering amplitudes in gauge theories, particularly in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence, provides deep insights into the dynamics of strongly coupled systems. Understanding the behavior of these amplitudes at different coupling regimes is crucial for testing and refining the correspondence itself, as well as for advancing our knowledge of quantum field theories and string theory.

Method: The authors employ a multi-faceted approach combining perturbative and non-perturbative methods. At weak coupling, they utilize standard scattering amplitude techniques, while at strong coupling, they apply the AdS/CFT correspondence and integrability. They also use bootstrap techniques to constrain the possible form of the amplitude and construct models for its behavior across different couplings. The dual conformal invariance relates properties of the scattering amplitude to those of the cusp Hamiltonian, allowing the use of integrability to compute Regge trajectories.

Result: The finite-coupling amplitude shows a rich structure, including dual conformal invariance, Regge trajectories with nonlinear behavior, bound states, and a two-particle cut. The study successfully constrains Wilson coefficients and couplings using bootstrap methods. The ℕ=4 amplitude is shown to satisfy bootstrap bounds at both weak and strong coupling, with a smooth interpolation in between. A Padé approximation is proposed that accurately describes the finite-coupling behavior of the amplitude, and the complete monotonicity of the scattering amplitude is confirmed beyond perturbation theory.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of scattering amplitudes in planar ℕ=4 SYM across different coupling regimes. By combining weak and strong coupling techniques and integrability, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the scattering amplitude's behavior. The results suggest that the ℕ=4 amplitude saturates bootstrap bounds and offers a robust framework for future studies of scattering amplitudes in gauge and string theories.

Abstract: We study scattering on the Coulomb branch of planar ${\mathcal{N}}=4$ SYM at
finite 't Hooft coupling. This setup defines a family of classical open-string
S-matrices that smoothly interpolates between perturbative parton scattering at
weak coupling and flat-space string scattering at strong coupling. We focus on
the four-point amplitude, which exhibits a remarkably rich structure: nonlinear
Regge trajectories, dual conformal invariance, an intricate spectrum of bound
states with an accumulation point, and a two-particle cut. Dual conformal
invariance relates the spectrum of Regge trajectories to the energy spectrum of
the Maldacena-Wilson cusp Hamiltonian. This connection allows us to use
integrability to compute the leading and subleading Regge trajectories at
finite coupling, which we then input in the bootstrap analysis. At strong
coupling, we use the worldsheet bootstrap to construct the first
$AdS$-curvature correction to the Veneziano amplitude. We apply dispersion
relations and S-matrix bootstrap techniques to derive bounds on Wilson
coefficients, couplings to bound states, and the overall shape of the
amplitude. We find that the $\mathcal{N}=4$ amplitude saturates the bootstrap
bounds at weak coupling and nearly saturates them at strong coupling. At
intermediate coupling, the amplitude traces a nontrivial path through the
allowed space of observables. To characterize this path, we combine the weak-
and strong-coupling information about the amplitude to construct a
finite-coupling model for Wilson coefficients using a Pad\'{e} approximation.
The resulting model satisfies bootstrap constraints and yields sharp
predictions for the finite-coupling behavior of the amplitude. We provide
evidence that complete monotonicity of the scattering amplitude, previously
observed perturbatively, persists at finite coupling.

Abstract: Three dimensional hyperbolic manifolds have accumulation points in the

The limit points are cusped hyperbolic manifolds, and we propose to renormalize
the sum by including the cusped manifold as a counterterm. This gives a
reinterpretation of the zeta-function regularization procedure used by Maloney
and Witten in the sum over SL(2,Z) black holes. For pure N = 1 supergravity,
cusps with even spin structure can be used in a similar way. Cusps with odd
spin structure are not needed to cancel any divergence, but they find an
application by making the index nonzero.

Abstract: We introduce generalization of the recently proposed Latent Entropy
(L-entropy) [1] as a refined measure of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME)
in pure states of $n$-party quantum systems. Generalized L-entropy satisfies
the axioms required for a valid GME measure and provides a natural ordering
among $k$-uniform states maximizing for absolutely maximally entangled states
(AME), effectively capturing the hierarchical structure of multipartite
entanglement. We analyze the behavior of this measure for $n$-party Haar-random
states and demonstrate that, in the large local-dimension limit, the maximal
L-entropy saturates its upper bound for odd $n$, while for even $n$ it
approaches the bound asymptotically. Furthermore, we apply this framework to
examine multipartite entanglement properties of quantum states in several
variants of the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model, including SYK$_4$, SYK$_2$,
mass-deformed SYK, sparse SYK, and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric SYK. The
results demonstrate that the generalized L-entropy serves as a sensitive probe
of multipartite entanglement, revealing how deformations influence quantum
entanglement structure in such strongly interacting systems.

Motivation: 探索通过RG界面分离不同相互作用的多标量CFT来寻找新的缺陷普遍性类别的可能性。

Method: 研究RG界面两侧的局部化相互作用，分别研究缺陷分布在界面内部、线和面内的情况，利用一个例子在单 bulk中的平均相互作用来计算固定点，得到新的缺陷普遍性类别。

Result: 在1-loop近似下，固定点的出现可以解释为单 bulk中缺陷所在的平均相互作用；通过这种平均作用，可以识别具有较少全局对称性的缺陷；计算了与这种RG界面相关的自由能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的方法，通过RG界面的局部化相互作用来寻找到新的缺陷普遍性类别；结果表明， defect可以具有较低的全局对称性，并且计算了相关RG界面的自由能；该方法可以推广到其他维度和不同类型的CFT的组合。

Abstract: We search for new defect universality classes by considering localised
interactions placed on an RG interface separating two interacting multiscalar
CFTs in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Studying interactions spread throughout the
entire interface as well as defects restricted to lines and surfaces within the
interface, we find that this setup leads to a great number of additional
physical fixed points in the space of conformal defects. At one loop it is
possible to interpret these fixed points as coming from defects placed within a
single bulk whose interaction is an average of the two sides. This averaging
means that it is possible to identify conformal defects with considerably less
global symmetry than was possible beforehand. We finally compute conformal data
for this setup, and find the free energy associated with these RG interfaces.

### [110] [Symmetry Points of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Modular Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19927)
*Amineh Mohseni,Cumrun Vafa*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses 4d $oldsymbol{cal{N}}=1$ supergravity theories with modular symmetry, focusing on critical points of the scalar potential at specific values of the modulus $	au$. It shows that these points are critical if there are no additional massless fields and that the nature of the vacuum (dS, AdS, or Minkowski) can be determined by the weight of the superpotential under modular transformations. The scalar potential's asymptotics are analyzed under the Swampland principles, showing that it decays either exponentially or double-exponentially, with the asymptotic slope bounded by the superpotential weight and modular contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of scalar potentials in supergravity theories, especially near special points in the moduli space, is crucial for exploring vacuum stability and the structure of the theory. This paper contributes to this understanding by analyzing critical points and the nature of vacua in the presence of modular symmetry.

Method: The authors use techniques from algebraic geometry and modular forms to analyze the scalar potential's structure. They consider specific points in the moduli space where gauge symmetries enhance and derive conditions for these points to be critical. The analysis involves studying the behavior of the superpotential and the K"ahler potential under modular transformations.

Result: The key results are: (1) critical points of the scalar potential exist at specific $	au$ values if no additional massless fields are present; (2) the vacuum type is determined by the superpotential's modular weight; (3) the scalar potential decays either exponentially or double-exponentially at asymptotic values, with a bounded slope governed by the modular weight and modular contributions to the K"ahler potential.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive analysis of critical points and vacuum stability in 4d $oldsymbol{cal{N}}=1$ supergravity theories with modular symmetry, offering new insights into the interplay between modular forms, scalar potentials, and Swampland principles.

Abstract: We consider 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity theories with modular symmetry,
where the modulus $\tau$ is the upper half-plane modulo $SL(2,\mathbf{Z})$
action. We focus on enhanced discrete gauge symmetry points $\tau=i, \exp(2\pi
i/3)$, and argue that, if there are no new additional massless fields at these
points, they will always be critical points of the scalar potential. Moreover,
we show that whether these correspond to dS, AdS, or Minkowski vacua can be
generically determined simply by the weight of the superpotential under modular
transformations. We also analyze the asymptotics of the scalar potential and
find that compatibility with the Swampland principles implies that, if
nonvanishing, the scalar potential decays either exponentially or
double-exponentially, and that the asymptotic slope is bounded. The slope is
governed by the superpotential weight as well as by real-analytic modular
contributions to the K\"ahler potential.

Conclusion: 论文通过研究’tHooft异常的背景对称性，展示了在多个情况下配分函数会发生消失，并推广了Freed-Witten异常抵消条件。

Abstract: In the presence of 't Hooft anomalies, backgrounds for the symmetries of a
quantum field theory can lead to non-conservation of Noether currents, or more
generally, to the presence of charged insertions in the path integral. When
there is a net background charge, the partition function evaluated on closed
manifolds will vanish. For anomalous symmetries, this statement can also be
understood as the anomaly theory giving rise to a non-trivial anomalous phase
for the partition function even for "rigid" transformations which leave all
background fields unchanged. We use the generalisation of this second viewpoint
to the setting of anomalous higher-form symmetries in order to show vanishing
of the partition function for a number of examples, both with and without a
Lagrangian description. In particular, we show how to derive from these
considerations the analogue of the Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation condition
for the M5-brane, and also that for the D3-brane in S-fold backgrounds.

Abstract: The covariant phase space formalism in general relativity is a covariant
method for constructing the symplectic two-form, Hamiltonian and other
conserved charges on the phase space of solutions to the Einstein equation with
classical matter. In this note, we consider a generalization of this formalism
to the semi-classical Einstein equation coupled to quantum matter. Given a
family of solutions in semi-classical gravity, we define the semi-classical
symplectic two-form -- a natural generalization of the classical sympelctic
two-form -- as the sum of the gravitational symplectic form and the Berry
curvature associated to the quantum state of matter. We show that the
semi-classical symplectic two-form is independent of the Cauchy slice, and
satisfies the quantum generalization of the classical Hollands-Iyer-Wald
identity. For small perturbations, we also extend our discussion to
gauge-invariantly defined subregions of spacetime, where the quantum
contribution is replaced by the Berry curvature of certain special
purifications involving the Connes cocycle. In the AdS/CFT context, the
semi-classical symplectic form defined here is naturally dual to the Berry
curvature in the boundary CFT.

Abstract: In this paper we propose 4d and 3d dualities among special unitary gauge
theories with fundamentals and antisymmetric flavors and symplectic or
orthogonal gauge theories with fundamentals and two index tensor matter. The
various dualities originate from a conjectured 4d self-duality for $SU(N)$ with
an antisymmetric and four fundamental flavors. While we provide a proof of such
self duality for $SU(4)$, we focus on baryonic deformations for the cases at
higher ranks. The deformations give rise to RG flows, deforming the self
duality into new types of dualities, involving $SU(N)$ and $USp(2M)$ gauge
theories, where the precise value of $M$ depends on the baryonic deformation.
We provide strong checks on the validity of these dualities, by proving the
integral identities among their superconformal index. By dimensional reduction
on a circle, real mass flows and other deformations we then find a rich set of
new dualities in 3d. These dualities are first conjectured from localization,
by the application of the duplication formula for the one loop determinants of
the matter fields, and then they are proved by using the tensor deconfinement
technique.

Conclusion: 本文展示了在满足 FLRW 条件的同时，可以引入超对称 partner 并保持超引力的重新参数化不变性。

Abstract: An FLRW reduction of N=1 supergravity is troublesome since spatial isotropy
prohibits a non-vanishing Rarita-Schwinger field. In view of this, we consider
the quadratic form $\psi_m^{\ \alpha} \psi_{n \alpha}$ arising from a
particular superspace generalization of the metric tensor. Imposing the FLRW
form on this object reduces $\psi_m^{\ \alpha}$ to a single 2-component spinor
$\phi^\alpha$, which becomes the superpartner of both the scale factor $a$ and
lapse $N$, thus inducing the conformal time gauge, $N=a$.
Time-reparametrization invariance is restored if we allow for deviations of
FLRW form that are proportional to the gauge fields $N, \psi_0^{\ \alpha}$. We
determine the allowed supergravity transformations that preserve the resulting
FLRW supermultiplets.

Conclusion: 切iral代数 bootstrap 简化了两环 QCD 幅值的计算，提供了两环形式因数的已知结果来计算完整的颜色两环 QCD 幅值。

Abstract: We show that the chiral algebra bootstrap, which computes form factors of
twistorial theories, can help determine two-loop amplitudes in massless QCD. We
give an $n$-gluon result for a previously unknown partial amplitude of the
two-loop all-plus-helicity QCD amplitude by utilizing supersymmetry Ward
identities and known chiral algebra bootstrap results. We then show that the
full-color two-loop $n$-gluon amplitude of QCD with $n_f$ quark flavors can be
obtained from certain two-loop form factors of twistorial theories and one-loop
and tree-level amplitudes. Chiral algebra bootstrap results exist for these
form factors when all gluons have positive helicities. Hence, the bootstrap
simplifies the computation of these two-loop amplitudes by one loop level.

Motivation: Understanding black hole thermodynamics in different dimensions and charge configurations is important for theoretical physics and may shed light on quantum gravity.

Method: Mathematical analysis of the black hole solution within gauged supergravity, evaluation of thermodynamic quantities, and comparison with known solutions.

Result: The thermodynamic formalism holds for the new solution, with smooth transitions to known three-charge cases. Topological classification of the thermodynamics is performed.

Conclusion: This work extends the understanding of thermodynamic properties of AdS black holes in higher dimensions with multiple charges and provides new insights into their classification.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate thermodynamical aspects of a novel static
non-extremal black hole solution in the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS)
space carrying four independent electric charge parameters and with a negative
cosmological constant, within the framework of $D=5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauged
supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets specified by the pre-potential
$\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. A central outcome of our work is the
demonstration that the thermodynamics of this solution consistently satisfies
both the differential and integral forms of the first law of black hole
thermodynamics. When the fourth charge is set to zero, our configuration
reduces to the known three-charge static non-extremal AdS$_5$ black hole within
the gauged $STU$ model, and its thermodynamic behavior connects smoothly to
that limit. Finally, we also provide a brief discussion about topological
classifications of its thermodynamics.

Abstract: Real eigenpairs of a real antisymmetric tensor of order $p$ and dimension $N$
can be defined as pairs of a real eigenvalue and $p$ orthonormal
$N$-dimensional real eigenvectors. We compute the signed and the genuine
distributions of such eigenvalues of Gaussian random real antisymmetric tensors
by using a quantum field theoretical method. An analytic expression for finite
$N$ is obtained for the signed distribution and the analytic large-$N$
asymptotic forms for both. We compute the edge of the distribution for
large-$N$, one application of which is to give an upper bound (believed tight)
of the injective norm of the random real antisymmetric tensor. We find a
large-$N$ universality across various tensor eigenvalue distributions: the
large-$N$ asymptotic forms of the distributions of the eigenvalues $z$ of the
complex, complex symmetric, real symmetric, and real antisymmetric random
tensors are all expressed by $e^{N\,B\, h_p(z_c^2/z^2)+o(N)}$, where the
function $h_p(\cdot)$ depends only on the order $p$, while $B$ and $z_c$ differ
for each case, $NB$ being the total dimension of the eigenvectors and $z_c$
being determined by the phase transition point of the quantum field theory.

Abstract: Black holes exist all over our Universe, possessing a very wide range of
masses. At the moment, they serve as a probe to test general relativity at
astrophysical scales, but in the future they may also give us information about
gravity at the microscale. Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties,
such as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering
black holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in
statistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system,
several questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be
explained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these
questions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored
at the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this
connection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved
spacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged
self-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of
state which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black
hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach
to quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes
and self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase
transitions between hot matter and black holes. We show the power of the
formalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes.
Namely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black
holes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius. We construct
ensembles of a self-gravitating matter thin shell, both in anti-de Sitter and
in asymptotically flat spaces, in order to understand the thermodynamic
features of the shell and the possible phase transitions to black hole
configurations.

Abstract: We present a symbol-level bootstrap construction of the planar, two-loop
six-gluon scattering amplitude for the --++++ helicity configuration in QCD,
focusing on the maximal weight pieces-the "most complicated terms" in the sense
of Lipatov et al. Building on recent advances in the understanding of the
relevant function space, we incorporate as a crucial new ingredient the
complete set of leading singularities, obtained from an explicit analysis of
on-shell diagrams. The resulting expressions are manifestly conformally
invariant and clarify the structure of previous five-particle results.
Combining this with the symbol bootstrap, we show that constraints from
physical limits are sufficient to uniquely determine the answer. We thus obtain
the first concrete characterization of two-loop six-gluon amplitudes at the
symbol level and at highest weight. Remarkably, we find that the effective
function space involves only 137 symbol letters, significantly fewer than the
full set of 167 possible letters, suggesting a yet-unexplained underlying
structure akin to that seen in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. From
the novel amplitude results we extract previously unknown symbol-level results
describing two-loop triple collinear and double soft limits.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the infrared divergence of two-loop amplitudes at
arbitrary multiplicity in three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=6$ Chern-Simons matter
theory. We introduce the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov (BDS) integrand, which captures the
full infrared structure while remaining free of unphysical cuts. We show that
these local integrands, together with their kinematic prefactors, are naturally
organized by the scaffolding triangulations of $n=2k$-gon, with distinct
triangulations yielding different local representations. Remarkably, this
triangulation structure also persists at the level of the integrated functions.
This observation provides a graphical proof of both the cancellation of
elliptic cuts and the triangulation independence of the integrated result. As a
direct consequence, we obtain a simple proof that the integrated BDS integrand
coincides with the one-loop maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitude (the
BDS ansatz) of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory for all $n=2k$.

Motivation:  motivating for symmetry-based approaches in GR and gravitational theories, emphasizing the importance of static Love numbers and their vanishing properties in black hole physics.

Method:  the paper employs symmetry arguments and applies them to both full GR and worldline EFT, establishing a unified methodology that captures both vanishing and non-renormalization phenomena.

Result:  key findings include the vanishing and non-renormalization of static Love numbers to full nonlinear order in four-dimensional GR, closing gaps in prior analyses that excluded nonlinear effects, and extending results to higher-dimensional gravitational theories, predicting additional insights like Love number behavior for electric and tensor types.

Conclusion:  conclusion emphasizes the significance of symmetry in determining the behavior of black hole tidal responses, offering a comprehensive framework that unifies previous findings across GR and EFT, while opening new avenues for exploring gravitational physics through nonlinear effects.

Abstract: We provide a symmetry argument for the vanishing and non-renormalization of
static Love numbers for spherically symmetric black holes at full nonlinear
order in four-dimensional General Relativity. The symmetry is realized both in
full GR and in the worldline EFT, allowing for a unified treatment and proving
both vanishing and non-renormalization to all orders. This closes some
loop-holes in previous arguments that neglected nonlinearities in the worldline
EFT, and extends previous vanishing results to all nonlinear static tides. When
extended to higher-dimensional gravity, these arguments also explain the
pattern of vanishing and running static Love numbers of electric and tensor
type, and predict new results at the nonlinear order. We also apply our
findings to the tidal response of shift-symmetric scalar fields, predicting the
vanishing of even order nonlinear static Love numbers and unifying these
statements with the no-hair theorem (and its violations).

Abstract: We develop a general framework for electromagnetic potential-charge
contributions to the first law of black hole mechanics, applicable to dynamical
first-order perturbations of stationary black objects with possibly non-compact
bifurcate Killing horizons. Working in the covariant phase space formalism, we
derive both comparison and physical process versions of the first law. We
consider generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity in $D$ spacetime
dimensions, containing non-minimally coupled abelian $p$-form gauge fields. The
pullback of the gauge field to the horizon is allowed to diverge while its
field strength remains smooth, yielding gauge-invariant electric
potential-charge pairs in the first law. We further extend the construction to
include magnetic charges by developing a bundle-covariant, gauge-invariant
prescription that fixes the Jacobson-Kang-Myers ambiguity in the improved
Noether charge. Electric and magnetic charges are, respectively, associated
with non-trivial $(D - p - 1)$- and $(p + 1)$-cycles of the horizon
cross-section, whose homology classes determine the number of independent
potential-charge pairs through the Betti numbers $b_{D - p - 1}$ and $b_{p +
1}$. Further, the dynamical gravitational entropy entering the first law is
identified with the gauge-invariant part of the improved Noether charge, giving
a gauge-invariant extension of the recent proposal by Hollands, Wald and Zhang.
We illustrate our framework with dyonic AdS black holes, dipole black rings,
and charged black branes.

Abstract: We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic
effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical
superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an
additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of
Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of
the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for
non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results
of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This
provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the
existence of the extra coefficient we identified.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the deterministic and disordered
versions of the Russian Doll Model (RDM), which is a generalization of
Richardson model of superconductivity in a finite system with time-reversal
symmetry breaking parameter $\theta$. It is one of the simplest examples of the
cyclic RG where $\log N$ plays the role of the RG time. The deterministic model
is integrable and shares the same Bethe Ansatz (BA) equations with the
inhomogeneous twisted XXX spin chain. We analyze the quantum metric, the Berry
curvature, and the fractal dimension in the sector with a single Cooper pair. A
rich phase structure in the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane is found, where
$\gamma \log N$ quantifies the hopping term.
  For the deterministic RDM we clearly identify the extended domain of
non-ergodic multifractal phase on the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane
supporting the reentrance transitions between the localized, ergodic, and
multifractal phases. We find the pattern of phase transitions in the global
charge $Q(\theta,\gamma)$, which arises from the BA equation. In particular, in
the multifractal phase in the deterministic model $Q(\gamma)$ exhibits the
analogue of "charge concentration" and fortuity phenomena discussed in the
context of black hole microstates at finite $N$. The BA equations in RDM
exactly coincide with the equations defining the ground states in the theory on
the worldvolume of the vortex strings in $N_F=2N_C$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD at a
strong coupling point $\frac{1}{g_{YM}^2}=0$ with identification $\theta_{RDM}=
\theta_{4D}-\pi$. We conjecture that the Hamiltonian of the RDM model describes
the mixing in particular 2d-4d BPS sector of the Hilbert space. Our findings
provide an example of the BPS multifractality regime for the probe operator in
the sector of Hilbert space, and we comment on the possible application to
dense QCD with $\theta$ term.

### [126] [Time-Dependent Black Hole Lensing and the Unified Weak-to-Strong Deflection Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19849)
*Ali Övgün,Reggie C. Pantig*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A unified analytical framework for weak-field and strong-deflection lensing in a perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime is developed, incorporating time-dependence through a single, axisymmetric quasinormal mode. The framework predicts corrections to the weak-field $1/b$ law, including harmonic centroid wobble driven by ringdown frequency, and a time-dependent generalization of the strong-deflection limit featuring modulated coefficients, including small oscillations in the critical impact parameter. Gauge-safe observer quantities are derived, allowing for a coherent theoretical understanding of ringdown physics in imaging observables without numerical ray tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational lensing is a fundamental phenomenon in general relativity with important applications in astrophysics and cosmology. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding lensing effects in perturbed Schwarzschild spacetimes, particularly focusing on the interplay between weak-field and strong-deflection regimes.

Method: The authors develop a time-dependent perturbative approach within the Schwarzschild metric framework. They employ analytic techniques to derive line-of-sight deflection, weak-field asymptotic expansions, and near-photon-sphere expansions. Observer tetrad constructions ensure gauge safety at first order.

Result: The framework establishes that ringdown physics leaves distinct imprints on imaging observables such as centroid motion, multi-image hierarchies, and time delays, as well as photon-ring morphology. These findings enhance our understanding of lensing phenomena in perturbed spacetimes without requiring numerical ray tracing.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational theoretical framework for analyzing lensing in perturbed Schwarzschild spacetimes, with implications for interpreting gravitational lensing effects in realistic astrophysical scenarios involving black holes and their perturbations.

Abstract: We present a fully analytical framework that unifies weak-field and
strong-deflection lensing of light in a time-dependent, perturbed Schwarzschild
spacetime. The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric,
even-parity quasinormal mode with $\ell=2$, $m=0$ and complex frequency
$\omega$. Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while
keeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent
line-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a
static observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic
expansion yields the familiar weak-field $1/b$ law with a ringdown-frequency
correction that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere
expansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic
strong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small
oscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the
background static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities like centroid
motion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, and photon-ring morphology are
gauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing
that the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius
modulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field
correction. The result is a coherent, purely theoretical account of how
ringdown physics imprints on imaging observables without numerical ray tracing.

Abstract: Anisotropic Bianchi type-III cosmology is examined within the framework of
f(R,T) gravity, where R denotes the Ricci scalar and T the trace of the
energy-momentum tensor. In this work, we investigate the statistical
constraints on anisotropic Bianchi type-III cosmology within the framework of
f(R,T) gravity. The specific choice $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ is considered and exact
solutions are derived for the background dynamics of the model. The physical
parameters, such as the Hubble parameter H(z), spatial volume V(z), energy
density $\rho(z)$, and pressure p(z), are derived and their evolutionary
behaviors are analyzed. To examine the observational viability of the model, we
employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and perform a comprehensive
statistical analysis using the latest observational datasets, including the
Hubble parameter measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the
Pantheon compilation of type Ia supernovae. The combined data analysis provides
constraints on the free parameters of the model and allows a comparison with
the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results show that the anisotropic
Bianchi-III universe in f(R,T) gravity can successfully accommodate current
observational data, offering new insights into the role of matter-geometry
coupling in the late-time cosmic acceleration.

Abstract: The apparent shadow of a black hole provides one of the most direct probes of
strong-field general relativity. While the shadow size in asymptotically flat
spacetimes is well understood, the influence of cosmic expansion on its
apparent angular diameter remains less explored. In this work, we present a
simple analytic framework to estimate the shadow size of a non-rotating black
hole embedded in an expanding universe. By combining the local Schwarzschild
geometry with large-scale cosmological dynamics through the McVittie and
Kottler metrics, we derive a compact relation between the shadow angular size
and the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. This approach captures the
essential dependence on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant
$H_0$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, while remaining analytically
tractable. We further perform numerical estimates to quantify the redshift
dependence of the apparent shadow size, showing that the effect of cosmic
expansion is negligible for nearby sources but becomes relevant for
high-redshift black holes. Our results demonstrate a clear conceptual
connection between strong-gravity optics and cosmological expansion, providing
a pedagogically transparent and physically motivated extension of black hole
shadow theory to a cosmological context.

Abstract: We explore how inflationary features shape the early stages of cosmic
structure formation. Using the transfer function formalism, we trace the
evolution of primordial perturbations, showing how causal physics and
oscillatory signatures from inflation influence the matter power spectrum. The
variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of
overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the
Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze
primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling
and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation.
Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early
galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and
disk properties of high-redshift systems. Our results indicate that oscillatory
features from inflation can leave measurable imprints on halo abundances and
early galaxy properties, providing a testable link between high-energy physics
and astrophysical observations with JWST

### [130] [Detecting White Dwarf Binary Mergers with Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19913)
*Giona Sala,Chiara Brandenstein,Sebastian Baum,Peter W. Graham*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: White dwarf (WD) mergers are a leading progenitor channel for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Though WCs are abundant and well-studied, their gravitational wave (GW) signals remain undetected. A space-based detector in the mid-LISA band, such as MAGIS Space or AEDGE, could potentially detect these GWs for mergers involving WDs of around 0.6 Msun after merger. Early GW signals from merging WD binaries can provide early warnings of their final SN explosions. Atom-interferometer technology could offer precise sky localization and enable electromagnetic observation of the SN. Tentatively finalized by 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quest to detect gravitational waves from merging white dwarfs is driven by the potential to gain insights into this significant mechanism driving Type Ia supernovae. Early warning systems for such events could provide valuable clues about the progenitor processes and could complement electromagnetic observations to advance multi-messenger astronomy efforts.

Method: The authors simulate and analyze signals from GW emissions resulting from the inspiral and merger of WD binaries. They employ numerical relativistic simulations, Bayesian parameter estimation, and analysis of detector sensitivity curves.

Result: Simulations predict that current plans for space-based detectors could detect at least one merger per four years, and hundreds of events annually if the gravitational wave strain reaches the required amplitude. Precision sky localization through interferometry could pinpoint events, allowing electromagnetic observation of their supernova explosions.

Conclusion: WD mergers are detectable with future space-based GW detectors within the next decade. Early GW signals could offer unique insights into SN Ia progenitor physics and serve as a valuable multi-messenger astronomy tool, enhancing our comprehension of these bright cosmic events.

Abstract: Mergers of white dwarf binaries are a possible progenitor channel for Type Ia
supernovae. While white dwarfs are abundant in the universe and relatively well
understood, their gravitational wave signals have not yet been directly
observed. In order to detect gravitational waves from merging white dwarf
binaries, a detector in the mid-band between LVK and LISA appears necessary. In
this paper, we compute and discuss the gravitational waves emitted by
inspiraling and merging white dwarf binaries, and assess their detectability
with proposed space-based atom-interferometer detectors such as MAGIS Space and
AEDGE. Gravitational waves from massive white dwarf binaries can be observed
for many years before merger, offering a unique early warning of their final
explosion. Our projections suggest that MAGIS Space could detect signals from
Type Ia supernova progenitors at least once every four years, while AEDGE could
observe at least a few hundred such events annually. The prolonged
gravitational wave emission captured by atom-interferometers provides precise
sky localisation and can allow observation of the final explosion with
electromagnetic telescopes. The combined observation with electromagnetic
radiation from the white dwarf binary coalescence could open a new pathway for
multi-messenger astronomy involving some of the brightest transient events in
the universe.

Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a
binary black hole coalescence. Motivated by the recent proposal that a black
hole's information load can alter its classical response to small
perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal
phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole
merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a
Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal
modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how
the gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the
critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high
signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p
\gtrsim 5$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer. Our results
disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden
effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.

Abstract: Scalar fields of masses between $10^{-21}\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-11}
\rm{eV}/c^2$ can exhibit enhanced gravitational interactions with black holes,
and form scalar clouds around them. Such a cloud modifies the dynamics of a
coalescing black-hole binary, and the resulting gravitational waves may provide
a new channel to detect light scalar fields, such as axion-like particles or
wave-like dark matter candidates. In this work we simulate a series of
black-hole mergers with mass ratios $q=1$ and $q=1/2$, immersed in an scalar
field overdensity with masses in the range $M\mu_{\rm{S}} \in[0,1.0]$. To do
so, we implemented a constraint-satisfying initial data solver based on the
puncture method, we improved the accuracy of our open-source software Canuda to
eighth order finite differences, and we reduced the initial orbital
eccentricity. We investigate the impact of the scalar mass on the gravitational
and scalar radiation. We find that binaries can undergo a delayed or an
accelerated merger with respect to the vacuum. Our study highlights the
challenge and importance of accurately modeling black-hole binaries in dark
matter environments.

standard General Relativity or other modifications, this inclusion allows for a
modified entropy formulation, facilitating the computation of key thermodynamic
quantities such as Gibbs free energy, the first law of thermodynamics, the
equation of state, and Hawking temperature. We identify critical points and
graphically represent the relationship between temperature and Gibbs free
energy as a function of the horizon radius. Ultimately, we assess the thermal
stability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS black hole within the framework of
Gauss-Bonnet gravity, emphasizing the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term unlike
previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other
modifications. As a result, it is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling
significantly alters the thermodynamic behavior and stability structure of the
black hole, revealing richer phase transition phenomena.

### [134] [Emergent time and more from wavefunction collapse in general relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20207)
*Sung-Sik Lee*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores a theory of time linked to quantum gravity, focusing on the role of wavefunction collapse in driving time evolution. The scale factor acts as a clock, with different graviton modes behaving differently—tensor modes exhibit unitary dynamics, while scalar and vector modes decay over time, with scalar decay rates dependent on wavelength. Large-wavelength scalar modes could be dark matter candidates due to long-range interactions while short-wavelength modes decay quickly, making them undetectable without long-term observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of time and its relation to quantum mechanics and general relativity is fundamental to theoretical physics, particularly in cosmology and quantum gravity.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework, analyzing graviton modes in cosmological settings using semi-classical and adiabatic approximations in large-dimensional spaces to derive their decay and interaction properties.

Result: The graviton modes show distinct decay behaviors over time, with implications for dark matter candidates and observable interactions.

Conclusion: This theory provides new insights into time's quantum origin and suggests novel dark matter candidates, while emphasizing the need for long-term observational studies to detect scalar mode interactions.

Abstract: In this paper, we further develop a recently proposed theory of time based on
wavefunction collapse in general relativity. It is based on the postulations
that quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints,
represent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift
generate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses
toward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the
scale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar,
vector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of
time for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit,
the tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra
modes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the
constraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over
all length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave
vector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations
with large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range
interactions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them
undetectable without sufficient temporal resolution. These are demonstrated for
the cosmological constant-dominated universe through semi-classical and
adiabatic approximations, which are controlled in the limit of large space
dimension.

Abstract: We study successive Rindler-like transformations in Minkowski spacetime and
the corresponding sequence of vacuum states perceived by observers restricted
to respective wedges. Extending the standard Rindler construction to an
$n$-fold iteration, we find via Bogoliubov transformations that the vacuum of
the $(n-1)^{th}$ Rindler observer appears thermal to the $n^{th}$ one. The
characteristic trajectories, confined to nested wedges, exhibit characteristic
accelerations and horizon shifts depending on transformation parameters ${g_1,
g_2, \ldots, g_{n}}$. For the second-level transformation (\emph{Rindler
Rindler} case), the late time acceleration asymptotically approaches $2g_2$ for
one branch and diverges for the other. We study Minkowski, Rindler, and Rindler
Rindler vacuum states from the perspective of Unruh DeWitt (UDW) detectors
along inertial, Rindler, and Rindler Rindler trajectories. The response of the
UDW detector coupled to a real massless scalar field confirms the thermality:
the transition rate of Rindler Rindler observer in Minkowski vacuum matches
that of a standard Rindler detector with acceleration $2g_2$, yielding a
Planckian spectrum at late times. The conclusions are discussed.

Abstract: We revisit our earlier work and investigate the bound state perturbations in
the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The bound sates are defined as
the perturbations in the interior of the black hole with an imaginary spectrum
which are regular at the center of black hole while their time-dependent
profile falls off exponentially on the event horizon. Using the scale factor in
the expanding direction in the interior of the black hole as the clock, we
rewrite the corresponding Regge-Wheeler equation and solve it semi-analytically
as well as numerically. We confirm that the bound state solutions exist for
scalar, vector and axial tensor perturbations. It is shown that for a given
value of $\ell >s$, there are total $\ell-s$ such bound states. We obtain the
universal lower bound $2 G M \omega_I >1$ for the spectrum of bound state which
is asymptotically saturated in the large $\ell$ limit. Furthermore, we obtain
an upper bound on the spectrum of axial perturbations which for large $\ell$
scales like $2 G M \omega_I \lesssim 0.04\, \ell^4 $. As observed recently,
these bound states have the curious property that the profile of the total wave
function has a non-zero magnitude near the future event horizon.

dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission
factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the
characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime
around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass
lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing
depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength
$\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical
geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent
ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of
the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers
lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating
pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on
the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS
lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a
wide region of parameter space.

*Simone D'Onofrio,Sergei Odintsov,Tanmoy Paul*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper modifies the usual inflationary scenario to explain the stochastic gravitational wave background observed by PTA, incorporating thermodynamic entropy and using ACT data to validate compatibility with PTA findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining the stochastic gravitational wave background observed through PTA observations requires alternative inflationary models, prompting this theoretical modification of inflationary scenarios.

Method: The paper employs thermodynamic entropy generalized from the apparent horizon, applying numerical analysis to fit the model with ACT data and validate its compatibility with PTA observations in the NANOGrav frequency range.

Result: The modified model successfully integrates the constraints from the ACT data with the NANOGrav 15-year data, demonstrating compatibility with both ACT and PTA datasets.

Conclusion: The thermodynamic approach with generalized entropy provides a viable framework for reconciling inflationary theories with PTA observations, potentially addressing discrepancies in early universe models.

Abstract: Recent evidences of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) through
Pulsar Time Array (PTA) observations hint towards an alternative inflationary
scenario, compared to the usual inflation, for describing the early stage of
the universe in order to be compatible with the PTA data. Moreover, currently
the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO) refines
the constraint on inflationary observables, compared to the only-Planck 2018
measurements. In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues
by incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual
inflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor
perturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency
region. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where
the entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy
that is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for
suitable representations. The constraints on the model parameters coming from
the ACT data also fit the NANOGrav 15-year data (based on numerical analysis),
which reveal the model's compatibility with both the ACT and the PTA data.

Abstract: Recently, some of us have obtained exact charged spherically symmetric black
hole solutions within the framework of bumblebee gravity, where the Lorentz
symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the nonvanishing vacuum expectation
value of the bumblebee field. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal
modes of this black hole. We compute the quasinormal frequencies corresponding
to the scalar perturbation and the gravito-electromagnetic coupled perturbation
using both the continued fraction method and the asymptotic iteration method. A
detailed comparison of the results obtained from the two approaches is
presented to evaluate their accuracy and efficiency in this Lorentz-violating
background.

the weak energy condition, we employ gravitational decoupling method to
construct non-singular hairy black holes: spherically or axially symmetric.
These solutions arise from a deformation of the Minkowski vacuum, where the

Abstract: The gravitational weak lensing of neutrinos in the presence of a
Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter halo is
investigated. The event horizon structure is explored, and the existence of the
BH is studied in two different slices of the parameter space. Additionally, we
derive analytic expressions for the oscillation phase and transition
probabilities for both radial and non-radial neutrino propagation. Finally, we
use a two-flavor toy model, and numerically analyze how the dark matter halo
parameters as density and scale radius, affect oscillation probabilities and
examine the role of decoherence. The results show that the presence of a dark
matter halo modifies the oscillation phase and damping factor, leading to
measurable deviations from the standard Schwarzschild BH case. These findings
suggest that neutrino oscillations could, in principle, serve as a probe for
dark matter distributions around compact astrophysical objects.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study inflation in the framework of extended metric-affine F(R) gravity,
where all even-parity quadratic invariants of torsion and non-metricity are
included in the Lagrangian alongside the F(R) term. The extended theory admits
a scalar-tensor description with a non-canonical kinetic term featuring poles.
As a result, the inflationary dynamics and predictions for observables of this
model are insensitive to the specific form of F(R), since they are dominated by
the structure of the poles (order and residue). We analyze both a simplified
version analytically and the full eleven-parameter theory, and we classify the
models based on whether they feature second-order poles, whether they are free
from ghosts, and whether they predict a sufficiently small tensor-to-scalar
ratio. By relaxing the ghost-free requirement to only exclude ghosts near the
pole (where inflation occurs), we demonstrate that we can significantly enlarge
the set of viable models. We thus show that extended metric-affine F(R) gravity
can act as a robust framework for inflation, reproducing the attractor
predictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the Einstein-Dirac system for a massive field, which describes
the evolution of self-gravitating massive spinor fields, and we investigate the
global evolution problem, when the initial data set is sufficiently close to
data describing a spacelike, asymptotically Euclidean slice of the Minkowski
spacetime. We establish the gauge-invariant nonlinear stability of such fields,
namely the existence of a globally hyperbolic development, which remains
asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime in future timelike, null, and spacelike
directions. Previous results on this problem have been limited to the
Einstein-Dirac system in the massless case. Our analysis follows the
asymptotically hyperboloidal-Euclidean framework introduced by LeFloch and Y.
Ma for the massive Klein-Gordon-Einstein system. The structure specific to
spinor fields and the Dirac equation necessitates significantly new elements in
the proof. In contrast with prior approaches, our treatment of spinor fields
and the Dirac equation is gauge-invariant, relying on the formalism of Lorentz
Clifford algebras, principal fiber bundles, etc. Our analysis is carried out
with the metric expressed in light-bending wave coordinates, as we call them.
This leads us to the study of a global existence problem for a system of wave
equations with constraints and a Klein-Gordon-type equations. We derive L2
estimates for the Dirac equation and its coupling with the Einstein equations,
along with $pointwise estimates. New Sobolev inequalities are proven for spinor
fields in a gauge-invariant manner in the hyperboloidal-Euclidean foliation.
The nonlinear coupling between the massive Dirac equation and the Einstein
equations is investigated, and we establish a hierarchy of estimates, which
distinguish between translations, rotations, and boosts.

Abstract: It is common knowledge that black holes necessarily contain a region where
general relativity breaks down, due to the inevitable formation of either a
curvature singularity or a Cauchy horizon. In this work we challenge this view
by analyzing a charged spherically symmetric black hole formed through
gravitational collapse and evaporating via Hawking radiation. We show that the
electromagnetic repulsion and the violation of energy conditions due to the
presence of Hawking radiation are be sufficient to avoid the formation of both
a singularity and a Cauchy horizon. We argue that a similar mechanism may apply
to astrophysical black holes in which the role of the electric charge is
replaced by the angular momentum.

### [145] [Quantum black holes: inside and outside](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20799)
*Wei-Chen Lin,Dong-han Yeom,Dejan Stojkovic*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper argues that for a unitary description of an evaporating black hole, time slices must always lie outside the event horizon. Inside the horizon, the spacetime breaks down into multiple coherent states, leading to a horizon-scale uncertainty and the impossibility of a single coherent state, thereby viewing the black hole as a highly quantum macroscopic object.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to understand the information loss paradox in black hole evaporation. The authors aim to propose a framework that preserves unitarity by considering the spacetime structure inside and outside the event horizon.

Method: The authors investigate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, which allows time slices to cover both inside and outside the event horizon. By analyzing the properties of wave packets and coherent states, they argue that a single coherent state cannot cover both regions and propose that the interior must be described by a superposition of coherent states.

Result: The study finds that a wave function must be annihilated near the event horizon if it covers outside slices, which implies the impossibility of a coherent state crossing the horizon. This leads to the conclusion that spacelike hypersurfaces crossing the event horizon cannot be described by a single coherent state. Consequently, the interior of a black hole must be described as a quantum superposition, introducing a horizon-scale uncertainty and justifying the black hole as a highly quantum macroscopic object.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the process of black hole evaporation must be understood within a framework that preserves unitarity. It suggests that the black hole horizon cannot be traversed by a single coherent state, forcing the interior to be a superposition of states, thereby providing a new perspective on the information loss paradox and the quantum nature of black holes.

Abstract: For a unitary description of an evaporating black hole, one usually chooses
the time slices that cover only outside of the event horizon, which is mostly
problem-free because the event horizon is not encountered. However, is there
any justification for avoiding time slices that cover inside the event horizon?
To answer the question, we investigate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, where the
time slices can cover both inside and outside the event horizon. We find that
one can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave
function must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly
suggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface
that crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must
keep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the
event horizon. In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single
coherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a
superposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a
horizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum
macroscopic object. We provide a synthetic approach to understanding the
information loss paradox from this perspective.
