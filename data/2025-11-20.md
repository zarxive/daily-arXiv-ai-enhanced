Abstract: When four dimensional spacetime R is considered as locally embedded on a larger manifold M, labelled by higher division algebra coordinates, a natural question to ask is how much of the symmetry properties of the larger space are inherited by R. Here this question is studied when M is a quaternion manifold. Of particular relevance is the absence of spinors in the linear representations of the symmetry group of the larger manifold and the emergence of new quantum numbers when, by Whitney sums, spinors are implemented on the vector bundles associated to the coset manifolds of the symmetry groups of M. A possible relation to the structures of the standard model is briefly discussed.

### [2] [Exploring the Infrared Landscape of the SYK Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14839)

Conclusion: 双 SYK 模型在特定条件下表现出比单一模型更快的增长，扩展了 SYK 模型在不同温度下的适用性。

Abstract: We analyse a class of SYK models whose Hamiltonian is the sum of two SYK Hamiltonians with different numbers of fermions $q, \tilde q$ in each interaction. We consider both Euclidean and Lorentzian probes of the quantum system in the large $N$ limit. In the strong coupling phase, the entropy provides a diagnostic of the thermal renormalisation group flow. Under certain conditions, two parametrically separated regimes of near-conformal behaviour emerge. The first reproduces the standard linear-in-temperature scaling characteristic of the single SYK model. The system then flows to another near-fixed point whose entropy scaling depends on the ratio $n = q/\tilde q$. For $n<3/2$, the entropy exhibits anomalous, faster-than-linear scaling in temperature. At $n=3/2$, there is an additional logarithmic enhancement. Using conformal perturbation theory, we argue that in the infrared regime of the SYK model, there may exist disordered conformal operators with dimensions $1 < Δ\leq 3/2$. In Lorentzian signature, we study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and show that these deformed theories exhibit near-maximal chaos in both regimes (when they exist). We comment on the relation between the anomalous scalings found here and those observed in certain near-extremal black holes in two and higher dimensions.

Result: Kerr-Taub-NUT时空作为例子展示了这种等效性。

Conclusion: 通过零角洛伦兹变换证明了自旋为零的自旋空时之间的等效性，并将在详细文章中提供更复杂的例子。

Abstract: There are a number of classical double copies, each providing a prescription for generating solutions to the Maxwell and scalar wave equations from exact solutions of Einstein's equations. Two such prescriptions are the Kerr-Schild and twistorial double copies. We argue that for a broad class of self-dual vacuum solutions of the Kerr-Schild form, which we refer to as twistorial Kerr-Schild spacetimes, these two prescriptions are in fact equivalent. The approach is elementary, utilizing null Lorentz transformations, with homogenous functions on twistor space playing a central role. The equivalence is illustrated explicitly for the example of the self-dual (Kerr)-Taub-NUT spacetime. A detailed proof and several more examples will be presented in a long-form companion to this letter.

### [4] [Sampling Polynomial Rational Remainders with SP$\mathbb{Q}$R: A new Package for Polynomial Division and Elimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14875)
*Vsevolod Chestnov,Giulio Crisanti*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: SPQR is a Mathematica package that efficiently divides and eliminates variables in polynomial systems by using finite field sampling and reconstruction, overcoming computational bottlenecks like expression swell in Gröbner basis calculations. It substantially enhances performance compared to traditional symbolic methods, reducing runtime and memory usage. Additionally, applying SPQR to Feynman integrals reveals new Landau singularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind SPQR stems from the challenge of efficiently handling large polynomial systems, particularly in contexts like algebraic geometry and theoretical physics where traditional methods are computationally intensive.

Method: SPQR operates by sampling results over finite fields and then reconstructing them, mimicking advanced Integration by Parts techniques for Feynman integrals. This approach effectively mitigates the issue of expression swell during Gröbner basis construction, which is a significant computational hurdle.

Result: SPQR shows remarkable improvements over existing symbolic computer algebra systems in benchmarks, offering multiple orders of magnitude reduction in both runtime and memory consumption. In applications involving Feynman integrals, it successfully identifies new Landau singularities that were previously unknown.

Conclusion: SPQR represents a significant advancement in handling polynomial systems by integrating insights from algebraic geometry with techniques from theoretical physics. Its ability to process complex computations more efficiently opens new possibilities in fields requiring symbolic computation and analysis of algebraic varieties.

Abstract: We introduce SP$\mathbb{Q}$R, a new Mathematica package for the division and elimination of variables from polynomial systems. SP$\mathbb{Q}$R works by sampling and reconstructing results over finite fields, in an analogous manner to many state of the art Integration by Parts algorithms for Feynman integrals. This allows SP$\mathbb{Q}$R to effectively overcome expression swell during the construction of Gröbner bases, which in many cases is the major bottleneck in such computations. Benchmarks on state of the art Macaulay resultants show that SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can deliver substantial gains over symbolic computer algebra workflows -- reducing both runtime and memory footprint by multiple orders of magnitude. Likewise when applied to study Feynman integrals, we show how SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can be used to find previously unknown Landau singularities.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It is commonly believed that a unitary supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) involving graviton and gravitino fields on fixed 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_4$) cannot exist due to known challenges associated with supersymmetry (SUSY) on spaces with positive cosmological constant. In this talk, we contradict this expectation by presenting a new unitary supersymmetric QFT on fixed $dS_4$ : the free supersymmetric theory of the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino fields. The theory overcomes the known obstacles to unitary global SUSY on de Sitter because the commutator between two SUSY transformations closes on the conformal algebra $so(4,2)$ rather than the de Sitter algebra $so(4,1)$. Crucially, the $so(4,2)$ symmetry is realised through unconventional conformal-like transformations. Based on arxiv:2503.04515.

Abstract: The gauge field formalism, or operator-valued cochain formalism, has recently emerged as a powerful framework for describing quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. In this work, we extend this framework to construct a broad class of logical gates for general CSS codes, including the S, Hadamard, T, and (multi-)controlled-Z gates, under the condition where fault-tolerance or circuit-depth optimality is not necessarily imposed. We show that these logical gates can be expressed as exponential of polynomial functions of the electric and magnetic gauge fields, which allows us to derive explicit decompositions into physical gates. We further prove that their logical action depends only on the (co)homology classes of the corresponding logical qubits, establishing consistency as logical operations. Our results provide a systematic method for formulating logical gates for general CSS codes, offering new insights into the interplay between quantum error correction, algebraic topology, and quantum field theory.

### [7] [A construction of single-valued elliptic polylogarithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15240)

Conclusion: 本论文成功地构建了椭圆单值多对数的一般框架，为未来在量子场论和算术几何中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: We establish a general construction of single-valued elliptic polylogarithms as functions on the once-punctured elliptic curve. Our formalism is an extension of Brown's construction of genus-zero single-valued polylogarithms to the elliptic curve: the condition of trivial monodromy for solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation is expressed in terms of elliptic associators and involves two representations of a two-letter alphabet. Our elliptic single-valued condition reduces to Brown's genus-zero condition upon degeneration of the torus. We provide several examples for our construction, including the elliptic Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm.

Conclusion: 这个研究为量子引力理论提供了一个新的可能性，通过引入鬼场动态来解释高阶导数项的物理现象。

Abstract: The inclusion of higher derivatives is a necessary condition for a renormalizable or superrenormalizable local theory of quantum gravity. On the other hand, higher derivatives lead to classical instabilities and a loss of unitarity at the quantum level. A standard way to detect such issues is by examining the reflection positivity condition and the existence of a Kallen-Lehmann spectral representation for the two-point function. We demonstrate that these requirements for a consistent quantum theory are satisfied in a theory we have recently proposed. This theory is based on a six-derivative scalar field action featuring a pair of complex-mass ghost fields that form a bound state. Our results support the interpretation that physical observables can emerge from ghost dynamics in a consistent and unitary framework.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we give a detailed account of the algorithm outlined in [1] for Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations. The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, we use a new geometric order relation in the integration-by-parts reduction to obtain a basis of master integrals, whose differential equations are of a Laurent polynomial form in the regularisation parameter $\varepsilon$ and compatible with a filtration. This step works entirely with rational functions. In a second step, we provide a method to $\varepsilon$-factorise the aforementioned Laurent differential equations. The second step may introduce algebraic and transcendental functions. We illustrate the versatility of the algorithm by applying it to different examples with a wide range of complexity.

Abstract: The Kerr/CFT correspondence establishes a relationship between extremal black holes in higher dimensions and a chiral conformal field theory (CFT) in their near-horizon limit. A generalization of this framework, known as the EVH/CFT correspondence, has been developed for four- and five-dimensional AdS black holes. It was further proposed in arXiv:1910.14293 that a generalized duality between $(D-2)$ dimensional geometry and $(D-3)$ dimensional field theory may emerge in AdS$_{D=6,7}$ black holes under a suitably defined extremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limit. In this work, we demonstrate that the near-EVH geometries arising in these AdS$_{6,7}$ black hole models are not of the standard lower dimensional AdS kinds of black holes to establish a lower dimensional version of AdS/CFT correspondence, but instead belong to the family of Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton (EMMD) gravity theories. This realization opens a pathway toward a microscopic counting of non-AdS black hole entropy via higher-dimensional AdS/CFT techniques.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in conformal and duality invariant nonlinear electrodynamics, we study the non-Abelian extension of ModMax electrodynamics. The theory is parameterized by a single dimensionless constant, and it is continuously connected to Yang-Mills theory in its vanishing limit. We show that the theory admits (anti-)self-dual instantons, despite the additional nonlinearities that characterize the non-Abelian ModMax theory. For $SU(2)$, we construct the generalization of the BPST instanton and extend this solution to Euclidean de Sitter and anti-de Sitter backgrounds. In the latter case, the Chern-Pontryagin index depends on the instanton size since the configuration is not a pure gauge at infinity; a property already pointed out in Yang-Mills on negative-curvature backgrounds by Callan and Wilczek. We compute the contribution of the latter to the spectrum of the Dirac operator at the boundary, which is crucial for determining the non-local contributions to the Dirac index. Then, we show that the ansatz constructed with 't Hooft symbols accommodates multi-instantons in the non-Abelian ModMax theory. The system of (anti-)self-dual equations reduces to a single nonlinear equation, which can be perturbatively solved order by order in the parameter that controls the nonlinearity. Following such a strategy, we provide a formal solution for the $N$-instanton configuration to first order in the expansion. Then, we couple non-Abelian ModMax theory to gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field and construct new gravitating solutions that describe Euclidean wormholes and other smooth configurations with secondary hair.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The gravitational path integral measure has been the subject of an increasing interest lately, and no conclusive answer yet exists for its correct form. In this paper, we adopt effective field theory techniques to shed light on this issue. We build the configuration-space metric as an energy expansion, including all possible terms that satisfy the underlying symmetries, and use it to define a Riemannian measure. We study the running of the free parameters that show up in this expansion at leading order, which corresponds to the DeWitt metric with parameter $λ$. We show that a flat configuration space is excluded on unitarity grounds. The renormalization group contains one UV fixed point at $λ=-1$, thus allowing for the UV completion of the measure sector. This fixed point corresponds to the value obtained by identifying DeWitt's metric from the kinetic term of general relativity, a standard procedure in the literature that otherwise lacks physical motivation. Our results provide such a justification from first principles.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky quantization of the quadratic gravity theory, which is the most general theory with terms up to quadratic order in curvature. This approach of quantization is based on the Hamiltonian formulation. In this sense, this study contributes to the consistency of the quantum formulation of the theory. With this scheme of quantization we may introduce a broad class of additional conditions on the field variables, by including Lagrange multipliers and time derivatives. We find that a mandatory condition for the validity of the Hamiltonian formulation, previously known from classical analysis, can be incorporated consistently in this quantization. We obtain the propagators of the fields, including the propagators associated with the quantum states of negative norm. The spectrum of masses coincides with the results of Stelle, but distributed on a different way among the fields.

Abstract: We consider complex, supersymmetric, non-extremal Euclidean black holes that are asymptotically locally AdS$_5$, with $S^1 \times M_3$ conformal boundary. We study field theory backgrounds consisting of various $M_3$, and explicitly construct Killing spinors that are anti-periodic around the Euclidean time circle. Focussing on elliptically/biaxially squashed three-spheres and Lens spaces, we compute the supersymmetric index of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in a Cardy-like limit. While such black holes have not been constructed for general $M_3$, we show that our field theory results can be recovered from a gravity computation using equivariant localization, just assuming the solutions exist.

Conclusion: 该研究为研究高维量子场论中的临界行为和实时间和散过程提供了新的数值方法，并展示了TDVP方法的强大潜力。

Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior and real-time scattering dynamics of the interacting $φ^4$ quantum field theory in $(1+1)$ dimensions using uniform matrix product states and the time-dependent variational principle. A finite-entanglement scaling analysis at $λ= 0.8$ bounds the critical mass-squared to $μ_c^2 \in [-0.3190,-0.3185]$ and provides a quantitative map of the symmetric, near-critical, weakly broken, and deeply broken regimes. Using these ground states as asymptotic vacua, we simulate two-particle collisions in a sandwich geometry and extract the elastic scattering probability $P_{11\to 11}(E)$ and Wigner time delay $Δt(E)$ following the prescription of Jha et al. [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 023266 (2025)]. We find strongly inelastic scattering in the symmetric phase ($P_{11\to 11} \simeq 0.63$, $Δt \simeq -180$ for $μ^2 = 0.2$), almost perfectly elastic collisions in the spontaneously broken phase ($P_{11\to 11} \simeq 0.998$, $Δt \simeq -270$ for $μ^2=-0.2$ and $P_{11\to 11} \simeq 1$, $Δt \simeq -177.781$ for $μ^2=-0.5$), and a breakdown of the sandwich evolution precisely at the critical coupling, which provides a dynamical signature of the quantum critical point. These results demonstrate that TDVP-based uniform matrix product states can probe nonperturbative scattering and critical dynamics in lattice $φ^4$ theory with controlled entanglement truncation.

Abstract: The 2-component BKP (2-BKP) hierarchy is an important integrable system corresponding to the infinite dimensional Lie algebras $b_{\infty}$ and $d_{\infty}$, which contains Novikov-Veselov equation and can be used to describe the total descendent potential of D type singularity. Here we firstly introduce the projections of the mixed pseudo-differential operators to rewrite the 2-BKP Lax equation in the Shiota construction, where the scalar Lax operators involving two differential operators $\partial_1$ and $\partial_2$ are used. Based upon this, the $(M_1,M_2)$-reduction of the 2-BKP hierarchy is given. After that, we give the most important result of this paper, i.e., the transformations of the 2-BKP tau functions, which are in fact the 2-BKP Darboux transformations. Here we further give the corresponding changes in the 2-BKP Lax operators. Also the corresponding results are investigated for the reduction case. Finally, the additional symmetries can be viewed as the special cases of the transformations of the 2-BKP tau functions. Besides, we discuss the Pfaffian identities of the 2-BKP tau functions by successive applications of the above transformations, which are closely related with the 2-BKP addition formulae.

*Julia Wildeboer,Marton Lajer,Robert M. Konik*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses how confinement of fractionalized excitations, such as spinons, in the gapped spin-½ XXZ chain under a staggered field leads to confinement-induced nonergodicity. Eigenstate thermalization is suppressed, and mesonic bound states form in a controlled manner across the system's parameter space. The study combines exact diagonalization, analytical methods, and numerical comparisons to elucidate confinement mechanisms and their implications for quantum spin chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research is driven by the question of how confinement of fractional excitations affects many-body quantum systems. The understanding of such phenomena not only contributes to fundamental knowledge of condensed matter and high-energy physics but also impacts the development of quantum technologies, particularly in the context of quantum computing and information processing where nonergodic behavior can be harnessed for specific tasks.

Method: The authors employ an exact diagonalization technique focusing on symmetry-resolved sectors. They use this method in conjunction with analytical tools, particularly the predicted analytic ladder by Rutkevich, to explore the formation and behavior of mesonic bound states. Cross-sectional analysis of gap ratios, entanglement measures, and state banding across different anisotropy parameters serves as a comprehensive approach to understanding the system's dynamics.

Result: The study identifies a phase transition in the system's behavior based on the anisotropy parameter Δ. At weak Δ (Δ ≈ 1), the system exhibits chaotic, Gaussian-orthogonal level statistics, indicating high ergodicity. As Δ increases (Δ ≫ 1), the system transitions to a non-ergodic regime characterized by domain-wall-resolved Hilbert space structure and distinctive banding in eigenstates. The Page-like entanglement structure typical of chaotic systems is replaced by suppressed, band-resolved entanglement, reflecting quasi-conservation of domain walls. Additionally, precise agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical simulations of mesonic bound state formation is observed, validating the confinement hypothesis.

Conclusion: This research provides a unified framework for understanding confinement-induced nonergodicity and its role in controlling the spectral and entanglement properties of quantum spin chains. The findings offer a systematic approach to meson spectroscopy, advancing our understanding of fractionalization and confinement in low-dimensional quantum systems and providing a concrete model for future studies in this field.

Abstract: Confinement of fractionalized excitations can strongly restructure many-body spectra. We investigate this phenomenon in the gapped spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a staggered field, where spinons bind into domain-wall ``mesons'' deep in the antiferromagnetic phase. We present evidence that this non-integrable model exhibits both Hilbert space fractionalization and quantum scar formation as controlled by the anisotropy parameter $Δ$. Exact diagonalization across symmetry-resolved sectors reveals a crossover from Gaussian-orthogonal (chaotic) level statistics at weak anisotropy $Δ\sim 1$ to non-ergodic behavior deep in the antiferromagnetic regime $Δ\gg 1$ through scrutinizing the adjacent gap ratios, accompanied by a striking banding of eigenstates by domain-wall number in correlation and entanglement measures. The Page-like entanglement dome characteristic of chaotic spectra gives way to suppressed, band-resolved entanglement consistent with emergent quasi-conservation of domain walls. To investigate further the formation mechanism of mesonic scar states, we carry out meson spectroscopy near the two-spinon threshold and compare with the analytic ladder predicted by Rutkevich [Phys. Rev. B 106, 134405 (2022)]. We test the theory through continuum-relative bindings, an offset-removed Airy scaling collapse, and explicit two-meson thresholds that determine the number of stable meson levels. The low-lying spectrum shows close quantitative agreement, while deviations at higher energies are consistent with finite-size and subleading corrections. These results establish a unified account of confinement-induced nonergodicity and provide a template for quantitative meson spectroscopy in quantum spin chains.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, characterized by the coexistence of atypical non-thermal eigenstates within an otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum. In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.

*Eduard Koller,Swetlana Swarup,Johannes Knolle,Natalia B. Perkins*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Experiments on α-RuCl3 show finite Raman circular dichroism (RCD), indicating chiral phonons. A diagrammatic framework for the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev model explains this: bare phonons don't contribute RCD, but coupling to a chiral spin excitation continuum under a magnetic field renormalizes the phonon propagator, mixing polarization eigenvectors and creating finite angular momentum states. This interaction-induced effect leads to nonzero RCD with characteristic Fano line shapes. The RCD grows with magnetic field strength, matching experiments and showing that the field induces chirality in the spin sector. This work demonstrates RCD as a powerful probe for chiral phonons in correlated quantum materials.

Motivation: Understanding the origin of Raman circular dichroism in Kitaev materials and its implications for chiral phonon behavior is crucial for advancing knowledge in condensed matter physics, particularly in the study of topological and frustrated magnets.

Method: A diagrammatic framework for the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev model was developed to analyze the experimental data.

Result: The study reveals that interaction-induced chiral phonons are responsible for the observed RCD, with the signal growing in strength as the magnetic field increases.

Conclusion: RCD is confirmed as an effective tool for detecting and studying interaction-induced chiral phonons in correlated quantum materials, opening new avenues for research in this area.

Abstract: Recent Raman experiments on the Kitaev material $α$-RuCl$_3$ have reported a finite Raman circular dichroism (RCD), revealing chiral phonon behaviour not expected from lattice symmetry alone. To explain this observation, we develop a diagrammatic framework for the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev model. We demonstrate that bare phonons contribute no RCD, but coupling to the chiral spin excitation continuum under an applied magnetic field renormalizes the phonon propagator, mixing real polarization eigenvectors into complex superpositions with finite angular momentum. This interaction-induced modification generates a nonzero RCD accompanied by characteristic Fano line shapes in the Raman response, reflecting interference between discrete phonons and the continuum. The resulting signal grows with magnetic field strength, consistent with experiment, and directly tracks the field-induced chirality of the spin sector. More broadly, our results establish RCD as a powerful probe of interaction-induced chiral phonons in correlated quantum materials.

Abstract: Rare-earth nickelates RNiO3 (R=rare-earth element) exhibit three kinds of phase transitions with decreasing temperature: a structural transition from a pseudo-cubic to a monoclinic phase, a metal- insulator transition (MIT), and a magnetic transition from a paramagnetic state to an ordered one. The first two occur at the same temperature, which has led to a consensus that the MIT is driven by lattice distortions. We show here that the primary driving force for the MIT is magnetic; however because of the unusual d7 configuration of Ni, additional flexibility in spin configurations are also needed which symmetry-lowing structural deformations make possible. The latter enable Ni to disproportionate into two kinds: a high-spin and a low-spin configuration, which allow the system to reduce its unfavorable orbital moment and also open a gap.

Abstract: A functional heterostructure is central to integrated circuitry in quantum photonics, optoelectronics, neuromorphic computing, spintronics, and straintronics. Recently, heterostructures combining 2D magnets and nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored. In these, electron and hole wavefunctions are localized in 2D magnets but delocalized in TMDs. When combined, a proximity induced magnetic inter layer exciton can emerge, with energy differing by 20 to 30 meV from intra layer excitons and being two orders of magnitude darker, making it hard to detect and functionalize. Using a high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach, we show that functionality can be significantly enhanced in a transition metal molecule TMD interface. The molecular exciton exhibits charge transfer character and is extended, unlike the localized Frenkel excitation in 2D magnets. Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states.

TL;DR: This paper explores how quantum spin liquids form at finite temperatures by studying the entanglement patterns in two models, the Kitaev honeycomb model and the Kagome lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

Motivation: Understanding the formation mechanism of quantum spin liquids (QSL) at finite temperatures is important for advancing knowledge of quantum phases of matter and has implications for quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Method: The authors introduce a method to characterize entanglement patterns and apply it to study the entanglement evolution in the Kitaev honeycomb model and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice as temperature is reduced.

Result: The results determine the temperature at which spins within the paramagnetic phase first become entangled and the temperature at which the system first develops structured multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into the entanglement-based formation of quantum spin liquids and introduces a promising method for studying entanglement structures in other quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.

Abstract: Fractionalized excitations such as spinons and anyons have emerged as a central theme in condensed matter physics with broad implications for superconductivity, quantum statistics, and quantum computation. The nearly ideal one-dimensional $S=1/2$ system $β$-VOSO$_4$ without long-range order down to 85 mK provides a promising platform to experimentally explore such fractionalized excitations. Here, we employ Raman spectroscopy to probe magnetic excitations and the evolution of spin correlations in $β$-VOSO$_4$. Spinon signatures are found along the chain direction, evidenced by a broad, gapless scattering continuum at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the spinon spectral weight aligns considerably with numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations. By comparing the experimental spinon spectral weight with calculated results and evaluating the associated quantum Fisher information (QFI) therefrom, we observe a steep increase in QFI upon cooling, indicating rapidly growing correlation lengths. Our study showcases QFI as a probe of spin correlations in quantum magnets.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the XXZ model on the sawtooth spin chain with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in which all exchange constants (symmetric, antisymmetric and axial anisotropy) are different for the three different bonds of each triangle.

  The properties of the corresponding flat magnon bands and localized magnon states are analyzed.
  We further construct the mapping of the flat-band conditions for the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya constants onto the Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky parameters.
  Based on the mapping the possibility of the electric field driven flat bands with aid of the magnetoelectric coupling is examined.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates the electronic properties and superconductivity of La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure using DFT+DMFT and RPA. Despite non-Fermi-liquid behavior at low pressures, the system shows robust magnetic order and no signs of high-temperature superconductivity, suggesting the need for alternative routes to break magnetic rigidity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic states and superconductivity in transition metal oxides is crucial for advancing high-temperature superconductivity research.

Method: The study employs a multi-theoretical approach combining DFT+DMFT, RPA, and multi-orbital spin susceptibility analysis to comprehensively map the electronic and magnetic properties under pressure.

Result: The analysis reveals that superconductivity is unlikely in the pristine state due to robust magnetic order and unfavorable pairing symmetry. Pressure induces symmetry transition between d-wave and s+g-wave pairing, but the energetic cost of high angular momentum g-wave makes high-Tc superconductivity implausible.

Conclusion: The absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 highlights the importance of considering magnetic order and pairing symmetry in achieving superconductivity. Future research should focus on alternative methods like chemical doping or strain to potentially enable superconductivity in this material.

Abstract: We elucidate the electronic structure and quantum many-body instabilities of the monolayer nickelate La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure using a combination of density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), and random phase approximation (RPA). Our DFT+DMFT calculations reveal non-Fermi-liquid behavior and coherence loss near the Fermi level at low pressures, driven by strong electron correlations within the Ni-e_g orbital manifold, which is analogous to the low-energy electronic properties observed in La3Ni2O7. However, multi-orbital spin susceptibility analysis demonstrates an exceptionally suppressed critical Stoner parameter U_c (about 0.4~0.7 eV), indicating robust magnetic order that dominates the ground state and precludes superconductivity in the pristine system. Below U_c, superconducting instabilities exhibit a pressure-driven symmetry transition: the d_(x2-y2)-wave pairing prevails at ambient and low pressure, while the s+g-wave symmetry occurs above 75 GPa. This transition is attributed to pressure-induced self-doping effect. The high-angular-momentum g-wave component incurs significant energetic penalties, rendering high-Tc superconductivity unlikely. We conclude that the absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 arises from its robust intrinsic magnetism and the unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure, suggesting that alternative routes-such as chemical doping or epitaxial strain-are necessary to suppress magnetism and unlock superconducting states.

Abstract: We discuss the emergence of non-Abelian zero modes from twist defects in Abelian topological phases. We consider a setup built from a fractional quantum Hall (FQH)-superconductor heterostructure, which effectively induces a phase transition, leading to a topological phase endowed with new anyonic symmetries, and accordingly supporting distinct types of zero modes at fixed filling. These defects are modeled at the interface between two copies of the same heterostructure arranged side by side, which produces counterpropagating modes that can be gapped by interactions that realize the anyonic symmetries. We characterize the parafermions associated with each anyonic symmetry and discuss how their presence affect the periodicity of Josephson tunneling current.

Motivation: The study contributes to understanding the structural and magnetic properties of materials in the FePdTe family, which could be useful for applications in spintronics or other fields requiring ferromagnetic materials.

Method: The research employed temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction, transport measurements, and magnetic characterization to analyze the compounds at various temperatures and compositions.

Result: The materials undergo structural transitions with varying Fe and Pd fractions, resulting in different magnetic properties, such as easy-plane ferromagnetism with Curie temperatures ranging from 98 to 180 K.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of controlling material properties through compositional tuning in vdW ferromagnets, offering new design avenues for magnetic materials with tailored properties.

Abstract: Here, we provide a detailed study of the crystal structure and physical properties of the recently discovered vdW ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$. We find this compound has a relatively wide width of formation, and grow single crystals with compositions Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ where $x$ ranges from 0.9 to 1.1 and $y$ from 1.8 to 2.5, respectively. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and transport measurements reveal that a first-order structural transition occurs in the range of $T$ = 360-420 K. Above the transition, the compounds with Pd fraction $y>2$ adopt a disordered derivative of the tetragonal FeTe structure, with the Fe layer showing mixed Fe/Pd occupancy and the extra Pd atoms partially occupying interstitial sites. Below 370 K, the structure is incommensurately modulated. For $y<2$, the composition Fe$_{1.1}$Pd$_{1.8}$Te$_2$ has monoclinic symmetry at room temperature that is consistent with the reported structure of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. This phase undergoes a structural transition at 420 K for which the high temperature structure is yet to be determined; however, based on the similarities with the $y > 2$ compounds, we speculate that this composition also adopts a tetragonal structure above 420\,K. All compounds investigated in the Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ series show metallic behavior, with magnetic characterization indicating that they are easy-plane, hard, ferromagnets with $T_C$ spanning 98--180 K. Both the critical temperature for the structural transition and the Curie temperature are moderately suppressed with increasing Pd fraction $y$ and corresponding decreasing Fe fraction $x$, indicating that synthetic control over $x$ and $y$ paves way for the further exploration of these compounds.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the electron-hole asymmetry in cuprates using the three-band Emery model with multiple computational methods. No significant asymmetry is observed when focusing on antiferromagnetic orders. Dopant effects, such as Cu- and O-site defects, are identified as intrinsic contributors to apparent asymmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electron-hole asymmetry is crucial for comprehending the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates.

Method: The study employs variational Monte Carlo, determinant quantum Monte Carlo, constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, density-matrix embedding theory, and Gutzwiller approximation with parameters from La₂CuO₄.

Result: The research finds no significant electron-hole asymmetry when considering only Neel antiferromagnetic responses and stripe states. Dopant effects significantly influence the asymmetry.

Conclusion: Dopant-driven effects must be considered when analyzing competing orders in cuprates.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the electron-hole asymmetry of antiferromagnetism in cuprates by studying the three-band Emery model. Using parameters relevant to La$_2$CuO$_4$, we benchmark the anti-ferromagnetic response for a large range of dopings with variational Monte Carlo, determinant quantum Monte Carlo, constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, density-matrix embedding theory, and the Gutzwiller approximation. Across methods and accessible sizes/temperatures, we find no significant electron-hole asymmetry if we consider only Neel anti-ferronagnetic response and ignore other possible orders such as stripe state. This result is robust to a moderate oxygen-site repulsion $U_p$ and to parameter sets of Nd$_2$CuO$_4$. Incorporating dopant-induced local potentials reveals an extrinsic route to asymmetry: Cu-site defects enhance AFM on the electron-doped side, whereas O-site defects suppress it on the hole-doped side. These results indicate that dopant-driven effects make a non-negligible contribution to apparent electron-hole asymmetry in the general phase diagram of cuprates and should be included when analyzing competing orders in cuprates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding exotic magnetic phases and quantum criticality in pyrochlore materials is important for advancing our knowledge of correlated electron systems.

Method: Inelastic neutron scattering and exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian were used to study the magnetic properties of Yb2Ti2O7.

Result: The material exhibits a unique magnetic phase characterized by a partially captured magnon mode and evidence of quantum criticality.

Conclusion: Yb2Ti2O7 provides a promising system for studying quantum criticality, with implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other quantum phenomena.

Abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the anisotropic pyrochlore phase diagram. Inelastic field-dependent neutron scattering on Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ shows intrinsic broadening and a flat low-energy magnon mode which is partially captured by interacting magnon models. Exact diagonalization reveals the existence of an emergent quantum phase between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, in which Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ Hamiltonian potentially resides. This behavior matches the phenomenology of quantum criticality in heavy fermion systems, and shows Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is a clean system which can be field-tuned from well-defined magnons to a nontrivial quantum ground state. This suggests that quantum criticality is a generic feature of the dipolar phase diagram.

Abstract: Plasmonic nanopores combine nanofluidic confinement with electromagnetic field enhancement, enabling optical interrogation of single molecules in sub-wavelength volumes. Yet, direct optical readout within these metallic geometries has remained challenging due to fluorescence quenching near the surface. Here, we implement DNA-PAINT as a molecular reporter of local optical fields inside plasmonic nanopores. Transient hybridization of fluorescent imager strands at the nanopore tips yields stochastic emission bursts that map active binding sites with nanometric precision. By varying the fluorophore-metal distance using DNA spacers of controlled length, we observe a non-monotonic intensity response consistent with near-field quenching and plasmonic enhancement, identifying an optimal separation of around 6 nm. Finally, we extend the concept to dual-material Au/Si nanopores, demonstrating lateral coupling between plasmonic and semiconducting regions. These results establish DNA-PAINT as a quantitative probe of nanoscale optical environments in hybrid nanopores.

Abstract: We report that due to the orbital Hall effect, orbital pumping effects can occur in materials with weak spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between the strength of the orbital Hall effect and the size of spin-pumping. During the spin-pumping, with the enhancement of the orbital Hall effect, the resonant absorption of orbital current and the damping of the ferromagnetic layer also increase. Especially, when the thickness of Ti reaches 60 nm, the orbital -mixing conductance of Ti/Co is an order of magnitude higher than spin-mixing conductance of heavy metal/Co, reaching 474.1 3 ^18 m^(-2). The results indicate that the orbital current is more easily transmitted across the interface

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium relaxation of a spatial density modulation in a one-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose gas, and its connection to the equilibrium scattering rate $\smash{γ_k\propto k^{3/2}}$ of the system's phononic excitations. We show that the relaxation is generally governed by a nonequilibrium scattering rate $γ_{k,t}$ coupled to quantum fluctuations, which approaches its equilibrium value $γ_k$ only at long times. Numerical simulations of quantum kinetic equations reveal an algebraic convergence, $\smash{γ_{k,t} - γ_k \sim t^{-2/3}}$, confirmed by analytical predictions. More broadly, our results establish a theoretical framework for experimentally probing phonon dynamics through the temporal evolution of local perturbations in quantum gases.

Abstract: This work presents a dimensional reduction of Bose-Einstein condensates confined by generalized transverse potentials, parametrized by an exponent $n$. Starting from the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we employ a variational ansatz to derive an effective one-dimensional nonpolynomial Schrödinger equation, which self-consistently determines the transverse width dynamics. The model generalizes existing formalisms for cigar- and funnel-shaped geometries. We validate the approach through comprehensive numerical tests, demonstrating excellent agreement with full 3D simulations for ground-state properties across various interaction regimes. Finally, real-time simulations of matter-wave scattering at potential barriers verify the model's dynamical robustness, successfully replicating the spatiotemporal evolution and energy-dependent transmission characteristics observed in full 3D calculations.

*Paola Perion,Clara Magnin,Fulvia Arfelli,Bertrand Faure,Ralf Hendrik Menk,Emmanuel Brun*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Modulation-based imaging (MoBI) can improve image quality by optimizing membrane movement, though it currently requires multiple exposures. Different movement strategies, such as regular stepping, random stepping, global standard deviation, and local standard deviation, were tested. The optimized movement strategies, particularly those based on standard deviation metrics, resulted in better contrast-to-noise ratio and reduced angular sensitivity. Honeycomb membranes were found to be especially compatible with these strategies. Overall, the optimized motion strategies enhance MoBI performance without increasing experimental complexity.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore how to optimize the movement of the intensity modulator in MoBI to improve image quality without increasing experimental complexity.

Method: The paper uses an experimental study based on different membrane types, comparing optimized movement strategies with regular and random stepping motions, and validates through noise power spectrum analysis.

Result: The optimized movement strategies improved contrast-to-noise ratio and reduced angular sensitivity. Honeycomb membranes were the most compatible with the optimization procedure. Noise power spectrum analysis showed further advantages of optimized motion strategies.

Conclusion: An optimized membrane movement can significantly improve MoBI image quality without increasing experimental complexity.

Abstract: Modulation-based imaging (MoBI) is an X-ray phase-contrast technique that uses an intensity modulator (or membrane) in the beam. Although MoBI can be performed in a single shot, multiple exposures are typically needed to improve the quality of the result. The membrane is typically moved using a regular stepping pattern for convenience; however, the impact of the membrane movement scheme on image quality has not been fully investigated yet. In this work, we explore optimized movement strategies aiming at improving MoBI performance. An experimental study tested optimization schemes based on global and local standard deviation metrics, and compared them with regular and random stepping motions. The results demonstrated superior contrast-to-noise ratio and reduced angular sensitivity in the optimized approaches compared to conventional stepping. These results were consistent across different membrane types, with honeycomb membranes showing the highest compatibility with the optimization procedure. Noise power spectrum analysis further validated the advantages of the optimized motion strategies. Overall, the results demonstrate that an optimized membrane movement can significantly improve MoBI image quality without increasing experimental complexity.

Abstract: Thermalization of isolated quantum systems is an intriguing phenomenon at the forefront of contemporary physics. In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear multimode optical platforms can be harnessed to induce effective quantum interactions between photons. Through numerical experiments where quantum beams propagate alongside classical light within multimode nonlinear optical systems, we reveal the thermalization of fundamental quantum light states--specifically single- and two-photon states. This thermalization is clearly manifested by the emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans and Boltzmann statistical distributions. Beyond providing a deeper understanding of how classical nonlinearities can be used to investigate quantum many-body dynamics, our findings will enable the exploration of a broader range of complex quantum phenomena, including aspects of quantum phase transitions, within readily accessible classical optical settings.

Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds (neutral NV0 (wavelength 575 nm) and negative NV- (wavelength 637 nm)) represent promising platforms for quantum nanophotonics applications, yet their emission efficiencies remain constrained by weak light-matter interactions. Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLM) offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for efficient light manipulation beyond conventional single-material metasurfaces, enabling dual-resonance cavities that can simultaneously enhance pump excitation and SPE collection. However, traditional trial-and-error and forward optimization methods face significant challenges in designing these complex structures due to the vast parameter space and computational demands. Here, we present NanoPhotoNet-Inverse, an artificial intelligence-driven inverse design framework based on a hybrid deep neural network architecture. This model efficiently performs inverse design of two dual-resonance MLM cavities to amplify pump and SPE emissions of different vacancies in nanodiamond and improve SPE collection. Our approach achieves inverse design prediction efficiency exceeding 98.7%, demonstrating three orders of magnitude amplification in SPE count rate and 50 picosecond lifetime, significantly surpassing conventional cavity designs. These remarkable enhancements in emission rates and collection efficiency position our platform as a transformative technology for advancing quantum communication networks, quantum computing architectures, quantum sensing applications, and quantum cryptography systems. Therefore, it opens new pathways for intelligent photonic device engineering in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Engineering nanoscale light matter interaction in mixed dimensional semiconductor heterostructures offers a pathway to mitigate the intrinsic gain bandwidth trade off in photodetectors. Here, we report a broadband, high responsivity 2D and 1D photodetector formed by integrating monolayer p type WSe2 with electrospun p type NiO nanowires. The device photoresponse spans 350 to 780 nm and is governed by a nanophotonic field confinement mechanism rather than bulk optical absorption. The high index NiO nanowire acts as a dielectric Mie type nanoresonator that supports geometry defined optical modes and produces antenna like near field concentration at the nanoscale WSe2 and NiO junction. This localized optical mode increases the local absorption cross section and enhances the photocarrier generation rate within the junction region, identified as the dominant active volume for photocurrent. A coupled optoelectronic model linking full wave electromagnetic simulations to carrier generation, recombination, and extraction accurately captures the measured responsivity spectrum and its power dependence using only two electronic fitting parameters. The device achieves responsivities of 627 A/W in the visible region, 227 A/W in the UV, and 167 A/W in the NIR, demonstrating broadband operation with ultrahigh gain. These results show that geometric resonance in mixed dimensional junctions is a powerful design principle for next generation high gain optoelectronic detectors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Off-axis parabolic mirrors (OAPs) are occasionally desirable for specialized applications, but are known to introduce field-dependent astigmatic aberrations. In an experiment where optical tweezers are formed by OAPs, another OAP is added to form a relay configuration with an optional microscope, resulting in near diffraction-limited performance, with a resolution of $2.19$ $μm$. The severe radially non-uniform distortion incurred by this configuration, with a long path length and a large field of view, requires software corrections for the microscopic image. To avoid overfitting given the limited features available for calibration at the tweezers focal plane, a distortion model with a reduced set of parameters is selected based on simulation data. Applying the model to experimental data, an average residual error of $3.60$ $μm$ ($1.33$ $μm$) is achieved in object space after the simple relay (adding a $5 \times$ microscope) over a field of approximately $1$ $μm$ $\times$ $1$ $μm$ ($200$ $μm$ $\times$ $200$ $μm$). The residual errors are likely dominated by diffraction artifacts in the features used for correction.

Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$μ$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.

Yet, systematic studies of its thickness-dependent reflectivity and its impact on harmonic generation are still lacking. Here, we introduce a non-destructive optical method to determine the thickness of 3r-MoS2 flakes from reflectivity measurements, offering AFM-like precision with a mean bias of less than 2 nm range, while being much faster and applicable to non-solid substrates such as PDMS, in the 3-200 nm range. Nonlinear characterization further reveals distinct thickness-dependent maxima in second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG), with the first clear peak at ~200 nm. These maxima arise from Fabry-Pérot-type phase matching conditions mediated by the film thickness and can further be shaped by absorption. This work thus provides both a practical thickness metrology and new insights for exploiting thickness-dependent 3R-MoS2 nonlinearities in scalable photonic technologies.

Abstract: The concept of geometric phase was applied to initiate the geometric-phase portrayal of electromagnetic scattering by a three-dimensional object in free space. Whereas the incident electromagnetic field is that of an arbitrarily polarized plane wave, the direction-dependent far-zone scattering amplitude is used to define
  direction-dependent Stokes parameters for the scattered field. Both symmetric and asymmetric Poincaré spinors are formulated to characterize the polarization states of incident plane wave and the far-zone scattering amplitude, and two different geometric phases are defined therefrom. Density plots of both geometric phases were calculated for six different homogeneous isotropic spheres with different linear constitutive properties and boundary conditions: dielectric-magnetic spheres (non-dissipative and dissipative), impedance spheres, perfect electrically conducting spheres, charged dielectric-magnetic spheres, dielectric-magnetic spheres with topologically insulating surface states, and isotropic chiral spheres. The incident plane waves were taken to be linearly and circularly polarized, for the sake of illustration. Numerical results revealed that geometric-phase density plots possess significantly richer features than their counterparts for the differential scattering efficiency. The geometric-phase portrayals exhibit enhanced sensitivity to changes in the size and composition of the scatterer, the boundary conditions, and the incident polarization state, suggesting promise for inverse-scattering problems.

Abstract: The lowest-frequency Raman mode of water, observed through depolarized light scattering or optical Kerr effect techniques, is routinely used to track dynamic changes in water molecules near ions or biomolecules. Yet, the microscopic origin of this mode and its relation to dielectric relaxation still remains debated for pure water with conflicting interpretations attributing it to either translational or rotational molecular motions. In this study, we compute the low-frequency Raman spectrum in the GHz to THz range using ab initio simulations, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data. Detailed decomposition analysis reveals that the rotational and translational contributions are equally important, while strong negative orientational cross-correlations as well as internal field effects significantly modify the rotational component, making it distinct from expectations inferred from dielectric spectroscopy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A time-domain representation of chromatographic peak shapes is presented as an analytic expression designed for high computational efficiency, which can be used for direct time-domain peak fitting with parameters that represent physical quantities. The underlying model integrates the effects of axial diffusion (molecular and multipath/eddy), finite initial spatial variance, and two distinct retention mechanisms: one characterized by a high rate of short-duration events (fast kinetics), and another by a low rate of long-duration events (slow kinetics). Fits to experimental chromatograms yield substantially smaller residual standard error (RSE) than the standard EMG and the lowest average normalised RSE among 12 established peak-shape functions in the examined cases. The stochastic approach is reformulated using single-particle probability laws, providing a rigorous basis for future theoretical extensions. The validity of the foundational Poisson assumption is critically examined by deriving expressions for the excess variance caused by correlated microscopic retention rate fluctuations. A statistical interpretation of the HETP is presented and used to determine a lower bound on the number of microscopic retention events from chromatogram-derived macroscopic observables. This, in turn, justifies the applicability of the Gaussian limit for the mobile-plus-fast component, as established by analysis of the cumulant generating function of the closed-form benchmark derived herein. The contribution from the slow-kinetic mechanism is incorporated via a decoupling approximation, whose validity is established through a cumulant-based analysis that explicitly bounds the decoupling-induced error. Finally, the notion that mechanistic heterogeneity necessarily exacerbates peak tailing is qualified, analytically delineating parameter regions in which it leads to a reduction in peak asymmetry.

The Atomistic Mechanism Of Rare Events in Molecular Dynamics (AMORE-MD) framework enhances interpretability of deep-learned reaction coordinates by connecting them to atomistic mechanisms, without requiring any a priori knowledge of collective variables, pathways, or endpoints. Here, AMORE-MD employs the ISOKANN algorithm to learn a neural membership function $χ$ representing the dominant slow process, from which transition pathways are reconstructed as minimum-energy paths aligned with the gradient of $χ$, and atomic contributions are quantified through gradient-based sensitivity analysis. Iterative enhanced sampling further enriches transition regions and improves coverage of rare events enabling recovery of known mechanisms and chemically interpretable structural rearrangements at atomic resolution for the Müller-Brown potential, alanine dipeptide, and the elastin-derived hexapeptide VGVAPG.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the binding energy and electron-hole (e-h) overlap of excitonic states confined at the interface between two-dimensional materials with type-II band alignment, i.e., with lowest conduction and highest valence band edges placed in different materials, arranged in a side-by-side planar heterostructure. We propose a variational procedure within the effective mass approximation to calculate the exciton ground state and apply our model to a monolayer MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ heterostructure. The role of nonabrupt interfaces between the materials is accounted for in our model by assuming a W$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloy around the interfacial region. Our results demonstrate that (i) interface-bound excitons are energetically favorable only for small interface thickness and/or for systems under high dielectric screening by the materials surrounding the monolayer, and that (ii) the interface exciton binding energy and its e-h overlap are controllable by the interface width and dielectric environment.

Abstract: Nonuniform strain in graphene acts as a valley-dependent gauge field, generating pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) that mimic real magnetic fields but preserve global time-reversal symmetry. While local probes have visualized such fields, their quantitative detection via macroscopic transport has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that high-mobility graphene exhibits distinct beating patterns in Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, arising from valley-resolved Landau quantization under different effective magnetic fields. Systematic analysis of these beats reveals universal quadratic and linear scaling of the node carrier density and Landau level filling factor with the applied magnetic field, enabling the extraction of PMFs as small as a few millitesla. Our results establish quantum oscillation spectroscopy as a robust and broadly applicable probe of strain-induced gauge fields in Dirac materials, opening avenues for mechanically tunable valleytronic and straintronic devices.

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium topological phases of monolayer 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ under high-frequency circularly polarized driving using a low-energy $k\!\cdot\!p$ Hamiltonian combined with a van Vleck expansion. The off-resonant field generates spin- and valley-dependent mass corrections that reshape the Berry curvature profile and shift the conditions for band inversion. By evaluating the quasienergy bands, Berry curvatures, Hall conductivities, and spin- valley-resolved Chern numbers, we identify a sequence of light-controlled topological transitions marked by well-defined gap closings. Depending on the Floquet coupling strength and the electric-field parameter, the system evolves between the equilibrium quantum spin Hall (QSH) state and a set of driven phases including spin-polarized quantum Hall insulator (S-QHI), quantum valley Hall (QVH or BI) and photo-induced quantum Hall insulator (P-QHI) regimes. The results establish 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ as a tunable platform where circular driving selectively manipulates spin and valley degrees of freedom, enabling controlled access to non-equilibrium topological phases in transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism that produces a Hall-like response in time-reversal-invariant materials, driven entirely by geometric effects. Specifically, we demonstrate that a tilted potential interface causes electron wave packets to undergo a refraction-like deflection upon transmission through the barrier, leading to a finite transverse current and a corresponding Hall conductance. Our analytical framework captures the essential features of this refraction Hall effect, and the resulting Hall conductivity profile is corroborated by numerical simulations across different lattice models and device geometries. We further visualize our predicted effect through real-time wave packet dynamics, which reveals its purely geometric origin and the robustness of the transverse response. These findings establish a fundamentally distinct class of Hall-like transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems that preserve time-reversal symmetry.

Abstract: We present a rare example of a one-dimensional system with short-range range interactions for which a self-stabilizing long-range ordered phase persists to finite temperatures. Our model offers a new perspective on the origins of shape anisotropy on the mesoscopic scale in magnetic metamaterials. Specifically, we show how the combination of a physically realistic stray-field potential and the spatial dimensionality of the system can reduce the effective dimensionality of classical magnetic mesospins. The resulting emergent constraints on the magnetic excitation spectrum underpin the observed ordering, in stark contrast to the behaviour of analogous one-dimensional models with strictly isotropic spins.

Abstract: Energetic ion irradiation is an effective method for studying how single and multi-shelled carbon nanotubes break apart. The energy from ions is dissipated through both linear and nonlinear processes in the nanotubes, leading to defect formation. Fragmentation occurs via atomic collision cascades and thermal spikes, each described by different theoretical models. Experiments with Cs-irradiated nanotubes support these models, and an information-theoretic approach further explains the fragmentation mechanisms. Sputtered species yield probability distributions, which are analyzed using Shannon entropy and fractal dimension to assess spatial characteristics. Kullback-Leibler divergence helps identify the diversity of emission mechanisms. Together, thermal and information-theoretic models clarify and distinguish the roles of collision cascades and thermal spikes in nanotube fragmentation.

Abstract: Engineered assemblies of interacting magnetic elements-magnetic metamaterials-provide a powerful route to tailor collective magnetic order and dynamics. By structuring matter at the mesoscale, they bridge atomic magnetism and macroscopic functionality, enabling emergent behaviour inaccessible in conventional materials. However, realizing large-area metamaterials that combine high morphological uniformity with intrinsic long-range order has remained challenging, largely due to the structural disorder inherent to lithographic fabrication. Here we demonstrate a scalable route to structurally and magnetically coherent metamaterials by embedding iron-ions to form mesospins within a non-magnetic thin film palladium host matrix. Using controlled implantation, we realize morphologically uniform arrays that spontaneously develop extended antiferromagnetic order in the as-fabricated state - without the need of external annealing or field cycling. Resonant X-ray scattering and microscopy reveal sharp magnetic Bragg peaks modulated by the mesospin form factor, evidencing long-range antiferromagnetic order coupled to structural coherence. This embedded architecture establishes a platform for exploring coherent spin-photon interactions and functional X-ray scattering in magnetic metamaterials free from lithographic topography and disorder.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study investigates the effects of the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) on threshold carrier and current densities. Various modeling techniques such as 8-band kp, electrostatics, and Auger recombination rates are used. The model accounts for carrier-carrier scattering and considers parasitic absorption and bias voltage effects on Auger recombination. The study finds that heavy doping of the electron injector reduces multi-hole Auger recombination, which aligns with experimental results. However, the model suggests that Auger recombination alone cannot explain the increase in threshold currents at high doping. The use of indium in hole injector wells shows that doping strategies may be preferable to simply increasing the levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the physics of ICL injectors is vital for optimizing device performance, particularly in reducing threshold currents and improving efficiency.

Method: The study employs a comprehensive theoretical approach combining 8-band kp modeling, electrostatic analysis, and microscopic Auger recombination rate calculations. The non-equilibrium Green's function formalism is used to model carrier-carrier scattering.

Result: Heavy doping of the electron injector suppresses multi-hole Auger recombination, as seen in experiments. However, the model indicates that Auger recombination alone does not fully explain the behavior of threshold currents at high doping. Incorporating indium into hole injectors yields results in line with experimental observations about the effectiveness of doping strategies.

Conclusion: The study provides physical insights into the optimization of ICL carrier injectors through modeling, highlighting the complexity of explaining threshold current behavior beyond Auger recombination effects.

Abstract: We investigate theoretically how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathrm{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order within the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. It captures the combined effects of charge carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Yet, our model suggests that the Auger recombination alone is not sufficient to explain the increase of threshold currents at high doping concentrations. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional GaSb hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights toward optimization of ICL carrier injectors.

Conclusion: GKBA方法在电子-声子相互作用中具有有限适用性，建议结合电子体系扩展以提高稳定性。

Abstract: Predicting real-time dynamics in correlated systems is demanding: exact two-time Green's function methods are accurate but often too costly, while the Generalized Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz (GKBA) offers time-linear propagation at the risk of uncontrolled behavior. We examine when and why GKBA fails in a minimal yet informative setting, the Holstein dimer that describes electron-phonon coupling. Using a conserving, fully self-consistent electron-phonon self-energy, we map out parameter regions where GKBA dynamics is stable and where it becomes unstable. We trace the onset of these failures to qualitative changes in the model's ground-state solutions obtained from the full nonequilibrium Green's function theory, thereby providing practical stability bounds for GKBA time evolution. We further show that coupling the dimer to electronic leads can damp and, in part, cure these instabilities. The results supply simple diagnostics and guidelines for reliable GKBA simulations of electron-phonon dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pixel chip readout scheme: the Region-of-Interest Readout Circuit (ROIRC), which is designed for large area, large array pixel chips and Gas Pixel Detector (GPD). This design employs a sentinel pixel detection strategy, enabling rapid identification and prioritized readout of the pixel regions containing signal events. During the scanning readout of these signal events, ROIRC employs a Block-based readout approach, effectively minimizing the readout of non-signal pixels. The functionality of ROIRC has been successfully implemented on both the ASIC and FPGA platforms. In the tests of the ROIRC, the pixel chip embedded in the GPD is capable of detecting low-energy X-rays in the range of 2-10 keV and supports multiple event readouts, and the pixel chip can read out photo-electron signal events with the count rate up to 15k / (cm2 x s).

Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a magnetic signal scanning and imaging system based on the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect. The system employs a pair of performance-matched GMI sensing elements configured as a differential probe structure. Through co-optimized low-noise electronic and probe design, the system effectively suppresses both intrinsic sensor common-mode drift and external environmental magnetic noise, enabling high signal-to-noise ratio detection of nono-tesla to micro-tesla-level magnetic signals without magnetic shielding. Experimental results demonstrate that the differential system achieves significantly lower noise spectral density in unshielded environments compared to conventional GMI sensors (\SI{46}{pT}/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ versus \SI{286}{pT}/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at \SI{1}{Hz}), with a sensitivity of 186,790 V/T and spatial resolution better than 200 micrometers. The system's excellent performance in weak magnetic field detection and spatial resolution was verified through scanning experiments of magnetic ink on US banknotes and magnetic reference samples. Compared to SQUID scanning systems, which requiring liquid helium cooling, this system based on the GMI effect offers advantages of room-temperature operation, compact structure, and low cost. Relative to conventional single-element GMI microscopes, it achieves significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and environmental adaptability. This research provides a practical solution for high-resolution magnetic field imaging at room temperature with broad application potential in materials magnetism, biomagnetic imaging, and nanomagnetic detection.

Abstract: Fine-pitch hybridisation processes are essential for next-generation pixel detectors and high-density microelectronic assemblies. Conventional bump-bonding techniques, although reliable, remain costly and difficult to implement for single-die applications.
  In this work, we present flip-chip hybridisation results combining Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) bumping with Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) bonding, both developed in-house. This method enables fine-pitch interconnections without requiring wafer-level processing.
  The feasibility of the ENIG-ACF process for functional devices was demonstrated by hybridising functional Timepix3 ASIC and Ti-LGAD (Trench Isolated Low-Gain Avalanche Detector) sensors with 55 um pitch. The approach was then extended to test structures with 25 um pitch, using aligned-particle ACFs. The analysis revealed that the main limitation originated from the mismatch between ACF thickness and bump height, underlining the importance of interface geometry optimisation. To address this, a dedicated simulation program was developed to model the isotropic growth of ENIG bumps and to determine the optimum bump height as a function of ACF thickness and pixel-matrix geometry.
  The results provide valuable guidelines for future high connection density assemblies and demonstrate the potential of the ENIG-ACF process as a scalable, low-cost alternative to conventional bump-bonding techniques.

Motivation: Improving the performance and reliability of variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era is crucial for advancing quantum computing.

Method: The proposed NPID method integrates a classical PID controller with a neural network to update variational quantum circuit parameters. This approach incorporates classical control theory to address the barren plateau issue common in quantum optimization.

Result: Simulation results show that NPID achieves better convergence speed (2-9 times faster) compared to existing methods like NEQP and QV. Additionally, it exhibits consistent performance even under varying noise levels, with average fluctuation of 4.45%.

Conclusion: The integration of classical control strategies with quantum machine learning shows promise in enhancing the trainability and stability of variational quantum algorithms, offering a new pathway for their optimization.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) combine the advantages of classical optimization and quantum computation, making them one of the most promising approaches in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. However, when optimized using gradient descent, VQAs often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, commonly known as the barren plateau. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with a neural network to update the parameters of variational quantum circuits. We refer to this method as NPID, which aims to mitigate the barren plateau. The proposed algorithm is tested on randomly generated quantum input states and random quantum circuits with parametric noise to evaluate its universality, and additional simulations are conducted under different noise rates to examine its robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated based on its convergence speed toward the target cost value. Simulation results show that NPID achieves a convergence efficiency 2-9 times higher than NEQP and QV, with performance fluctuations averaging only 4.45% across different noise levels. These results highlight the potential of integrating classical control theory into quantum optimization, providing a new perspective for improving the trainability and stability of variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to redefine the boundaries of computational science, offering the potential for exponential speedups in solving complex problems across chemistry, optimization, and materials science. Yet, their practical utility remains constrained by unpredictable performance degradation under real-world noise conditions. A key question is how problem structure itself influences algorithmic resilience. In this work, we present a comprehensive, hardware-aware benchmarking study of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm across 11 diverse test patterns on multiple superconducting quantum processors, revealing that algorithmic performance is exquisitely sensitive to problem structure. Our results reveal average success rates of 100.0\% (ideal simulation), 85.2\% (noisy emulation), and 26.4\% (real hardware), representing a dramatic 58.8\% average performance gap between noisy emulation and real hardware execution. With quantum state tomography confirming corresponding average state fidelities of 0.993, 0.760, and a 0.234 fidelity drop to hardware. Performance degrades dramatically from 75.7\% success for sparse patterns to complete failure for high-density 10-qubit patterns. Most strikingly, quantum state tomography reveals a near-perfect correlation between pattern density and state fidelity degradation, providing the fundamental explanation for observed performance patterns. The catastrophic fidelity collapse observed in real hardware measurements -- dropping to 0.111 compared to the predicted 0.763 -- underscores severe limitations in current noise models for capturing structure-dependent error mechanisms. Our work establishes pattern-dependent performance as a critical consideration for quantum algorithm deployment and provides a quantitative framework for predicting algorithm feasibility in practical applications.

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is an indispensable ab initio method in both quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Based on recent advancements in reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT), a variant of DFT that is believed to be better suited for strongly correlated systems, we construct a mathematical framework generalizing all ground state functional theories, which in particular applies to fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems. We show that within the special class of such functional theories where the space of external potentials forms the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group, the $N$-representability problem is readily solved by applying techniques from the study of momentum maps in symplectic geometry, an approach complementary to Klyachko's famous solution to the quantum marginal problem. The ``boundary force'', a diverging repulsive force from the boundary of the functional's domain observed in previous works but only qualitatively understood in isolated systems, is studied quantitatively and extensively in our work. Specifically, we present a formula capturing the exact behavior of the functional close to the boundary. In the case where the Lie algebra is abelian, a completely rigorous proof of the boundary force formula based on Levy-Lieb constrained search is given. Our formula is a first step towards developing more accurate functional approximations, with the potential of improving current RDMFT approximate functionals such as the Piris natural orbital functionals (NOFs). All key concepts and ideas of our work are demonstrated in translation invariant bosonic lattice systems.

Abstract: Interacting Rydberg atoms constitute a versatile platform for the realization of non-equilibrium states of matter. Close to phase transitions, they respond collectively to external perturbations, which can be harnessed for technological applications in the domain of quantum metrology and sensing. Owing to the controllable complexity and straightforward interpretability of Rydberg atoms, we can observe and tune the emergent collective nonlinearity. Here, we investigate the application of an interacting Rydberg vapour for the purpose of time series prediction. The vapour is driven by a laser field whose Rabi frequency is modulated in order to input the time series. We find that close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where collective effects are amplified, the capability of the system to learn the input becomes enhanced. This is reflected in an increase of the accuracy with which future values of the time series can be predicted. Using the Lorenz time series and temperature data as examples, our work demonstrates how emergent phenomena enhance the capability of noisy many-body quantum systems for data processing and forecasting.

### [65] [Robustness of the quantum Mpemba effect against state-preparation errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14837)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现QME在不同系统中对初始状态准备噪声有不同的敏感度，一些模型对噪声敏感，难以实现加速热化，而另一些模型则表现出更强的QME和更稳定的对称性复原能力。

Motivation: 探索QME在不同系统中的稳定性及对初始状态准备噪声的影响

Method: 使用 Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad 方程模型分析加速热化问题；考虑U(1)对称随机量子电路的对称性恢复 via 增加初始对称性破坏；在状态准备中引入较大噪声进行实验。

Result: 基于GKSL方程的模型对初始状态噪声非常敏感，难以加速热化；在U(1)对称随机电路中，增加初始对称性破坏可以稳定实现加速对称恢复和增强的QME；当出现较大状态准备噪声时，QME速率和对称恢复能力进一步增强。

Conclusion: QME的实现需要谨慎选择系统的模型结构，确保初始状态准备的准确性；对于对称性恢复要求较高的系统，可能需要额外的控制措施以抵消噪声的影响。

Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is a phenomenon observed in many-body systems where initial systems configurations farther from equilibrium can be observed to equilibrate faster than configurations that are closer to it. By considering noise induced error in the initial system state preparation, we analyse the robustness of various models exhibiting the QME. We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state, making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast, we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation, we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a stronger QME.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the computational hurdles in modeling quantum light evolution in nonlinear media, which is crucial for advancing quantum technologies.

Method: The method employs a tensor-network approach with continuous-variable representation, using matrix product states (MPS) to efficiently capture the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems through direct numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation.

Result: The method successfully simulates degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and accurately reproduces theoretical benchmarks such as energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing. It achieves compression ratios of over 3·10³ while maintaining physical fidelity even for high-intensity pump fields (α=100).

Conclusion: This framework provides a scalable solution for modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena, opening new possibilities in quantum technology development.

Abstract: Understanding the quantum evolution of light in nonlinear media is central to the development of next-generation quantum technologies. Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($α= 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental time complexity, as constrained by Lieb-Robinson bounds, for preparing entangled states useful in quantum metrology. We relate the minimum time to the Quantum Fisher Information ($F_Q$) for a system of $N$ quantum spins on a $d$-dimensional lattice with $1/r^α$ interactions with $r$ being the distance between two interacting spins. We focus on states with $F_Q \sim N^{1+γ}$ where $γ\in (0,1]$, i.e., scaling from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. For short-range interactions ($α> 2d+1$), we prove the minimum time $t$ scales as $t \gtrsim L^γ$, where $L \sim N^{1/d}$. For long-range interactions, we find a hierarchy of possible speedups: $t \gtrsim L^{γ(α-2d)}$ for $2d < α< 2d+1$, $t \gtrsim \log L$ for $(2-γ)d < α< 2d$, and $t$ may even vanish algebraically in $1/L$ for $α< (2-γ)d$. These bounds extend to the minimum circuit depth required for state preparation, assuming two-qubit gate speeds scale as $1/r^α$. We further show that these bounds are saturable, up to sub-polynomial corrections, for all $α$ at the Heisenberg limit ($γ=1$) and for $α> (2-γ)d$ when $γ<1$. Our results establish a benchmark for the time-optimality of protocols that prepare metrologically useful quantum states.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Preserving spin symmetry in variational quantum algorithms is essential for producing physically meaningful electronic wavefunctions. Implementing spin-adapted transformations on quantum hardware, however, is challenging because the corresponding fermionic generators translate into noncommuting Pauli operators. In this work, we introduce an exact and computationally efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries derived from fermionic double excitation and deexcitation rotations. These unitaries are expressed as ordered products of exponentials of Pauli operators. Our method exploits the fact that the elementary operators in these generators form small Lie algebras. By working in the adjoint representation of these algebras, we reformulate the factorization problem as a low-dimensional nonlinear optimization over matrix exponentials. This approach enables precise numerical reparametrization of the unitaries without relying on symbolic manipulations. The proposed factorization provides a practical strategy for constructing symmetry-conserving quantum circuits within variational algorithms. It preserves spin symmetry by design, reduces implementation cost, and ensures the accurate representation of electronic states in quantum simulations of molecular systems.

Abstract: If classical algorithms have been successful in reproducing the estimation of expectation values of observables of some quantum circuits using off-the-shelf computing resources, matching the performance of the most advanced quantum devices on sampling problems usually requires extreme cost in terms of memory and computing operations, making them accessible to only a handful of supercomputers around the world. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a classical simulation outperforming Gaussian boson sampling experiments of one hundred modes on established benchmark tests using a single CPU or GPU. Being embarrassingly parallelizable, a small number of CPUs or GPUs allows us to match previous sampling rates that required more than one hundred GPUs. We believe algorithmic and implementation improvements will generalize our tools to photo-counting, single-photon inputs, and pseudo-photon-number-resolving scenarios beyond one thousand modes. Finally, most of the innovations in our tools remain valid for generic probability distributions over binary variables, rendering it potentially applicable to the simulation of qubit-based sampling problems and creating classical surrogates for classical-quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a fundamental model for light-matter interactions, the finite-component quantum phase transition (QPT) in the QRM has established a paradigmatic application for critical quantum metrology (CQM). However, such a paradigmatic application is restricted to a local regime of the QPT which has only a single critical point. In this work we propose a globalized CQM in the QRM by introducing an auxiliary nonlinear term which is realizable and can extend the critical point to a continuous critical regime. As a consequence, a high measurement precision is globally available over the entire coupling regime from the original critical point of the QRM down to the weak-coupling limit, as demonstrated by the globally accessible diverging quantum Fisher information in dynamics. We illustrate a measurement scheme by quadrature dynamics, with globally criticality-enhanced inverted variance as well as the scaling relation with respect to finite frequencies. In particular, we find that the globally high measurement precisions still survive in the presence of decoherence. Our proposal paves a way to break the local limitation of QPT of the QRM in CQM and enables a broader application, with implications of applicability in realistic situation.

Abstract: Optimal measurements for quantum multiparameter estimation are complicated by the uncertainty principle. Generally, there is a trade-off between the precision with which different parameters can be simultaneously estimated. The task of determining the minimum achievable estimation error is a central task of multiparameter quantum metrology. For estimating parameters encoded in pure quantum states, the ultimate limit is known, but is given by the solution of a non-trivial minimisation problem. We present a new expression for the achievable bound for two-parameter estimation with pure states that is considerably simpler. We also determine the optimal measurements, completing the problem of two-parameter estimation with pure state probes. To demonstrate the utility of our result, we determine the precision limit for estimating displacements using grid states.

Abstract: We report generation of 10.1\pm0.2-dB squeezed light from a broadband periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Based on our previous report where a similar PPLN waveguide shows 8.3-dB squeezing [T. Kashiwazaki et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 122, 234003 (2023)], we reduce phase fluctuations and overall optical losses in the measurement system. In particular, we introduce a novel phase detection technique that does not require tapping a part of the squeezed light to get a phase locking signal. We use a phase-detection OPA seeded by a tapped probe and pump light before a squeezer OPA. This configuration breaks the conventional trade-off between generating a phase-locking signal with high-signal-to-noise ratio and suppressing degradation of squeezing level caused by optical tapping. With all these improvements, the phase fluctuation angle is reduced from 14 mrad to 9 mrad, and the total optical loss from 12\% to 8\%. Achieving more than 10 dB of squeezing by the broadband waveguide OPA is a significant step towards realization of fault-tolerant ultra-fast universal optical quantum computation.

Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics sets a lower bound on the work required to drive a system between thermal equilibrium states, with equality attained in the quasistatic limit. For finite-time processes, part of the extractable work is inevitably dissipated, motivating the search for driving protocols that minimize the work. While classical stochastic systems have been extensively explored, quantum analyses remain limited and often rely on Markovian master equations valid only in the weak-coupling regime. Here, we study minimal work protocols for representative two-level systems coupled to a harmonic-oscillator bath using a numerically exact method. Inspired by known optimal solutions for Brownian oscillators, we introduce an impulse ansatz that incorporates possible boundary impulses and test it across a wide range of bath parameters. We find that impulse-like features remain nearly optimal in the quantum, non-Markovian regime, at short times. We also identify cases in which the widely used Markovian master equation fails even at weak coupling, underscoring the need for fully quantum approaches to finite-time thermodynamic optimization.

TL;DR: A novel variational method for time evolution operators with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors propose a new method to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of quantum simulations, particularly in quantum computing applications.

Method: The method involves a variational alternative to the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition by using a global action principle and optimized parameters to preserve unitarity while improving accuracy.

Result: The method outperforms standard Trotter-Suzuki formulas by achieving higher accuracy with fewer gates, reducing noise and improving precision in quantum computing applications.

Conclusion: This new approach offers a promising tool for accurate quantum simulations with improved efficiency compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: We propose a variational alternative to the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition that provides greater control over errors while preserving the unitary structure of time evolution. The variational parameters in our ansatz are derived from a global action principle, where Euler-Lagrange equations govern their optimal dynamics. Unlike conventional wavefunction-based variational methods, our approach specifically targets the time evolution operation and this allows a single set of optimized parameters to be applied to any initial state for a fixed Hamiltonian avoiding costly optimization procedures. Our method outperforms the standard Trotter-Suzuki formulas, typically achieving higher accuracy than higher-order Suzuki schemes. This translates directly to quantum computing applications, where it enables the design of quantum circuits with fewer gates which reduces noise and improves precision. Although we focus on quantum dynamics, the method is broadly applicable to problems involving general time-evolution operators. Applied to various model Hamiltonians, our approach reduces errors by factors of 2 to 5 compared to Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, demonstrating its promise for accurate quantum simulation with improved efficiency. In certain cases, the variational ansatz achieves higher accuracy than more complex higher-order Suzuki formulas while reducing the gate count by nearly half within a single circuit layer. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the variational parameters up to cubic order in time, valid for generic Hamiltonians. These approximations enable long-time quantum simulations with improved accuracy over equivalent Suzuki decompositions, providing ready-to-use evolution formulas that match Suzuki's gate complexity while delivering better performance.

Conclusion: This work opens a new pathway for the design of fast, high-fidelity quantum logic gates using micromotion-sensitive radial modes of trapped-ion crystals, offering promising advancements in quantum computing technologies.

Abstract: Micromotion in radio-frequency ion traps is generally considered detrimental for quantum logic gates, and is typically minimized in state-of-the-art experiments. However, as a deterministic effect, it can be incorporated into quantum control frameworks aimed at designing high-fidelity quantum logic controls. In this work, we demonstrate that micromotion can be beneficial to the design of fast gates utilizing the radial modes of a two-ion crystal, particularly in the sub-trap-period regime where high-fidelity control sequences are identified with operation times ranging from hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds. Through analysis of select fast gate solutions, we uncover the physical origin of micromotion enhancement and further study the induced gate error under experimental noises and control imperfections. This analysis establishes the feasibility of realising high-fidelity entangling gates in hundreds of nanoseconds using the micromotion-sensitive radial modes of trapped-ion crystals.

Conclusion: 通过结合这三个新技术，研究为量子错误更高效的有效策略提供了重要的工具和见解，未来有望进一步提升qLDPC码的性能。

Abstract: The ultimate goal of quantum error correction is to create logical qubits with very low error rates (e.g. 1e-12) and assemble them into large-scale quantum computers capable of performing many (e.g. billions) of logical gates on many (e.g. thousands) of logical qubits. However, it is necessarily difficult to directly assess the performance of such high-quality logical qubits using standard Monte Carlo sampling because logical failure events become very rare. Building on existing approaches to this problem, we develop three complementary techniques to characterize the rare-event regime for general quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes under circuit noise. (I) We propose a well-motivated, low-parameter ansatz for the failure spectrum (the fraction of fault sets of each size that fail) that empirically fits all the QEC systems we studied and predicts logical error rates at all physical error rates. (II) We find min-weight logical operators of syndrome measurement circuits and exactly compute the number of min-weight failing configurations. (III) We generalize the splitting method to qLDPC codes using multi-seeded Metropolis sampling to improve convergence for systems with many inequivalent logical operators. We apply these tools to distance-6, -12, and -18 bivariate bicycle codes under circuit noise, observing strong low-error-rate performance with the recently proposed Relay decoder but also considerable scope for further improvement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol to address the threat of the HNDL attack in future large-scale IoT networks. QADR provides quantum-resistant and scalable solutions by combining QKD and QS-PRF, achieving O(n²) communication complexity, a significant improvement over O(n⁴) alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of IoT and the threat of quantum computing, ensuring secure data transmission is critical. The HNDL attack poses a significant risk, so a protocol that is both quantum-resistant and highly scalable is needed.

Method: The QADR protocol combines QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) and a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF). It features an automated slot reservation mechanism that accepts a controlled information leak for high performance, ensuring strong unlinkability.

Result: QADR achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity with improved communication complexity compared to quantum-native alternatives. A formal security analysis quantifies the trade-offs between performance and information leak.

Conclusion: QADR sets a high benchmark for future quantum-secured anonymity systems by addressing both security and performance comprehensively, proving its value as a solution for future challenges in IoT networks.

Abstract: The security of future large-scale IoT networks is critically threatened by the ``Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' (HNDL) attack paradigm. Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.

Abstract: Although known for negatively impacting the operation of superconducting qubits, thermal baths are shown to exert qubit control in a positive way, provided they are properly engineered. We demonstrate an experimental method to engineer the transduction of microwave driving into heat flow through a leaky resonator. Given the precise conversion, a qubit receiving the heat flow obtains a quasi-thermal equilibrium with arbitrary target temperature in hundreds of nanoseconds. We show that the dynamics of the quantum transducing process is described by thermalizing channel states, generated from the double dressings of the resonator by the semi-classical driving and the qubit-resonator coupling. Their spectrum, coupling, and driving strength determine the channel rate of energy flow, along with the relaxation rates of photon leakage into the bath. The analytical prediction is shown to match well with the experimental measurements on an Xmon qubit circuit.

Abstract: Efficiently encoding classical visual data into quantum states is essential for realizing practical quantum neural networks (QNNs). However, existing encoding schemes often discard spatial and semantic information when adapting high-dimensional images to the limited qubits of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We propose a Fidelity-Preserving Quantum Encoding (FPQE) framework that performs near lossless data compression and quantum encoding. FPQE employs a convolutional encoder-decoder to learn compact multi-channel representations capable of reconstructing the original data with high fidelity, which are then mapped into quantum states through amplitude encoding. Experimental results show that FPQE performs comparably to conventional methods on simple datasets such as MNIST, while achieving clear improvements on more complex ones, outperforming PCA and pruning based encodings by up to 10.2\% accuracy on Cifar-10. The performance gain grows with data complexity, demonstrating FPQE's ability to preserve high-level structural information across diverse visual domains. By maintaining fidelity during classical to quantum transformation, FPQE establishes a scalable and hardware efficient foundation for high-quality quantum representation learning.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an important model for implementing quantum machine learning (QML), while they demonstrate a high degree of vulnerability to backdoor attacks similar to classical networks. To address this issue, a quantum backdoor attack detection framework called QSentry is proposed, in which a quantum Measurement Clustering method is introduced to detect backdoors by identifying statistical anomalies in measurement outputs. It is demonstrated that QSentry can effectively detect anomalous distributions induced by backdoor samples with extensive experiments. It achieves a 75.8% F1 score even under a 1% poisoning rate, and further improves to 85.7% and 93.2% as the poisoning rate increases to 5% and 10%, respectively. The integration of silhouette coefficients and relative cluster size enable QSentry to precisely isolate backdoor samples, yielding estimates that closely match actual poisoning ratios. Evaluations under various quantum attack scenarios demonstrate that QSentry delivers superior robustness and accuracy compared with three state-of-the-art detection methods. This work establishes a practical and effective framework for mitigating backdoor threats in QML.

Abstract: Entanglement is a central resource in quantum technologies, and the realization of photonic entanglement necessarily relies on interaction with matter. Resonance fluorescence (RF), originating from the coherent interaction between a driving field and a two-level system, plays a pivotal role in quantum optics. Here, we demonstrate a novel route to entanglement generation based on RF from a single quantum dot. Rather than relying on generation of multiphoton states, our approach directly exploits vacuum-one-photon number superposition states created under resonant excitation. By delocalizing this superposition via a beam splitter, we realize time-bin entanglement and observe a clear violation of the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality using Franson-type interferometry. Our scheme removes the need for multiphoton generation, simplifies the experimental requirements, and establishes a scalable pathway toward solid-state entangled photon sources.

Abstract: We propose a topological transport platform for microwave-to-optical conversion at the single-photon level in a Rydberg atom-cavity setting. This setting leverages a hybrid dual-mode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) configuration, where a microwave resonator couples an optical cavity mediated by a Rydberg atom ensemble. Our scheme uniquely enables the formation of Fock-state lattices (FSLs), where photon hopping rates depend on photon numbers in individual sites. We identify an inherent zero-energy mode corresponding to the dark state of the dual-mode JC model. This enables to build a high-efficiency single-photon transducer, which realizes topologically protected photon transport between the microwave and optical modes. Crucially, we show analytically that the FSL features continuous variations of the winding number. Our work establishes a robust mechanism for efficient quantum transduction in synthetic dimensions and opens avenues for exploring topological physics with continuous winding numbers in the atom-cavity system.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks enable unconditionally secure key exchange using quantum mechanical principles. However, routing cryptographic keys across multi-hop quantum networks introduces challenges unique to quantum communication. This survey analyzes and classifies 26 routing strategies proposed between 2013 and 2024 for terrestrial, satellite, and hybrid QKD infrastructures. Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25-40% compared to static shortest-path methods by incorporating real-time key pool availability and link error rates. Multi-path strategies improve resilience against trusted-node compromise by distributing keys across disjoint routes, albeit with an increase in key consumption of 30-60%. SDN-based orchestration frameworks emerge as essential enablers of flexible, QoS-aware routing for hybrid networks integrating terrestrial fibers and intermittent satellite links. Critical research directions include reducing dependence on trusted nodes through quantum repeaters or post-quantum cryptography, developing standardized key management interfaces for interoperability, and adopting AI-driven predictive routing for adapting to fluctuating network states. This comprehensive synthesis of routing algorithms, performance trade-offs, and unresolved issues offers practical guidance for engineering secure, adaptable, and large-scale QKD networks capable of meeting real-world deployment demands.

Abstract: Although they have enabled several advances in the field of optomechanics, optomechanical disk resonators have not yet been operated in the quantum regime. We present the first experimental demonstration of an optomechanical disk resonator prepared in the quantum ground state. With a gigahertz frequency, the mechanical breathing mode of the investigated semiconductor disk reaches a level of excitation below a single phonon when cooled in a dilution refrigerator. We quantify the phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode by performing Brillouin sideband spectroscopy: a conical optical fiber is evanescently coupled to the disk optical whispering-gallery mode, and Stokes and anti-Stokes photons scattered by phonon emission and absorption are counted on a single-photon detector. We measure a suppression of the absorption process corresponding to a phonon occupancy of $0.66\pm0.20$. We experimentally investigate the mechanisms ruling laser-induced heating, which limits the lowest measurable phonon occupancy, and notably witness an extra-cavity heating effect.

Abstract: Stochastic unravelings allow to efficiently simulate open system dynamics, yet their application has traditionally been restricted to master equations that preserve both Hermiticity and trace. In this work, we introduce a general framework that extends piecewise-deterministic unravelings to arbitrary trace-nonpreserving master equations, requiring only positivity and Hermiticity of the dynamics. Our approach includes, as special cases, unravelings of arbitrary dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, evolutions interpolating between fully Lindblad and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian generators, and equations employed in the derivation of full counting statistics, for which we show it can be used to obtain the moments of the associated probability distribution. The framework is suitable for both trace-decreasing and trace-increasing processes through stochastic disappearance and replication of the stochastic realizations, and it is compatible with different unraveling schemes and with reverse jumps in the non-Markovian regime. Thereby, our approach provides a powerful and versatile simulation method that significantly broadens the applicability of stochastic techniques for open system dynamics.

Abstract: As quantum networks evolve toward a full quantum Internet, reliable transmission in quantum multiple-input multiple-output (QuMIMO) settings becomes essential, yet remains difficult due to noise, crosstalk, and the mixing of quantum information across subchannels. To improve reliability in such settings, we study an adaptive diversity strategy for discrete-variable QuMIMO systems based on universal asymmetric cloning at the transmitter and probabilistic purification at the receiver. An input qubit is encoded into M approximate clones, transmitted over an N x N multi-mode quantum channel, and recovered through a purification map optimized using available channel state information (CSI). For the given cloning asymmetry parameters, we derive an eigenvalue-based expression for the decoder-optimal end-to-end fidelity in the form of a generalized Rayleigh quotient, which enables efficient tuning of the cloner without iterative optimization. As a design choice, we employ semidefinite program (SDP) to construct the purification map for only a targeted success probability p. This numerical framework is used to study fixed-noise, dimension-scaling noise, and stochastic depolarization regimes. A cloning asymmetry index is introduced to quantify the distribution of quantum information across the multiple subchannels across these operating conditions. The results show that the proposed scheme yields significant fidelity gains in crosstalk-dominated settings and automatically adapts to channel symmetry and channel conditions. This work provides design guidelines for future QuMIMO systems and establishes a robust baseline for more advanced transmission and decoding strategies.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization typically encode constraints as soft penalties within the objective function, which can reduce efficiency and scalability compared to state-of-the-art classical methods that instead exploit constraints to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Although solving this issue for an arbitrary problem is inherently a hard task, we address this challenge for a specific problem in the field of telecommunications, the multi-frequency antenna placement problem, by introducing a constraint-preserving quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA). To this aim, we construct a quantum circuit that prepares an initial state comprising an equal superposition of all feasible solutions, and define a custom mixer that preserves both the one-hot encoding constraint for vertex coloring and the cardinality constraint on the number of antennas. This scheme can be extended to a broader range of applications characterized by similar constraints. We first benchmark the performance of this quantum algorithm against a basic version of QAA, demonstrating superior performance in terms of feasibility and success probability. We then apply this algorithm to large problem sizes with hundreds of variables using a constraint-aware decomposition method based on the SPLIT framework. Our results indicate competitive performance against other large-scale classical approaches, such as branch-and-bound and simulated annealing. This work supports previous claims that constraint-aware algorithms are crucial for the practical and efficient application of quantum methods in industrial settings.

Abstract: Magic is a non-classical resource whose efficient manipulation is fundamental to advancing efficient and scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Quantum advantage is possible only if both magic and entanglement are present. Of particular interest is non-local magic- the fraction of the resource that cannot be distilled (or erased) by local unitary operations - which is a necessary feature for quantum complex behavior. We perform the first experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Direct access to the QPU device enables us to identify and characterize the dominant noise mechanisms intrinsic to the quantum hardware. We observe excellent agreement between theory and experiment without the need for any free parameter in the noise modeling of our system and shows the experimental capability of harnessing both local and non-local magic resources separately, thereby offering a promising path towards more reliable pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices and to advance hardware-aware research in quantum information in the near term. Finally, the methods and tools developed in this work are conducive to the experimental realization of efficient purity estimation (featuring exponential speedup) and the decoding of Hawking radiation from a toy-model of a Black Hole.

Abstract: Task scheduling with constrained time intervals and limited resources remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as manufacturing, logistics, cloud computing, and healthcare. This study presents a novel variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) designed to address the task scheduling problem formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. The proposed method, referred to as Quantum Time Interval Scheduler (QTIS), integrates an ancilla-assisted quantum circuit to dynamically detect and penalize overlapping tasks, enhancing the enforcement of scheduling constraints. Two complementary implementations are explored for overlap detection: a quantum approach based on RY rotations and CCNOT gates, and a classical alternative relying on preprocessed interval comparisons. QTIS decomposes the problem Hamiltonian, Hp, into two components, each parameterized by a distinct angle. The first component encodes the objective function, while the second captures penalty terms associated with overlapping intervals, which are controlled by the auxiliary circuit. Subsequently, three minimization strategies are evaluated: standard QAOA, T-QAOA, and HT-QAOA, showing that employing separate parameters for the different components of the problem Hamiltonian leads to lower energy values and improved solution quality. Results confirm the efficiency of QTIS in scheduling tasks with fixed temporal windows while minimizing conflicts, demonstrating its potential to advance hybrid quantum-classical optimization in complex scheduling environments.

Abstract: Long distance entanglement generation at a high rate is a major quantum technological goal yet to be fully realized, with the promise of many interesting applications, such as secure quantum computing on remote servers and quantum cryptography. One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new extension of Gleason's theorem to two-dimensional Hilbert spaces for qubits, emphasizing the use of tensor-product structures and composite quantum systems to derive density matrices and Born's rule, ensuring probability invariance under subsystem consideration. The approach aligns with Gleason's original theorem by assigning probabilities only to projection-valued measures.


<details>

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is likely to extend the applicability of Gleason's theorem to lower-dimensional quantum systems, such as qubits, which are fundamental in quantum computing and quantum information theory.

Method: The method involves using tensor-product structures to consider composite quantum systems and deriving density matrices and Born's rule under the condition that probabilities are invariant when viewed as subsystems of larger systems.

Result: The result is an extension of Gleason's theorem to two-dimensional Hilbert spaces for qubits, providing a foundation for probability assignments in such systems by considering projection-valued measures exclusively.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that by focusing on projection-valued measures and composite systems, it successfully extends Gleason's theorem to qubits, contributing to the theoretical framework of quantum mechanics for lower-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We extend Gleason's theorem to the two-dimensional Hilbert space of a qubit by invoking the standard axiom that describes composite quantum systems. The tensor-product structure allows us to derive density matrices and Born's rule for $d=2$ from a simple requirement: the probabilities assigned to measurement outcomes must not depend on whether a system is considered on its own or as a subsystem of a larger one. In line with Gleason's original theorem, our approach assigns probabilities only to projection-valued measures, while other known extensions rely on considering more general classes of measurements.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises transformative advances, but remains constrained by recurring misconceptions and methodological pitfalls. This paper demonstrates a fundamental incompatibility between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) implementations and quantum optimization frameworks like Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Using Schelling's segregation model as a case study, we show that the standard practice of directly translating ABM state observations into QUBO formulations not only fails to deliver quantum advantage, but actively undermines computational efficiency. The fundamental issue is architectural. Traditional ABM implementations entail observing the state of the system at each iteration, systematically destroying the quantum superposition required for computational advantage. Through analysis of Schelling's segregation dynamics on lollipop networks, we demonstrate how abandoning the QUBO reduction paradigm and instead reconceptualizing the research question, from "simulate agent dynamics iteratively until convergence" to "compute minimum of agent moves required for global satisfaction", enables a faster classical solution. This structural reconceptualization yields an algorithm that exploits network symmetries obscured in traditional ABM simulations and QUBO formulations. It establishes a new lower bound which quantum approaches must outperform to achieve advantage. Our work emphasizes that progress in quantum agent-based modeling does not require forcing classical ABM implementations into quantum frameworks. Instead, it should focus on clarifying when quantum advantage is structurally possible, developing best-in-class classical baselines through problem analysis, and fundamentally reformulating research questions rather than preserving classical iterative state change observation paradigms.

Abstract: For the preparation of high-dimensional functions on quantum computers, we introduce tensor network algorithms that are efficient with regard to dimensionality, optimize circuits composed of hardware-native gates and take gate errors into account during the optimization. To avoid the notorious barren plateau problem of vanishing gradients in the circuit optimization, we smoothly transform the circuit from an easy-to-prepare initial function into the desired target function. We show that paradigmatic multivariate functions can be accurately prepared such as, by numerical simulations, a 17-dimensional Gaussian encoded in the state of 102 qubits and, through experiments, a 9-dimensional Gaussian realized using 54 qubits on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from gradient-descent methods developed for data processing in quantum state tomography [\href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/ae0baa}{Quantum Sci.~Technol.~\textbf{10} 045055 (2025)}] and quantum process tomography [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.150402}{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\textbf{130}, 150402 (2023)}], we introduce stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for fast quantum measurement tomography (QMT), applicable to both discrete- and continuous-variable quantum systems -- thus completing the tomography trio. A measurement device or detector in a quantum experiment is characterized by a set of positive operator-valued measure (POVM) elements; the goal of QMT is to estimate these operators from experimental data. To ensure physically valid (positive and complete) POVM reconstructions, we propose two distinct parameterization schemes within the SGD framework: one leveraging optimization on a Stiefel manifold and one based on Hermitian operator normalization via eigenvalue scaling. Within the SGD-QMT framework, we further investigate two loss functions: mean squared error, equivalent to L2 or Euclidean norm, and average negative log-likelihood, inspired by maximum likelihood estimation. We benchmark performance against state-of-the-art constrained convex optimization methods. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared to standard methods, our SGD-QMT algorithms offer significantly lower computational cost, superior reconstruction fidelity, and enhanced robustness to noise. We make a Python implementation of the SGD-QMT algorithms publicly available at \href{https://github.com/agtomo/SGD-QMT}{github.com/agtomo/SGD-QMT}.

### [97] [Detection of a highly stable orbital-period signal in GRACE-FO one-way intersatellite ranging using a synchronization-free differential observable (origin currently unidentified)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14782)
*S. H. Wassegh*

TL;DR: 本研究发现了一种新的方法用于探测方向性时间膨胀效应，通过比较卫星轨道器之间的持续范围间隔，发现了一个一致的大振幅信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测方向性时间膨胀效应对理解时空结构和引力场有重要科学意义。

Method: 采用了同步-free方法，通过比较卫星轨道器的连续间隔范围变化来实现。

Result: 在相对速度变化率的导数中观察到了一致的周期性信号，其相位和幅值在四个季节性数据集中一致，表明信号有物理依据。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在SME框架下，信号对应的有效速度约为139.3±0.1 km/s，尽管超出实验室现有界值，但信号稳定且与轨道框架一致，具有诊断轨道误差系统的作用，未来可应用于其他平台如GNSS以确认信号的普遍性或特殊性。

Abstract: We report the detection of a consistent, large-amplitude signal using a new synchronization-free protocol for probing directional time-dilation asymmetries with one-way ranging data between Earth-orbiting satellites. Our method, which relies exclusively on comparing successive range intervals measured by independent local clocks, was applied to data from the GRACE-FO mission. We observe a coherent signal in the derivative of the relative velocity projection, (v_A-v_B) dot V, that exhibits a clear orbital-period modulation. Crucially, the phase and amplitude of this modulation are found to be in excellent agreement across four distinct seasonal datasets, providing strong evidence against a purely random origin.
  Expressing this observable within the Standard-Model Extension (SME) framework yields an effective velocity magnitude of |V| ~= 139.3 +/- 0.1 km/s. While the corresponding effective SME coefficients (s-bar^0j from 10^-5 to 10^-4) exceed current laboratory bounds, the signal's stability and its coherence with the orbital frame make it a valuable diagnostic for systematic effects in orbital ranging. This work constitutes the first synchronization-free detection of a stable, orbital-scale signal of this type and establishes a clear, experimental path forward: applying this method to other platforms, most critically GNSS, to determine if the signal is a mission-specific systematic or a universal physical effect.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to provide a clear and accessible introduction to the rapidly evolving fields of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics, making it easier for students and researchers to understand and contribute to these areas.

Conclusion: This paper successfully equips readers with the knowledge and tools needed to delve into the exciting fields of gravitational waves and black holes, encouraging further exploration and innovation.

Abstract: Ten short years ago, we had the rare privilege of witnessing the onset of a renaissance in science: humanity finally succeeded in its arduous quest to directly detect gravitational waves. This breakthrough did not occur in a vacuum: it was the natural culmination of decades of research dedicated towards understanding the nature of gravitation based on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine. Coupled with our theoretical understanding of phenomena in the strong gravity regime, black hole physics has become a precision science. The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions. We provide first principles analysis of black hole and gravitational wave physics, and sometimes a very personal interpretation of results. We share with the readers a number of notebooks that will allow them to reproduce some of the most important results in the field, and could even help in carrying out state-of-the-art research. We also include a few original results that we think are helpful in understanding the broader picture.

Abstract: In our previous work [H. Zejli, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 34, 2550052 (2025), arXiv:2508.00035], we introduced a PT-symmetric wormhole model based on a bimetric geometry, capable of generating closed timelike curves (CTCs). In this paper, we extend the analysis to the null hypersurface at the throat of this modified Einstein-Rosen bridge, where two regular Eddington-Finkelstein metrics render the geometry traversable. Using the Barrabes--Israel formalism in Poisson's reformulation, we evaluate the null shell's surface stress-energy tensor $S^{αβ}$ from the jump of the transverse curvature, revealing a violation of the null energy condition: a lightlike membrane of exotic matter with negative surface energy density and positive tangential pressure. This exotic fluid acts as a repulsive source stabilizing the throat, ensuring consistency with the Einstein field equations, including conservation laws on the shell. Beyond the local characterization, we outline potential observational signatures: (i) gravitational-wave echoes from the photon-sphere cavity; (ii) horizon-scale imaging with duplicated and through-throat photon rings, and non-Kerr asymmetries; (iii) quantum effects such as PT-induced frequency pairing with possible QNM doublets and partial suppression of vacuum flux at the throat; and (iv) a relic cosmological population yielding an effective $Λ_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and seeding voids. Compared with timelike thin-shell constructions, our approach is based on a null junction interpreted as a lightlike membrane, combined with PT symmetry, providing a distinct route to traversability and clarifying the conditions under which CTCs can arise in a self-consistent framework.

Abstract: In this work, we consider generalized uncertainty principles (GUPs) that incorporate a minimal length through generic momentum-dependent deformation functions. We thus develop a systematic approach connecting such a framework to effective gravitational actions extending general relativity. By examining quantum gravity-motivated corrections to black hole entropy induced by the GUP and employing Wald's formalism, we reconstruct modifications to Einstein's gravity within the contexts of $f(R)$ and $f(R, R_{μν} R^{μν})$ theories. In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length. Our results show that GUP-induced effects can be consistently embedded into extended gravity theories, offering a promising framework for testing quantum gravity phenomenology through astrophysical and cosmological observations.

Result: 在不同设定下，R和G的演替显示出不同的行为，尤其是在接近奇点时的收敛性被成功模拟。

Conclusion: 提供了处理二维问题的可靠数值方法，适用于研究极端物理情景。

Abstract: We consider line elements of the form $-2G\,du\,(dx+B\,du) + R^2(...)$, where $(...)$ does not contain $dx$. Surfaces of constant $u$ are then null surfaces, and their affinely parameterised generators have tangent vector $G^{-1}\partial_x$. Considering $u$ as the time coordinate, we can evolve either $R$ or $G$, with the other one found by solving the Raychaudhuri equation along the null generators, or we can evolve both. This choice of formulation is independent from the remaining gauge choice $x\to x'(u,x,...)$ in the line element above, which is fixed incrementally by the choice of $B$. For example, we can evolve $G$, in order to be able to evolve through an event horizon, and use $B$ in to adapt the coordinates to type-II critical collapse. As a demonstration of these ideas, we consider a charged scalar field in spherical symmetry. We consider two settings: a domain where the outgoing null cones of constant $u$ emanate from a regular centre $R=0$, and a domain where the outgoing null cones emanating from an ingoing-null boundary. We demonstrate convergence with resolution, within each formulation and between the three formulations in both settings. As testbeds, we compute the critical exponents and periodic fine-structures of the black hole charge and mass scaling laws in a one-parameter family of charged regular initial data, and examples of perturbed extremal Reissner-Nordström solutions.

Abstract: In this article we study spherical thin-shell wormholes in five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We show that configurations supported by non-exotic matter, that is matter satisfying the weak energy condition, are possible at the same time that traversability problems associated with strong radial tides at the throat can be avoided when suitable values of the parameters are adopted. Our construction is performed in such a way that it also allows for the admissible behaviour of the geometry in the whole spacetime.

Abstract: Building upon previous work that derived an alternative to (galactic) dark matter in the form of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), with a specific theoretical interpolating function, from the motion of a non-relativistic test particle in the gravitational field of a point mass immersed in the non-relativistic static limit of the spin connection foam -- which represents the quantum analogue of Minkowski spacetime within precanonical quantum gravity -- we now show the consequences of using higher moments (third and fourth) of the corresponding geodesic equation with a random spin connection term. These higher moments lead to more general quantum modifications of the Newtonian potential (qMOND potentials expressed in terms of Gauss and Appell hypergeometric functions), more general (steeper) MOND interpolating functions, and a new modification of MOND at low accelerations (mMOND) that features an almost-flat asymptotic rotation curve $\propto r^{-1/18}$, which is expected to operate at approximately the same galactic scales as MOND.

Abstract: Dark energy perturbations are expected to modify the evolution of cosmological perturbations, producing observable effects on scalar perturbations and gravitational waves. We show that the effects of dark energy for a generic modified gravity model can be encoded in a momentum, space and polarization dependent effective matter-gravity coupling, in agreement with the results obtained in some specific theories, and that this is not just related to the effective Planck mass appearing in the action as a coefficient of the Ricci's scalar. Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations. The generality of this effective description of the effects of dark energy on cosmological perturbations gives a solid theoretical justification for the phenomenological approaches often used in the analysis of cosmological observations, allowing to understand the mapping between the results of phenomenological analysis of observational data and theoretical models. The momentum and polarization dependence of the effective gravitational coupling implies that the gravitational energy emitted by a binary coalescence can have an additional frequency and polarization dependence, due to the effects of dark energy perturbations.

As a result, we find four types of power-law solutions that are classified according to the number of non-vanishing vector fields. Moreover, we find that all these solutions are stable for certain conditions on the parameters (stability regions), which are described both quantitatively and qualitatively. The attractor property of these solutions is also confirmed by numerical calculations.

We demonstrate that this solution corresponds to the limit of a new black hole solution with torsion.

Abstract: We study the bound state solutions for the polar perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that for a given value of the spherical harmonic index $\ell$, there are a total of $\ell-1$ bound states for polar perturbations. We show both analytically and numerically that the spectrum of $\ell-2$ of these perturbations agrees identically with the spectrum of axial perturbations. Correspondingly, the isospectrality between the bound states of the axial and polar perturbations in the interior of the black hole does hold. This is significant since the effective potential is singular at the center of the black hole, and the existence of the isospectrality is far from obvious. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional mode found in the spectrum of polar perturbations is the algebraically special mode, which is the ground state of polar perturbations as well.

Conclusion: 这一研究表明，Warm 膨胀在四阶势下实现了平滑的、自然的穿越到辐射主导的 Universe，确认了 Four 的 graceful-exit 机制，并给出了具体的 reheating 温度。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the full nonlinear dynamics of warm inflation driven by the quartic inflaton potential, avoiding any simplifying approximations. The thermal backreaction is incorporated through a dissipation coefficient that depends linearly on the temperature, and the model parameters are chosen to remain consistent with Planck observational constraints. By numerically integrating the complete set of three coupled, nonlinear differential equations that describe the evolution of the inflaton field, radiation energy density, and background expansion, we obtain an exact description of the system's dynamics. Our results reveal that, while transition to radiation domination is suppressed in the weak regime, the strong dissipative regime leads to a smooth and natural transition to a hot, radiation-dominated Universe, thereby confirming graceful-exit within warm inflation in the quartic scenario. The reheating temperature is extracted directly from the nonlinear evolution of warm inflation, yielding a temperature of approximately 10^13 GeV at the end of inflation, which cools to about 10^12 GeV near radiation-inflaton equality, whence the Universe transitions into a radiation-dominated era.

Our results show that the values of these quantities increase with the black hole charge $Q$ and the screening parameter $γ$. We then plot various periodic orbits, characterized by the integers ($z$,$w$,$v$). Finally, we present the gravitational waveforms associated with extreme mass ratio inspirals, consisting of a stellar-mass compact object orbiting a supermassive black hole.

Abstract: The gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field remains a demanding benchmark for numerical methods in numerical relativity, as it exhibits critical behavior at the boundary between dispersion and black hole formation. In this work we revisit this problem by relying on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as flexible partial differential equations solvers thereby providing a comparative assessment of several recent neural architectures. Building on the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon formulation in polar-areal coordinates, we consider four initial-value problems encompassing subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and use high-resolution finite-difference simulations as reference solutions. Our study is primarily comparative: we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including vanilla and high-precision PINNs, sinusoidal-feature and quadratic-residual variants, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, all trained under a common loss design that encodes the field equations, boundary conditions, and causal time-space enforcement, together with a novel adaptive spacetime sampling. Within this framework we also introduce ModPINN, a modest modification of standard PINNs that augments standard multiplayer perceptrons with coordinate embeddings, quadratic layers among other common ingredients in recent literature. This study shows that deep-learning-based methods can reproduce finite-difference solutions for the scalar field and the spacetime metric with competitive accuracy using significantly fewer collocation points than more traditional methodologies. While no single architecture dominates in all regimes, ModPINN achieves particularly stable and accurate solutions near criticality, indicating that suitable designed embeddings and adaptive sampling can enhance the robustness of PINNs for challenging gravitational-collapse scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Standard measures of quantum non-Markovianity are usually defined in terms of dynamical maps on a preferred time foliation and therefore do not extend straightforwardly to curved spacetimes, where no global time coordinate exists and causal structure is primary. We develop a covariant framework for open quantum dynamics along arbitrary timelike worldlines by building multi-time quantum processes (process tensors) from overlapping causal diamonds. For an Unruh--DeWitt detector weakly coupled to a scalar field in a Hadamard state, we define a foliation-independent measure of non-Markovianity as the operational distance between the physical process tensor and the convex set of Markovian (CP-divisible) processes. Numerical benchmarks in $(1{+}1)$ dimensions compare inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and static and infalling trajectories in Schwarzschild spacetime. Inertial trajectories are found to be almost Markovian, whereas acceleration and curvature generate pronounced long-range temporal correlations and strong non-Markovian behaviour. In Rindler spacetime, acceleration produces horizon-induced memory tails. In Schwarzschild spacetime, near-horizon field correlations cause both static and freely falling observers to experience enhanced memory, which can remain hidden in single-step diagnostics but becomes evident in multi-time protocols and can even be superactivated by combining different time steps. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first coordinate-independent, operational quantification of quantum memory in relativistic settings. They identify spacetime curvature, horizons, and acceleration as controllable ingredients that can either degrade or be harnessed as resources in relativistic quantum information tasks, including communication and metrology with accelerated detectors and near black holes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Einstein was guided by the principle of general covariance in formulating general relativity, Kretschmann later argued that this principle lacks physical significance, since any space-time theory can be reformulated in a generally covariant form. This critique has prompted an ongoing debate over how to distinguish substantive general covariance from mere formal general covariance. Some proposals for defining substantive general covariance are based on the requirement that a theory be derivable from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. The present work aims to critically assess these proposals by examining canonical examples of Kretschmannian formulations of special relativistic theories. It will be shown that these formulations -- which seem merely formally generally covariant -- can always be derived from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. Although these actions involve auxiliary variables, these variables are trivial in the sense that they are either pure gauge or dynamically fixed by the other variables. Consequently, the theories described by these actions are arguably equivalent to the original Kretschmannian formulations. This stands in contrast to the actions proposed by Rosen and Sorkin, which include non-trivial auxiliary variables and hence seem to describe distinct physical theories. More recently, Freidel and Teh have suggested an additional criterion for substantial general covariance, namely that the action should also yield a non-trivial corner charge associated to diffeomorphism invariance. However, this too appears insufficient, since such actions can always be constructed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate and generalize Horndeski theories for multi-field scenarios, providing a framework that connects these theories to established equations.

Method: The authors introduce two axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and inclusion of the minimal Horndeski theory. Using these assumptions, they construct a general action for multi-field extensions.

Result: The authors successfully recover the standard single-field Horndeski action and identify that antisymmetric structures within Horndeski's theory can be extended. They also demonstrate that their multi-field framework can reproduce known bi-Horndeski equations.

Conclusion: The framework offers a systematic approach to constructing multi-field Horndeski-like theories, aligning with known results and extensions of existing equations.

Abstract: In the single-field case, Horndeski provides the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations. By contrast, systematic multi-field extensions remain incomplete: while the general field equations for the bi-Horndeski case are known, a general action has not been established, and for cases with three or more fields, neither a general action nor general equations are available. We characterize Horndeski by two mild axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and the requirement that the theory includes the minimal Horndeski theory. Under this characterization, we recover the standard single-field action up to boundary terms and obtain a practical path to multi-field constructions. In particular, we show that antisymmetric structures, such as those identified by Allys, Akama, and Kobayashi, appear within this framework, and indicate that this viewpoint has the potential to account for features captured by known bi-Horndeski equations.

### [114] [Detectability of axion-like dark matter for different time-delay interferometry combinations in space-based gravitational wave detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15438)
*Yong-Yong Liu,Jing-Rui Zhang,Ming-Hui Du,He-Shan Liu,Peng Xu,Yun-Long Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the potential of space-based gravitational wave detectors to detect axion-like dark matter by analyzing the polarization effects of lasers used in these detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the use of space-based gravitational wave detectors as a method for detecting axion-like dark matter, which remains one of the leading candidates for explaining dark matter's mysterious nature.

Method: The authors employ a theoretical approach, considering the birefringence effect on laser polarization caused by axion-like dark matter within a space-based interferometer setup. They analyze three different interferometry combinations: Monitor, Beacon, and Relay, evaluating their respective sensitivities across various frequency ranges.

Result: The study reveals that the Monitor and Beacon combinations exhibit enhanced sensitivity in the high-frequency range, reaching an optimal sensitivity of approximately $10^{-13}	ext{GeV}^{-1}$. Conversely, the Sagnac combination shows superior sensitivity in the low-frequency range. Furthermore, the detector ASTROD-GW identifies a wide detection range for axion-like dark matter masses, as low as $10^{-20}	ext{eV}$.

Conclusion: The research contributes to the understanding of how space-based gravitational wave detectors can be utilized to detect axion-like dark matter, providing insights into the effectiveness of different interferometry setups across various frequency bands.

Abstract: In the space-based gravitational wave detections, the axion-like dark matter would alter the polarization state of the laser link between spacecrafts due to the birefringence effect. However, current designs of space-based laser interferometer are insensitive to variations in the polarization angle. Thus, the additional wave plates are employed to enable the response of the axion-induced birefringence effect. We calculate and compare the sensitivities of different space-based detectors, accounting for three time-delay interferometry combinations, including Monitor, Beacon, and Relay. We find that the Monitor and Beacon combinations have better sensitivity in the high-frequency range, and the optimal sensitivity reaches $g_{aγ}\sim 10^{-13}\text{GeV}^{-1}$, while the Sagnac combination is superior in the low-frequency range. We also find that ASTROD-GW can cover the detection range of axion-like dark matter mass down to $10^{-20}\text{eV}$.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide an analytical model for the formation of stable structures (cosmological or astrophysical), where stability is obtained through the tangential pressure countering the effect of gravity. We utilize the generalization of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) spacetime to matter with tangential pressure generated by the angular momentum of fluid particles. Extending the Krasiński-Hellaby (KH) LTB reconstruction method, we show how set of three functions defined on two arbitrary hypersurfaces can fully determine the spacetime geometry. We further restrict our attention to the bounded case and develop the weak-field and the small-angular-momentum approximations. We show how these can be applied to the exact solution on the initial hypersurface, together with the oscillatory solution on the final hypersurface, to considerably simplify the reconstruction scheme. The so obtained models exhibit explicit dust-like behaviour in the early and middle stages of the collapse, and reach the final state as oscillations around the static solution.

Abstract: We study the effect on the primordial tensor power spectrum of varying the number of e-folds during slow-roll inflation in Loop Quantum Cosmology with a Starobinsky potential. Using the hybrid quantization approach, we derive the effective mass governing tensor mode evolution. The choice of vacuum state is crucial, especially since the preinflationary phase predicted by Loop Quantum Cosmology invalidates the choice of the Bunch-Davies state as the preferred vacuum. We adopt a choice which is optimally adapted to the dynamics, so that it provides a non-oscillating (NO) spectrum free of spurious contributions, and permits an asymptotic Hamiltonian diagonalization (AHD) of the perturbations. For this so-called NO-AHD vacuum, we compute the power spectrum using both analytic approximations and numerical integration. Our results confirm the accuracy of our approximations in a wide range of situations, including short- and long-lived inflationary scenarios. The primordial power spectrum exhibits a characteristic cutoff on a wavenumber scale determined primarily by the background dynamics around the bounce that replaces the big bang in Loop Quantum Cosmology.

### [117] [An Analytical Formula for Gravitational Faraday Rotation in the ADM Split of Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15639)
*Mark T. Lusk*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: An analytical expression for gravitational Faraday rotation (GFR) is derived for Eulerian observers in the Kerr spacetime using a Fermi-Walker triad aligned with the spatial wave vector. The result is shown to be consistent with numerical predictions and offers a new perspective on Faraday rotation by enabling comparisons between experimental data and analytical predictions. The approach avoids mathematical singularities at the ergosphere in the threading decomposition, making physically intuitive coordinates useful for studying GFR predictions for light transits through the ergosphere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational Faraday rotation is an important phenomenon in general relativity, and deriving an analytical expression for its rate is crucial for understanding and predicting its behavior in different spacetime geometries.

Method: The method involves using a Fermi-Walker triad aligned with the spatial wave vector in the context of the ADM split of Kerr spacetime and geometric optics. The analysis avoids mathematical singularities at the ergosphere in the threading decomposition, and the derived formula is implemented and verified against numerical predictions.

Result: The derived formula for GFR is consistent with numerical predictions and provides a new perspective on Faraday rotation by enabling comparisons between experimental data and analytical predictions. The approach also avoids mathematical singularities at the ergosphere in the threading decomposition, making physically intuitive coordinates useful for studying GFR predictions for light transits through the ergosphere.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advance in the analytical understanding of gravitational Faraday rotation in the Kerr spacetime. The results not only confirm the consistency of the theoretical framework but also open up new avenues for experimental validation and further theoretical exploration.

Abstract: An analytical expression is derived for the rate of gravitational Faraday rotation measured by Eulerian observers. The reference frame is a Fermi-Walker triad aligned with the spatial wave vector. Attention is restricted to the ADM split of Kerr spacetime and geometric optics. Our exact, closed-form GFR formula is implemented and verified to be consistent with numerical predictions. The approach offers a new perspective on Faraday rotation, and it allows a single Eulerian observer to compare experimentally measured polarization holonomy with analytical prediction. Sliced spacetime does not suffer from a mathematical singularity at the ergosphere associated with Boyer-Lindquist coordinates in the threading decomposition. These physically intuitive coordinates can therefore be used to analytically produce and study GFR predictions for transits of light that pierce the ergosphere.

Abstract: We present a categorical formulation of the Hamiltonian renormalisation programme for quantum field theories, establishing a systematic bridge between functional and lattice renormalisation. To this end, we introduce two categories, $Seq$ and $Func$, whose objects correspond to resolution spaces at different ultraviolet scales, and whose morphisms encode embeddings, projections, coarse-graining maps, and discrete derivatives.
  Focusing on Dirichlet-type embeddings, we construct the corresponding subcategories $Seq_D$, $Func_D$ and prove that the embedding and its adjoint define functors between them.
  Furthermore we revisit and extend the analysis of the convergence rate to the fixed point for the couplings of the $U(1)^3$ model for $3+1$ Euclidean quantum gravity, analysing different combinations of Haar and Dirichlet embeddings.

*D. A. Cook,A. Olimpieri,I. P. R. Baranov,H. A. Borges,S. Carneiro*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of polymer models in describing quantum gravity effects near the initial singularity, leading to a bouncing universe instead of a singularity. The authors explore anisotropic models under the Gambini-Bénitez-Pullin polymerisation and use the Loop Quantum Gravity area gap to find the bouncing radius and curvature. The pressures are negative enough to avoid singularities, and the solution exhibits oscillatory behavior. A positive cosmological constant ensures an eternal expansion to a late de Sitter phase. The paper also examines a Bianchi III metric, which avoids collapse despite different spatial curvature properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum gravity effects near the Big Bang and the mechanisms of cosmological bounces are fundamental to exploring the early universe's evolution and the nature of singularities.

Method: Mathematical modeling of anisotropic polymerization schemes under specific space-time symmetries, incorporating Loop Quantum Gravity constraints.

Result: Bounce solutions exist under certain conditions, avoiding singularities with oscillatory expansion, with cosmological implications affecting the late-time universe's structure.

Conclusion: This framework provides a novel approach to studying quantum gravitational effects on early universe dynamics, with implications for inflationary models and late-time cosmic acceleration.

Abstract: Polymer models are effective in describing quantum gravity effects around the initial singularity, leading to its replacement by bouncing surfaces on which the curvature and densities are finite. Their properties depend on the space-time symmetry and on the particular polymerisation scheme adopted. In this article we investigate anisotropic models under the Gambini-Benítez-Pullin polymerisation, recently used to quantise spherically symmetric black-holes, whose interiors are isometric to Kantowski-Sachs (KS) space-times. Demanding that the minimum area defined by the bouncing surface matches the Loop Quantum Gravity area gap, we can find its radius alongside the curvature and effective density and pressures at the bounce. The density is always positive, while the pressures are negative enough to avoid the singularity. Due to the positive spatial curvature, the solution is oscillatory, reaching a maximum radius where a re-collapse occurs. Therefore, a positive cosmological constant is included in order to have an eternal expansion to a late de Sitter phase. We have also considered a Bianchi III metric, showing that the bounce is still present, but the space-time is asymptotically flat in this case, with no re-collapse. In this hyperbolic space, the minimal area constraint can also be imposed on compact $2$-surfaces. Nevertheless, in contrast to the KS case, it is enough for avoiding the singularity, independently of polymerisation procedures.

Abstract: By employing singles, doubles, and triples excitations within the relativistic coupled-cluster framework, we perform comprehensive calculations of a wide range of atomic properties for the Th$^{3+}$ ion. These properties are essential for advancing nuclear clock technology and probing fundamental physics. Combining our isotope shift parameters with experimental data, we estimate highly accurate values of the differential nuclear charge radii for $^{232,229}$Th and $^{229m,229}$Th. Additionally, we determine the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments for both the ground and isomeric states of $^{229}$Th by combining measured hyperfine structure constants with our theoretical calculations. Our precise evaluations of electric dipole polarizabilities and hyperfine-induced quadrupole moments are critical for assessing systematic uncertainties in $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$-based nuclear clock. Notably, we observe unexpectedly significant contributions from higher-order relativistic effects and excitations involving orbitals with higher angular momentum, which markedly influence the energies of the ground state and its fine-structure partner. These results highlight the substantial challenges in achieving highly accurate predictions for these properties.

Abstract: An extensive analysis of the spectrum of neutral manganese has been performed using spectra of manganese-neon and manganese-argon hollow cathode discharges measured using high resolution Fourier transform (FT) and grating spectroscopy over the range 151 - 5112 nm (1956 - 65876 cm-1). Wavelengths for 10426 spectral lines were extracted from the FT spectra, with uncertainties at least an order-of-magnitude lower than previous measurements. Wavelengths for 13397 lines from new grating spectra were determined for spectral regions beyond the FT spectra range or to provide wavelengths for weak transitions not observed in FT spectra. To aid in level identification, selected, previously published grating lines were included in the energy level optimisation, but no levels in this work relied solely on previously published wavelengths. In total, 24237 lines were included in the final spectral linelist, and these were used to identify 2186 Mn I transitions. These classified spectral lines were then used to optimise the values of 384 previously published energy levels of Mn I, with typical uncertainties of a few 10-3 cm-1, again typically an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy. Our study then expanded the known energy level structure of Mn I through the establishment of 18 new energy levels, reported here for the first time. In total, 2187 lines and 402 energy levels of Mn I have been determined as a result of our work, marking a substantial advance in the precision of Mn I atomic data which will enable far more accurate analyses of Mn I lines in astrophysical spectra.
  Please note: The final wavelength and energy level datasets are withheld from this pre-print to ensure that only the peer-reviewed, definitive versions are released. This approach prevents the propagation of duplicate or inconsistent data across widely used atomic databases and modelling frameworks.

Abstract: The design and performance of future fusion power plants will depend on accurate atomic data for plasma-facing material and plasma impurity species. A leading candidate for the plasma-facing material is tungsten due to its high melting point, however, the energy levels and wavefunctions of high-Z atoms with many electrons (e.g. 30 or more), including tungsten, are difficult to calculate with high accuracy. Gaps and large uncertainties in atomic data for tungsten introduce design and performance uncertainties for a fusion power plant. Specifically, improved atomic data for ionization potential, excited state energies, and collisional excitation rates are needed for the low charge states of atomic tungsten. We aim to address these shortcomings by using the semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (SHCI) method, which nearly exactly calculates the energies that can be determined at higher cost with the full configuration interaction. Adding well-motivated approximations to SHCI, including orbital optimization and effective core potentials, we demonstrate good agreement between our calculated first ionization potentials and the best available experimental values for chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. The efficiency and accuracy achieved in calculating these ionization potentials demonstrates that our SHCI workflow can yield improved electron structure data for ions with many electrons, suggesting that the method could also be useful for collisional processes, such as state-selective charge exchange reactions and electron impact ionization.

Motivation: Understanding molecular ions' spectroscopic properties and lifetimes is crucial for testing molecular theories and models in high-precision physics.

Method: Relativistic coupled cluster method with advanced basis sets was employed for calculations of structural parameters, followed by extrapolation and vibrational analysis using Schrödinger equation and transition rates.

Result: The vibrational states' lifetimes are significantly extended by radiative processes, with CdH⁺ and HgH⁺ having shorter lifetimes compared to YbH⁺.

Conclusion: The results validate the models and provide valuable data for further theoretical and experimental studies in molecular physics.

Abstract: The present work reports the spectroscopic parameters and molecular properties for the ground electronic state, $^1Σ^+$, of CdH$^+$, HgH$^{+}$, and YbH$^{+}$ molecular ions. We have used the state-of-the-art relativistic coupled cluster method together with the relativistic core-valence triple- and quadruple zeta quality basis sets for the calculation of structural parameters. The computed results have been extrapolated to the complete basis set limit using a two-point polynomial fit. The reliability of the results has been confirmed by their remarkable agreement with existing experimental and theoretical values. Further, we have calculated the relevant vibrational parameters by solving the vibrational Schrödinger equation using the potential energy curve and the permanent dipole moment curve of the electronic ground state. Subsequently, the lifetimes of the vibrational states have been determined by calculating the spontaneous and black-body radiation (BBR) induced transition rates. At room temperature, the lifetimes of the lowest ro-vibrational state ($v$ = \(0\), $J$ = \(0\)) due to BBR-induced transitions are estimated to be \(98.48\)\,s for CdH$^+$, \(204.85\)\,s for HgH$^+$, and \(1250.28\)\,s for YbH$^+$. Additionally, the rotational energies within each vibrational state are also calculated in this work.

Abstract: The burst approximation is a widely-used technique to simplify stochastic gene expression models. However, both analytical results and efficient algorithms are currently unavailable for general models under the burst approximation. In this article, we systematically analyze surrogate models with multiple gene states. Analytical solution to the chemical master equation is provided, which is further exploited from two perspectives. Theoretically, several inequalities are established using functional analysis. We conclude that the steady-state distribution of protein copy number is bounded from above by a constant multiple of some negative binomial distribution if the burst size is geometrically distributed. Computationally, efficient algorithms are developed under three circumstances based on the standard binomial moment method.

Abstract: Quantifying the collision risk of birds and bats with offshore wind turbines requires an understanding of the drivers of flying animal behavior at offshore wind sites. An omnidirectional S-band radar system was deployed on a research barge on the Northeastern Shelf of the United States (40.9 deg N, 70.79 deg W) and collected data for a 5-week window during the 2024 autumn bird and bat migration. The barge also sup- ported two profiling lidar systems that measured the wind speed and direction. This study presents a first methodological approach for analyzing radar and lidar data together, providing a framework for future analyses of offshore bird and bat movements that can be used to improve collision risk models. Coupling the radar animal tracks with measured wind speed profiles revealed that wind is a driver of animal pres- ence, flight direction, flight height, and flight speed. Further, a hierarchical clustering methodology was developed to investigate behavior by approximate animal size. For example, smaller animals had con- centrated flight direction distributions aligned with the wind and flew at a variety of altitudes, whereas bigger animals flew in a wide variety of directions but were concentrated at low altitudes. Our results provide the first insights into animal behavior at offshore wind sites with paired radar and lidar data.
