In this\nwork, we present a general framework for studying the complexity of circuits in\ngeneric Lie groups, where penalty factors assign relative weights to different\ngenerators. Our approach constructs a metric on the coset space of quantum\nstates, induced from a (pseudo-)Riemannian norm on the space of unitary\ncircuits.

The\nmethod builds on the formalism of (pseudo-)Riemannian submersions and connects\nnaturally to other prescriptions in the literature, including cost function\nminimization along stabilizer directions and constructions based on coadjoint\norbits. As a concrete application, we compute state complexity for states in\none- and two-dimensional CFTs.

In this work we will demonstrate a method\nutilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble\nof cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin\nsystem Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are\nable to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to\nexplore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales.

While much progress has been made toward the realization of a\nfully digital, scalable, and fault tolerant quantum computer, there are still\nmany essential challenges to overcome. In the interim, direct emulation of\nquantum systems of interest can fill an important gap not only for exploring\nfundamental questions about many-body physics and the quantum to classical\ntransition, but also for potentially providing alternative methods to verify\nresults from quantum simulations. In this work we will demonstrate a method\nutilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble\nof cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin\nsystem Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are\nable to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to\nexplore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales. Moreover,\ncontrolling the number of atoms in the collective spin can potentially allow us\nto investigate these dynamics in the transition from fully quantum to the\nclassical limit. In particular, we emulate two models: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick\n(LMG) Hamiltonian, and a closely related model, the Kicked Top. In the former\ncase, we show that our system undergoes a symmetry-breaking phase transition in\nthe expected parameter regime. In the latter, we explore two interesting\naspects: the formation of chaos, and a dynamically driven time crystal phase.\nWe will then discuss the advantages and limits of this approach."}

In this work, we\ndemonstrate that linear-signal analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying\nbiases, allowing for detailed explorations that are computationally too\nexpensive for traditional Bayesian injection and recovery approaches.

Based on this idea Bell constructed an inequality whereby\nexperimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and\nlocal-realistic theories. Many experiments have since been done that are\nconsistent with quantum mechanics, disproving the concept of local realism. But\nall these tests suffered from loopholes allowing a local-realistic explanation\nof the experimental observations. In this context, of special interest is\nentanglement between different quantum objects like atoms and photons, because\nit allows one to entangle distant atoms by the interference of photons. The\nresulting space-like separation together with the almost perfect detection\nefficiency of the atoms will allow a first event-ready Bell test closing\ndetection and locality loopholes.\n  The primary goal of the present thesis was the experimental realization of\nentanglement between a single localized atom and a single spontaneously emitted\nphoton. In the experiment a single optically trapped R87 atom is excited to a\nstate which has two selected decay channels. In the following spontaneous decay\na photon is emitted coherently with equal probability into both decay channels.\nThis accounts for perfect correlations between the polarization state of the\nemitted photon and the Zeeman state of the atom after spontaneous decay.\nBecause these decay channels are spectrally and in all other degrees of freedom\nindistinguishable, the spin state of the atom is entangled with the\npolarization state of the photon. To verify entanglement, appropriate\ncorrelation measurements in complementary bases of the photon polarization and\nthe internal quantum state of the atom were performed. It is shown, that the\ngenerated atom-photon state yields an entanglement fidelity of 0.82."}

To probe new formulations within the Richardson-Gaudin class,\nwe develop a high-performance numerical solver. The Bethe roots are encoded in\nthe Baxter polynomial, with initial estimates obtained from a secular matrix\neigenproblem and subsequently refined using a deflation-assisted hybrid\nNewton-Raphson/Laguerre algorithm. The solver proves effective in practical\napplications: when applied to picket-fence, harmonic oscillator, and\nhydrogen-like spectra, it accurately reproduces known rapidity trajectories and\nreveals consistent merging and branching patterns of arcs in the complex\nrapidity plane. We also explain how to generalize our computational approach to\nfinite temperatures, allowing us to calculate temperature-dependent pairing\nenergies and other thermodynamic observables directly within the discrete\nRichardson model.

In this\napproach, the Bethe ansatz equations for these exactly solvable models are\nembedded within two-dimensional Virasoro CFT via irregular, degenerate\nconformal blocks. To probe new formulations within the Richardson-Gaudin class,\nwe develop a high-performance numerical solver. The Bethe roots are encoded in\nthe Baxter polynomial, with initial estimates obtained from a secular matrix\neigenproblem and subsequently refined using a deflation-assisted hybrid\nNewton-Raphson/Laguerre algorithm. The solver proves effective in practical\napplications: when applied to picket-fence, harmonic oscillator, and\nhydrogen-like spectra, it accurately reproduces known rapidity trajectories and\nreveals consistent merging and branching patterns of arcs in the complex\nrapidity plane. We also explain how to generalize our computational approach to\nfinite temperatures, allowing us to calculate temperature-dependent pairing\nenergies and other thermodynamic observables directly within the discrete\nRichardson model. We propose an application of the solver to Gaudin-type Bethe\nequations, which emerge in the classical (large central charge) limit of\nVirasoro conformal blocks.
