Likewise, active space selection is a key to\nunlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry.\nAlbeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully\nautomated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a\nwide range of molecular systems.\n  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic\nValence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy\nanalysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of\nchemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme\nenables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while\nretaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of\nmolecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of\nRu(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation\nand structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due\nto the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate\nelectronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can\nreliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the\nessential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum\ncomputational frameworks.\n  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive\nto use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and\nquantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research\ncommunity."}

Our study focuses on the quantum approximate\noptimization algorithm (QAOA) -- a prominent variational quantum algorithm\ndesigned to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We investigate if\ncircuit overparametrization is necessary and sufficient to solve such problems\nin QAOA, considering two representative problems -- MAX-CUT and MAX-2-SAT. For\nMAX-CUT we observe that overparametriation is both sufficient and\n(statistically) necessary for attaining exact solutions, as confirmed\nnumerically for up to $20$ qubits. In fact, for MAX-CUT on 2-regular graphs we\nshow the necessity to be exact, based on the analytically found optimal depth.\nIn sharp contrast, for MAX-2-SAT, underparametrized circuits suffice to solve\nmost instances. This result highlights the potential of QAOA in the\nunderparametrized regime, supporting its utility for current noisy devices."}

The framework integrates\nphysics-based models of spacecraft photovoltaic generation, precise orbital\ngeometries, time-dependent link availability and slant-range variations,\ncoherent beam propagation (including transmitter aperture diameter, beam\nquality factor, path losses, and pointing jitter), and photonic-to-electrical\nconversion at the lunar surface. Particular emphasis is placed on phased-array\ntransmitter systems, whose large effective apertures significantly reduce beam\ndivergence relative to single-aperture designs, resulting in\norders-of-magnitude increases in delivered surface power under equivalent\norbital and power conditions. Parametric sensitivity analyses and illustrative\nnumerical simulations demonstrate how phased-array architectures improve power\ndensity and end-to-end efficiency at operational lunar distances. The study\nalso examines advanced orbital configurations (e.g., Near-Rectilinear Halo\nOrbits, Earth-Moon Lagrange points), real-time adaptive beam steering and\nwavefront control, optimized receiver geometries, and thermal/dust mitigation\nstrategies. The results establish a clear pathway toward scalable, efficient\nlaser power beaming infrastructures capable of overcoming lunar-specific\nchallenges - including prolonged darkness and permanently shadowed regions -\nand enabling sustained robotic and crewed surface operations."}

We show how ionization rates oscillate with oscillations of\nenvelope reflecting modulation of the population of the excited molecular\norbital. We observe the increase in ionization due to mechanisms analogous to\nCharge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) and also uncover also the time\nperiods of suppressed ionization. Electronic flux calculations illustrate these\nchanges and help reveal multiple ionization bursts which are for the first time\nreported for a multielectron non-stretched/ non-dissociating molecule.\nFurthermore, we discuss the effects of ultrafast intense laser pulses on the\nbonding properties of a nitrogen molecular ion in these conditions through\ndetailed analysis of electron density and electron density differences,\ntime-dependent average local energy, and time-dependent electron localization\nfunction. We illustrate the main characteristics of changes of the electron\ndensity that leads to laser induced dynamics of bonding and how the standard\ncriteria lead to the transient properties of double, triple, and lone pair\nbonding characteristics."}

Since the seed laser for high-power laser system has a\nlarge influence on the overall noise characteristics, the use of the lowest\nnoise seed laser is beneficial. This study compares a newly developed seed\nlaser, based on a non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO) design, at a wavelength of\n1064 nm with two commercial NPROs and shows that the new laser exhibits ten\ntimes lower power and frequency noise. This noise advantage is retained even\nafter subsequent amplification to 40 W."}

Likewise, active space selection is a key to\nunlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry.\nAlbeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully\nautomated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a\nwide range of molecular systems.\n  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic\nValence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy\nanalysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of\nchemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme\nenables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while\nretaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of\nmolecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of\nRu(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation\nand structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due\nto the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate\nelectronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can\nreliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the\nessential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum\ncomputational frameworks.\n  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive\nto use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and\nquantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research\ncommunity."}

Of particular interest are traveling wave\nsetups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the\nconceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it\ndifficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety\nof constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method\nwhich automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous\nparameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the\nsimplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply\nit to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency\ndemultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed\nanalytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable\nconstruction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections\nbetween the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The\nresulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including\nmicrowave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to\nextensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired\nproperties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions."}

However, QKMs generically suffer from\nexponential concentration, requiring an exponential number of measurements to\nresolve the kernel values, with the exception of trivial (i.e., classically\nsimulable) kernels. Here we propose a QKM that is free of exponential\nconcentration, yet remains hard to simulate classically. Our QKM utilizes the\nweak ergodicity-breaking many-body dynamics in the Rydberg blockade of\ncoherently driven neutral atom arrays. We demonstrate the fundamental\nproperties of our QKM by analytically solving an approximate toy model of its\nunderpinning quantum dynamics, as well as by extensive numerical simulations on\nrandomly generated datasets. We further show that the proposed kernel exhibits\neffective learning on real data. The proposed QKM can be implemented in current\nneutral atom quantum computers."}

We\nanalyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS\nwith point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a\nsingle class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the\ngauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly\ninaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore,\nwe develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this\neffect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need\nfor gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational\nPEPS in general settings."}
