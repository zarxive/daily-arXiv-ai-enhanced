### [1] [Dual-Functional Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles with Antioxidant and DNase I activities to Prevent and degrade Neutrophil Extracellular Traps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04693)

Motivation: 研究免疫血小板相关血栓性疾病中的中性粒细胞外分泌游离氧化应答具有重要意义。

Method: 通过设计双功能性CeO2纳米粒子结合人可降解DNA，研究其在清除和抑制NETs中的作用。

Result: 实验表明，双功能性纳米粒子能够高效地清除中性粒细胞进入的游离氧化应答，并有效抑制NETs的形成。

Conclusion: 该研究为NETs相关血栓性疾病提供了有效的治疗策略。

Abstract: Neutrophils play a central role in immunothrombosis through the formation of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a process known as NETosis. Upon
stimulation, neutrophils release decondensed chromatin structures enriched with
proteolytic enzymes, which contribute to thrombus formation. NETosis is
critically dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS), making redox regulation
a key point of intervention. The intrinsic redox cycling of cerium oxide
nanoparticles (CNPs) imparts self-regenerating antioxidant properties suitable
for modulating neutrophil-driven oxidative stress. To address both the
prevention and clearance of NETs, we developed dual-functional CNPs conjugated
with DNase I. These engineered nanoparticles were efficiently internalized by
neutrophils, reduced intracellular ROS levels, and inhibited NETs formation. In
addition, DNase I-functionalized CNPs degraded pre-formed NETs. This
dual-action strategy offers a promising nanotherapeutic platform for mitigating
NETs-associated thrombotic pathologies. Ongoing studies aim to enhance thrombus
targeting and assess in vivo efficacy.

### [2] [Glassy dynamics in active epithelia emerge from an interplay of mechano-chemical feedback and crowding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05469)
*Sindhu Muthukrishnan,Phanindra Dewan,Tanishq Tejaswi,Michelle B Sebastian,Tanya Chhabra,Soumyadeep Mondal,Soumitra Kolya,Saroj Kumar Nandi,Sumantra Sarkar,Medhavi Vishwakarma*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the emergence of glassy dynamics in active biological cells. Despite common intuition that cellular activity would hinder glass formation, the study demonstrates that when combined with a mechanochemical feedback loop (MCFL), glass-like traits can indeed form under sufficiently high activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the conditions under which glassy dynamics emerge in active biological systems has implications for fields ranging from material science to cellular biology.

Method: The research combines experimental observations with an active vertex model, incorporating mecanochemical feedback loops (MCFL) to simulate cell behavior and interactions.

Result: The findings reveal that glassy dynamics are influenced by both crowding and active feedback loops. A high strength of MCFL is required to drive glass transitions in dense tissues, contradicting the initial assumption that high activity would inhibit such dynamics. The model also explains how collective mechanical and biochemical oscillations arise from the interplay of two MCFLs.

Conclusion: This study significantly advances our understanding of how active feedback loops and mechanostatic properties can sustain complex dynamic behavior in cells, challenging conventional views on the relationship between activity and glass formation.

Abstract: Glassy dynamics in active biological cells remain a subject of debate, as
cellular activity rarely slows enough for true glassy features to emerge. In
this study, we address this paradox of glassy dynamics in epithelial cells by
integrating experimental observations with an active vertex model. We
demonstrate that while crowding is essential, it is not sufficient for glassy
dynamics to emerge. A mechanochemical feedback loop (MCFL), mediated by cell
shape changes through the contractile actomyosin network, is also required to
drive glass transition in dense epithelial tissues, as revealed via a crosstalk
between actin-based cell clustering and dynamic heterogeneity in the
experiments. Incorporating the MCFL into the vertex model reveals that glassy
dynamics can emerge even at high cellular activity if the strength of the MCFL
remains high. We show that the MCFL can counteract cell division-induced
fluidisation and enable glassy dynamics to emerge through active cell-to-cell
communication. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the existence of novel
collective mechanochemical oscillations that arise from the crosstalk of two
MCFLs. Together, we demonstrate that an interplay between crowding and active
mechanochemical feedback enables the emergence of glass-like traits and
collective biochemical oscillations in epithelial tissues with active cell-cell
contacts.

### [3] [Three-dimensional imaging of threading dislocations in GaN by multimodal stimulated Raman scattering microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04915)

Method: 通过多模式 3D-Stokes 光散射与 MPPL 显微镜的结合，利用光散射强度和 Raman 光谱峰的位置信息实现 TDs 的精确表征。

Result: 新型表征方法显著提高了检测 TDs 的速度和精度，能够三维重建 TDs 的分布和结构特征。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发高质量 GaN 晶体和高性能 GaN 设备提供了新工具，推荐在 GaN 器件设计中广泛应用。

Abstract: Emerging gallium nitride (GaN) vertical power devices require high-quality
GaN crystals with reduced crystal defects, especially threading dislocations
(TDs), to harness the high critical electric field and electron mobility of the
material. A strong demand for characterizing TDs has driven the development of
many imaging techniques, such as multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MPPL)
microscopy and spontaneous Raman microscopy. However, all these techniques lack
the capability of visualizing densely existing TDs in a non-destructive and
three-dimensional (3D) way or distinguishing the types of TDs. Here, we propose
multimodal 3D stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and MPPL microscopy to
non-destructively characterize the TDs in free-standing GaN substrates.
Leveraging strong SRS signals, we achieve an imaging speed 10^2-10^3 times
faster than that of spontaneous Raman microscopy. This acceleration of the
imaging speed enables 3D SRS imaging of the strain fields that are induced by
TDs and correlated with the edge components of the Burgers vectors. Multimodal
3D SRS and MPPL imaging reveals rich information on TD features and behavior,
including propagation directions, Burgers vectors, dislocation reactions, and
their relationships. Furthermore, we present a deterministic identification
method for screw-type TDs, which are regarded as killer defects causing leakage
current in p-n junctions, by exploiting no SRS peak shifts at screw
dislocations in combination with MPPL patterns. Our multimodal imaging
technique will greatly advance the understanding of dislocations toward
realizing high-quality GaN crystals and high-performance GaN devices.

Abstract: This work reports the demonstration of lateral p-NiOx/p-GaN/n-GaN-based
super-heterojunction (SHJ) diodes using p-GaN with additional sputtered p-type
nickel oxide (NiOx) layers to realize charge-balanced structures. The
heterojunction diode capacitance-voltage (C-V) model is applied to extract
effective the acceptor concentration from the p-NiOx. Net donor and acceptor
concentration in n-GaN and p-GaN are extracted by using
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) test structures. The fabricated
p-NiOx/p-GaN/n-GaN SHJ diodes with charge-balanced region between anode and
cathode exhibit a forward on-state current density of 10-30 mA/mm across an
anode-to-cathode distance (LAC) from 16 {\mu}m to 80 {\mu}m. The SHJ diodes
show rectifying behavior with a maximum on/off ratio of 10^9 and a low reverse
leakage density. The highest breakdown voltage achieved for the SHJ diodes is
~2.8 kV with reverse leakage density of 10^-4 mA/mm at ~80% of devices
catastrophic breakdown voltage. The SHJ diodes across all types of dimensions
exhibit significant breakdown voltage improvements (~6X on average) with
ultra-low reverse leakage current compared to corresponding reference
structures without a charge-balanced extension, clearly demonstrating the
superjunction effect for devices fabricated on GaN epitaxial layer with ~10^17
cm^-3 electron density.

Result: 实验结果表明，当基区宽度为0.17nm，发射极电压为0.01925V，集电极电压为0.2124V时，达到最大温度差242.89K；当基区宽度限制在10nm时，仍可获得174.15K的最大温度差。

Conclusion: 该研究证实，结合热电效应与晶体管技术的热电晶体管可以显著提升传统热电冷却装置的温度差性能。

Abstract: To achieve high performance thermoelectric materials and devices,
thermoelectric transistors, which integrate thermoelectric effects with
transistor technology, represent a promising approach. Here p type
Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and n type Bi2Te2.97Se0.03 are used as the constituent materials
for an NPN transistor. By applying forward bias to the emitter and reverse bias
to the collector to form a common-base triode configuration, the thermoelectric
effect, transistor effect, and interfacial effects within the NPN
heterostructure are coupled. This NPN heterostructure induces temperature
increase (heat release) at the forward biased end and temperature decrease
(heat absorption) at the reverse biased end. Therefore, this device becomes a
new type of thermoelectric transistor cooler. Furthermore, a DC equivalent
circuit method is introduced to analyze the cooling performance of the
thermoelectric transistor cooler. The results show that when the emitter
voltage of the NPN thermoelectric transistor cooler is 0.01925V, the collector
voltage is 0.2124V, the corresponding base region width is 0.17nm, the maximum
temperature difference of 242.89K can be obtained. Even if the base region
width is limited to a level of 10 nanometers, for example when the base region
width is 12.78nm, the maximum temperature differenced can still reach 174.15K.
The research results above indicate that the thermoelectric transistor, which
synergistically combines the thermoelectric effect with transistor technology,
can effectively enhance the maximum temperature difference that typical
thermoelectric cooling can achieve.

Motivation: 理解量子系统从可积分到完全无序行为的过渡是物理学中的核心问题，SYK模型在许多体混沌与 holography领域具有示范性作用。然而，它仅在强关联极限下描述，并未探讨介于两者之间的中间区域。本研究通过Yukawa-SYK模型，填补了这一空白。

Method: 研究使用了谱和动力学的混沌标记者，对YSYK模型进行了有限大小的全面表征。通过调整相互作用强度，研究发现该参数能够调节模型从SYK₂到SYK₄限的转变，并提供了一个与基准模型直接比较的框架。

Result: 研究揭示了在中间强度下，YSYK模型表现出不同的动力学阶段，包括部分遍历性破坏、预热阶段 plateau和不完全的(combining)。此外，研究还提出了一种使用超冷原子在光腔中实现YSYK模型的实验方法。

Conclusion: YSYK模型作为一种连接单粒子和许多体混沌的统一平台，为两者现象的实验观察提供了可能。这一步研究为理解介于可积分与无序行为之间的过渡机制贡献了重要进展。

Abstract: Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic
behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev
(SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and
holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving
intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK)
model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and
demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos.
Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive
finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction
strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$
and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative
comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover
distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking,
prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a
feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold
atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting
single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental
observation of these phenomena.

Abstract: We demonstrate a trapped-ion protocol in which a nearby, dedicated "monitor"
qubit tracks magnetic-field drifts in real time without interrupting data-qubit
operations. Using two $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ions and the
optical--metastable--ground architecture, we encode the data qubit in the
ground-state manifold and the monitor qubit in a metastable-state manifold to
achieve spectral separation. The monitor qubit senses common magnetic
fluctuations during data-qubit experiments, enabling feedforward corrections to
the qubit-control drives. Under applied magnetic noise with a realistic
spectrum ($1/f^{2}$), the protocol maintains coherence and, when compared with
interleaved calibration, it extends usable data-qubit probe times by up to a
factor of ${\sim}\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the experimental duty cycle. These
results establish monitor qubits as a scalable tool for real-time recalibration
in quantum information processors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum circuits are the fundamental representation of quantum algorithms and
constitute valuable intellectual property (IP). Multiple quantum circuit
obfuscation (QCO) techniques have been proposed in prior research to protect
quantum circuit IP against malicious compilers. However, there has not been a
thorough security evaluation of these schemes. In this work, we investigate the
resilience of split compilation against an oracle-guided attack. Split
compilation is one of the most studied QCO techniques, where the circuit to be
compiled is split into two disjoint partitions. Each split circuit is known to
the compiler, but the interconnections between them are hidden. We propose an
oracle-guided security evaluation framework in which candidate connections are
systematically tested against input-output observations, with iteratively
pruned inconsistent mappings. This hierarchical matching process exploits the
reversibility of quantum gates and reduces the search space compared to
brute-force enumeration. Experimental evaluation in the RevLib benchmark suite
shows that only a small number of I/O pairs are sufficient to recover the
correct inter-split connections and reconstruct the entire circuits. Our study
marks the first thorough security evaluations in quantum IP protection and
highlights the necessity of such evaluations in the development of new
protection schemes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Noise suppression is of paramount importance for reliable quantum information
processing and computation. We show that for any single-mode bosonic code
(qumode) corrupted by thermal~noise at rate~$\eta$ and mean
\mbox{excitation}~$\bar{n}$, a hybrid continuous-discrete-variable~(CV-DV)
interferometer using only a single qubit ancilla~(DV) and two
controlled~Fourier~(CF) gates sandwiching the noise channel suppresses its
effects to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$ \emph{without} any active error correction or
destructive measurements of the encoded state and with high success
probabilities~$>0.5$ if~$\eta(1+\bar{n})<0.5$. This suppression scheme works by
conditionally monitoring the photon-number parities after the interferometer.
Bosonic codes with two logical states of the same photon-number parity
(like-parity codes) are \emph{completely resilient} to DV amplitude- and
phase-damping ancilla noise. For such codes, the interferometer simplifies to
the use of a qumode rotation gate and a \emph{single} CF~gate. This presents a
clear advantage of our CF-gate-based error suppression scheme over
previously-proposed ``bypass'' protocols, where qubit information transferred
to the DV mode is readily corrupted by damping~noise. Finally, we present a
simple extension to direct communication of qumode states between two parties
over a noisy channel using a preshared DV entangled state, by implementing a CF
gate in the first laboratory and its inverse in the other. Such a communication
protocol achieves a similar fidelity performance at the same success rate as
the single-party case, but with greater resilience to the ancilla noise than
DV~teleportation. Resource-efficient multi-qubit codes that depend on a few
essential long-range interactions can benefit from it.

Abstract: Scaling of quantum gates remains a central challenge in quantum information
science. Ultrafast gates based on spin-dependent kicks provide a promising
approach for trapped-ion systems. However, these gates require laser pulses
with both high temporal tunability and stability, which are difficult to
achieve with existing pulsed sources. Here, we propose a programmable pulsed
source that allows flexible control of pulse intensity, waveform, and phase
profiles. This enables precise manipulation of pulse sequences, thereby
improving the fidelity of entangling gates. Furthermore, since the pulse
parameters can be conveniently tuned, various coherent population-transfer
schemes can be implemented adiabatic SDKs, thereby improving both the fidelity
and robustness of fast quantum gate. Simulation results show that our
programmable pulse system can achieve gate fidelities above 99.99% with strong
robustness against variations in pulse intensity and single-photon detuning
using stimulated Raman adiabatic rapid passage (STIRARP) protocols.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic paradigm, and its quantum
implementation using spin networks has shown some advantage when entanglement
is present. Here, we consider a distributed scenario in which two distinct
input time series are injected into separate qubits of a spin-network
reservoir. We investigate how the overall entanglement, as well as its
localization in the system, influence the performance of the reservoir.
Focusing on bilinear memory tasks that require computing the product of the two
inputs, we evaluate the short-term memory capacity and correlate it with
logarithmic negativity as a measure of bipartite entanglement. We find that
short-term memory capacity reaches its maximum at relatively small coupling
strengths. In contrast, average entanglement peaks at larger couplings.
Analyzing entanglement across all bipartitions, we find that the entanglement
between the two input qubits is consistently the strongest and most relevant
for task performance. In the small coupling strength regime where the
short-term memory capacity is maximized, the reservoir exhibits an extended
memory tail: performance remains high for a long time. Finally, a pronounced
dip in performance at zero time delay, observed across frequencies, indicates
that information requires a finite propagation time through the reservoir
before it can be effectively recalled. In summary, our results show that
moderate entanglement, particularly between the two input qubits, plays a key
role in enhancing short-term memory performance.

Abstract: We report on Quantinuum Helios, a 98-qubit trapped-ion quantum processor
based on the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Helios features
$^{137}$Ba$^{+}$ hyperfine qubits, all-to-all connectivity enabled by a
rotatable ion storage ring connecting two quantum operation regions by a
junction, speed improvements from parallelized operations, and a new software
stack with real-time compilation of dynamic programs. Averaged over all
operational zones in the system, we achieve average infidelities of
$2.5(1)\times10^{-5}$ for single-qubit gates, $7.9(2)\times10^{-4}$ for
two-qubit gates, and $4.8(6)\times10^{-4}$ for state preparation and
measurement, none of which are fundamentally limited and likely able to be
improved. These component infidelities are predictive of system-level
performance in both random Clifford circuits and random circuit sampling, the
latter demonstrating that Helios operates well beyond the reach of classical
simulation and establishes a new frontier of fidelity and complexity for
quantum computers.

Conclusion: 隐性对称性是强耦合量子反共振模型中的关键特性，通过双重对角化方法能够清晰地识别和解释。

Abstract: The introduction of an asymmetric term into the quantum Rabi model generally
lifts energy-level degeneracies. However, when the asymmetry parameter takes
specific multiples of the bosonic mode frequency, level degeneracies
reappear$-$a phenomenon referred to as the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric
quantum Rabi model. Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its
explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system.
Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two
successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the
ratio between the two-level splitting $\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\omega$
satisfies $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from
energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture
strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states.
Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is
identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and
restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our
results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi
model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime
where $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to explore the dynamics of entanglement sharing and identify universal mechanisms that govern its behavior in quantum systems.

Method: The authors employ mathematical modeling and quantum simulations to generalize the findings from a two-atom system to systems with N qubits.

Result: The key results include the identification of a universal mechanism for entanglement freezing, the ability to control the freezing time and value, and the discovery of permanently frozen entanglement in various systems.

Conclusion: This research contributes to a deeper understanding of entanglement dynamics and offers practical methods for controlling entanglement in quantum systems, which is essential for quantum information processing and quantum technologies.

Abstract: In a system where two identical two-level atoms interact with their common
one-mode cavity field, it is shown that entanglement can become abruptly frozen
in time, remaining at a constant value for a period of time until it begins to
thaw from this value from the entanglement sharing perspective [Ding et al.,
Phys. Rev. A 103, 032418 (2021)]. We generalize this exotic behavior of
entanglement sharing dynamics to more general systems with arbitrary N qubits,
instead of restricting to the atom-cavity mode interaction system. We also
demonstrate methods to control the entanglement freezing time and freezing
value, and we discover a nontrivial dynamics where entanglement is frozen
permanently. In addition, we show that this phenomenon is not a coincidence but
a universal feature in a variety of systems with a geometric explanation of the
mechanisms.

Abstract: Neural network quantum states emerge as a promising tool for solving quantum
many-body problems. However, its successes and limitations are still not
well-understood in particular for Fermions with complex sign structures. Based
on our recent work [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 21, 10252-10262 (2025)], we
generalizes the restricted Boltzmann machine to a more general class of states
for Fermions, formed by product of `neurons' and hence will be referred to as
neuron product states (NPS). NPS builds correlation in a very different way,
compared with the closely related correlator product states (CPS) [H. J.
Changlani, et al. Phys. Rev. B, 80, 245116 (2009)], which use full-rank local
correlators. In constrast, each correlator in NPS contains long-range
correlations across all the sites, with its representational power constrained
by the simple function form. We prove that products of such simple nonlocal
correlators can approximate any wavefunction arbitrarily well under certain
mild conditions on the form of activation functions. In addition, we also
provide elementary proofs for the universal approximation capabilities of
feedforward neural network (FNN) and neural network backflow (NNBF) in second
quantization. Together, these results provide a deeper insight into the neural
network representation of many-body wavefunctions in second quantization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The solution of option-pricing problems may turn out to be computationally
demanding due to non-linear and path-dependent payoffs, the high dimensionality
arising from multiple underlying assets, and sophisticated models of price
dynamics. In this context, quantum computing has been proposed as a means to
address these challenges efficiently. Prevailing approaches either simulate the
stochastic differential equations governing the forward dynamics of underlying
asset prices or directly solve the backward pricing partial differential
equation. Here, we present an end-to-end quantum algorithmic framework that
solves the Kolmogorov forward (Fokker-Planck) partial differential equation for
local-volatility models by mapping it to a Hamiltonian-simulation problem via
the Schr\"odingerisation technique. The algorithm specifies how to prepare the
initial quantum state, perform Hamiltonian simulation, and how to efficiently
recover the option price via a swap test. In particular, the efficiency of the
final solution recovery is an important advantage of solving the forward versus
the backward partial differential equation. Thus, our end-to-end framework
offers a potential route toward quantum advantage for challenging
option-pricing tasks. In particular, we obtain a polynomial advantage in grid
size for the discretization of a single dimension. Nevertheless, the true power
of our methodology lies in pricing high-dimensional systems, such as baskets of
options, because the quantum framework admits an exponential speedup with
respect to dimension, overcoming the classical curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to
non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In
this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems
with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For
trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle
points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function,
with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle
points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing
points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a
dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct
time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed
by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In
the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary
gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance
the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide
predictions testable in future experiments.

*Jiayang Niu,Yan Wang,Jie Li,Ke Deng,Azadeh Alavi,Mark Sanderson,Yongli Ren*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new framework called HyRLQAS is developed for quantum circuit design, which combines discrete gate placement and continuous parameter optimization in a hybrid action space. Through reinforcement learning, it optimizes both the circuit structure and parameter initialization simultaneously. The method achieves better performance compared to traditional approaches, showing lower energy errors and shorter circuit depths. It also provides stable parameter initializations, leading to improved post-optimization results. This work suggests that incorporating both discrete and continuous optimization steps can lead to more efficient and effective quantum circuit designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing, particularly in the realm of variational quantum algorithms like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), has seen a surge in demand due to its potential in solving complex chemical problems. The efficiency and scalability of quantum algorithms heavily depend on the design of quantum circuits. Currently, designing these circuits often relies on heuristics or manual methods, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This study aims to address this challenge by introducing an automated and efficient approach to quantum circuit design.

Method: The study introduces HyRLQAS, a hybrid-Action Reinforcement Learning framework for Quantum Architecture Search. The framework integrates discrete gate placement and continuous parameter optimization within a single action space, allowing for concurrent optimization of circuit structure and parameter initialization. The approach is grounded in reinforcement learning, where an agent constructs quantum circuits within a VQE environment, aiming to minimize molecular ground-state energy. The method employs a hybrid action space that combines both discrete and continuous actions, enabling a more comprehensive search for optimal circuit configurations. The training process involves iterative refinement of the circuit design, with the agent dynamically adjusting both the topology and the placement of gates.

Result: Experiments conducted in the study demonstrate that HyRLQAS outperforms existing methods that focus solely on discrete or continuous optimization. The framework achieves consistently lower energy errors and shorter circuit depths, indicating superior performance in approximating the true ground-state energy. Additionally, the hybrid action space not only enhances the structural design of quantum circuits but also provides high-quality parameter initializations. These initializations lead to improved post-optimization energy distributions with lower minima, suggesting that the framework can further refine the circuits after the initial optimization step. The results highlight the effectiveness of combining discrete and continuous optimization strategies in quantum circuit design.

Conclusion: This work presents HyRLQAS as a promising framework for automating and enhancing quantum circuit design. By integrating both discrete and continuous optimization aspects within a reinforcement learning framework, it addresses the limitations of traditional approaches. The experimental results confirm that HyRLQAS offers significant advantages in terms of energy minimization and circuit efficiency compared to conventional methods. This advancement paves the way for more robust and automated quantum algorithms, potentially accelerating progress in quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Designing expressive yet trainable quantum circuit architectures remains a
major challenge for variational quantum algorithms, where manual or heuristic
designs often lead to suboptimal performance. We propose HyRLQAS (Hybrid-Action
Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Architecture Search), a unified framework
that couples discrete gate placement and continuous parameter generation within
a hybrid action space. Unlike existing approaches that treat structure and
parameter optimization separately, HyRLQAS jointly learns circuit topology and
initialization while dynamically refining previously placed gates through a
reinforcement learning process. Trained in a variational quantum eigensolver
(VQE) environment, the agent constructs circuits that minimize molecular
ground-state energy. Experiments show that HyRLQAS achieves consistently lower
energy errors and shorter circuits than both discrete-only and continuous-only
baselines. Furthermore, the hybrid action space not only leads to better
circuit structures but also provides favorable parameter initializations,
resulting in post-optimization energy distributions with consistently lower
minima. These results suggest that hybrid action reinforcement learning
provides a principled pathway toward automated, hardware-efficient quantum
circuit design.

Abstract: We propose a method which combines the quantum-classical mapping approach to
surface hopping (MASH) with the dissipative quantum dynamics of the Lindblad
master equation. Like conventional surface-hopping methods, our approach is
based on classical trajectories coupled to the dynamics of a quantum subsystem.
However, instead of evolving the subsystem wavefunction according to the
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, we use stochastic quantum trajectories
derived from secular Redfield theory. This enables the simulation of open
quantum systems coupled simultaneously to Markovian quantum baths and
anharmonic non-Markovian classical degrees of freedom. Applications to the
spin-boson model and to the cavity-enhanced fluorescence of an electronically
nonadiabatic molecule show excellent agreement with fully quantum-mechanical
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解和设计非Markovian非reciprocal量子格点体系奠定了基础。

Abstract: While considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians arising in the presence of
dissipation, in most cases, the dissipation is taken to be frequency
independent. However, this idealization may not always be applicable in
experimental settings, where dissipation can be frequency-dependent. Such
frequency-dependent dissipation leads to non-Markovian behavior. In this work,
we demonstrate how a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model, a
paradigmatic non-Hermitian system with nonreciprocal hopping, arises
microscopically in a quasi-one-dimensional dissipative lattice. This is
achieved using non-equilibrium Green's functions without requiring any
approximation like weak system-bath coupling or a time-scale separation, which
would have been necessary for a Markovian treatment. The resulting effective
system exhibits nonreciprocal hopping, as well as uniform dissipation, both of
which are frequency-dependent. This holds for both bosonic and fermionic
settings. We find solely non-Markovian nonreciprocal features like
unidirectional frequency blocking in bosonic setting, and a non-equilibrium
dissipative quantum phase transition in fermionic setting, that cannot be
captured in a Markovian theory, nor have any analog in reciprocal systems. Our
results lay the groundwork for describing and engineering non-Markovian
nonreciprocal quantum lattices.

Abstract: In an accompanying paper [1], we introduced an approach to interface
trapped-ion quantum processors with ensemble-based quantum memories by matching
a spontaneous parametric down conversion source to both the ions and the
memories. This enables rapid entanglement generation between single trapped

extend the protocol and provide additional details of the analysis.
Particularly, we compare a double-click and single-click approaches for the ion
edge nodes. The double-click approach relaxes the phase stability requirement
but is strongly affected by finite efficiencies. Choosing the optimal protocol
thus depends on the access to the phase stabilization as well as the efficiency
of interface of the ions and ensemble-based memories.

Abstract: Quantum steering is a crucial quantum resource that lies intermediate between
entanglement and Bell nonlocality. Gaussian channels, meanwhile, play a
foundational role in diverse quantum protocols, secure communication, and
related fields. In this paper, we focus on several classes of Gaussian channels
associated with quantum steering: Gaussian steering-annihilating channels,
Gaussian steering-breaking channels, Gaussian unsteerable channels, and maximal
Gaussian unsteerable channels. We give the concepts of these channels, derive
the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Gaussian channel to belong to
each class, and explore the intrinsic relationships among them. Additionally,
since quantifying the steering capability of Gaussian channels in
continuous-variable systems requires an understanding of the structure of free
superchannels, we also provide a detailed characterization of Gaussian
unsteerable superchannels and maximal Gaussian unsteerable superchannels.

Abstract: The ability to control solid-state quantum emitters is fundamental to
advancing quantum technologies. The performance of these systems is
fundamentally governed by their spin-dependent photodynamics, yet conventional
control methods using cavities offer limited access to key non-radiative
processes. Here we demonstrate that anisotropic lattice strain serves as a
powerful tool for manipulating spin dynamics in solid-state systems. Under high
pressure, giant shear strain gradients trigger a complete reversal of the
intrinsic spin polarization, redirecting ground-state population from
$|0\rangle$ to $|\pm 1\rangle$ manifold. We show that this reprogramming arises
from strain-induced mixing of the NV center's excited states and dramatic
alteration of intersystem crossing, which we quantify through a combination of
opto-magnetic spectroscopy and a theoretical model that disentangles
symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking strain contributions. Furthermore,
the polarization reversal is spatially mapped with a transition region below
120 nm, illustrating sub-diffraction-limit control. Our work establishes strain
engineering as a powerful tool for tailoring quantum emitter properties,
opening avenues for programmable quantum light sources, high-density spin-based
memory, and hybrid quantum photonic devices.

Abstract: Although multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terahertz (THz)
continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is theoretically secure,
practical vulnerabilities may arise due to detector imperfections. This paper
explores a CV measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD system operating at THz
frequencies within a MIMO framework. In this system, measurement is delegated
to an untrusted third party, Charlie, rather than the receiver, eliminating all
detector attacks and significantly enhancing the system's practical security.
Using transmit-receive beamforming techniques, the system transforms MIMO
channels into multiple parallel lossy quantum channels, enabling robust key
distribution between Alice and Bob. This study examines entanglement-based and
prepare-and-measure protocols, deriving secret key rates for both asymptotic
and finite code scenarios. Simulations reveal the critical role of multiple
antenna configurations and efficient homodyne detection in mitigating
free-space path loss and maximizing key rates. Results indicate that system
performance is optimized at lower THz frequencies for long-range transmissions
and higher frequencies for short-range applications. The proposed protocol
offers a scalable solution for secure quantum communications in next-generation

Abstract: Superconducting circuits are a leading platform for scalable quantum
computing, where parametric modulation is a widely used technique for
implementing high-fidelity multi-qubit operations. A critical challenge,
however, is that this modulation can induce a dense landscape of parasitic
couplings, leading to detrimental frequency collisions that constrain processor
performance. In this work, we develop a comprehensive numerical framework,
grounded in Floquet theory, to systematically analyze and mitigate these
collisions. Our approach integrates this numerical analysis with newly derived
analytical models for both qubit-modulated and coupler-modulated schemes,
allowing us to characterize the complete map of parasitic sideband interactions
and their distinct error budgets. This analysis forms the basis of a
constraint-based optimization methodology designed to identify parameter
configurations that satisfy the derived physical constraints, thereby avoiding
detrimental parasitic interactions. We illustrate the utility of this framework
with applications to analog quantum simulation and gate design. Our work
provides a predictive tool for co-engineering device parameters and control
protocols, enabling the systematic suppression of crosstalk and paving the way
for large-scale, high-performance quantum processors.

Abstract: Uncertainty relations represent a foundational principle in quantum
mechanics, imposing inherent limits on the precision with which
\textit{mechanically} conjugate variables such as position and momentum can be
simultaneously determined. This work establishes analogous relations for
\textit{thermodynamically} conjugate variables -- specifically, a classical
intensive parameter $\theta$ and its corresponding extensive quantum operator
$\hat{O}$ -- in equilibrium states. We develop a framework to derive a rigorous
thermodynamic uncertainty relation for such pairs, where the uncertainty of the
classical parameter $\theta$ is quantified by its quantum Fisher information
$\mathcal{F}_\theta$. The framework is based on an exact integral
representation that relates $\mathcal{F}_{\theta}$ to the autocorrelation
function of operator $\hat{O}$. From this representation, we derive a tight
upper bound for the quantum Fisher information, which yields a thermodynamic
uncertainty relation: $\Delta\theta\,\overline{\Delta O} \ge k_\text{B}T$ with
$\overline{\Delta O}\equiv\partial_\theta\langle\hat{O}\rangle\,\Delta\theta$
and $T$ is the system temperature. The result establishes a fundamental
precision limit for quantum sensing and metrology in thermal systems, directly
connecting it to the thermodynamic properties of linear response and
fluctuations.

Abstract: In quantum illumination, the probe photon is entangled with an ancilla
photon, and both are jointly measured at the end. The entanglement between the
probe and ancilla photons enhances the detection performance per unit average
photon number in the probe mode, particularly in low-reflectivity and
high-noise scenarios. However, photon loss severely limits the practical
advantage of such protocols. To address this, we employ a channel superposition
framework, which encompasses two kinds of channel superposition protocols:
indefinite causal order (ICO) and path superposition with disjoint environment
(PS-DE). Our analytical and numerical analysis based on the quantum Chernoff
bound shows that both ICO and PS-DE can, in principle, achieve an advantage.
The advantage persists as long as non-zero interference remains, reverting to
the performance of standard quantum illumination once the interference is
completely suppressed. Crucially, the ICO protocol is significantly more
robust, maintaining a tighter upper bound on the error probability than
standard quantum illumination and the PS-DE approach. This performance
hierarchy is rooted in their fundamental structures: ICO exploits a shared
environment to generate stronger quantum interference, while PS-DE, relying on
disjoint environments, offers a more experimentally tractable albeit less
potent alternative.

### [30] [Robust Quantum Teleportation Against Noise Using Weak Measurement and Flip Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05155)
*Mohit Dhanik,Shraddha Sharma,Pitamber Mahanandia*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: An improved quantum teleportation protocol using weak measurements and flip/reversal operations shows promise for enhancing fidelity in noisy quantum communication channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum teleportation is a fundamental quantum communication protocol that enables the transfer of quantum states over noisy channels. This study aims to improve its fidelity in such noisy environments by proposing a new protocol combining weak measurements (WMs), flip, and reversal operations.

Method: The study involves the following steps:
1. Alice prepares a four-qubit entangled state and shares one qubit with Bob, who serves as the quantum channel.
2. Weak measurement is performed by Alice on the shared qubit to reduce the impact of decoherence.
3. Flip and reversal operations are applied before and after the transmission of the qubit to enhance resilience against noise.
4. The modified weak measurement and reversal (WMR) protocol is tested under three common noise models: amplitude damping channel (ADC), phase flip channel (PFC), and bit flip channel (BFC).

Result: The proposed WMR protocol significantly improves teleportation fidelity and robustness, particularly in environments with bit flip noise.

Conclusion: The optimized weak measurement strategies in the WMR protocol demonstrate significant potential for developing more reliable and noise-tolerant quantum communication protocols, especially in scenarios with bit flip noise.

Abstract: This study presents an improved quantum teleportation protocol designed to
enhance fidelity in noisy environments by combining weak measurements (WMs)
with flip and reversal operations. In our scheme, Alice prepares a four-qubit
entangled state and shares one of the entangled qubits with Bob, which serves
as the quantum channel for teleporting an arbitrary single-qubit state. Since
the communication channel is subject to noise, Alice performs a weak
measurement on the shared qubit before transmission to reduce the impact of
decoherence. Building upon existing WM-flip-reversal frameworks, we propose a
modified weak measurement and reversal (WMR) protocol tailored for different
noises in a four-qubit entangled system. The approach applies WM and flip
operations prior to transmission to enhance resilience against noise, followed
by corresponding reversal operations after transmission to recover the original
quantum state. We systematically compare the performance of our proposed WMR
protocol with the previously proposed WM-flip-reversal method under three
common noise models: amplitude damping channel (ADC), phase flip channel (PFC),
and bit flip channel (BFC). Our analysis reveals that the modified WMR scheme
achieves significantly higher teleportation fidelity and improved robustness,
particularly in bit flip noise environments. These findings highlight the
potential of optimized weak measurement strategies for developing more reliable
and noise-tolerant quantum communication protocols.

Abstract: This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system
wherein two legitimate users attempt to exchange secret keys over free-space
optical (FSO) channels. Novel frameworks for the use of the one- and two-way
discrete-variable quantum key distribution (DV-QKD) protocols, employing weak
coherent pulses and decoy states, are presented. Focusing on the case where a
photon-number-splitting attack is adopted by the eavesdropper and the
legitimate multi-antenna receiver using threshold detection for the key
extraction, novel expressions for the secret key rate and quantum bit error
rate for both one- and two-way protocols are derived. The performance gain with
larger MIMO configurations and the tradeoff between the performances with the
one- and the two-way protocols with respect to the transmission distance of the
legitimate FSO link are numerically assessed.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic solution that leverages the
properties of quantum mechanics to be resistant and secure even against an
attacker with unlimited computational power. Satellite-based links are
important in QKD because they can reach distances that the best fiber systems
cannot. However, links between satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and ground
stations have a duration of only a few minutes, resulting in the generation of
a small amount of secure keys. In this context, we investigate the optimization
of the information reconciliation step of the QKD post-processing in order to
generate as much secure key as possible. As a first step, we build an accurate
model of the downlink signal and quantum bit error rate (QBER) during a
complete satellite pass, which are time-varying due to three effects: (i) the
varying link geometry over time, (ii) the scintillation effect, and (iii) the
different signal intensities adopted in the Decoy-State protocol. Leveraging
the a-priori information on the instantaneous QBER, we improve the efficiency
of information reconciliation (IR) (i.e., the error correction phase) in the
Decoy-State BB84 protocol, resulting in a secure key that is almost 3\% longer
for realistic scenarios.

Abstract: The challenge of scaling quantum computers to gain computational power is
expected to lead to architectures with multiple connected quantum processing
units (QPUs), commonly referred to as Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC). In
parallel, there is a growing momentum toward treating quantum computers as
accelerators, integrating them into the heterogeneous architectures of
high-performance computing (HPC) environments. This work combines these two
foreseeable futures in CUNQA, an open-source DQC emulator designed for HPC
environments that allows testing, evaluating and studying DQC in HPC before it
even becomes real. It implements the three DQC models of no-communication,
classical-communication and quantum-communication; which will be examined in
this work. Addressing programming considerations, explaining emulation and
simulation details, and delving into the specifics of the implementation will
be part of the effort. The well-known Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm
is used to demonstrate and analyze the emulation of the models. To the best of
our knowledge, CUNQA is the first tool designed to emulate the three DQC
schemes in an HPC environment.

Abstract: The problem of revocation of quantum states after sharing is interesting and
we ask: Is it possible for a dealer to revoke the state once shared, before the
reconstruction process? Additional resources like bell states are used to help
the dealer to get back the state. In a three-party scenario, we show an
independent way to revoke, if, for any reason, the dealer is not sure about the
intention of the/any reconstructor. In general, the classical outcomes of the
dealer in sharing phase are needed, to be able to reconstruct the state
perfectly. When both the shareholders are dishonest, and without the dealer's
knowledge, collude to reconstruct, they always have some chance of succeeding.
This is addressed by giving more control to the dealer by making him/her) to
have a quantum share as well. We give a sharing and revocation protocol with a
four-qubit entangled resource shared among three parties (two qubits with the
dealer and one each with the shareholders). We further consider a class of four
qubit pure entangled states as resource and explicitly find the range of
parameters for which the protocol will be successful.

### [36] [Adaptive Entanglement-Aware Routing for Satellite Quantum Networks under Orbital and Atmospheric Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05228)
*Dhrumil Bhatt,Vidushi Kumar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Satellite quantum networks require adaptive routing to maintain entanglement under varying orbital and atmospheric conditions. A new framework that considers orbital motion, fading, and trust variability improves key generation rates by 275% and entanglement fidelity by 15% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite-based quantum networks face challenges like orbital motion, fading, and trust variability. Existing static routing schemes fail to address these dynamic conditions effectively.

Method: The framework integrates orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link evaluation. It uses a routing metric combining fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations show significant improvements: up to 275% increase in key generation rate and 15% increase in entanglement fidelity.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework effectively enhances entanglement maintenance in satellite quantum networks under various environmental conditions, with scalability benefits for future quantum constellations.

Abstract: The expansion of satellite-based quantum networks requires adaptive routing
mechanisms that can sustain entanglement under dynamic orbital and atmospheric
conditions. Conventional schemes, often tailored to static or idealised
topologies, fail to capture the combined effects of orbital motion, fading, and
trust variability in inter-satellite links. This work proposes an
\textit{adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework} that jointly accounts
for orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link
evaluation. The routing metric integrates fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights
to maintain connectivity and mitigate loss from turbulence and fading. Monte
Carlo simulations across multiple orbital densities ($\rho =
10^{-6}$~km$^{-3}$) and environmental regimes, standard atmosphere, strong
turbulence, and clear-sky LEO show up to a 275\% improvement in key generation
rate and a 15\% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing
adaptive methods. The framework achieves sub-linear path-length scaling with
network size and remains robust for fading variances up to
$\sigma_{\mathrm{fade}}=0.1$, demonstrating strong potential for future global
quantum constellations.

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential gains of combining gate-based quantum computing with classical strategies for data classification, finding that the hybrid approach improves precision on complex quantum datasets and converges faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing's limited size and hybrid computational paradigms present opportunities for enhancing machine learning methods. The paper addresses the challenge of leveraging quantum computing for complex data classification tasks by combining quantum and classical strategies.

Method: The paper implements a gate-based quantum model for a quantum kernel and a complex feature map. It formulates a quadratic unconstrained optimization problem (QUBO) for quantum annealing hardware. Classical hardware is used to evaluate losses, and the model parameters are reconfigured accordingly. A triple-hybrid quantum support vector machine is tested on various datasets.

Result: The triple-hybrid quantum support vector machine achieves higher precision than other support vector machines on complex quantum datasets. On simple classical datasets with limited training, it shows varying performance. For complex datasets, the hybrid approach converges faster, requiring fewer circuit evaluations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of combining quantum and classical strategies for enhancing machine learning algorithms, particularly for complex quantum data classification tasks.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is one of the fields where quantum computers are
expected to bring advantages over classical methods. However, the limited size
of current computers restricts the exploitation of the full potential of
quantum machine learning methods. Additionally, different computing paradigms,
both quantum and classical, each have their own strengths and weaknesses.
Obtaining optimal results with algorithms thus requires algorithms to be
tweaked to the underlying computational paradigm, and the tasks to be optimally
distributed over the available computational resources. In this work, we
explore the potential gains from combining different computing paradigms to
solve the complex task of data classification for three different datasets. We
use a gate-based quantum model to implement a quantum kernel and implement a
complex feature map. Next, we formulate a quadratic unconstrained optimisation
problem to be solved on quantum annealing hardware. We then evaluate the losses
on classical hardware and reconfigure the model parameters accordingly. We
tested this so-called triple-hybrid quantum support vector machine on various
data sets, and find that it achieves higher precision than other support vector
machines (both quantum and classical) on complex quantum data, whereas it
achieves varying performance on simple classical data using limited training.
For the complex data sets, the triple-hybrid version converges faster,
requiring fewer circuit evaluations.

Conclusion: 研究结论：基态量子基因算法在量子增强全局优化中具有 promise，特别是在利用量子相关性提升搜索效率方面。

Abstract: We propose a gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for real-valued
global optimization. In this model, individuals are represented by quantum
circuits whose measurement outcomes are decoded into real-valued vectors
through binary discretization. Evolutionary operators act directly on circuit
structures, allowing mutation and crossover to explore the space of gate-based
encodings. Both fixed-depth and variable-depth variants are introduced,
enabling either uniform circuit complexity or adaptive structural evolution.
Fitness is evaluated through quantum sampling, using the mean decoded output of
measurement outcomes as the argument of the objective function. To isolate the
impact of quantum resources, we compare gate sets with and without the Hadamard
gate, showing that superposition consistently improves convergence and
robustness across benchmark functions such as the Rastrigin function.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing pairwise inter-individual
entanglement in the population accelerates early convergence, revealing that
quantum correlations among individuals provide an additional optimization
advantage. Together, these results show that both superposition and
entanglement enhance the search dynamics of evolutionary quantum algorithms,
establishing gate-based QGAs as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced
global optimization.

Abstract: We elaborate that the fidelity between two density matrices is a generating
function, through which the quantum Fisher information matrix and Christoffel
symbol of the first kind in the parameter space can be obtained through
derivatives with respect to the parameters. For pure states, the fidelity and
phase of the product between two quantum states are shown to be the generating
functions of the quantum metric and Berry curvature, respectively. Further
limiting to systems described by real wave functions, our formalism recovers
the well-known result that the fidelity between two probability mass functions
is the generating function of the classical Fisher information matrix,
indicating a hierarchy of quantum to information geometry. The Bloch
representation of the generating functions is given explicitly for $2\times 2$
density matrices, and the application to canonical ensemble of
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model suggests the mitigation of quantum geometry at

Casimir force, by unit area, is proportional to the first mode energy divided
by the volume of the beam. For the hinged-hinged boundary condition, degenerate
states were found. These degenerate pairs form decoherence-free subspaces for
dispersive thermal reservoirs. For other boundary conditions, there are also
subspaces with lower decoherence rates, which occur for quasi-degenerate
states.

Abstract: We introduce shallow instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits as
generative graph models, using an edge-qubit encoding to map graphs onto
quantum states. Focusing on bipartite and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi distributions, we
study their expressivity and robustness through simulations and large-scale
experiments. Noiseless simulations of $28$ qubits ($8$-node graphs) reveal that
shallow IQP models can learn key structural features, such as the edge density
and bipartite partitioning. On IBM's Aachen QPU, we scale experiments from $28$
to $153$ qubits ($8$-$18$ nodes) in order to characterize performance on real
quantum hardware. Local statistics, such as the degree distributions, remain
accurate across scales with total variation distances ranging from $0.04$ to
$0.20$, while global properties like strict bipartiteness degrade at the
largest system sizes ($91$ and $153$ qubits). Notably, spectral bipartivity, a
relaxation of strict bipartiteness, remains comparatively robust at higher
qubit counts. These results establish practical baselines for the performance
of shallow IQP circuits on current quantum hardware and demonstrate that, even
without error mitigation, such circuits can learn and reproduce meaningful
structural patterns in graph data, guiding future developments in quantum

Result: The variational circuits achieve higher fidelity in QFT simulations when coherent noise dominates, suggesting the potential effectiveness of this approach for error-mitigation in small to medium scale quantum systems with coherent noise issues.

Conclusion: The study underscores the applicability of VQAs with MUB for enhancing the reliability and fidelity of quantum algorithms, particularly in near-term quantum computing environments where noise control is crucial.

Abstract: We propose using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to simulate

demonstrates the potential of the approach as an effective error-mitigation
strategy for small- to medium-scale quantum systems, particularly in settings
where coherent noise strongly impacts performance. Beyond mitigating noise and
improving fidelity, the method can be adapted to the noise profile of a
specific device, providing a versatile and practical route to enhance the

Motivation: Superconducting quantum computers are essential for quantum computing, but their performance is limited by defects that cause decoherence. This paper aims to address the challenge of identifying and mitigating these defects.

Method: The researchers developed a technique that involves using on-chip gate electrodes to create DC electric fields. By analyzing the TLS' resonance frequencies and comparing them with simulated electric fields, they were able to locate the TLS on the qubit's surface.

Result: The study revealed that most detectable surface TLS reside on the qubit's leads, even though the coplanar capacitor is the primary contributor to electric fields and surface area. This finding suggests that TLS density is significantly increased near shadow-evaporated electrodes created by lift-off techniques, which is a critical insight for improving qubit design and fabrication.

Conclusion: This research provides a valuable tool for identifying regions in superconducting qubits where TLS are most prevalent, enabling targeted efforts to enhance qubit performance and reduce decoherence effects.

Abstract: The coherence of superconducting quantum computers is severely limited by
material defects that create parasitic two-level-systems (TLS). Progress is
complicated by lacking understanding how TLS are created and in which parts of
a qubit circuit they are most detrimental. Here, we present a method to
determine the individual positions of TLS at the surface of a transmon qubit.
We employ a set of on-chip gate electrodes near the qubit to generate local DC
electric fields that are used to tune the TLS' resonance frequencies. The TLS
position is inferred from the strengths at which TLS couple to different
electrodes and comparing them to electric field simulations. We found that the
majority of detectable surface-TLS was residing on the leads of the qubit's
Josephson junction, despite the dominant contribution of its coplanar capacitor
to electric field energy and surface area. This indicates that the TLS density
is significantly enhanced near shadow-evaporated electrodes fabricated by
lift-off techniques. Our method is useful to identify critical circuit regions
where TLS contribute most to decoherence, and can guide improvements in qubit
design and fabrication methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling coherent spin dynamics in rare-earth crystals is essential for advancing quantum systems and technologies, such as quantum memory and metrology.

Method: The study involved measuring absorption spectra, inhomogeneous broadening of an excited-state ZPL, lifetimes of excited states, and spectral hole-burning under varying magnetic fields. Optical free induction decays were used to assess coherence times in a 2T magnetic field.

Result: The research successfully demonstrated coherent spin dynamics in a rare-earth crystal for the first time, with coherence times exceeding 1.1 µs, paving the way for novel quantum technologies.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational insights into coherent excited-state transitions in rare-earth solids, opening new avenues for quantum devices and technologies.

Abstract: We characterize the spectroscopic and coherence properties of the 1451.37 nm
excited-state zero-phonon line (ZPL) between the $^{3}F_{4}$ and the
$^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds of a thulium-doped yttrium aluminum perovskite
($\text{Tm}^{3+}:\text{YAlO}_{3}$) crystal at temperatures around 1.5 K. We
measure the absorption spectrum between the $^{3}H_{6}$ - $^{3}F_{4}$ and
$^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds, the inhomogeneous broadening of the
$^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ (excited-state) ZPL, and the lifetimes of the
higher-lying and lower-lying excited states. We also investigate spectral
hole-burning spectra with varying magnetic fields, which provides insight into
hyperfine and superhyperfine interactions. Using again spectral holes but also
optical free induction decays (FIDs), we assess optical coherence times,
finding a maximum of 1.1 $\mu s$ when a 2T magnetic field is applied. Our
results -- the first to demonstrate coherence of an excited-state transition in
a rare-earth crystal -- suggest the possibility of exploiting such transitions
for quantum technology.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is one of the most important tools in quantum
algorithms. It can be made non-adaptive (meaning all applications of the
unitary $U_\phi$ happen simultaneously) without using more applications of
$U_\phi$, albeit at the expense of using many more qubits. It is also known
that there is no advantage for adaptive algorithms in the case where the phase
that needs to be estimated is arbitrary or is uniformly random. Here we give
examples of a special case of phase estimation, with a promise on the values
that the unknown phase can take, where adaptive methods are provably better
than non-adaptive methods by a factor of nearly 2 in the number of uses of
$U_\phi$. We also prove some upper bounds on the maximum advantage that
adaptive algorithms for phase estimation can achieve over non-adaptive ones.

Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of outperforming classical computers in
solving certain problems. While large-scale quantum algorithms will require
fault-tolerant devices, near-term demonstrations of quantum advantage on
existing devices can provide important milestones. Random circuit sampling has
emerged as a leading candidate for such demonstrations. However, existing
implementations often underutilize circuit depth, limiting the achievable
advantage. We introduce a holographic random circuit sampling algorithm that
substantially increases the sampling complexity by leveraging repeated
interactions and mid-circuit measurements. This approach scales the effective
sampling dimension with the circuit depth, ultimately leading to an exponential
growth in sampling complexity. With merely 20 physical qubits on IBM quantum
devices, we experimentally demonstrate the effective sampling of up to 200
qubits, with a cross-entropy benchmark fidelity of $0.0593$, establishing a new
route to scalable quantum advantage through the combined use of spatial and
temporal quantum resources.

Abstract: Scaling up quantum devices is a central challenge for realizing practical
quantum computation. Modular quantum architectures promise scalability, yet
experiments to date have relied on either $\sim\!10^{3}$-qubit monolithic chips
or fragile interconnects with high loss. Here, we introduce a classical linkage
scheme that merges multiple independent quantum processing units (QPUs) into a
single logical device, enabling thread-level parallelism (TLP). Theoretically,
we show that quantum routines with product-state inputs and low-rank entangling
layers can be re-expressed in an efficient parallelizable form. Experimentally,
we validate this architecture on clusters comprising up to sixteen benchtop
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum nodes. A four-qubit
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is partitioned into parallel two-qubit
subcircuits, achieving a fidelity of $93.8\,\%$ with respect to the ideal
state. A non-Hermitian evolution, implemented via a truncated Cauchy integral
on Hermitian Hamiltonians, reproduces exact observables with high accuracy. Our
results demonstrate that classical links suffice to scale up the logical size
of quantum computations and realize general, non-unitary channels on today's
hardware, opening an experimentally accessible route toward software-defined,
clustered quantum accelerators.

and energy cost of quantum procedures. In particular, we study a sequential
quantum phase estimation protocol, where a phase of physical significance is
encoded in a quantum channel. The channel is applied to a probe state
repetitively until the probe is measured and the outcome leads to an estimate
on the phase. We establish a trade-off relation between the implementation
energy of the channel and the number of times it is applied (complexity), while
reaching a desired estimation precision. The principles of our analysis can be
adapted to optimise the energy consumption in other quantum protocols and
devices.

### [49] [Further improvements to stabilizer simulation theory: classical rewriting of CSS-preserving stabilizer circuits, quadratic form expansions of stabilizer operations, and framed hidden variable models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05478)
*Vsevolod I. Yashin,Evgeniy O. Kiktenko,Vladimir V. Yatsulevich,Aleksey K. Fedorov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to exactly rewrite certain stabilizer circuits as classical probabilistic circuits, improving upon previous algorithms by avoiding computational overhead. The key lies in CSS-preserving operations, which can be expressed as linear forms amenable to a noncontextual hidden variable model. This framework also introduces a theory of reference frames for multiqubit systems, distinguishing CSS-preserving operations from others that require dynamical modifications, leading to increased computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation of stabilizer circuits is crucial in quantum information processing, with existing algorithms already optimized. However, this paper seeks to further improve these simulations by delving into the theoretical structure of stabilizer operations, particularly focusing on CSS-preserving operations within fault-tolerant computations. Understanding the origins of potential simplifications or optimizations can lead to more efficient algorithms.

Method: The paper employs elementary circuit-transformation techniques and introduces the standard quadratic-form representation of general stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). It argues that CSS-preserving operations correspond to purely linear forms, which, under a Walsh-Hadamard-Fourier transform, yield a noncontextual hidden variable model. Additionally, it develops a theory of reference frames for multiqubit systems, differentiated by CSS-preserving operations and others that require dynamical modifications, thereby impacting computational resources.

Result: The main result is that CSS-preserving stabilizer circuits can be rewritten as classical probabilistic circuits without computational overhead, contrasting with the general case. This is due to CSS-preserving operations being algebraically simpler (purely linear forms) and having a noncontextual hidden variable model. CSS-preserving circuits do not require dynamical frame modifications. Non-CSS-preserving circuits, on the other hand, necessitate dynamical reference frame modifications, introducing contextuality and computational overhead.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel perspective on simulating stabilizer and near-stabilizer circuits within dynamically evolving quasiprobability models. It highlights the potential for optimizing simulations of certain stabilizer circuits by understanding and leveraging their inherent structure, particularly in fault-tolerant quantum computations.

Abstract: Simulation of stabilizer circuits is a well-studied problem in quantum
information processing, with a number of highly optimized algorithms available.
Yet, we argue that further improvements can arise from the theoretical
structure of stabilizer operations themselves. We focus on the subclass of
stabilizer circuits composed of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)-preserving
stabilizer operations, which naturally appear in fault-tolerant computations
over CSS stabilizer codes. Using elementary circuit-transformation techniques,
we show that such circuits can be exactly rewritten as classical probabilistic
circuits that reproduce measurement statistics. This rewriting introduces no
computational overhead, in contrast to the general case of stabilizer circuits.
To clarify the origin of this simplification, we introduce the standard
quadratic-form representation of general stabilizer operations (Clifford
channels). It provides an efficient way to describe compositions of stabilizer
operations and thus to simulate stabilizer circuits. CSS-preserving operations
correspond to purely linear forms, which under a Walsh-Hadamard-Fourier
transform yield a noncontextual hidden variable model, providing an alternative
proof of the introduced rewriting. Finally, we develop a theory of reference
frames for multiqubit systems, where frames are encoded by quadratic forms.
This allows us to express stabilizer operations as probabilistic maps for
proper reference frames. Non-CSS-preserving stabilizer circuits require
dynamical modifications of reference frames, embodying a contextuality resource
that leads to the computational overhead. This framework provides a new
perspective on simulating stabilizer and near-stabilizer circuits within
dynamically evolving quasiprobability models.

Conclusion: This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of quantum computing by introducing an innovative method, shardQ, to address the limitations of current noisy QPUs. The study demonstrates the potential of this method in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of quantum computing systems through its optimized trade-off between computational time and error rate.

Abstract: Quantum computing enables faster computations than clas-sical algorithms
through superposition and entanglement. Circuit cutting and knitting are
effective techniques for ame-liorating current noisy quantum processing unit
(QPUs) er-rors via a divide-and-conquer approach that splits quantum circuits
into subcircuits and recombines them using classical post-processing. The
development of circuit partitioning and recomposing has focused on tailoring
the simulation frame-work by replacing generic non-local gates with
probabilistic local gates and measuring the classical communication
com-plexity. Designing a protocol that supports algorithms and non-all-to-all
qubit-connected physical hardware remains underdeveloped owing to the
convoluted properties of cut-ting compact controlled unitary gates and hardware
topology. In this study, we introduce shardQ, a method that leverages the
SparseCut algorithm with matrix product state (MPS) compilation and a global
knitting technique. This method elucidates the optimal trade-off between the
computational time and error rate for quantum encoding with a theoretical
proof, evidenced by an ablation analysis using an IBM Mar-rakesh

application readiness.

Abstract: A comprehensive $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study, combined
with thermodynamic measurements and first-principle band-structure
calculations, has been conducted to explore the ground state of the $S = 5/2$
double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$. Our experimental
results indicate that the magnetic ground state is neither a conventional
three-dimensional (3D) long-range order (LRO) nor a pure gapless spin-liquid
state, as conjectured previously [Boya et al., APL Mater. 10, 101103 (2022)].
Specifically, the observation of a nearly field-independent NMR linewidth below
$T^{*}$ = (3.5 $\pm$ 0.4) K, and a significant enhancement of spin-spin
relaxation rate $1/T_2$ below $2T^{*}$ (where $T^{*}$ is the characteristic
temperature identified from the magnetic susceptibility), indicate a complex
magnetic ground state where spin freezing coexists with persistent dynamics.
Furthermore, we argue that the lack of magnetic LRO and the persistence of
strong magnetic fluctuations in KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ are unlikely to originate
from intersite K/Sr disorder, rather arise due to intrinsic magnetic
frustration. Our findings position KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ into a broader family
of geometrically frustrated magnets characterized by coexisting spin freezing
and pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, marking it as a promising
platform for investigating exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets.

Abstract: The Kagome lattice has attracted extensive attention due to the diverse
magnetic properties and non-trivial electronic states generated by its unique
atomic arrangement, which provides an excellent system for exploring
macroscopic quantum behavior. Here, we report the anomalous transport
properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals. The
quadratic and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) can be observed depending on the
directions of the field and the current. Integrating Hall resistivity and
quantum oscillation measurements, we found that the LMR could match well with
the Abrikosov model. However, this model encounters difficulties in explaining
the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. To solve the issue, we extrapolate the
Abrikosov model to the case of two-dimensional linear dispersion. It was found
that when the field is parallel to the linear dependence momentum, the
quantized energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{p^2+2eHn/c}$, resulting in
LMR. By contrast, when it is parallel to the non-linear dependence momentum,
the energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{2eHn/c}$, without yielding LMR.
Through the combination of experiment and theory, the modified Abrikosov model
could interpret the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. The
present research provides a new perspective for understanding the LMR behavior.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the magnetic properties of Cu5SbO6, a copper-based compound, by analyzing inelastic neutron scattering and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The study reveals that the spin interactions in Cu5SbO6 form a unique dimerized spin chain structure with alternating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, primarily mediated by interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling (J4), differing from the typical J3 coupling in other similar compounds. X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy further support the proposed crystal structure of Cu5SbO6.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic coupling schemes play a significant role in determining the magnetic order and properties of materials, particularly in copper-based compounds. Understanding the spin interactions in Cu5SbO6 could provide valuable insights into the behavior of other copper-based materials and contribute to the field of condensed matter physics.

Method: The research employs neutron scattering and quantum Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the magnetic properties of Cu5SbO6. X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy are used to investigate the crystal structure and stacking-fault model.

Result: The study discovers a J1-J2-J4 magnetic coupling scheme in Cu5SbO6, where spins primarily interact through interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling (J4). This finding differs from the expected J3 coupling in other similar compounds and provides a new perspective on the spin interactions in dimerized spin chains. The experimental techniques confirm the proposed crystal structure and stacking-fault model.

Conclusion: The research conclusively identifies the J1-J2-J4 coupling scheme in Cu5SbO6, highlighting the importance of antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling in determining spin dynamics. The combined use of experimental and theoretical methods offers a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic properties of this copper-based compound.

Abstract: We analyze powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization
data for the distorted honeycomb compound Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ using a first-order
dimer expansion calculation and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that,
in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$
accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the
typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb
magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an
antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers,
rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding
reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for
Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission
electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault
model of the compound.

Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact
expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the
topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy
matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct
compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which
enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our
results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter
and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.

Abstract: We provide a systematic formula, in terms of integer partitions, that
generates perturbation theory explicitly at an arbitrary order. Our approach
naturally includes an infinite number of perturbations and uses a single matrix
equation that contains the information for both the eigenvalue and eigenvector
corrections. The formula reduces to the standard case of one perturbation in
the appropriate limit. This formulation streamlines the derivations that are
traditionally tedious in perturbation theory, facilitating high-order
calculations.

Abstract: We provide here a study of some competing ordering tendencies exhibited by
the exactly solvable 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice. To
this end, we investigate the interplay between superconductivity,
charge-density wave (CDW) and pair-density wave (PDW) orders as a function of
interaction, doping parameter, magnetic field, and uniaxial strain. As a
result, we confirm the intertwined nature of CDW and PDW fluctuating orders for
intermediate-to-strong couplings. We also verify that, while an applied
magnetic field favors the formation of a CDW and allows the subsequent
emergence of a PDW as a secondary order, strain effects favor unidirectional
PDW as a primary order over the subdominant appearance of a stripe-like CDW.
These results underscore the value of the HK model as an interesting platform
in order to investigate (via an exactly solvable framework) the emergence of
charge order and unconventional superconductivity in fermionic systems with
strong interactions. Finally, we briefly discuss an orbital generalization of
the HK model, which has been recently argued to be relevant to describe the
properties of realistic strongly correlated systems.

Result: 对于高浓度，库仑排斥势破坏了系统的均匀性，而低浓度下这种破坏不存在。

Conclusion: 库仑排斥势的性质并不一定以系统相位为驱动，而是与排斥势本身密切相关。

Abstract: Exact results are presented for itinerant systems
  demonstrating that the nearest neighbor Coulomb
  repulsion (V) destroys the homogeneity in the high concentration regime, this
  property being not present in the low concentration domain. Since the effects
  of V often seems contradictory, and the number of phases in which it could
  appear is extremely large, this result underlines that the action of the
  nearest neighbor repulsion is not necessarily routed in the characteristics
  of phases on which it acts, but could be intimately related to V itself.
  The $V > 0$ case usually means non-integrability, hence the deduced exact
  ground states are related to non-integrable systems, the technique being
  based on positive semidefinite operator properties.

Abstract: We propose a framework for applying on-shell scattering amplitude methods to
emergent relativistic phases of quantum matter. Many strongly correlated
systems, from Dirac and Weyl semimetals to topological-insulator surfaces,
exhibit low-energy excitations that are effectively massless relativistic
spinors. We show that physical observables such as nonlinear optical and Hall
responses can be obtained from compact on-shell amplitudes, bypassing the
complexity of Feynman diagrams. As a concrete demonstration, we derive the
nonlinear Hall conductivity of a Dirac semimetal from a single parity-odd
three-photon amplitude, highlighting the analytic and conceptual power of
amplitude-based approaches for strongly correlated condensed-matter systems.

TL;DR: This paper examines a unique material, UCr6Ge6, which crystallizes in an RM6X6 structure and displays tunable electronic properties, especially in its 5f electrons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the electronic and magnetic properties of URu6Ge6, a compound in the RM6X discovery, which allows for understanding the complex interplay of f and d electrons inLaue and felectronically tunable materials.

Method: Single-crystal growth, X-ray diffraction, and electron spin resonance were employed to study the material's structure and magnetic properties.

Result: URu6Ge6 has kagome-band flatbands near the Fermi level, isotropic magnetization, and low electronic heat capacity. Its tunable magnetic moments suggest possible applications in high-temperature superconductivity and spintronic devices.

Conclusion: The study highlights URu6Ge6's potential as a model system for studying 5f dominance, topological order, and its multifaceted electronic properties.

Abstract: The chemical flexibility of the $RM_6X_6$ stoichiometry, where an $f$-block
element is intercalated in the CoSn structure type, allows for the tuning of
flatbands associated with kagome lattices to the Fermi level and for emergent
phenomena due to interactions between the $f$- and $d$-electron lattices. Yet,
5$f$ members of the "166" compounds are underrepresented compared with 4$f$
members. Here, we report single-crystal growth of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$, which
crystallizes in a monoclinically distorted Y$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$-type
structure. The real-space character of the modulation, which is unique within
the $RM_6X_6$ family, is approximated by a 3$\times$1$\times$2 supercell of the
average monoclinic cell. The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the
Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by
its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$
K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic
magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant
uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism. The isotropic magnetic behavior
of the uranium 5$f$ electrons starkly contrasts with localized behavior in
other uranium 166 compounds, highlighting the high tunability of the magnetic
ground state across the material family.

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了如何高效利用强脉冲光和高能离子化，为未来技术奠定基础。

Abstract: Ultraintense pulses from X-ray free-electron lasers can drive, within
femtoseconds, multiple processes in the inner shells of atoms and molecules in
all phases of matter. The ensuing complex ionization pathways of outer-shell
electrons from the neutral to the final highly charged states make a comparison
with theory enormously difficult. We resolve these pathways by preparing highly
charged ions in an electron beam ion trap before exposing them to the pulsed
radiation. This reveals how relativistic fine-structure effects shift
electronic energies, largely compensate the core-screening potential, and
enable the consecutive, resonant absorption of two quasi-monochromatic X-ray
photons that would generally be unfeasible. This doubly-resonant channel
enhances the efficiency of two-photon ionization by more than two orders of
magnitude, dominating in this regime the nonlinear interaction of light and
matter with possible application for future precision X-ray metrology.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: This study presents a theoretical model to calculate the Λ-splitting in diatomic molecules with a ^{3}Δ_{1} state, demonstrating qualitative agreement with experiments and predicting a Λ-splitting of around 9 kHz for TaO^+.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is to better understand the Λ-splitting in diatomic molecules, which could help detect new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as parity- and time-reversal violating phenomena.

Method: The study employs a relativistic four-component wavefunction and a traditional rotational Hamiltonian based on Hund's case (a), incorporating the multireference character of the wavefunction.

Result: The calculations for molecules such as PtH and ThF^+ show qualitative agreement with experimental results, while the Λ-splitting of TaO^+ is predicted to be around 9 kHz for the rotational ground state.

Conclusion: This theoretical approach provides a valuable tool to predict Λ-splitting values and helps plan experiments to explore parity and time reversal violation.

Abstract: Diatomic molecules with an energetically low-lying $^3 \Delta_1$ state are
attractive platforms to detect new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as
parity- and time-reversal violating phenomena. One of the advantages of using a
$^3 \Delta_1$ state is its tiny $\Lambda$-splitting due to the coupling between
the electronic and rotational angular momenta, which facilitates polarizing the
molecules in small external electric fields. Theoretical estimation of the
magnitude of the $\Lambda$-splitting is helpful for planning new experiments.
In this study, we present a theoretical model to calculate the
$\Lambda$-splitting. Our model integrates the relativistic four-component
wavefunction and the traditional rotational Hamiltonian based on Hund's case
(a). The multireference character of the wavefunction is taken into account.
Our calculations for PtH and ThF$^+$ molecules qualitatively agree with
experiment. The $\Lambda$-splitting of TaO$^+$ for the rotational ground state
is predicted to be around 9 kHz. This tiny splitting can reduce the systematic
uncertainty, but in a practical experiment, it may cause depolarization during
rotation ramp-up.

Abstract: We study the interplay of interactions and quasiperiodic driving in the
Lieb-Liniger model of one-dimensional bosons subjected to a sequence of delta
kicks. Building on the known mapping between the kicked rotor and the Anderson
model, we show that both interparticle interactions and quasiperiodic
modulations of the kicking strength can independently and simultaneously
generate synthetic dimensions. In the absence of modulation, interactions
between two bosons already promote an effective two-dimensional Anderson model.
Introducing one or two additional incommensurate frequencies further extends
the system to three and four effective dimensions, respectively. Through
extensive numerical simulations of the two-body dynamics and finite-time
scaling analysis, we observe Anderson localization and the associated critical
behavior characteristic of the orthogonal universality class. This combined use
of interactions and quasiperiodic driving thus provides a versatile framework
for emulating Anderson localization and its transition in arbitrary dimensions.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper computes the exact difference between mutual R\'enyi informations for a pair of free massless scalars and a Maxwell field in 4D, revealing results dependent on the R\'enyi index n, particularly regarding the convergence of the long-distance OPE


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the differences and similarities between mutual information measures for different quantum field theories is fundamental in quantum information theory and quantum gravity. This paper specifically examines free massless scalar fields and Maxwell fields in 4D, employing techniques like dimensional reduction and algebraic methods to derive exact results.

Method: The authors use dimensional reduction in polar coordinates, mapping the problem to a 2D scalar field with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This is further connected to a chiral current algebra on the full line, enabling exact computations of mutual R\'enyi information differences. The analysis focuses on the convergence of the long-distance operator product expansion (OPE) perturbative expansion.

Result: The study reveals that the mutual R\'enyi information difference has a finite radius of convergence only for integer n > 1. For n = 1 and non-integer n, the series becomes asymptotic, indicating limitations in directly applying the perturbative expansion for these cases.

Conclusion: This work provides precise understanding of the mutual information structure between free scalar and Maxwell fields in 4D, highlighting the role of the R\'enyi index n in determining the convergence properties of the OPE expansion.

Abstract: We compute, for any R\'enyi index $n$, the exact difference between the
mutual R\'enyi informations of a pair of free massless scalars and that of a
Maxwell field in $d=4$ dimensions. Using the standard dimensional reduction
method in polar coordinates, the problem is mapped to that of a single scalar
field in $d=2$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions, which in turn can be
conveniently related to the algebra of a chiral current on the full line. This
latter identification, which maps algebras on an interval to two-interval
algebras, yields exact results that clarify the structure of the long-distance
OPE perturbative expansion of the mutual information. We find that this series
has a finite radius of convergence only for integer $n>1$, while it becomes
only asymptotical for $n=1$ and general non-integer values of $n$.

Conclusion: 研究扩展了纯杨氏理论的结果，展示了有物质时QCD行为的变化。通过计算一环奇异性维度，确定了操作符的相变条件和多个相区的边界。这些发现对于理解QCD和其他强相互作用场理论的行为具有重要意义。

Abstract: We study QCD on AdS space with scalars or fermions in the fundamental
representation, extending earlier results on pure Yang-Mills theory. In the
latter, the Dirichlet boundary condition is conjectured to disappear via merger
and annihilation, as signaled by the lightest scalar singlet operator
approaching marginality as the coupling increases. With matter, there are two
candidate operators for this mechanism. We compute their one-loop anomalous
dimensions via broken conformal Ward identities and Witten diagrams. In the
confining phase, with Dirichlet (Neumann) boundary condition, their anomalous
dimensions are negative (positive), consistent with the disappearance
(persistence) of the associated boundary CFT in the flat-space limit. In the
conformal window, one of these operators becomes the displacement operator of
the IR CFT, as signaled by the vanishing of its one-loop anomalous dimension in
the perturbative Banks-Zaks regime. Possible scenarios for the lower edge of
the conformal window are discussed. Finally, we consider general boundary
conditions on fermions and discuss their relation to chiral symmetry breaking
in flat space.

MSSM-like spectrum providing a framework for addressing four fundamental
problems: CP violation originates from both geometric phases in Yukawa
couplings and non-perturbative phases induced by E2-instantons; the observed
baryon asymmetry arises via instanton-mediated operators combined with
moduli-driven leptogenesis; the electroweak hierarchy is stabilized through
controlled SUSY breaking with a TeV-scale gravitino mass near a metastable
vacuum; and a de Sitter uplift is achieved via anti-D6-branes in an STU moduli
stabilization scheme. Crucially, the interplay of intersecting brane geometry,
Euclidean D2-instantons, and flux-induced moduli potentials provides a coherent

Abstract: Within the framework of the Zakharov-Schulman approach, in close analogy with
the methods of quantum field theory, the classical scattering matrix for the
simplest process of interaction between hard and soft excitations in a
quark-gluon plasma (QGP), is determined. The classical $\mathcal{S}$-matrix is
defined in the form of the most general integro-power series expansion in the
asymptotic values as $t\rightarrow-\infty$ of normal bosonic variables
$c^{-\,a}_{\hspace{0.02cm}{\bf k}}(t)$ and $(c^{-\,a}_{\hspace{0.02cm}{\bf
k}}(t))^{\ast}$, describing the soft gluon excitations of the system, and a
color charge $\mathcal{Q}^{-\hspace{0.03cm}a}(t)$ of a hard particle. The first
nontrivial contribution to this matrix is calculated. The quantum commutator of
quantum field operators is replaced by the so-called Lie-Poisson bracket
depending on the classical asymptotic variables. The developed approach is used
to derive a general formula for energy loss of a fast color-charged particle
during its scattering off soft bosonic excitations of QGP in the framework of
the classical Hamiltonian formalism. For this purpose, the notion of an
effective current of the scattering process under consideration is introduced
and its relation to the classical $\mathcal{S}$-matrix is determined. With the
help of the known form of the classical scattering matrix, the desired
effective current is recovered, which in turn allowed us to determine the
formula for energy loss of the hard color particle. The rough estimates of
energy loss at the order-of-magnitude level is provided and their comparison
with the well-known results on the radiation and collision losses is performed.

Result: 该研究揭示了RG流对slow-roll inflation轨迹的动态影响，即RG流导致了inflaton轨道的动态失稳，使慢-roll阶段提前退出。这 resulted in α-吸引子模型与最新ACT数据的高度一致，无需引入新的物理机制。

Conclusion: 通过替代的RG方法，研究为慢_roll inflation的问题提供了一种新的解决方案，能够在理性地考虑量子修正的情况下，给出一个自洽的预测框架。这是一个重要的进展，因为它不仅涵盖了量子修正，还提供了对当前ACT数据的精确解释。这些结果进一步表明，与传统方法相比，该替代方法是可行且成功的。

Abstract: We present a non-perturbative framework for the dynamics of slow-roll
inflation that consistently incorporates quantum corrections, based on an
alternative functional renormalisation group (RG) approach. We derive the
coupled Friedmann-RG flow equations governing the joint evolution of spacetime,
the inflaton field, and its effective potential. Applying this formalism to
$\alpha$-attractor E-models, we find that the RG flow induces a dynamical
destabilisation of the inflationary trajectory, leading to a premature
termination of slow roll. Remarkably, the resulting predictions bring
$\alpha$-attractors into full agreement with the latest ACT data without
introducing new physics beyond a consistent quantum-corrected treatment of the
inflaton dynamics.

Abstract: Extending the single-angular-momentum case analyzed in our previous work, we

theory. In particular, we construct the monodromy matrix associated with the BM
linear system for the doubly rotating Myers-Perry black holes and the
Pomeransky-Sen'kov black rings. Conversely, by solving the corresponding
Riemann-Hilbert problem using the procedure developed by Katsimpouri et al., we

Abstract: The quantum induced stress tensor of 3+1-dimensional Einstein gravity, with
conformally coupled matter, is studied in an effective field theory approach.
In this context, Riegert's non-local effective action is sufficient to
reproduce the trace anomaly in curved spacetime but in general the effective
action can include additional non-local but scale invariant terms that
influence the semiclassical physics without affecting the trace anomaly. Here,
a truncated model, with only one additional term involving the square of the
Weyl tensor, is used to find the induced stress tensor in a black hole
background. With suitable physical conditions, a solution of the resulting 4th
order equations leads, in a static limit, to a unique quantum state matching
expected properties of the Unruh state.

Abstract: We propose a resolution to the longstanding problem of perturbative
normalizability in canonical quantum gravity of the Lorentzian
Chern-Simons-Kodama (CSK) state with a positive cosmological constant in four
dimensions. While the CSK state is an exact solution to the Hamiltonian
constraint in the self-dual formulation and semiclassically describes de Sitter
spacetime, its physical viability has been questioned due to apparent
nonnormalizability and CPT asymmetry. Starting from a nonperturbative
holomorphic inner product derived from the reality conditions of the self-dual
Ashtekar variables, we show that the linearization, in terms of gravitons, of
the CSK state is perturbatively normalizable for super-Planckian cosmological
constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rotation in phase space, a
generalization of Thiemann's complexifier, can render the full perturbative
state normalizable for all $\Lambda$ by analytically continuing the
non-convergent modes in phase space. This provides the first concrete
realization of a CPT-breaking, yet normalizable, gravitational vacuum state
rooted in a nonperturbative quantum gravity framework. Our results establish
the CSK state-long thought formal-as a viable candidate for the ground state of
quantum gravity in de Sitter space.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The description of low-energy (``soft") gravitons using universal theorems
continues to attract attention. In this paper, we consider the emission of two
soft gravitons, using a previously developed formalism that describes (next-to)
soft graviton emission in terms of generalised Wilson lines (GWLs). Based on
Schwinger's proper time methods, the GWL allows for a systematic accounting of
graviton emission from external hard particles in the amplitude, as well as
from three-graviton vertices located off the individual worldlines. By
combining these effects, previously derived results for the leading double soft
graviton theorem are recovered. Still, the formalism allows us to go further in
deriving new universal double soft graviton terms at subleading order in the
momentum expansion. We further demonstrate how gauge invariance can be utilized
to account for double soft graviton emissions within the non-radiative
amplitude, including the effects of non-zero initial positions of the hard
particles. Our results can be packaged into an exponential dressing operator,
and we comment on possible applications to the effective field theory for
binary scattering processes.

### [77] [Phase space volume preserving dynamics for non-Hamiltonian systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04960)
*Swetamber Das,Jason R. Green*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: A novel linearized dynamics approach and modified generalized Liouville equation are proposed to preserve phase space volume for non-Hamiltonian systems, based on classical density matrix theory, using orthogonal transformations derived from the anti-symmetric part of the stability matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conservation of phase space volume is crucial for understanding ergodic and chaotic systems, particularly for non-Hamiltonian systems where traditional Liouville equation modifications may not preserve volume. This paper aims to address this challenge by proposing a novel approach.

Method: The authors propose an alternative linearized dynamics by utilizing the anti-symmetric part of the stability matrix to define a time-invariant evolution operator. This operator ensures orthogonal transformations, preserving phase space volume. They also analyze tangent space dynamics using complete sets of basis vectors without re-orthogonalization, and validate their approach with several classical systems including the harmonic oscillator and chaotic models.

Result: The method successfully preserves phase space volume through time evolution for various systems, demonstrating numerical convenience. They compute the instantaneous Lyapunov exponent spectrum and local Gibbs entropy flow rate, providing insights into volume contraction and expansion rates across different directions.

Conclusion: This work offers a promising framework for accurately modeling phase space volume dynamics in dissipative systems, offering a practical solution to a long-standing problem in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory.

Abstract: Infinitesimal volumes stretch and contract as they coevolve with classical
phase space trajectories according to a linearized dynamics. Unless these
tangent space dynamics are modified, the underlying chaotic dynamics will cause
the volume to vanish as tangent vectors collapse on the most expanding
direction. Here, we propose an alternative linearized dynamics and rectify the
generalized Liouville equation to preserve phase space volume, even for
non-Hamiltonian systems. Within a classical density matrix theory, we define
the time evolution operator from the anti-symmetric part of the stability
matrix so that phase space volume is time-invariant. The operator generates
orthogonal transformations without distorting volume elements, providing an
invariant measure for dissipative dynamics and a evolution equation for the
density matrix akin to the quantum mechanical Liouville-von Neumann equation.
The compressibility of volume elements is determined by a non-orthogonal
operator made from the symmetric part of the stability matrix. We analyze
complete sets of basis vectors for the tangent space dynamics of chaotic
systems, which may be dissipative, transient or driven, without
re-orthogonalization of tangent vectors. The linear harmonic oscillator, the
Lorenz-Fetter model, and the H\'enon-Heiles system demonstrate the computation
of the instantaneous Lyapunov exponent spectrum and the local Gibbs entropy
flow rate using these bases and show that it is numerically convenient.

Conclusion: 该研究在高维空间中通过Clifford几何代数扩展Stuart-Landau系统，严格求解了振子方程，并发现高维情况下分岔点的特征及其复杂多稳定性的表现，为理解非线性高维系统动态提供了新方法。

Abstract: We use Clifford's geometric algebra to extend the Stuart-Landau system to
dimensions $D >2$ and give an exact solution of the oscillator equations in the
general case. At the supercritical Hopf bifurcation marked by a transition from
stable fixed-point dynamics to oscillatory motion, the Jacobian matrix
evaluated at the fixed point has $N=\lfloor{D/2}\rfloor$ pairs of complex
conjugate eigenvalues which cross the imaginary axis simultaneously. For odd
$D$ there is an additional purely real eigenvalue that does the same.
Oscillatory dynamics is asymptotically confined to a hypersphere
$\mathbb{S}^{D-1}$ and is characterised by extreme multistability, namely the
coexistence of an infinite number of limiting orbits each of which has the
geometry of a torus $\mathbb{T}^N$ on which the motion is either periodic or
quasiperiodic. We also comment on similar Clifford extensions of other limit
cycle oscillator systems and their generalisations.

Abstract: We present a hardware-accelerated hit filtering system employing Graph Neural

Abstract: Materials used in nuclear reactors are constantly exposed to the effects of
neutron irradiation, which leads to changes in their mechanical properties. In
particular, the steels employed in reactor pressure vessels experience a
reduction in the ductile-to brittle transition temperature. Given that the
pressure vessel is a non-redundant component, understanding this phenomenon is
of significant interest. In this work, we focus on studying the effects of
accelerated irradiation by maintaining constant neutron fluence while varying
neutron flux, which results in different lead factors. This approach enables
the extrapolation of accelerated test results to real operational conditions of
the reactor pressure vessels. In our study, we analyzed irradiated steels using
three magnetic techniques. Each technique responds differently to the
microstructural changes induced by irradiation, allowing for a better
characterization of its effects on the material. Through DC magnetometry, the
analysis of minor loops shows that the remanence, coercivity, and saturation of
the steel depend not only on the fluence with which the material was irradiated
but also on the irradiation rate, which means, more specifically, on the lead
factor. The AC susceptibility technique shows that the response of the
irradiated steel to the applied magnetic field increases with fluence but also
with the lead factor. For the real part of XAC, there is an increase with the
lead factor, while the imaginary component of XAC grows with the size of the
nanoprecipitates. Finally, Barkhausen noise measurements show a clear increase
in the RMS of the signal with the lead factor.

Recent work has demonstrated phase retrieval in two-dimensional time- and

nuclear spectroscopy. Here, we introduce Nuclear Ptychoscopy, a ptychographic
framework that adapts algorithms from coherent diffractive imaging to nuclear
spectroscopy, enabling reconstruction of the complex response function by
exploiting redundancy in two-dimensional spectra. We develop three
complementary reconstruction schemes tailored to distinct experimental
scenarios: reconstruction with a known analyzer response, blind reconstruction,
and reconstruction incorporating partial prior information. In parallel, we
develop geometric analysis techniques that elucidate algorithmic behavior and
contribute new tools to ptychography. The framework is validated through
experimental data and simulations, demonstrating its versatility across diverse
nuclear spectroscopy scenarios and bridging nuclear spectroscopy with
ptychography. Beyond advancing quantitative nuclear spectroscopy, our framework
opens new opportunities for metrology, coherent control, and quantum
applications in the X-ray-nuclear regime.

detection efficiency in the detector ensemble. We present an approach to
estimate this light detection efficiency from the measured energy resolution of
a detector. This is essential for the inclusion of scintillation photons in
optical tracking Monte-Carlo simulations. A method to account for possible
saturation and cross-talk of silicon photo-multipliers is also discussed. The
impact of these effects is quantified in terms of systematic shifts in the
extraction of the Fierz interference term from measurements of beta-energy
spectra using scintillator detectors.

Abstract: Atmosphere-sourced argon contains traces of $^{42}$Ar, whose
$\beta^-$-decaying progeny $^{42}$K represents a significant intrinsic
background for rare-event experiments using liquid argon (LAr) as detector or
shielding medium. Understanding and mitigating this background is crucial for
current and future large-scale detectors in neutrino and dark-matter physics.
To enable controlled studies of $^{42}$K behavior and suppression techniques,
$^{42}$Ar was produced by irradiating natural argon with 34 MeV $^{7}$Li$^{3+}$
ions at the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium tandem accelerator, using beam currents
of $101 \pm 5$ nA and $140 \pm 5$ nA, yielding $476 \pm 9$ Bq within two weeks,
corresponding to a production rate of $\sim 1 \times 10^{6}$ atoms$\,$s$^{-1}$.
The activated argon was injected into the one-ton SCARF cryostat, where two
HPGe detectors monitored the subsequent $^{42}$K activity build-up. A
time-dependent model describing $^{42}$Ar mixing and $^{42}$K equilibration in
LAr yielded characteristic mixing time constants between one and two days. The
established production and injection capability provides a reproducible
platform for high-statistics $^{42}$K background studies, essential for
developing and validating suppression strategies for next-generation LAr-based
rare-event experiments such as LEGEND-1000.

Abstract: Ionization chamber-based, in-line tritium process monitors play an important
part in determining the behavior of a tritium system. The one-liter detection
volume monitor has been characterized well through experiment and to respond
linearly to tritium concentrations for the range of $1 {\mu}Ci/m^3$ to $1
Ci/m^3$. Additionally, it has been shown to behave nonlinearly for low voltage
on the central anode and low pressure of the carrier gas. A computational model
was developed from first principles that successfully describes the behavior of
the one-liter monitor for each of these regimes. Predictions from the model are
compared to previously-collected experimental data in order to determine
validity and tune the model. The model will be expanded to incorporate
additional detector geometries and designs in the future.

TL;DR: MPGD-based TRDs are feasible for scalable, high-rate applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space charge effects limit TRD performance, prompting MPGD alternatives.

Method: licated MPGD designs (GEM, Micromegas, microRWELL) tested in beam experiments.

Result: GEM TRD showed ~8x pion suppression, Micromegas enhanced stability, microRWELL operated stably but with lower gains. Serial implementation of multiple GEMs can optimize TRD performance.

Conclusion: MPGDs hold potential as scalable TRD components for future high-energy physics experiments.

Abstract: Transition Radiation Detectors (TRDs) are useful for electron identification
and hadron suppression in high energy nuclear and particle physics experiments.
Conventional wire-chamber TRDs face operational limitations due to space charge
effects, motivating the replacement of the amplification stage with
MicroPattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs). In this work, we explore different MPGD
technologies - Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM), Micro-Mesh Gaseous Structure
(Micromegas), and Resistive Micro-Well (microRWELL) - as alternative TRD
amplification stages. We report on the design, construction, and in-beam
characterization of three MPGD-based TRD prototypes exposed to 3-20 GeV mixed
electron-hadron beams at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF) and at the CERN
SPS H8 beamline. Each detector consisted of a multi-layered radiator, an
approximately 2 cm deep drift region, an MPGD amplification stage optimized for
X-ray transition radiation detection in a 90%10% ratio of Xenon and CO2, and a
two-dimensional readout. The GEM-based TRD prototype achieved a pion
suppression factor of about 8 at 90% electron efficiency at FTBF, while the
Micromegas-based prototype - with an added GEM preamplification layer -
demonstrated improved gain stability and clear TR photon discrimination at
CERN. The microRWELL prototype achieved stable operation but limited gain.
Geant4-based studies confirmed the observed trends and highlighted the
sensitivity of the TR yield to cathode material and radiator configuration.
These studies represent the first in-beam measurements of Micromegas- and
microRWELL-based TRDs, along with discussion of the performance capabilities of
a triple-GEM-TRD. The results demonstrate the feasibility of MPGDs as scalable,
high-rate amplification structures for next-generation TRD applications.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore the potential of combining twist and strain in graphene to create new moire patterns and engineer correlated electronic states.

Method: The study involves selectively displacing native wrinkles in graphene to achieve a transition from a trigonal to a square moire pattern. A continuum model incorporating electrostatic interactions was used to reproduce the observed features, such as elliptically shaped AA domains and narrow bands with split Van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.

Result: The key findings include the successful observation of square moire patterns, evidence of strong electronic correlations, and the demonstration that the specific twist-strain combination minimizes elastic energy, leading to these features.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for the development of moire heterostructures with tailored electronic properties, with applications in next-generation electronics.

Abstract: We report the first observation of controlled, strain-induced square moire
patterns in stacked graphene. By selectively displacing native wrinkles, we
drive a reversible transition from the usual trigonal to square moire order.
Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals elliptically shaped AA domains, while
spectroscopy shows strong electronic correlation in the form of narrow bands
with split Van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. A continuum model with
electrostatic interactions reproduces these features under the specific
twist-strain combination that minimizes elastic energy. This work demonstrates
that the combination of twist and strain, or twistraintronics, enables the
realization of highly correlated electronic states in moire heterostructures
with geometries that were previously inaccessible.

Abstract: We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect

By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary
modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this
breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic
boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal
single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and
energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions
can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations
to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.

TL;DR: 3DASI offers a new way to realize programmable magnetic metamaterials where nanoscale geometry controls the emergence and dynamics of magnetic monopoles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding magnetic monopoles is crucial for advancing our knowledge of fundamental physics and could lead to breakthroughs in materials science, such as in developng new types of electronic and magnetic materials, potentially with novel applications in computing and high-tech devices.

Method: The researchers created a three-dimensional spin-ice lattice with diamond-bond geometry using two-photon lithography and fabricated it. They then used scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry to directly measure the stray magnetic fields of both charge-neutral and monopole vertices. They performed micromagnetic simulations and multipole expansions to analyze the data.

Result: They discovered that ice-rule vertices produce antivortex textures directly above their vertices, stabilized by the local frustrated two-in/two-out ordering principle. The stray magnetic field of monopoles was found to have a highly divergent profile, revealing that monopoles in 3DASI are non-trivial micromagnetic entities carrying both magnetic charge and an intrinsic moment. They exhibit anisotropic interactions dependent on their position on the lattice. As monopoles separate under an applied field, the dipolar contribution to their interaction reorients relative to the underlying Coulombic field, showing that monopole coupling can be tuned through geometry, which is determined by the local vertex topology.

Conclusion: These findings establish 3DASI as a programmable magnetic metamaterial where nanoscale geometry governs the energetics and dynamics of emergent magnetic charges.

Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, long hypothesised as fundamental particles carrying
isolated magnetic charge, emerge in spin-ice systems as fractionalised
excitations governed by the ice rule. Yet their three-dimensional field
structure has never been directly visualised. Here, we use two-photon
lithography and processing to fabricate a fully three-dimensional artificial
spin-ice lattice with diamond-bond geometry. We then use scanning
nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry to directly measure the stray magnetic fields of
both charge-neutral and monopole vertices. We find that ice-rule vertices
produce antivortex textures directly above their vertices, stabilised by the
local frustrated two-in/two out ordering principle. Direct imaging of the
monopole stray field shows a highly divergent profile. By correlating
experiment with micromagnetic simulations and performing a multipole expansion
of the reconstructed magnetisation, we reveal that monopoles in 3DASI are
non-trivial micromagnetic entities, carrying both magnetic charge and an
intrinsic moment, giving rise to anisotropic interactions that are dependent
upon the quasiparticles position on the lattice. Results suggest that as
monopoles separate under an applied field, the dipolar contribution to their
interaction reorients relative to the underlying Coulombic field, revealing
that monopole coupling is tunable through geometry, being set by the local
vertex topology. These findings establish 3DASI as a programmable magnetic
metamaterial in which nanoscale geometry governs the energetics and dynamics of
emergent magnetic charges.

Abstract: We report the discovery of an in plane quantization (IPQ) state in trilayer

conductivity of e2/h under strong in-plane magnetic fields. This state emerges
at a quantum critical point separating quantum anomalous Hall phases tuned by

by a self consistent approximation model, reveal that electron hole puddles
dominate charge transport in this regime, highlighting the essential role of
impurity disorder in stabilizing quantized critical transport. These findings
establish a tunable experimental framework that connects gap-closing physics

transport in magnetic topological insulators and a robust platform for probing
quantum criticality in topological systems.

Abstract: The polarization entanglement of photons emitted by semiconductor quantum
dots is unavoidably limited by the spin fluctuations of the host lattice
nuclei. To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon
pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet
exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a
function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is
intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as
self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape
anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a
possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine
interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and
electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate
limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum
dots.

Abstract: We compute and analyze the dependence of excitonic second- and third-harmonic
generation (SHG/THG) as a function of the optical excitation intensity in the
presence of static electric fields by solving the semiconductor Bloch
equations. Our simulations are performed for excitation of the strongly bound
intralayer exciton of an inversion-symmetric homobilayer of MoS2 with in-plane
electric fields. We demonstrate that for resonant excitation at the 1s
K-exciton the SHG and the THG show complex dependencies on both the strength of
the static field and the peak amplitude of the optical pulse. For sufficiently
intense optical excitation, the THG increases and the SHG increases
superlinearly with the amplitude of the static field as long as exciton
ionization is not yet dominating. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that
these dependencies arise from an interplay between several effects including
static and transient Stark shifts, exciton ionization, Wannier-Stark
localization, off-resonant Rabi oscillations, and a modified interference
between optical nonlinearities induced by the intraband acceleration. Our
findings offer several new possibilities for controlling the strong-field
dynamics of systems with strongly bound excitons.

framework, where $Q$ represents non-metricity. We assume that the scale factor
follows a power-law and explore how this model aligns with the expanding
universe. In this perspective, we develop a new agegraphic $f(Q)$ model and
analyze the graphical behavior for cosmic evolution. We analyze physical
characteristics of the model using the equation of state parameter,
$(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$ and the $(r-s)$ planes. The equation of
state parameter indicates a quintessence era characterized by accelerated
expansion. The $(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$-plane identifies the freezing
region and the Chaplygin gas model is represented in the $(r-s)$-plane.
Finally, we examine the stability of the non-interacting model by evaluating
the squared speed of sound. Our findings show that the non-interacting new
agegraphic dark energy model effectively resolves the cosmic coincidence
problem.

Abstract: Applications of effective field theory (EFT) and scattering amplitudes to
gravitational problems have recently produced many unique results that advanced
our understanding of the dynamics of compact binaries. Many of these results
were made possible by comparing gravitational scattering amplitudes in EFT with
exact expressions from general relativity. However, the latter expressions are
not easily available as they require intricate solution techniques for the
Teukolsky master equation, such as the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. In
this paper, we develop and present the first public package that enables
computations of gravitational scattering amplitudes in black hole perturbation
theory within the MST framework. Our package supports both analytic
computations to a given post-Minkowskian (PM) order in the low-frequency limit
and exact numerical computations for an arbitrary frequency of the perturbing
field. As an application, we compute scattering phase shifts and inelasticity
parameters for massless spin - 0, 1, and 2 fields resulting from scattering off
a rotating Kerr black hole through the third PM order and compare these results
with the exact numerical solutions.

TL;DR: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are considered a promising candidate for dark matter, bridging cosmology and quantum gravity. While several studies constrain their mass ranges, this work introduces new Solar System-scale methods to investigate PBHs, focusing on asteroid to dwarf planet mass PBHs and planetary mass PBHs. The proposed methods aim to detect measurable dipolar timing signatures in pulsar timing arrays and detectable accretion disk annuli flares (ADAF) through interactions with Kuiper Belt bodies. These complementary approaches open a new observational window to explore PBHs across previously unconstrained mass ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Primordial black holes (PBHs) represent a promising candidate for dark matter, and their study bridges the fields of cosmology and quantum gravity. However, their mass ranges remain largely unconstrained by conventional cosmological methods, making it a prime target for new observational approaches. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing innovative Solar System-scale methods to investigate PBHs across diverse mass ranges.

Method: The work proposes two complementary methods to search for PBHs: (1) asteroid to dwarf planet mass PBHs are searched using pulsar timing arrays, leveraging their unique precision and coverage of local observables, and (2) planetary mass PBHs are investigated through their interactions with Kuiper Belt bodies, which can generate detectable ADAF accretion flares. These methods cover mass ranges that are currently underexplored.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate the potential to detect measurable dipolar timing signatures in pulsar timing arrays for asteroid to dwarf planet mass PBHs and detectable accretion disk annuli flares (ADAF) for planetary mass PBHs. These signatures provide a new way to probe PBHs across a broader range of masses and open a new observational frontier for studying these elusive objects.

Conclusion: This work presents novel Solar System-scale methods to search for PBHs, offering a promising new direction for probing these objects across mass ranges that have previously been challenging to study. By combining timing signatures from pulsar timing arrays with accretion flares from interacting with Kuiper Belt bodies, this approach significantly expands our ability to investigate PBHs and potentially provides new insights into the nature of dark matter.

Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) represent one of the more interesting ways to
address dark matter, at the interface of both cosmology and quantum gravity. It
is no surprise then that testing PBHs is a venue of active interest, with
several cosmological and astrophysical probes constraining different mass
ranges. In this work, we propose novel Solar System scale searches for PBHs,
motivated by the unique precision and coverage of local observables. We show
that asteroid to dwarf planet mass PBHs can induce measurable dipolar timing
signatures in pulsar timing arrays, while planetary mass PBHs can generate
detectable ADAF accretion flares through interactions with Kuiper Belt bodies.
Together, these complementary approaches open a new observational frontier for

Abstract: The two-parameter inhomogeneous and time-dependent Pimentel solution of
Brans-Dicke theory is analyzed to probe the new thermal view in which General
Relativity is the zero-temperature (equilibrium) state of scalar-tensor
gravity. As the parameters vary, we uncover phenomenology not found before with
other exact solutions, nor contemplated thus far in the general theory. In the
process, we also discuss the anomalous limit to General Relativity of the
Pimentel geometry and show how the Mars solution of the Einstein equations is
its Einstein frame version.

Result: 提供了一个使用真实物质状态方程的数值结果，包括结构分层导致低频引力模式的出现。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了相对论星汐模型发展的主要障碍，并为引力波消散和二阶效应研究提供了工具。

Abstract: We develop a fully relativistic approach for determining the
frequency-dependent tidal response of a compact star. The strategy involves
matching the solution for the linearised fluid dynamics in the star's interior
to the spacetime perturbations in the near-zone surrounding the body, along
with an identification of the tidal driving and the star's response. Notably,
this identification is exact in Newtonian gravity and we provide strong
evidence that it remains robust also in the relativistic case. The argument
does not involve a sum over the star's quasinormal modes and hence circumvents
one of the obstacles that have held up the development of models for
relativistic tides. Numerical results are provided, at the proof-of-principle
level, for a realistic matter equation of state from the BSk family, including
composition stratification leading to the presence of low-frequency gravity
modes. We also sketch the connection with the field-theory inspired approach to
the problem, in which the tidal response is expressed in terms of asymptotic
scattering amplitudes.

*Peter K. S. Dunsby,Maria-Alexia Caldis,Eduardo Bittencourt*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a full covariant and gauge-invariant analysis of linear cosmological perturbations in Energy-Momentum Squared (EM$^2$) gravity, based on the 1+3 formalism. They analyze scalar, vector, and tensor modes on FLRW backgrounds for radiation and dust, and find that nonlinearity enters at $	extit{O}(	extit{η} 	extit{ρ}^2)$ corrections or modified equations of state. Scalar and vector perturbations' behavior differs from General Relativity (GR), with density and vorticity contrasts being enhanced or reduced based on coupling parameters. Tensor modes propagate as damped waves with effective masses. As $	extit{η} 	o 0$, all modes reduce to GR limits. The framework predicts robust signatures like early-time scalar tilts, tensor damping shifts, and altered vorticity decay, which could be tested against CMB and large-scale structure observations to constrain EM$^2$ gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of cosmological perturbations in EM$^2$ gravity, a specific type of modified gravity theory, to better understand its implications for cosmological observations.

Method: The authors employ the 1+3 formalism to conduct a thorough analysis of scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations in this gravity theory, considering both radiation and dust backgrounds.

Result: The analysis reveals how different coupling parameters and wavelength regimes affect the behavior of density contrast, vorticity, and tensor propagation, with apparent departures from General Relativity.

Conclusion: This framework allows for distinguishing EM$^2$ gravity from General Relativity through observations of the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure, providing a path for constraint.

Abstract: We present a fully covariant and gauge-invariant analysis of linear
cosmological perturbations in Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity. Working within
the 1+3 formalism, we derive the exact propagation equations for scalar,
vector, and tensor modes on FLRW backgrounds, in the case of radiation and
dust. Two representative subclasses are examined in detail, in which
non-linearity enters through $\mathcal{O}(\eta\rho^2)$ corrections or
modifications in the equation-of-state parameter and the sound speed. For
scalar perturbations, the density contrast can be enhanced or reduced relative
to General Relativity, depending on the coupling parameter and the wavelength
regime. A similar behaviour occurs for vector modes, allowing for a non-trivial
vorticity at early-times. Tensor modes, described by the magnetic part of the
Weyl tensor and the shear tensor propagate as damped waves with slowly varying
effective masses. All sectors reduce continuously to their GR limits as
$\eta\!\to\!0$. The framework isolates robust signatures - early-time scalar
tilts, tensor damping shifts, and altered vorticity decay - that can be
confronted with CMB and large-scale-structure observations to constrain these
theories of gravity.

### [104] [Poissonian Analysis of Glitches Observed in the LIGO Gravitational Wave Interferometers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05244)
*Giovanna Souza Rodrigues Costa,Julio Cesar Martins,Odylio Denys Aguiar*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the temporal distribution of glitches in LIGO data, focusing on their classification through morphological analysis. By comparing the empirical distribution of glitches to a Poisson model using R², the study finds that some glitch types (like 1400Ripples, Fast Scattering, and Power Line) do not adhere well to this model, suggesting their origins may not be Poissonian. The results offer a basis for distinguishing glitch classes and could improve mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing glitch mitigation in gravitational wave detectors through statistical analysis of their temporal distribution.

Method: Developed a statistical method comparing empirical glitch distribution to Poisson model using R², applied to LIGO data from O3 run and synthetic Poisson datasets.

Result: Some glitch types show significant deviations (R² ≤ 0.6) from the Poisson model, suggesting non-Poissonian origins. Detector and run-specific dependencies were observed in some cases.

Conclusion: A quantitative approach to distinguish glitch classes based on their Poissonian behavior could support better glitch mitigation strategies.

Abstract: This work investigates the temporal distribution of glitches detected by
LIGO, focusing on the morphological classification provided by the Gravity Spy
project. Starting from the hypothesis that these events follow a Poisson
process, we developed a statistical methodology to evaluate the agreement
between the empirical distribution of glitches and an ideal Poisson model,
using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) as the main metric. The analysis
was applied to real data from the LIGO detectors in Livingston and Hanford
throughout the O3 run, as well as to synthetic datasets generated from pure
Poisson distributions. The results show that while several morphologies exhibit
good agreement with the proposed model, classes such as 1400Ripples, Fast
Scattering, and Power Line display significant deviations ($R^2 \leq 0.6$),
suggesting that their origins do not strictly follow Poissonian statistics. In
some cases, a dependence on the detector or the observing run was also
observed. This analysis provides a quantitative basis for distinguishing glitch
classes based on their degree of "Poissonness", potentially supporting the
development of more effective glitch mitigation strategies in gravitational
wave detector data.

### [105] [Born-Infeld Electrogravity and Dyonic Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05273)
*Guadalupe Ahumada Acuña,Cecilia Bejarano,Rafael Ferraro*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Born-Infeld electrogravity is a theory that unifies gravity and electromagnetism with a single determinantal Lagrangian, using Palatini's formalism. The theory has two interpretations for its electrodynamic sector and its dynamics are analyzed for spherically symmetric dyonic solutions, showing similarities to Reissner-Nordström geometry but with softened curvature divergences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores a unifying theory of gravity and electromagnetism, aiming to understand its implications for spacetime structure and electrodynamics.

Method: The authors use Palatini's formalism to derive field equations independently for the metric, connection, and vector potential. They analyze spherically symmetric dyonic solutions by examining the horizon structure and extremality conditions.

Result: Born-Infeld electrogravity modifies the Reissner-Nordström geometry by softening curvature singularities but does not eliminate them. The two interpretations of the electrodynamic sector are consistent, and the solutions mimic Reissner-Nordström but with adjusted properties that allow for extremal states.

Conclusion: This theory successfully unifies gravity and electromagnetism with a single action, showing promise for further exploration of spacetime singularities and black hole physics.

Abstract: Born-Infeld electrogravity is defined through a Lagrangian that couples
gravity and electromagnetism within a single determinantal structure. The field
equations are derived in Palatini's formalism, where the metric, connection,
and vector potential are varied independently in the action. As a result, the
gravitational sector reduces to Einstein's equations with a torsion-free,
metric-compatible connection. The electrodynamic sector, in turn, admits two
equivalent interpretations or $pictures$: it can be seen either as a standard
Born-Infeld electrodynamics in an effective background geometry, or as an
$anomalous$ Born-Infeld electrodynamics in the physical metric. We illustrate
the dynamics by analyzing the horizon structure and extremality conditions of
spherically symmetric dyonic solutions. A comparison with the
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometry shows that Born-Infeld electrogravity softens
but does not eliminate curvature divergences, and geodesic incompleteness
persists.

### [106] [The $\boldsymbol{r^{-3}}$ Curvature Decay and the Infrared Structure of Linearized Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05345)
*Michael Wilson*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper identifies a critical curvature decay rate of $r^{-3}$ in asymptotically flat manifolds that separates dispersive and infrared gravitational behavior. Faster decay leads to purely continuous spectrum, while slower decay allows for static, marginally bound modes. Numerical studies confirm the scaling transition at $p=3$, aligning with previous findings on non-Abelian fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the spectral properties of linearized gravity is crucial for analyzing gravitational waves and memory effects, particularly their infrared behavior and potential connections to soft-gaviton phenomena.

Method: The authors analyze the Lichnerowicz operator in asymptotically flat spaces, studying its spectrum as a function of the curvature decay rate. They supplement their analytical results with numerical simulations of a radial model to confirm the scaling transition at $p=3$.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the curvature decay rate $|	ext{Riem}| acksim r^{-3}$ is a sharp threshold. For faster decay, the spectrum becomes continuous, corresponding to freely propagating tensor modes. Slower decay allows for marginally bound, finite-energy configurations, which are static and represent precursors of gravitational memory and soft-gaviton phenomena.

Conclusion: The identified $r^{-3}$ threshold provides a clear dividing line between dispersive and infrared behaviors in linearized gravity, with implications for understanding gravitational wave phenomena and their connections to gauge theories like Yang-Mills.

Abstract: We identify curvature decay $|\mathrm{Riem}| \sim r^{-3}$ as a sharp spectral
threshold in linearized gravity on asymptotically flat manifolds. For faster
decay, the spatial Lichnerowicz operator possesses a purely continuous spectrum
$\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(L) = [0,\infty)$, corresponding to freely radiating
tensor modes. At the inverse-cube rate, compactness fails and zero energy
enters $\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(L)$, yielding marginally bound, finite-energy
configurations that remain spatially extended. These static modes constitute
the linear precursors of gravitational memory and soft-graviton phenomena,
delineating the geometric boundary between dispersive and infrared behavior. A
complementary numerical study of the radial model \[ L_p = -\frac{d^2}{dr^2} +
\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2} + \frac{C}{r^p} \] confirms the analytic scaling law,
locating the same transition at $p = 3$. The eigenvalue trends approach the
flat-space limit continuously for $p > 3$ and strengthen progressively for $p <
3$, demonstrating a smooth yet sharp spectral transition rather than a discrete
confinement regime. The result parallels the critical threshold of the
non-Abelian covariant Laplacian~[18], indicating a common $r^{-3}$ scaling that
governs the infrared structure of gauge and gravitational fields.

### [107] [Non-resonant SABRE provides a new and versatile hyperpolarization approach for magnetic resonance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04851)
*Loren L. Smith,Warren S. Warren*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A new hyperpolarization method in magnetic resonance that achieves field-independent spin order and efficient magnetization without field control, applicable to a wide range of molecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the sensitivity and applicability of magnetic resonance techniques through novel hyperpolarization methods.

Method: Use of reversible exchange with para-hydrogen on transition metal catalysts; no field control required; field-independence achieved.

Result: Significantly enhanced signal (up to 10^4 times) on various molecules; effective for low-field applications; eliminates the need for precise field matching.

Conclusion: Expands the utility of SABRE and opens new possibilities for low-field magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy.

Abstract: Hyperpolarization approaches in magnetic resonance overcome the sensitivity
limitations imposed by thermal magnetization and play an important role in a
very wide range of modern applications. One of the newer strategies, variants
of what is generically called SABRE, uses para-hydrogen to form hydrides on
transition metal catalysts, followed by reversible exchange to polarize target
molecules in solution, and has produced large signal enhancements (approx.
10^4) on hundreds of different molecules, cheaply and rapidly. Most commonly,
the sample is kept in a constant field, matched to make the hydride scalar
coupling comparable to the frequency difference between hydride protons and
target protons (approx. 6.5 mT) or hydride protons and target heteronuclei
(approx. 0.5 {\mu}T). Here we demonstrate a different strategy, applicable to a
wide range of target molecules, that produces field-independent spin order in
the target molecules that is efficiently converted to magnetization. The
observed signal is even independent of field direction, hence significant
polarization can be achieved in a sample on a lab bench with no field control
at all. We show this signal arises from creation of two-spin order in the
target molecules, and discuss multiple ways this strategy should expand SABRE
generality and efficiency. We also show that, in many cases, the standard
assumption in low-field SABRE of a starting state with only singlet
polarization leads to incorrect results.

TL;DR: Graphene's wettability depends on the interplay between substrate charges and its polarizability, influencing water's molecular orientation at different scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the wettability of graphene supported on various substrates in contact with water is crucial for advancing its use in nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications.

Method: We combined heterodyne-detected sum-frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate CaF₂-supported graphene interfaces in contact with water.

Result: Surface properties dominate the macroscopic water orientation, but at the nanoscale, graphene's polarizability causes a local inverse orientation of water molecules above substrate charges.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the molecular origins of graphene's wetting behavior, suggesting new avenues to tailor its application in nanotechnology.

Abstract: Graphene supported on a substrate in contact with water underpins a wide
range of processes and technologies, yet its wettability remains controversial.
Understanding how substrate charges and graphene's properties influence water
organization is crucial. Here, we combine heterodyne-detected sum-frequency
generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations to
investigate CaF$_2$-supported graphene interfaces in contact with water. We
find that interfacial water orientation is primarily governed by the CaF$_2$
substrate's pH-dependent local electrostatics, confirming graphene's
macroscopic wetting transparency. However, at the nanoscale, graphene's
polarizability induces a local inversion of water's molecular orientation above
substrate charges, revealing subtle structural ordering that is masked in
spatially averaged measurements. These insights elucidate the molecular origins
of graphene's wetting behavior and suggest new avenues to tailor interfacial
phenomena in graphene-based nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications.

### [109] [Complex-Energy Second-Order Approximate Coupled-Cluster Methods for Electronic Resonances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05197)
*Cansu Utku,Garrette Pauley Paran,Thomas-C. Jagau*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes electronic resonances in molecules using complex-energy RI-CC2 methods, comparing them with EOM-EA-CCSD results. The new methods show good agreement with experiments for small systems but medium-sized systems show deviations. Semi-empirical spin-scaling improves results but still doesn't match experiments perfectly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electronic resonances is essential for various applications in molecular science. This paper aims to assess the accuracy of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics methods in describing these resonances.

Method: The researchers employed the complex absorbing potential and complex basis functions techniques with the RI-CC2 method. The second-order coupled cluster method (CC2) balances accuracy and computational cost. The resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation was used to reduce computational demands. The study focuses on negative electron affinities and resonance widths of molecules such as N2, CH2O, HCOOH, etc.

Result: EA-CC2 yields affinities approximately 0.1-0.2 eV smaller than EOM-EA-CCSD for small molecules. However, larger anions like uracil show deviations of up to 0.5 eV. The resonance widths from EA-CC2 are about 0.05-0.25 eV smaller compared to EOM-EA-CCSD. Semi-empirical spin-scaling improves results by increasing affinities and broadening widths, but discrepancies with experiments remain.

Conclusion: The RI-CC2 methods provide a computationally efficient way to study electronic resonances but require further refinement to better align with experimental data, especially for larger molecules. Semi-empirical spin-scaling can enhance accuracy but does not fully resolve the discrepancies.

Abstract: Electronic resonances are metastable states with finite lifetimes,
encountered in processes such as photodetachment, electron transmission, and
Auger decay. Resonances appear in Hermitian quantum mechanics as increased
density of states in the continuum rather than as discrete energy levels. To
describe resonances accurately, including their coupling to the continuum,
methods based on non-Hermitian quantum mechanics can be used, which yield
complex energies. In this work, we combine the complex absorbing potential
(CAP) and complex basis functions (CBF) techniques with the RI-CC2 method. The
second-order coupled cluster method (CC2) offers a good balance between
accuracy and computational cost by approximating equation-of-motion
coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) theory, making it suitable for
studying of electronic resonances in larger molecules. The
resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation further reduces computational
demands without significant loss in accuracy. We investigate the numerical
performance of the new complex-energy RI-CC2 methods focusing on temporary
anions. Negative electron affinities and decay widths can be computed using the
electron-attachment (EA) variant of RI-CC2. For N2, C2H4, CH2O, and HCOOH,
EA-CC2 yields affinities about 0.1-0.2 eV smaller than EOM-EA-CCSD, while
deviations reach 0.5 eV for larger anions such as uracil, naphthalene,
cyanonaphthalene, and pyrene. As a result of these trends, EA-CC2 is in better
agreement with experiment for the negative electron affinities than EOM-EA-CCSD
for all studied anions. The corresponding resonance widths from EA-CC2
calculations are about 0.05-0.25 eV smaller compared to EOM-EA-CCSD.
Semi-empirical spin-scaling increases electron affinities by 0.3-0.5 eV and
broadens resonance widths, improving the agreement with EOM-EA-CCSD but
worsening the agreement with experiment.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种计算原子力的方法，该方法基于Jastrow相关的Slater行列式 ansatz，能够生成与势能面（PES）一致且无偏的原子力。然而，该方法需要额外的$3N$次DFT计算，随着原子数$N$的增加，计算成本显著提高，为此提出了使用单次相关的Kohn-Sham计算来减少计算量。实验结果表明，该方法不仅提高了原子力的精确性，而且在基准测试集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型分子系统和计算资源的增加，电子结构计算方法面临更高的计算成本和复杂性。量子蒙特卡罗（QMC）方法作为一种基于高并行性的随机框架的电子结构计算方法，虽然在许多方面表现出色，但在计算原子力方面仍存在显著的局限性。

Method: 作者利用Jastrow相关的Slater行列式 ansatz，将行列式部分固定为基于平均场的方法（如密度泛函理论，DFT）得到的值，并使用相关的方法（如对偶Kohn-Sham方法）将$3N$次DFT计算减少到单次。这种方法改进了计算成本和可扩展性。

Result: 实验研究表明，该方法能有效减少计算量，同时在基准测试集上的实验表明，与CCSD(T)计算相比，该方法的无偏原子力更加准确且一致性更好。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种计算原子力的新方法，通过减少计算量并提高数值精度，显著提升了QMC方法的实用性，特别是在处理大型分子系统时。

Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic
structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for
accurate solutions of the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, suitable for
modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the
major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting
dynamical properties of large systems or large amounts of configurations, is
the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent
with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased
atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way
to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant
ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a
mean-field method, such as DFT. However, the proposed method has a significant
drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires $3N$
additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces, which is not negligible as
the system size increases. This paper presents a way to replace the $3N$ DFT
calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following
the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. This
improves the computational cost and scalability of the method. We also
demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only
the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three
molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the corrected VMC forces
with those obtained by the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with
perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces
are significantly biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give
values much closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Predicting quantum wavefunction probability distributions is crucial for
computational chemistry and materials science, yet machine learning (ML) models
often face a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. This study
compares Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
Systems (ANFIS) in modeling quantum probability distributions for the H$_{2}^+$
ion, leveraging data generated via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
While ANN achieved superior accuracy (R$^2$ = 0.99 vs ANFIS's 0.95 with
Gaussian membership functions), it required over 50x more parameters (2,305 vs
39-45). ANFIS, however, provided unique interpretability: its Gaussian
membership functions encoded spatial electron localization near proton
positions ($\mu = 1.2 A$), mirroring Born probability densities, while fuzzy
rules reflected quantum superposition principles. Rules prioritizing the
internuclear direction revealed the system's 1D symmetry, aligning with Linear
Combination of Atomic Orbitals theory--a novel data-driven perspective on
orbital hybridization. Membership function variances ($\sigma$) further
quantified electron delocalization trends, and peak prediction errors
highlighted unresolved quantum cusps. The choice of functions critically
impacted performance: Gaussian/Generalized Bell outperformed Sigmoid, with
errors improving as training data increased, showing scalability. This study
underscores the context-dependent value of ML: ANN for precision and ANFIS for
interpretable, parameter-efficient approximations that link inputs to physical
behavior. These findings advocate hybrid approaches in quantum simulations,
balancing accuracy with explainability to accelerate discovery. Future work
should extend ANFIS to multi-electron systems and integrate domain-specific
constraints (e.g., kinetic energy terms), bridging data-driven models and
fundamental physics.

Abstract: This review presents the covalent chemistry of carbon within the spin-radical
concept of electron interaction. Using the language of valence bond
trimodality, the regions of classical spinless covalence and its spin
counterpart are defined. Carbon is the only element exhibiting spin covalent
chemistry. Classical covalent chemistry of carbon concerns molecular substances
whose valence bond structure includes segregate or chained single sp3C-C bonds.
Substances with double sp2C-C and triple sp1C-C bonds are the subject of spin

forms the basis of algorithms governing the chemical modification of carbon
substances, polymerization processes, and catalysis involving them, making it
possible to supplement the empirical spin covalent chemistry of carbon with its

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy and applicability of MLIPs across different materials and architectures is crucial for advancing computational materials science.

Method: MLIPs were fine-tuned using datasets from ab initio molecular dynamics, and their performance was benchmarked across different architectures.

Result: Fine-tuning enhances force predictions by a factor of 5-15 and improves energy accuracy by 2-4 orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is a universal method to achieve quantitative accuracy in MLIPs while maintaining computational efficiency. The aMACEing Toolkit facilitates its adoption across various frameworks.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that fine-tuning transforms foundational
machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to achieve consistent, near-ab
initio accuracy across diverse architectures. Benchmarking five leading MLIP
frameworks (MACE, GRACE, SevenNet, MatterSim, and ORB) across seven chemically
diverse compounds reveals that fine-tuning universally enhances force
predictions by factors of 5-15 and improves energy accuracy by 2-4 orders of
magnitude. The investigated models span both equivariant and invariant, as well
as conservative and non-conservative, architectures. While general-purpose
foundation models are robust, they exhibit architecture-dependent deviations
from ab initio reference data; fine-tuning eliminates these discrepancies,
enabling quantitatively accurate predictions of atomistic and structural
properties. Using datasets constructed from equidistantly sampled frames of
short ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories, fine-tuning reduces force
errors by an order of magnitude and harmonizes performance across all
architectures. These findings establish fine-tuning as a universal route to
achieving system-specific predictive accuracy while preserving the
computational efficiency of MLIPs. To promote widespread adoption, we introduce
the aMACEing Toolkit, which provides a unified and reproducible interface for
fine-tuning workflows across multiple MLIP frameworks.

Conclusion: 该框架为开发预测性分子模型提供了一种可靠的方法。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics is a valuable tool to probe biological processes at the
atomistic level - a resolution often elusive to experiments. However, the
credibility of molecular models is limited by the accuracy of the underlying
force field, which is often parametrized relying on ad hoc assumptions. To
address this gap, we present a Bayesian framework for learning physically
grounded parameters directly from ab initio molecular dynamics data. By
representing both model parameters and data probabilistically, the framework
yields interpretable, statistically rigorous models in which uncertainty and
transferability emerge naturally from the learning process. This approach
provides a transparent, data-driven foundation for developing predictive
molecular models and enhances confidence in computational descriptions of
biophysical systems. We demonstrate the method using 18 biologically relevant
molecular fragments that capture key motifs in proteins, nucleic acids, and
lipids, and, as a proof of concept, apply it to calcium binding to troponin - a
central event in cardiac regulation.

Abstract: Controlling multiple wave properties simultaneously poses a key challenge in
coherent control of wave transport. We present a theory for joint coherent
control of transmission, reflection, and absorption in linear systems. We prove
that the numerical range provides the mathematical structure governing
achievable responses, and reveal non-abelian effects due to non-commutativity
between transmission, reflection, and absorption matrices. We provide an
algorithm to achieve arbitrary target responses. Our results establish a
theoretical foundation for joint coherent control of waves.

Abstract: A serial asymmetric transmission (AT) nanodevices based on the
grating-film-grating (G-F-G) structure are proposed and studied. By showing the
results of three different nanodevices as examples, it is proved that this kind

These three nanodevices can achieve high forward transmittivities of 0.69,
0.71, and 0.87 at the wavelengths of 714, 810, and 905 nm, respectively, and
the isolation ratio between forward and backward transmittivities are all more
than 10 dB. In addition, the effects of the incidence angle and lateral
displacement of upper gratings on device performance were also investigated,
revealing that optimal AT is achieved under normal incidence and zero

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is a powerful
technique for investigating molecular structures, orientations, and dynamics at
surfaces. However, its spatial resolution is fundamentally restricted to the
micrometer scale by the optical diffraction limit. Tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG)
using a scanning tunneling microscope has been developed to overcome this
limitation. The acquired spectra exhibit characteristic dips originating from
vibrational responses located within the strong broadband non-resonant
background (NRB), which distorts and obscures the molecular signals. By making
the second pulse temporally asymmetric and introducing a controlled delay
between the first and second laser pulses, the NRB was effectively suppressed,
which in turn amplified the vibrational response through interference and
facilitated the detection of weak vibrational signals. This interference also
made the technique phase-sensitive, enabling the determination of absolute
molecular orientations. Furthermore, forward- and backward-scattered signals
were simultaneously detected, conclusively confirming that the observed signals
originated from tip enhancement rather than far-field contributions. Finally,
the signal enhancement factor in TE-SFG was estimated to be $6.3\times
10^6-1.3\times 10^7$, based on the experimental data. This phase-sensitive
TE-SFG technique overcomes the optical diffraction limit and enables the
investigation of molecular vibrations at surfaces with unprecedented detail.

Conclusion: 该研究发现了一种逆向利用无序的策略，通过引入冗余的拓扑电荷，显著提升了光子晶体壁的性能，为光子相关领域开辟了新的设计思路。

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are widely known spatially localized
states experimentally implemented as quasi-BICs. Although they emerged as a
promising solution for achieving high-quality resonances in photonic
structures, quasi-BICs are confined to a very narrow range in k-space and are
highly sensitive to disorder. Here, we introduce quasi-bound flat bands in the
continuum (quasi-BFICs), a class of optical states where Bloch modes are found
within a photonic flat band, leading to a quasi-BIC behaviour at every k-point
above the light line. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the origin of
quasi-BFICs from the disorder-induced band folding, mode localization and
multiple topological charges in k-space, and identify the optimal strength of
structural disorder to maximise their generation probability. Angle-resolved
transmission and Q-factor measurements confirm the existence of quasi-BFICs,
opening new avenues for designing devices with high quality factor and
wide-angle response, presenting a counterintuitive strategy that leverages
disorder to enhance optical performance.

Abstract: We report on the eye-safe laser performance of Tm3+-doped calcium fluoride
crystals, modified with optically inactive "buffer" cations (Y3+, Lu3+, Gd3+,

### [120] [Annular Channel Eigenmodes: A Physical-Layer Approach to Suppressing OAM Modal Crosstalk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05070)
*Chenghao Li,Pengyang An,Ziao Huang,Qiwen Zhan,Guanghui Yuan*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Annular Channel Eigenmodes (ACEs) suppress modal crosstalk in orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based spatial-division multiplexing exponentially better than Gaussian perfect optical vortices (POVs), achieving nearly -30 dB crosstalk suppression, compared to -16 dB for POVs. They also offer 36% improvement in energy confinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving crosstalk reduction and energy confinement in OAM-based communications systems is crucial for enhanced data transmission efficiency and system reliability.

Method: Analytical derivation of ACEs as optimal band-limited solutions, reformulation of beam design as a Hermitian eigenvalue problem, numerical simulations, and experimental generation of ACEs.

Result: ACEs outperform Gaussian POVs in crosstalk suppression and energy confinement.

Conclusion: ACEs provide a physically robust solution for high-fidelity, high-density OAM communication systems.

Abstract: Modal crosstalk is a fundamental limitation for orbital angular momentum
(OAM)-based spatial-division multiplexing. Here, we introduce Annular Channel
Eigenmodes (ACEs) - rigorously derived as the optimal band-limited solution for
maximizing energy concentration within distinct annular channels. This approach
reformulates the design as a Hermitian eigenvalue problem, efficiently yielding
optimal beams that are physically isolated in space. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that under identical conditions, conventional Gaussian-enveloped
perfect optical vortices (POVs) exhibit an average modal crosstalk of -16 dB,
whereas ACEs suppress crosstalk to nearly -30 dB. Moreover, the crosstalk
suppression of ACEs continues to improve exponentially with increasing channel
width, while that of POVs saturates at a fundamental limit. We experimentally
generated ACEs and confirmed a 36% enhancement in energy confinement relative
to POVs. ACEs thus provide a physically robust basis for high-fidelity,
high-density OAM communications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores the connection between structured light and topological field theory, proposing new methods for applications in quantum computing and information theory.

Method: Uses advanced mathematical concepts like SU(2) principal bundles and non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory to describe polarisation and spatial mode interactions in vector beams, linking Chern-Simons charge to spin-orbit coupling.

Result: A framework describing non-Abelian phases in vector beams using Wilson lines, leading to potential experiments for detecting topological phases, applications in quantum field theory, and topological protection for information and communication technologies.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel theoretical foundation linking structured light to topological field theories, offering new avenues for quantum information and topological protection in optical systems.

Abstract: This work unveils a novel and fundamental connection between structured light
and topological field theory by showing how the natural geometrical setting for
paraxial vector beams is that of a $SU(2)$ principal bundle over
$\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. Going beyond the usual high-order Poincar\'e sphere
approach, we show how the nonseparable structure of polarisation and spatial
modes in vector beams is naturally described by a non-Abelian Chern-Simons
gauge theory. In this framework, we link the Chern-Simons charge to spin-orbit
coupling, and we propose a simple way to experimentally detect the presence of
non-Abelian phases through Wilson lines. This new insight on vector beams opens
new possibilities for realising and probing topological quantum field theories
using classical optics, as well as it lays the foundation for implementing
topologically protected classical and quantum information protocols with
structured light.

Conclusion: This advancement paves the way for TPM to be a versatile tool in both materials science and biomedical research, leveraging polarization flexibility and enhanced scanning capabilities.

Abstract: Transient absorption microscopy measures excited-state kinetics based on the
imaginary part of the pump-induced perturbation to the complex refractive
index, i.e. $\Im \{\Delta\mathcal N\}$, with applications in both materials and
biomedical sciences. Its complement, transient phase microscopy, enabled by
stable inline birefringent interferometry, measures the real part $\Re\{\Delta
\mathcal N\}$. The ability to switch between absorption and phase measurements
may yield a stronger signal, depending on the sample and probe wavelength. To
date, however, transient phase has not been coupled with galvanometer scanners,
thus limiting it to materials science applications and non-imaging
spectroscopy. Here, we extend transient phase microscopy to operate in a fast
galvanometer-scanning microscope with balanced detection, comparing amplitude
and phase measurements in graphene, hemoglobin, and red blood cells. We examine
the impacts and limitations introduced by galvanometer scanning, in addition to
relocation of the pump-probe combining dichroic to permit arbitrary
polarization of the pump.
