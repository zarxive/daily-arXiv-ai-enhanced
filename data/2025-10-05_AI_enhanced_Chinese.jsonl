Accordingly, flow reactors have been increasingly used in these\nfundamental combustion research at high-pressure conditions to achieve chemical\nkinetic modeling. However, these previous chemical kinetic modeling for\npyrolysis and oxidation has almost been completely conducted based on ideal gas\nassumption, which might fail at high-pressure conditions when real-fluid\nbehaviors become pronounced.

In this paper, we develop a renormalization group (RG) approach\nto explain this phenomenon. Here, RG is understood as an exact relation between\nthe stochastic properties of systems with different dissipative and noise\nterms, in contrast to the Kadanoff-Wilson coarse-graining procedure, which\ninvolves small-scale integration. We argue that the stochastic process in the\nideal limit is represented as a fixed point of the RG operator. The existence\nof such a fixed point confirms not only the convergence in the ideal limit, but\nalso the universality of the spontaneously stochastic process, i.e. its\nindependence from the type of dissipation and noise. The dominant eigenmode of\nthe linearized RG operator determines the leading correction in the convergence\nprocess. The RG eigenvalue $\\rho \\approx 0.84 \\exp(2.28i)$ is universal and it\nturns out to be complex, which explains the rather slow and oscillatory\nconvergence in the ideal limit.

The most unfavorable VIV responses occurred under skew wind conditions,\nwith maximum amplitudes increasing by approximately 20.1 percent for heaving\nVIV and 179.8 percent for torsional VIV in the closed-box girder, and by 3.9\npercent for heaving VIV in the twin-edge girder, relative to normal wind\nconditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u659c\u98ce\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u7bb1\u5f0f\u6865\u6881\u6a2a\u9694\u677f\u7684\u65cb\u6da1\u8bf1\u5bfc\u632f\u52a8\uff08VIV\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u98ce\u504f\u89d2\u548c\u6c14\u52a8\u89d2\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0cVIV\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u9501\u4f4f\u8303\u56f4\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u539f\u7406\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u6865\u6881\u5728 heave \u548c torsion \u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa coupling \u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7aef\u6bb5\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5fc3\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u6821\u6b63 VIV \u7684\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u504f\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u659c\u98ce\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b VIV \u7684\u6700\u4e0d\u5229\u54cd\u5e94\u6700\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u632f\u5e45\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6b63\u5e38\u98ce\u6761\u4ef6\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ea6 20.1%\u3001179.8% \u548c 3.9%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6865\u6881\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u98ce\u8f7d\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u65cb\u6da1\u8bf1\u5bfc\u632f\u52a8\uff08VIV\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u632f\u52a8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u6865\u6881\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6297\u9707\u6297\u98ce\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f39\u7c27\u60ac\u81c2\u7684\u659c\u653e\u7f6e\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u504f\u89d2\u548c\u6c14\u52a8\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684 VIV \u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u4e86 VIV \u7684\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u9501\u4f4f\u8303\u56f4\u968f\u98ce\u504f\u89d2\u548c\u6c14\u52a8\u89d2\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1) VIV \u7684\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u9501\u4f4f\u8303\u56f4\u968f\u98ce\u504f\u89d2\u548c\u6c14\u52a8\u89d2\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u539f\u7406\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff1b(2) \u6865\u6881\u5728 heave \u548c torsion \u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa coupling \u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7aef\u6bb5\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5fc3\u504f\u79fb\uff1b(3) \u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6821\u6b63 VIV \u7684\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u504f\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b(4) \u659c\u98ce\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b VIV \u7684\u6700\u4e0d\u5229\u54cd\u5e94\u6700\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u632f\u5e45\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6b63\u5e38\u98ce\u6761\u4ef6\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ea6 20.1%\u3001179.8% \u548c 3.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u659c\u98ce\u5bf9\u6865\u6881\u6a2a\u9694\u677f\u7684\u65cb\u6da1\u8bf1\u5bfc\u632f\u52a8\uff08VIV\uff09\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u539f\u7406\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9884\u6d4b VIV \u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6865\u6881\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u98ce\u8f7d\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6539\u9020\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

The method involves solving Maxwell's equations\nfor a large number of coupled electromagnetic plane-waves inside the dielectric\nslab, then matching the boundary conditions at the interface between the\nincidence medium and the slab, as well as those at the interface between the\nslab and the transmittance medium. In this way, one obtains the E-field and\nH-field amplitudes for all the reflected and transmitted plane-waves (i.e.,\ndiffraction orders as well as evanescent waves) that emerge within the\nincidence and transmittance media. If the refractive index (or dielectric\ntensor) of the holographic slab happens to vary in the thickness direction, one\ntreats the slab as a number of thin layers stacked upon each other, then\ncomputes and combines the scattering matrices of these layers to arrive at the\ncomplete solution for the entire stack. The goal of the present paper is to\nextend the standard RCWA method to the case where the hologram's dielectric\ntensor varies in the thickness direction (in addition to being periodically\nmodulated along an in-plane axis), without slicing up the thick hologram into a\nnumber of thin layers.

These pre-peaks are puzzling\nin view of the apparently contradicting facts that neat amines show pre-peaks\nmuch weaker than neat alkanols, while water-rich aqueous alcohols do not. These\nobservations can be intuitively rationalized by noting that the amine head\ngroup have two hydrogen atoms when the hydroxyl group have only one, but they\noppose the following two facts: i) computer simulations show\nmicro-heterogeneity for both systems; ii) amines mix with water better than\nalcohols, both over larger concentrations and alkyl tails lengths.\n  The study of the atom-atom pair correlation functions and related structure\nfactors allows to understand the microscopic molecular details. The most\ninteresting observation is that the amine head groups accumulate preferentially\nat the surface of the water domains, and increasingly better with longer alkyl\ntail, thus allowing to stabilize both the water and alkylamine domains, hence\navoiding macroscopic demixing, except at high water concentrations when amines\nare scarce to achieve efficient surface saturation. The amine domains appear as\ndisordered bilayers. Hence, aqueous amines are analogous to an inverse micelle\nmelt and as precursor micro-emulsion.\n  This stable micro-segregation produces large domain oscillations in the long\nrange part of the correlation functions, translating into positive pre-peaks\nand negative anti-peaks in the related structure factors, the latter which\ncontribute destructively to produce the prominent scattering pre-peak observed\nin the x-ray experiments.\n  The model dependence is shown to be quite important, both for water and\nsolute models.

Transversal gates are a naturally fault-tolerant way to manipulate\nlogical qubits but cannot be universal themselves. Protocols such as magic\nstate distillation are needed to achieve universality via measurements and\npostselection. A phase is a region of parameter space with smoothly varying\nlarge-scale statistical properties except at its boundaries. Here, we find a\nphase of continuously tunable logical unitaries for the surface code\nimplemented by transversal operations and decoding that is robust against\ndephasing errors.

Hard computational problems, however, require deep circuits that\nplace high demands on classical variational parameter optimization. Ultimately,\nthis has necessitated investigations into alternative methods for effective\nQAOA parameterizations. Here, we study a parameterization scheme based on\nclassical chaotic recursive mapping, which enables significant reductions in\nthe scaling of the variational parameter space. Through numerical\ninvestigations of hard Maximum Satisfiability problems, we demonstrate that the\nchaotic mapping can effectively match the performance of standard QAOA when\nsubject to a limited number of classical optimization iterations and\nshort-depth circuits.

However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications,\ncandidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always\ninteract with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic\nquasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial\nstructure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\\em\nopen} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type\nand time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian\nregime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum\nsystems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the\ntime-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine\nmultipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin\ncorrelators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In\nparticular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in\nthe Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as\nalso discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to\nKitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson\nloop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory\neffects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also\nacquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions.

Wall"], "title": "Bounding field excursions along null geodesics with applications to cosmology", "comment": null, "summary": "Scalar fields in theories of gravity often inhabit a moduli space of vacua,\nand coherent spatial or temporal variations in their expectation values can\nproduce measurable gravitational effects. Such variations are expected in\ncontexts ranging from inflationary cosmology to the near-horizon regions of\nnear-extremal black holes, where they can deflect light rays and shift\nhorizons. This work derives a quantitative field excursion bound (FEB) on\nscalar variations along null geodesics, expressed in terms of the expansion\nparameter. The bound follows from the Raychaudhuri equation, assuming that all\nother fields satisfy the null energy condition (NEC). It is saturated in\ncertain spacetimes containing a timelike naked singularity.

Application of external magnetic\nfields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered\nphases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak\ncoupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been\nproposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to\nfeature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the\nzero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific\nfamily of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite\nvalue in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis\n(arXiv:2501.18591). Here, we predict that a confluence of external magnetic\nfields and such a non-Hermiticity can amplify the magnitude of commuting class\nmasses for subcritical strengths of interactions in Dirac liquids, an emergent\nphenomenon named non-Hermitian amplification of magnetic catalysis.

We show that the perturbations admit a\nregular conformal compactification at null and timelike infinity, where the\ndegree of regularity increases linearly with the rate of decay of the initial\ndata to Kerr initial data. In particular, the compactification is smooth if the\ninitial data decays rapidly to Kerr initial data. This generalizes results of\nFriedrich, who constructed spacetimes with a smooth conformal compactification\nin the case when the initial data is identical to Kerr initial data on the\ncomplement of a compact set. Our results rely on a novel formulation of the\nEinstein equations about Minkowski spacetime introduced by the author, that\nallows one to formulate the dynamic problem as a quasilinear, symmetric\nhyperbolic PDE that is regular at null infinity and with null infinity being at\na fixed locus. It is not regular at spacelike infinity, due to the asymptotics\nof Kerr. Thus the main technical task is the construction of solutions near\nspacelike infinity, using tailored energy estimates. To accomplish this, we\norganize the equations according to homogeneity with respect to scaling about\nspacelike infinity, which identifies terms that are leading, respectively lower\norder, near spacelike infinity, with contributions from Kerr being lower order.", "AI": {"tldr":
