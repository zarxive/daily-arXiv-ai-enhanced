Abstract: We study in detail the form of the orbits in integrable generalized
H\'enon-Heiles systems with Hamiltonians of the form $H = \frac{1}{2}(\dot{x}^2
+ Ax^2 + \dot{y}^2 + By^2) + \epsilon(xy^2 + \alpha x^3).$ In particular, we
focus on the invariant curves on Poincar\'e surfaces of section ($ y = 0$) and
the corresponding orbits on the $x-y$ plane. We provide a detailed analysis of
the transition from bounded to escaping orbits in each integrable system case,
highlighting the mechanism behind the escape to infinity. Then, we investigate
the form of the non-escaping orbits, conducting a comparative analysis across
various integrable cases and physical parameters.

TL;DR: 研究了二维哈伯德模型在不同 doping 下的态密度和 $B_{1g}$ 张量磁 susceptibility 的行为，通过_cluster 动态平均场理论得到结果。在弱相关 Fermi 液体 regime 下，两个量在 Lifshitz 临界 doping $p_{LT}$ 附近对称。在强相关 regime 下，低 doping 时出现 pseudo 洞性态和 Fermi 液体过渡，导致在 $p_{LT}$ 处 Fermi 面从孔状变为电子状时 asymmetric 且不连续的变化，Lifshitz 临界行为随着 pseudo 洞性态和 Fermi 液体过渡而改变。这些结果符合实验观察，应促进进一步的实验研究。

Motivation: 研究材料在相变下的性质变化，尤其是在二维 Hubbard 模型下的行为，有助于理解复杂相变及其物理机制。

Method: 采用_cluster 动态平均场理论分析二维 Hubbard 模型，研究了不同 doping 下的态密度和张量磁 susceptibility 的行为。

Result: 弱相关 Fermi 液体 regime 下，态密度和 $B_{1g}$ 张量磁 susceptibility 在 $p_{LT}$ 附近对称变化；强相关 regime 下，低 doping 时出现 pseudo 洞性态和 Fermi 液体过渡，导致在 $p_{LT}$ 处 asymmetric 且不连续的变化。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，二维 Hubbard 模型在不同 doping 下的行为复杂，尤其是 pseudo 洞性态和 Fermi 液体过渡对 Lifshitz 临界行为的影响。这些结果为材料科学和量子统计物理提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the behavior of the density of states and the $B_{1g}$ nematic
susceptibility extracted from Raman response data across the doping-driven
Lifshitz transition comparing the weak and strong interaction cases. Our
results were obtained using cluster dynamical mean field theory for the
two-dimensional Hubbard model. In the weakly correlated Fermi liquid regime,
both quantities are approximately symmetric around the Lifshitz transition
doping $p_{LT}$. In the strongly correlated regime, the low-doping pseudogap
leads to an asymmetric, discontinuous evolution when the Fermi surface changes
from hole-like to electron-like at $p_{LT}$. The Lifshitz transition thus
changes character because it is tied to the pseudogap-Fermi-liquid transition.
These results are consistent with available observations and should foster
further experimental investigations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a recently discovered heavy-fermion compound that orders at
T$_N\approx 0.4$ K and exhibits a magnetic field-tuned quantum critical point
at $H \approx 10$ kOe. In this work, we have grown YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ single
crystals by the self-flux method, to investigate their physical properties at
ambient pressure and their electrical transport properties under hydrostatic
pressure. At higher temperatures, we observed a decrease in the Kondo
temperature, accompanied by the appearance of a local minimum followed by a
local maximum, associated with the onset of the coherent Kondo regime. Power
law fitting at low temperatures indicated a recovery of the Fermi-liquid regime
for pressures below 1 GPa. Above 1 GPa, a reentrance of non-Fermi-liquid
behavior is suggested by a decrease in the exponent $n$, accompanied by a
substantial increase in the parameter $A$, indicating the approach of a new
quantum criticality tuned by hydrostatic pressure. The broad range of
interactions present in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$, including RKKY, crystalline electric
field (CEF), and Kondo lattice effects, appears to lead to a complex phase
diagram. We present a putative phase diagram featuring double quantum
criticality tuned by both magnetic field and hydrostatic pressure.

Abstract: In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are
smooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in
two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various
interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on
previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as
an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite.
We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated
with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we
show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that
results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG)
flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable
Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed
points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an
emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c
\rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction
of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement
entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum
fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where
interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies
provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical
points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing
many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role
of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality
classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open
questions and possible future directions.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The magnetic properties of the Tb-honeycomb lattice compound TbPt6Al3, which
crystallizes in the NdPt6Al3-type trigonal structure, have been studied by the
measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetization M(T, B), and specific
heat on single-crystalline samples. The magnetic susceptibility, M(T)/B, for B
|| c = 0.1 T shows a cusp at TN = 3.5 K, which temperature decreases with
increasing the magnitude of B || c, while M(T)/B for B || a = 0.1 T remains
constant with decreasing temperature below TN. This anisotropic behavior
suggests a collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order of the Tb3+ moments pointing
along the c axis. The data of M(T)/B for T > 10 K on the single crystal and
that of inelastic neutron scattering from powdered samples have been
simultaneously analyzed using the crystal field model. The analysis reveals the
non-Kramers doublet ground state for the Tb3+ ion under the trigonal crystal
field. The neutron powder diffraction measurement shows that the collinear AFM
structure with a magnetic propagation vector k = [0, 0, 0] is associated with
moments of 5.1 {\mu}B/Tb pointing along the c axis. Comparison of the magnetic
point group with the nontrivial spin Laue group indicates that TbPt6Al3 is
classified into bulk g-wave altermagnets.

### [6] [Entanglement architecture of beyond-Landau quantum criticality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09983)
*Menghan Song,Ting-Tung Wang,Liuke Lyu,William Witczak-Krempa,Zi Yang Meng*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Beyond-Landau quantum critical theories exhibit distinct entanglement architectures: Landau criticality induces compact multipartite entanglement, while non-Landau criticalities lead to loopy, non-uniform entanglement distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the entanglement structures at various quantum critical points is essential for advancing our knowledge of quantum phases of matter and emergent phenomena such as gauge theories.

Method: We employed entanglement microscopy, using full entanglement tomography of reduced density matrices and quantum Monte Carlo sampling to analyze multipartite entanglement near various critical transitions.

Result: Our findings reveal that Landau criticality and non-Landau criticality exhibit fundamentally different entanglement architectures. Specifically, Landau criticality amplifies compact entanglement, while non-Landau criticality leads to extended, non-loopy entanglement configurations. This distinction is observed across different types of quantum phase transitions, including conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, unconventional XY$^*$, Néel-VBS transitions, and in critical resonating valence bond wavefunctions.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive characterization of entanglement architecture at quantum critical points beyond the Landau paradigm, highlighting the importance of entanglement measures in distinguishing different quantum phases of matter and their underlying critical phenomena.

Abstract: Quantum critical points beyond the Landau paradigm exhibit fractionalized
excitations and emergent gauge fields. Here, we use entanglement
microscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions
and subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the
entanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine
multipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling
of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and
unconventional XY$^*$, and N\'eel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a
dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while
non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy
configurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of
three-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions.
Similar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this
multipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge
theories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in
beyond-Landau quantum critical theories.

### [7] [Intrinsic disorder in the candidate quantum spin ice Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10101)
*T. J. Hicken,P. Meadows,D. Prabhakaran,A. Szabó,S. E. Dutton,C. Castelnovo,K. Moovendaran,T. S. Northam de la Fuente,L. Mangin-Thro,G. B. G. Stenning,M. J. Gutmann,G. Sala,M. B. Stone,P. F. Henry,D. J. Voneshen,J. P. Goff*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper explores the intrinsic defect structure of quantum spin liquid Pr2Zr2O7 and proposes that the observed properties arise from specific types of structural defects, namely Zr^{4+} stuffing and O^{2-} vacancies, which lead to additional crystal electric field excitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum spin liquids is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, and understanding the underlying structural mechanisms is essential for applications.

Method: The research employed neutron and X-ray scattering techniques combined with density functional theory to analyze the defect structure in Pr2Zr2O7.

Result: The main defect in Pr2Zr2O7 involves the insertion of Pr^{3+} ions into Zr^{4+} sites, creating Pr-O bonds, and the presence of O^{2-} vacancies. Additionally, a neighboring O^{2-} ion shifts to an interstitial site.

Conclusion: The identified structural defects explain the observed single-ion magnetism and the broadening of pinch points in magnetic diffuse scattering. The low level of structural disorder has a magnified effect due to the influence on neighboring Pr sites, contributing to the quantum mechanical effects.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids with long-range entanglement are of great interest for
applications in quantum technology. The quantum spin ice Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is a
promising example, where it is believed that structural disorder plays a key
role in enhancing quantum mechanical effects by introducing strains that split
the ground state doublet akin to the effect of a local disordered transverse
field. However, the precise defect structure responsible for this behaviour is
unknown. Here we have determined the intrinsic defect structure of
Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ using neutron and x-ray scattering techniques supported by
density functional theory. We find the main defect is the stuffing of Zr$^{4+}$
sites by Pr$^{3+}$ ions, accompanied by charge compensating O$^{2-}$ vacancies,
and the relaxation of a neighbouring O$^{2-}$ ion to an interstitial site. Our
results explain the single-ion magnetism by considering the non-magnetic
singlets that arise on neighbouring sites as a result of the defect structure.
These singlets account for additional features in the crystal electric field
excitations. The effects caused by this low level of structural disorder are
magnified since several neighbouring Pr sites are affected. This makes a
significant contribution towards the observed broadening of pinch points in the
magnetic diffuse scattering, which was previously attributed purely to quantum
effects.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates quantum phase transitions in CeCu5.8Ag0.2 using anisotropic external magnetic fields, revealing that quantum critical fluctuations are suppressed due to the spin anisotropy of the ground state. The transitions are driven by three-dimensional spin-density wave fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum phase transitions is crucial for advancing condensed matter physics, particularly in correlated metals where such transitions are not well understood.

Method: The study employed anisotropic external magnetic fields as tuning parameters to observe the suppression of quantum critical fluctuations in the material CeCu5.8Ag0.2.

Result: The suppression of quantum critical fluctuations is linked to the spin anisotropy of the long-range ordered ground state, and the transitions are identified as being driven by three-dimensional spin-density wave fluctuations.

Conclusion: The findings provide insight into the role of spin anisotropy and three-dimensional spin-density wave fluctuations in quantum phase transitions within this material and suggest broader implications for the understanding of quantum critical phenomena in correlated systems.

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are among the most intriguing phenomena that can
occur when the electronic ground state of correlated metals are tuned by
external parameters such as pressure, magnetic field or chemical substitution.
Such transitions between distinct states of matter are driven by quantum
fluctuations, and can give rise to macroscopically coherent phases that are at
the forefront of condensed matter research. However, the nature of the critical
fluctuations, and thus the fundamental physics controlling many quantum phase
transitions, remain poorly understood in numerous strongly correlated metals.
Here we study the model material CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ to gain insight into
the implications of critical fluctuations originating from different regions in
reciprocal space. By employing an external magnetic field along the
crystallographic $a$- and $c$-axis as auxiliary tuning parameter we observe a
pronounced anisotropy in the suppression of the quantum critical fluctuations,
reflecting the spin anisotropy of the long-range ordered ground state at larger
silver concentration. Coupled with the temperature dependence of the quantum
critical fluctuations, these results suggest that the quantum phase transition
in CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ is driven by three-dimensional spin-density wave
fluctuations.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种系统化发现量子相的新途径，并为量子相的研究开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: The discovery and understanding of new quantum phases has time and again
transformed both fundamental physics and technology, yet progress often relies
on slow, intuition-based theoretical considerations or experimental
serendipity. Here, we introduce a general gradient-based framework for targeted
phase discovery. We define a differentiable function, dubbed "target-phase loss
function", which encodes spectral fingerprints of a quantum state, thereby
recasting phase search as a tractable optimization problem in Hamiltonian
space. The method is broadly applicable to phases characterized by ground-state
degeneracy and can be extended to a wide range of symmetry-broken and
topological orders. As a demonstration, we apply it to spinless fermions on the
kagome lattice and discover two distinctive fractional Chern insulators (FCIs),
verified through detailed exact diagonalization: (i) at filling $\nu = 1/3$, a
"non-ideal" Abelian FCI whose band geometry lies far beyond the Landau-level
mimicry paradigm and all recent generalizations; and (ii) at $\nu = 1/2$, a
non-Abelian FCI stabilized purely by finite-range two-body interactions. These
results provide the first explicit realization of such types of FCIs and
establish a versatile paradigm for systematic quantum-phase discovery.

### [10] [Observational Constraints on a Spinor Field Generalized Chaplygin Gas Model in a Spherically Symmetric FLRW Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09733)
*Mahendra Goray,Bijan Saha*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  discusses a spinor field-based generalized Chaplygin gas model that unifies dark matter and dark energy, addresses dark energy's nature, fine-tuning problems, and the Hubble tension, and suggests the model provides a viable alternative to LambdaCDM, particularly in the late universe, with potential implications for the Hubble constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  driven by unresolved issues in the standard LambdaCDM model, such as dark energy's nature, fine-tuning problems, and the Hubble tension, the paper aims to propose a new model to address these shortcomings.

Method:  the paper constructs a spinor field-based Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model within a spherically symmetric Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime, incorporating a nonlinear spinor field and open universe geometry. It constrains the model parameters using Type Ia supernovae from the binned Pantheon compilation, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC) and SDSS, including baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques are employed for parameter estimation.

Result:  the model provides a competitive and viable alternative to the LambdaCDM model, particularly in the late-time universe. The model also predicts a lower present-day Hubble constant, which may offer a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.

Conclusion:  the proposed spinor-based GCG model successfully unifies dark matter and dark energy within a unified framework and addresses several unresolved issues in cosmology. The model's predictions regarding the Hubble constant and its potential to resolve the Hubble tension suggest its validity and significance in cosmological研究.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the standard LambdaCDM model in describing
the evolution of the universe, several unresolved issues remain, such as the
true nature of dark energy, fine-tuning problems, and the persistent Hubble
tension. Motivated by these shortcomings, we construct a spinor field-based
Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model that unifies dark matter and dark energy
within a spherically symmetric Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
spacetime. This framework incorporates a nonlinear spinor field and considers
an open universe geometry. We constrain the model parameters using the latest
observational datasets, including Type Ia supernovae from the binned Pantheon
compilation, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC) and
SDSS, including baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. Employing Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, we obtain best-fit values that indicate
the spinor GCG model provides a competitive and viable alternative to the
LambdaCDM, particularly in the late-time universe. Furthermore, the model
predicts a lower present-day Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution
to the Hubble tension. The results highlight the rich phenomenology of spinor
fields and their possible role in the dynamics of dark energy through spacetime
interaction.

Abstract: We study anisotropic Bianchi-I (BI) cosmology, incorporating quantum
gravitational corrections into the Einstein equation through the
scale-dependent Newton coupling and cosmological term, as determined by the
flow equation of the effective action for gravity. For the cosmological term
$\Lambda_0=0$, we derive the quantum-corrected power-series solution for a
general equation-of-state parameter $w$ in the range $-1<w\leq 1$ in the form
of expansions in both inverse cosmic time and the anisotropy parameter. We give
a general criterion, valid for any $\Lambda_0$, if the solution becomes
isotropic in the late time, which indicates that the universe becomes isotropic
for most cases of $-1<w<1$ except $w=1$. By numerical analysis, we show that
quantum corrections lead to earlier isotropization compared to the classical
case starting from an initially highly anisotropic state. In contrast, for
$\Lambda_0 >0$, we obtain the inverse power-series solution in the exponential
of the cosmic time. We find that the universe always becomes isotropic in the
late time, in accordance with the cosmic no hair theorem, and the quantum
corrections make the isotropization faster. We also briefly summarize the
Kasner solution and its generalization with quantum corrections.

Abstract: The Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solution to the Einstein equations
describes the dynamics of a self-gravitating spherically symmetric dust cloud
with an arbitrary density profile and any distribution of initial velocities,
encoded in three arbitrary functions $f(R)$, $F(R)$, and $\tau_0(R)$, where $R$
is a radial coordinate in the comoving reference frame. A particular choice of
these functions corresponds to a wormhole geometry with a throat defined as a
sphere of minimum radius at a fixed time instant. In this paper we explore LTB
wormholes and discuss their possible observable appearance studying in detail
the effects of gravitational lensing by such objects. For this aim, we study
photon motion in wormhole space-time inscribed in a closed Friedmann dustfilled
universe and find the wormhole shadow as it could be seen by a distant
observer. Since the LTB wormhole is a dynamic object, we analyze the dependence
of its shadow size on the observation time and on the initial size of the
wormhole region. We reveal that the angular size of the shadow exhibits a
non-monotonic dependence on the observation time. At early times, the shadow
size decreases as photons with smaller angular momentum gradually reach the
observer. At later times, the expansion of the Friedmann Universe becomes a
dominant factor that leads to an increase in the shadow size.

$M\omega_{\rm th}\!\approx\!0.39$ (for the dominant mode), the spectrum
undergoes a qualitative break: with the black hole mimicker displaying
significant deviations from the black hole. Though individual plunge SNRs in
extreme mass ratio events are low and detecting them in a sea of noise is
difficult, the coherent spectral features identified here may allow for
enhancing the SNR by using multiple events.

Abstract: We have investigated the cosmological consequences of the model in the

\alpha\,R+\beta\,RT+\gamma\,RL_{m}-\eta$ with $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and
$\eta$ as coupling constants, we have solved the modified field equations to
get the Hubble function $H(z)$ in terms of $H_{0}$, $\Omega_{m0}$,
$\Omega_{r0}$, $\Omega_{\eta}$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$. To ensure that the model
is consistent with the physically observed universe, we constrained the model
parameters using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis on joint datasets of
cosmic chronometer and Pantheon samples. Using these approximated model
parameter values, we investigated the universe's cosmic evolution history,
including the deceleration parameter, effective equation of state, dark energy
equation of state, total dark energy density parameters, universe age, and so
on. In addition, to assess the physical acceptability and stability of the
generated model, we conducted the Om diagnostic test, causality test, and

*Tom van der Steen,Henri Inchauspé,Thomas Hertog,Aurélien Hees*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper derives velocity-dependent corrections to the LISA gravitational wave detector response, which are found to introduce residual effects up to 2% in the loudest events, comparable to current uncertainties, but potentially significant for parameter estimation and mock dataset simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of the LISA detector response is critical for reliable gravitational wave detection, especially for high-precision observations of massive black hole binaries.

Method: The authors developed a modified response simulator, lisagwresponse, to incorporate velocity-dependent corrections and analyzed their impact on signal-to-noise ratios for mass ranges of $10^6$ to $10^8$ solar masses.

Result: The corrections introduce residual SNRs up to 2% and fractional differences up to 0.04%, which are small but comparable to existing uncertainties and may provide sky-localization improvements.

Conclusion: While the corrections are minor in magnitude, their potential relevance for parameter estimation and simulation underscores the need to account for velocity effects in future analyses.

Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatory LISA is expected to
detect massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with high signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs), ranging up to thousands. Such high-precision observations require
accurate modeling of the detector response. However, current derivations of the
response function neglect the motion of the spacecraft during light travel
time, omitting velocity-dependent terms of order $\beta = v/c \sim 10^{-4}$. In
this work, we derive the velocity-dependent corrections to the gravitational
wave response. We analyze the contribution of the velocity-terms for MBHBs in
the mass range $[10^6,10^8]\:\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ using a modified version of
the state-of-the-art response simulator lisagwresponse. We find that
corrections introduce residual SNRs up to $\sim 2$ for the loudest events and
fractional differences up to $0.04\%$, compared to lisagwresponse. While small,
these effects are comparable to current waveform modeling uncertainties and
imprint distinctive sky-localization signatures, making them potentially
relevant for parameter estimation of high-mass MBHBs and simulation of mock
datasets.

Abstract: Models of quantum spacetime that are consistent with quantum energy
inequalities potentially enable the formation of Planck scale wormholes.
Building on the proposal of Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever that such microscopic
spacetime structures might be enlarged to macroscopic size, we revisit Roman's
analysis of a wormhole in an inflationary de Sitter background. In this
context, we introduce a refined quasi-local toy mechanism, which we call the
local inflation bubble. This construction inflates a compact region of
spacetime and thereby magnifies the underlying microstructure. Using the
Einstein equations we determine the required stress-energy to sustain the
bubble and obtain intrinsic lower bounds for the corresponding energy density,
while acknowledging the continued reliance on exotic matter.

Motivation: Public health needs rapid and precise virus detection.

Method: Integrated AI with NIR-SERS platform using AuNSt and AuCNT for enhanced sensitivity and specificity.

Result: Accurate classification of respiratory viruses, including influenza and coronaviruses at various strain levels.

Conclusion: This platform addresses current limitations by improving sensitivity, specificity, and overcoming plasmonic mismatch and AI limitations, enhancing global public health preparedness.

Abstract: Strain-level identification of viruses is critical for effective public
health responses to potential outbreaks, yet current diagnostic methods often
lack the necessary speed or sensitivity. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) offers great potential for fast and precise virus clarification through
unique vibrational fingerprints of biological components. However, existing
protocols typically operate outside of the tissue's transparent near-infrared
(NIR) window, and are further limited by the intrinsic complexity of clinical
viral samples, which complicates spectral analysis and recognition. Here, we
report an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered NIR-SERS platform that
integrates machine learning with a rationally designed hybrid substrate: gold
nanostars (AuNSt) coupled with gold-coated carbon nanotube arrays (AuCNT). This
architecture generates highly localized plasmonic hot spots resonant tuned to
NIR excitation, as confirmed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS),
enabling effective signal amplification from viral components. Our system and
protocols provide accurate classification of respiratory viruses, including
influenza viruses and coronaviruses, not only at the type and subtype levels,
but also the more challenging strain level. This approach overcomes the
plasmonic mismatch in conventional SERS and the lack of generalizability in
AI-driven diagnostics. It shows promise for enhancing rapid virus detection and
identification of novel strains and outbreak response capabilities, thus
potentially addressing critical challenges in global public health
preparedness.

Conclusion: 该研究为光-物质强耦合领域提供了一种有效的理论工具，帮助理解复杂系统，并指导实验设计与应用开发。

Abstract: Controlling chemical and material properties through strong light-matter
coupling in optical cavities has gained considerable attention over the past
decade. However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood,
and a significant gap persists between experimental observations and
theoretical descriptions. This challenge arises from the intrinsically
multi-scale nature of the problem, where non-perturbative feedback occurs
across different spatial and temporal scales. Collective coupling between a
macroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as
Fabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of
individual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect
the macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient
computational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB)
with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations
(DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both
the cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble. We demonstrate
the potential for this method by tackling several open questions. First, we
calculate non-perturbatively two-dimensional spectroscopic observable that
directly connect to well-established experimental protocols. Second, we provide
local, molecule-resolved information within collectively coupled ensembles,
which is difficult to obtain experimentally. Third, we show how cavity designs
can be optimized to target specific microscopic applications. Finally, we
outline future directions to enhance the predictive power of this framework,
including extension to finite temperature, condensed phases, and correlated
quantum effects.

TL;DR: This paper extends DFT to include electrochemical potential in ion transport simulation by modifying the solid’s electron count, using implicit solvation and PB equations. It presents grand-canonical and fixed-potential DFT calculations, employing Legendre transforms for free energy calculations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electrochemical simulations with DFT are crucial for understanding electron transport in batteries and electronics. This paper expands DFT capabilities to include electrochemical potential, enhancing the accuracy of such simulations.

Method: The paper combines continuum models for electrolyte double layers with grand-canonical DFT algorithms. It evaluates the relationship between forces in these ensembles and uses finite displacement methods to measure vibrational frequencies and Stark tuning rates.

Result: The core result is that vibrational frequencies and Stark tuning rates differ between grand-canonical and canonical ensembles in DFT simulations with electrochemical potential.

Conclusion: Extending DFT to account for electrochemical potential, as done here, improves predictive capabilities for electrochemical systems but highlights differences in vibrational and optical properties across ensembles.

Abstract: Simulating electrochemical interfaces using density functional theory (DFT)
requires incorporating the effects of electrochemical potential. The
electrochemical potential acts as a new degree of freedom that can effectively
tune DFT results as electrochemistry does. Typically, this is implemented by
adjusting the number of electrons on the solid surface within the Kohn-Sham
(KS) equation, under the framework of an implicit solvent model and the
Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PB equation), thereby modulating the potential
difference between the solid and liquid. These simulations are often referred
to as grand-canonical or fixed-potential DFT calculations. To apply this
additional degree of freedom, Legendre transforms are employed in the
calculation of free energy, establishing the relationship between the grand
potential and the free energy. Other key physical properties, such as atomic
forces, vibrational frequencies, and Stark tuning rates, can be derived based
on this relationship rather than directly using Legendre transforms. This paper
begins by discussing the numerical methodologies for the continuum model of
electrolyte double layers and grand-potential algorithms. We then show that
atomic forces under grand-canonical ensemble match the Hellmann-Feynman forces
observed in canonical ensemble, as previously established. However, vibrational
frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit distinct behaviors between these
conditions. Through finite displacement methods, we confirm that vibrational
frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit differences between grand-canonical
and canonical ensembles.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study in detail the critical points of Bohmian flow, both in the inertial
frame of reference (Y-points) and in the frames centered at the moving nodal
points of the guiding wavefunction (X-points), and analyze their role in the
onset of chaos in a system of two entangled qubits. We find the distances
between these critical points and a moving Bohmian particle at varying levels
of entanglement, with particular emphasis on the times at which chaos arises.
Then, we find why some trajectories are ordered, without any chaos. Finally, we
examine numerically how the Lyapunov Characteristic Number (LCN ) depends on
the degree of quantum entanglement. Our results indicate that increasing
entanglement reduces the convergence time of the finite-time LCN of the chaotic
trajectories toward its final positive value.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient simulation of open quantum systems is important for understanding systems interacting with environments.

Method: The stochastic approach involves adding random forces to the system and simulating the dynamics using these stochastic wave functions, comparing the results to density matrix approaches.

Result: The stochastic approach works well for a two-level system but shows problems with higher systems and temperatures, requiring further research.

Conclusion: The method currently works for simple systems but faces challenges with more complex scenarios, necessitating additional research to overcome these limitations

Abstract: Previous years researchers began to simulate open quantum system, taking into
account the interaction between system and the environment. One approach to
deal with this problem is to use the density matrix within the
Liouville-von-Neumann formalism or the Markovian variant the Lindblad
equations. Another way is to use a stochastic approach where a random force is
added to the system. The benefit of the stochastic approach is to solve the
dynamics of the system with less time and memory than the density matrix
approaches. In this project we want to develop a stochastic approach that can
deal with the stochastic wave functions approach. We did this on a 2-level
system and found that it works well when comparing to a density matrix
approach. Next, we tested a quantum particle connect to a bath of harmonic
oscillators using the stochastic approach. We found that a friction term is
necessary and applied it. Like in the classical Langevin equations the friction
constant and the random force fluctuations are related by the
fluctuation-dissipation constant. We showed that with friction the dynamics
decays to an ensemble with energy of $E_{gs}+k_BT$. However, we also found here
are problems. The system seems to absorb energy indefinitely if the temperature
is higher than the zero point energy or if the system is a Morse oscillator.
Thus more research is required to make this method work.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何通过减少编码深度来提高表面码的效率，为量子计算提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: The surface code is the most studied error-correcting code thanks to its high
threshold, simple decoding, and locality in two dimensions (2D). A key
component of any code is its encoding circuit, which maps an unencoded state to
the corresponding encoded state. The best previous surface code encoding
circuit compatible with 2D local connectivity requires depth $2d$ to encode
distance-$d$ surface codes. This paper presents depth $d$ encoding circuits for
the rotated surface code. Our circuit is constructed inductively from circuits
that grow the code from $d$ to $(d+2)$. We prove that depth $d+O(1)$ is optimal
for inductively constructed circuits.

Abstract: We investigate quantum sensing for spectroscopy in a system consisting of a
two-level atom coupled to a continuum of modes. We focus on optimizing the
pulse shape of a coherent state to maximize the quantum Fisher information
(QFI) of the emitted light with the aim of estimating the atom's dipole moment,
which is proportional to its spontaneous emission rate. To achieve this, we
derive a set of coupled differential equations, which include the standard
optical Bloch equations as a subset and whose solution directly yields the QFI
of the emitted light without resorting to finite-difference methods.
Furthermore, we analyze the factors that govern its optimization, provide
analytic solutions in both the long and the short pulse width limits, and
examine the role of the average photon number of the pulses. We then show that
under the closed (periodic) boundary conditions, the harmonic (plane-wave) with
frequency equal to half the spontaneous emission rate and a phase determined by
detuning are optimal in the long pulse width limit.

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入新的物理距离和算法，解决了稀疏Hamiltonian学习中的下界问题，并展示了算法的效率和近优性。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Hamiltonians $H$ that are $s$-sparse in the
Pauli basis, given access to their time evolution. Although Hamiltonian
learning has been extensively investigated, two issues recur in much of the
existing literature: the absence of matching lower bounds and the use of
mathematically convenient but physically opaque error measures.
  We address both challenges by introducing two physically motivated distances
between Hamiltonians and designing a nearly optimal algorithm with respect to
one of these metrics. The first, time-constrained distance, quantifies
distinguishability through dynamical evolution up to a bounded time. The
second, temperature-constrained distance, captures distinguishability through
thermal states at bounded inverse temperatures.
  We show that $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with bounded operator norm can be
learned in both distances with $O(s \log(1/\epsilon))$ experiments and
$O(s^2/\epsilon)$ evolution time. For the time-constrained distance, we further
establish lower bounds of $\Omega((s/n)\log(1/\epsilon) + s)$ experiments and
$\Omega(\sqrt{s}/\epsilon)$ evolution time, demonstrating near-optimality in
the number of experiments.
  As an intermediate result, we obtain an algorithm that learns every Pauli
coefficient of $s$-sparse Hamiltonians up to error $\epsilon$ in
$O(s\log(1/\epsilon))$ experiments and $O(s/\epsilon)$ evolution time,
improving upon several recent results.
  The source of this improvement is a new isolation technique, inspired by the
Valiant-Vazirani theorem (STOC'85), which shows that NP is as easy as detecting
unique solutions. This isolation technique allows us to query the time
evolution of a single Pauli coefficient of a sparse Hamiltonian--even when the
Pauli support of the Hamiltonian is unknown--ultimately enabling us to recover
the Pauli support itself.

Abstract: Using both simulation and experiment, we investigate the robustness of
dynamical decoupling sequences to pulse errors: rotation errors and detuning
errors. Whereas prior work examined the effect of errors on coherence times,
here we show that quantum sensing can be affected by pulse errors in
dramatically different ways than coherence times alone. We also explore the
effects of qubit leakage: off-resonant coupling to other quantum levels. We
find order-of-magnitude differences between commonly-used dynamical decoupling
sequences in both their sensitivity to pulse errors and leakage.

TL;DR: annealing-based quantum solutions excel in some combinatorial optimization problems but not universally outperforming classical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the effectiveness of quantum annealing for optimization problems is crucial for advancing quantum computing applications.

Method: The study benchmarks QUBO formulations using diverse solvers on two real-world use cases.

Result: Quantum annealing shows promise for specific problems but classical solvers remain competitive for others.

Conclusion: While quantum annealing shows potential, classical optimization methods still hold value depending on problem scale and structure.

Abstract: For various optimization problems, the classical time to solution is
super-polynomial and intractable to solve with classical bit-based computing
hardware to date. Digital and quantum annealers have the potential to identify
near-optimal solutions for such optimization problems using a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem formulation. This work
benchmarks two use cases to evaluate the utility of QUBO solvers for
combinatorial optimization problems, in order to determine if a QUBO
formulation and annealing-based algorithms have an advantage over classical
mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) solvers.
Various QUBO and solver metrics such as problem mapping, quantitative
interconnectivity, penalty structure, solver minimum cost (obtained optimal
value) and solver time to solution have been applied to evaluate different QUBO
problems. Constrained and unconstrained QUBO solvers are compared including the
Fujitsu digital annealer (DA), various D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing solvers
(QA, HQA), and the classical MIP/CP solvers HiGHS, Gurobi, SCIP, and CP-SAT.
The two industrially relevant use cases are reaction network pathway analysis
and mRNA codon selection. For reaction pathway analysis, classical MIP/CP
solvers are observed to solve the problem to optimality in reasonable time
frames while the DA is not able to do so. For mRNA codon selection, CP-SAT
displayed the best performance for standard and large protein datasets (under
1500 amino acids). For the extra-large protein dataset (11000 to 14000 amino
acids), the D-Wave Nonlinear HQA solver performed comparably to CP-SAT,
outperforming it in minimum cost in 2 out of the 4 problems.

Conclusion:  paper highlights the potential of quantum computing in addressing critical scientific challenges, particularly in domains where current classical methods are insufficient. The proposed metric, SQSP, offers a valuable tool for evaluating the scalability and performance of quantum systems, enabling more effective allocation of NERSC's high-performance computing resources for quantum computing applications.

Abstract: The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), as the
high-performance computing (HPC) facility for the Department of Energy's Office
of Science, recognizes the essential role of quantum computing in its future
mission. In this report, we analyze the NERSC workload and identify materials
science, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics as the science domains and
application areas that stand to benefit most from quantum computers. These
domains jointly make up over 50% of the current NERSC production workload,
which is illustrative of the impact quantum computing could have on NERSC's
mission going forward. We perform an extensive literature review and determine
the quantum resources required to solve classically intractable problems within
these science domains. This review also shows that the quantum resources
required have consistently decreased over time due to algorithmic improvements
and a deeper understanding of the problems. At the same time, public technology
roadmaps from a collection of ten quantum computing companies predict a
dramatic increase in capabilities over the next five to ten years. Our analysis
reveals a significant overlap emerging in this time frame between the
technological capabilities and the algorithmic requirements in these three
scientific domains. We anticipate that the execution time of large-scale
quantum workflows will become a major performance parameter and propose a
simple metric, the Sustained Quantum System Performance (SQSP), to compare
system-level performance and throughput for a heterogeneous workload.

### [30] [Improved Quantum Lifting by Coherent Measure-and-Reprogram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09896)
*Alexandru Cojocaru,Juan Garay,Qipeng Liu,Fang Song*

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the security of cryptographic primitives in the quantum setting is crucial as quantum computing advances. This work aims to provide a tool for analyzing security games in such contexts.

Method: Developed a coherent reprogramming framework within the quantum random oracle model. The framework introduces a novel measure-and-reprogram technique that simplifies quantum security analysis by avoiding complex quantum reasoning.

Result: The framework leads to a tighter lifting theorem for query complexity problems. It enables the derivation of numerous security game hardness results, including those for one-way functions, collision-resistant hash functions, and others, both in uniform and non-uniform settings.

Conclusion: This work offers a simpler, more accessible method for analyzing security games against quantum adversaries, potentially accelerating future research in quantum cryptography.

Abstract: We give a tighter lifting theorem for security games in the quantum random
oracle model. At the core of our main result lies a novel measure-and-reprogram
framework that we call coherent reprogramming. This framework gives a tighter
lifting theorem for query complexity problems, that only requires purely
classical reasoning. As direct applications of our lifting theorem, we first
provide a quantum direct product theorem in the average case - i.e., an
enabling tool to determine the hardness of solving multi-instance security
games. This allows us to derive in a straightforward manner the hardness of
various security games, for example (i) the non-uniform hardness of salted
games, (ii) the hardness of specific cryptographic tasks such as the multiple
instance version of one-wayness and collision-resistance, and (iii) uniform or
non-uniform hardness of many other games.

Abstract: We give novel lifting theorems for security games in the quantum random
oracle model (QROM) in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) settings such as
the hybrid query model, the noisy oracle and the bounded-depth models. We
provide, for the first time, a hybrid lifting theorem for hybrid algorithms
that can perform both quantum and classical queries, as well as a lifting
theorem for quantum algorithms with access to noisy oracles or bounded quantum
depth.
  At the core of our results lies a novel measure-and-reprogram framework,
called hybrid coherent measure-and-reprogramming, tailored specifically for
hybrid algorithms. Equipped with the lifting theorem, we are able to prove
directly NISQ security and complexity results by calculating a single
combinatorial quantity, relying solely on classical reasoning.
  As applications, we derive the first direct product theorems in the average
case, in the hybrid setting-i.e., an enabling tool to determine the hybrid
hardness of solving multi-instance security games. This allows us to derive in
a straightforward manner the NISQ hardness of various security games, such as
(i) the non-uniform hardness of salted games, (ii) the hardness of specific
cryptographic tasks such as the multiple instance version of one-wayness and
collision-resistance, and (iii) uniform or non-uniform hardness of many other

Abstract: This paper is motivated by the following problem. Define a quantum walk on a
positively weighted path (linear chain). Can the weights be tuned so that
perfect state transfer occurs between the first vertex and any other position?
We do not fully answer this question - in fact, we show that a particular case
of this problem is equivalent to a solution of a particular case of the well
known Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem, deeming our original task certainly harder
than anticipated. In our journey, we prove new results about sequences of
orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recurrences. In particular, we
provide a full characterization of when two polynomials belong to such a
sequence, which (as far as we were able to ascertain) was known only for when
their degrees differ by one.

Abstract: We theoretically study time-dependent correlations in a strongly driven array
of $N$ two-level atoms, coupled to photons in a waveguide. We focus on the
spectrum $\{\lambda\}$ of the Liouvillian superoperator, which determines the
correlation decay rates $-\Re \lambda$ and the frequencies $\Im\lambda$. Our
main finding is the suppression of subradiant oscillating correlations between
atomic states by a strong coherent of amplitude $\Omega$: $|\Re \lambda|\ge
m\gamma/2$, where $\gamma$ is the single-atom spontaneous decay rate and
$m=|\Im \lambda/(2\Omega)|$ is a nonzero integer for correlations oscillating
in time $\propto \exp(\pm 2i m|\Omega| t)$. This limit is independent of the
number of atoms $N$; it holds both for small arrays and in the macroscopic
limit. We demonstrate the suppression of subradiance numerically and provide a
rigorous proof based on the analytical decomposition of the Liouvillian using
spectral theory of simplicial complexes and posets.

Abstract: Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common
objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of
the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and
ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles
of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of
spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present
experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not
only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the
orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads
to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition
to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The
combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications
as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds
in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.

Abstract: Quantum circuits composed of CNOT and $R_z$ are fundamental building blocks
of many quantum algorithms, so optimizing the synthesis of such quantum
circuits is crucial. We address this problem from a theoretical perspective by
studying the graphic parity network synthesis problem. A graphic parity network
for a graph $G$ is a quantum circuit composed solely of CNOT gates where each
edge of $G$ is represented in the circuit, and the final state of the wires
matches the original input. We aim to synthesize graphic parity networks with
the minimum number of gates, specifically for quantum algorithms addressing
combinatorial optimization problems with Ising formulations. We demonstrate
that a graphic parity network for a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$
edges requires at least $m+n-1$ gates. This lower bound can be improved to
$m+\Omega(m) = m+\Omega(n^{1.5})$ when the shortest cycle in the graph has a
length of at least five. We complement this result with a simple randomized
algorithm that synthesizes a graphic parity network with expected $m +
O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ gates. Additionally, we begin exploring connected
graphs that allow for graphic parity networks with exactly $m+n-1$ gates. We
conjecture that all such graphs belong to a newly defined graph class.
Furthermore, we present a linear-time algorithm for synthesizing minimum
graphic parity networks for graphs within this class. However, this graph class
is not closed under taking induced subgraphs, and we show that recognizing it
is $\textsf{NP}$-complete, which is complemented with a fixed-parameter
tractable algorithm parameterized by the treewidth.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We obtain the ground-state phase diagram of two spin chains consisting in a
set two-level systems asymmetrically coupled to an XX chain through a chiral
interaction. The interaction is parametrized by its magnitude and an angle
defined by the relative orientation of the spins in different chains. From the
entanglement spectrum, we identify the critical lines separating distinct
magnetically ordered phases, with the interaction angle able to shift or fully
suppress the transition. By increasing the coupling strength, the systems is
driven through a quantum phase transition, leading to the formation of two
types of in-plane antiferromagnetic stripes. The interaction strength sets
stripe formation, while the angle controls the spins orientations. The chiral
interaction also induces a non-trivial finite vector spin chirality with
opposite orientation on the chains. We show that the vector spin chirality
emerges smoothly from the decoupled limit and occurs for angles different from
zero and $\pi/2$, where collinear order is favored instead.

### [38] [Perfect quantum state transfer via state restoring and ancilla measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10100)
*E. B. Fel'dman,J. Wu,A. I. Zenchuk*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a protocol for perfect state transfer (PST) of arbitrary pure quantum states using the k-excitation states along a spin-1/2 chain. By leveraging local transformations and ancilla qubits to remove garbage states, the sender's state is transferred to the receiver with only a common phase difference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PST allows for exact quantum state transfer, which is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing and communication. The ability to transfer arbitrary states is particularly valuable for scalable quantum systems.

Method: The method involves encoding the sender's state into a k-excitation state, transferring the state along the chain, and using ancilla qubits to correct residual (garbage) states. The local transformations and measurement processes ensure accurate state transfer implementation.

Result: The researchers demonstrate that arbitrary pure quantum states can be transferred precisely by removing the garbage states, which simplifies resource usage and enhances transfer efficiency.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for practical applications of PST by eliminating unnecessary qubits, paving the way for large-scale quantum communication and computing systems.

Abstract: We propose the protocol for perfect state transfer of an arbitrary pure
quantum state along the spin-1/2 chain governed by the Hamiltonian preserving
the excitation number in the system. We show that the $k$-excitation pure
sender's state can be restored at the receiver using only the local
transformations over the qubits of the extended receiver. The restored state
appears in the superposition with other states which form garbage. This garbage
can be easily removed by including the ancilla whose state labels the garbage,
and then measuring the {ancilla state} with desired output. The resulting state
of the receiver coincides with the initial sender's state {up to the
unimportant common phase factor.} Then, to transfer an arbitrary {pure} state
of some system $S_0$, we encode this state into the $k$-excitation state of the
sender, transfer and restore it and finally decode the restored $k$-excitation
state {of the receiver} into the state of another subsystem $R_0$. After
labeling and removing the garbage via measuring the state of the ancillae we
complete the algorithm for PST.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Squeezed-light generation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is essential
for scalable continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. By
suppressing quantum fluctuations below the shot-noise limit, squeezed states
enable quantum-enhanced sensing and serve as a standard resource for CV quantum
information processing. While chip-level squeezed-light sources have been
demonstrated, extending this capability to the wafer level with reproducible
strong squeezing to bolster large-scale quantum-enhanced sensing and
information processing has been hindered by squeezed light's extreme
susceptibility to device imperfections. Here, we report wafer-scale
fabrication, generation, and characterization of two-mode squeezed-vacuum
states on a fully complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible
silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) PIC platform. Across a 4-inch wafer, 8 dies yield
2.9-3.1 dB directly measured quadrature squeezing with $< 0.2$ dB variation,
demonstrating excellent uniformity. This performance is enabled by
co-integrating ultralow-loss, strongly overcoupled high-$Q$ microresonators,
cascaded pump-rejection filters, and low-loss inverse-tapered edge couplers.
The measurements agree with a first-principles theoretical model parameterized
solely by independently extracted device parameters and experimental settings.
The measured squeezing level can be further improved by enhancing the
efficiencies of off-chip detection and chip-to-fiber coupling. These results
establish a reproducible, wafer-scale route to nonclassical-light generation in
integrated photonics and lay the groundwork for scalable CV processors,
multiplexed entanglement sources, and quantum-enhanced sensing.

Abstract: In this manuscript, starting from a five-step algorithmic procedure for

Using the geometry of complex projective spaces CP(N-1) and a Langevin
formalism, we obtain N-1 Hamilton's equations which encode both the quantum
system and the bath degrees of freedom, representing a generalization of the
Caldeira-Legget model in a complex projective space. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the method by applying it to two paradigmatic systems: a two-qubit
system in CP(3) under entangling interactions, reproducing quantum observables
such as state populations, quaternionic population differences and concurrence,
and the seven-state Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in CP(6), reproducing
state populations in the picosecond timescale.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of entanglement in training samples on the trainability of Quantum Machine Learning models, particularly focusing on the limitations and fundamental aspects of using highly entangled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how entanglement in training data affects quantum machine learning models is crucial for improving their performance and applicability in real-world tasks, especially with the growing interest in quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms.

Method: The authors employ a combination of theoretical analysis, mathematical modeling, and numerical simulations. They analyze the relationship between entanglement measures and model trainability using Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) and conduct experiments to validate their findings.

Result: The study reveals that for highly expressive models, the use of maximally entangled training data significantly limits the improvement of loss function values. Additionally, the entanglement entropy plays a pivotal role as a key predictor for the trainability of these models. The experimental results from PQCs simulations further support these theoretical conclusions.

Conclusion: This work provides essential insights into the challenges of using highly entangled training data in quantum machine learning. It highlights the importance of considering entanglement entropy and the limitations of maximal entanglement for training highly expressive quantum models, offering valuable guidance for future research and practical implementations in the field of quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) aims to leverage the principles of quantum
mechanics to speed up the process of solving machine learning problems or
improve the quality of solutions. Among these principles, entanglement with an
auxiliary system was shown to increase the quality of QML models in
applications such as supervised learning. Recent works focus on the information
that can be extracted from entangled training samples and their effect on the
approximation error of the trained model. However, results on the trainability
of QML models show that the training process itself is affected by various
properties of the supervised learning task. These properties include the
circuit structure of the QML model, the used cost function, and noise on the
quantum computer. To evaluate the applicability of entanglement in supervised
learning, we augment these results by investigating the effect of highly
entangled training data on the model's trainability. In this work, we show that
for highly expressive models, i.e., models capable of expressing a large number
of candidate solutions, the possible improvement of loss function values in
constrained neighborhoods during optimization is severely limited when
maximally entangled states are employed for training. Furthermore, we support
this finding experimentally by simulating training with Parameterized Quantum
Circuits (PQCs). Our findings show that as the expressivity of the PQC
increases, it becomes more susceptible to loss concentration induced by
entangled training data. Lastly, our experiments evaluate the efficacy of
non-maximal entanglement in the training samples and highlight the fundamental
role of entanglement entropy as a predictor for the trainability.

TL;DR: Adaptive randomized compiling enhances quantum simulation fidelity by prioritizing sensitive Hamiltonian terms and utilizing classical shadows to reduce computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating quantum systems Digitally is challenging, and randomized compiling offers a potential solution by reducing circuit complexity.

Method: Proposed a fluctuation-guided adaptive algorithm that dynamically updates sampling probabilities based on Hamiltonian term fluctuations, enabling higher simulation fidelity without increasing the number of qubits required.

Result: Numerical simulations across various quantum systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive algorithm in improving simulation fidelity.

Conclusion: Adaptive Randomized Compiling is a promising technique for improving the fidelity of quantum simulations, especially in large-scale quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Stochastic methods offer an effective way to suppress coherent errors in
quantum simulation. In particular, the randomized compilation protocol may
reduce circuit depth by randomly sampling Hamiltonian terms rather than
following the deterministic Trotter-Suzuki sequence. However, its fixed
sampling distribution does not adapt to the dynamics of the system, limiting
its accuracy. In this work, we propose a fluctuation-guided adaptive algorithm
that adaptively updates sampling probabilities based on fluctuations of
Hamiltonian terms to achieve higher simulation fidelity. Remarkably, the
protocol renders an intuitive physical understanding: Hamiltonian terms with
greater sensitivity to the state evolution should be prioritized during
sampling. The overload of measuring fluctuations necessary for updating the
sampling probability is affordable, and can be further largely reduced by
classical shadows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with numeral
simulations across discrete-variable, continuous-variable and hybrid-variable
systems.

TL;DR: RPSS is a new True Random Number Generator based on quantum mechanics that uses system jitter and combinatorial processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a novel and robust True Random Number Generator (TRNG) that is independent of conventional entropy sources.

Method: The method is based on statistical quantum mechanics, using conjugate observables (permutation count and elapsed sorting time) and modular reduction for convergence.

Result: The implementation, QPP-RNG, shows rapid entropy convergence and statistically uniform outputs, validated under the NIST SP 800-90B framework.

Conclusion: RPSS offers a quantum-inspired, robust entropy engine with broad applicability across platforms.

Abstract: We present the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS), a novel framework
for true uniform randomness generation grounded in statistical quantum
mechanics. RPSS is built on a pair of conjugate observables, the permutation
count and the elapsed sorting time, whose heavy-tailed raw distributions
synchronously converge to uniformity through modular reduction. This
mathematically proven convergence establishes RPSS as a True Uniform Random
Number Generator (TURNG). A practical implementation, QPP-RNG, demonstrates how
intrinsic system jitter, arising from microarchitectural noise, memory latency,
and scheduling dynamics, interacts with combinatorial complexity to yield a
compact, self-stabilizing entropy source. Empirical validation under the NIST
SP 800-90B framework confirms rapid entropy convergence and statistically
uniform outputs. RPSS thus defines a new class of quantum-inspired entropy
engines, where randomness is simultaneously harvested from unpredictable system
jitter and amplified by combinatorial processes, offering a robust,
platform-independent alternative to conventional entropy sources.

TL;DR: We build good GKP codes from lattice-based cryptography and present a simple decoding algorithm with nearly linear time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lattice-based cryptography is a promising candidate for post-quantum cryptography. GKP codes are essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation, and efficient decoding algorithms are crucial for practical applications.

Method: We construct GKP codes from standard integer solution lattices and ring/lattices such as R-SIS and M-SIS. A simple decoding algorithm is designed specifically for these codes.

Result: Our codes achieve a distance of √(n/(πe)) and have a decoding algorithm with nearly linear time complexity.

Conclusion: This work provides efficient and practical lattice-based GKP codes with advantageous decoding properties for quantum information processing.

Abstract: We construct good GKP (Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill) codes (in the sense of
Conrad, Eisert and Seifert proposed) from standard short integer solution
lattices (SIS) as well as from ring SIS and module SIS lattices, R-SIS and
M-SIS lattices, respectively. These lattice are crucial for lattice-based
cryptography. Our construction yields GKP codes with distance $\sqrt{n/\pi e}$.
This compares favorably with the NTRU-based construction by Conrad et al. that
achieves distance $\Omega(\sqrt{n/q}),$ with $n\le q^2/0.28$. Unlike their
codes, our codes do not have secret keys that can be used to speed-up the
decoding. However, we present a simple decoding algorithm that, for many
parameter choices, experimentally yields decoding results similar to the ones
for NTRU-based codes. Using the R-SIS and M-SIS construction, our simple
decoding algorithm runs in nearly linear time. Following Conrad, Eisert and
Seifert's work, our construction of GKP codes follows directly from an
explicit, randomized construction of symplectic lattices with (up to constants
$\approx 1$) minimal distance $(1/\sigma_{2n})^{1/2n}\approx \sqrt{\frac{n}{\pi
e}}$, where $\sigma_{2n}$ is the volume of the 2n-dimensional unit ball. Before
this result, Buser and Sarnak gave a non-constructive proof for the existence
of such symplectic lattices.

Motivation: This paper compares two quantum approaches for multi-class classification on a reduced SDSS dataset. The authors are exploring the potential of quantum machine learning for astronomical data classification.

Method: The authors implemented two classification schemes: a QSVM using quantum kernel-based methods and a HHL-based approach. They compared their performance on a reduced SDSS dataset.

Result: QSVM showed better performance in most cases, but HHL-based method performed poorly on QSO isolation. Classical SVMs performed slightly better overall.

Conclusion: QSVM is better suited for current quantum hardware, but HHL-based methods may be more scalable for larger datasets as quantum hardware improves.

Abstract: We compare two quantum approaches that use support vector machines for
multi-class classification on a reduced Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
dataset: the quantum kernel-based QSVM and the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd
least-squares SVM (HHL LS-SVM). Both one-vs-rest and two-step hierarchical
classification schemes were implemented. The QSVM involves angle encoding of
ten features, two unitary operator blocks consisting of rotational operator
gates, and a projective measurement that projects the final state to the zero
state. The HHL-based method involves solving a system of linear equations using
the HHL algorithm and using the solution in a support vector machine approach.
The results indicate that the QSVM outperforms HHL LS-SVM in most cases. HHL
LS-SVM performs somewhat competitively in selected cases, particularly when
isolating galaxies (majority), however, it also performs poorly in others,
especially when isolating QSOs (minority). Comparisons with classical SVMs
confirm that quantum and classical methods achieve broadly similar performance,
with classical models performing slightly ahead overall. Scaling analysis
reveals a trade-off: QSVM performance suffers from quadratic scaling with the
number of samples and features, but benefits from explicit feature
representation during training, while HHL LS-SVM scales essentially constantly,
with moderate fluctuations, but suffers from limited representative elements.
The HHL-based method is also highly noise-sensitive. These results suggest that
QSVM performs better overall and will perform better on current hardware as
well, but that the more efficient scaling of HHL LS-SVM makes it a useful
option for larger datasets with many samples, especially if we move past the
NISQ era.

Abstract: Multiparameter quantum metrology is essential for a wide range of practical
applications. However, simultaneously achieving the ultimate precision for all
parameters, as prescribed by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB), remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we propose a scheme termed local operation
with entangling measurements (LOEM) strategy, which leverages classically
correlated orthogonal pure states combined with entangling measurements to
attain the multiparameter QCRB. We experimentally validate this scheme using a
quantum photonic system. Additionally, we employ iterative interactions to
demonstrate that the LOEM strategy can achieve the precision of Heisenberg
scaling. By theoretically and experimentally demonstrating the saturation of
the multiparameter QCRB with the LOEM strategy, our work advances the practical
applications of quantum metrology in multiparameter estimation.

### [47] [Beam-splitter-free, high-rate quantum key distribution inspired by intrinsic quantum mechanical spatial randomness of entangled photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10231)
*Ayan Kumar Nai,Gopal Prasad Sahu,Rutuj Gharate,C. M. Chandrashekar,G. K. Samanta*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol using entangled photon sources (EPS) based on spatial randomness, which overcomes the limitations of beam splitters (BSs) in conventional QKD protocols, such as photon loss and polarization dependence. The protocol significantly enhances the key rate, reduces quantum bit error rate (QBER), and achieves scalability for future quantum networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to improve the efficiency and scalability of quantum key distribution by addressing the limitations of traditional beam splitter-based protocols.

Method: The method utilizes spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) to generate EPSs with inherent spatial and spectral randomness. The paper divides the annular SPDC emission ring into four sections to create two independent EPSs, enabling pair-state generation for Alice and Bob. Additionally, wavelength demultiplexing is employed to generate EPSs at distinct wavelengths, reducing the number of spatial channels required.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate a 6.4-fold increase in sifted key rate, consistent reduction in QBER, and near-ideal encoding balance. The protocol also eliminates the need for four spatial channels through wavelength demultiplexing.

Conclusion: This QKD protocol based on spatial-randomness from EPSs offers a scalable and efficient solution for future quantum networks, surpassing the limitations of current BS-based QKD schemes.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) using entangled photon sources (EPS) is a
cornerstone of secure communication. Despite rapid advances in QKD,
conventional protocols still employ beam splitters (BSs) for passive random
basis selection. However, BSs intrinsically suffer from photon loss, imperfect
splitting ratios, and polarization dependence, limiting the key rate,
increasing the quantum bit error rate (QBER), and constraining scalability,
particularly over long distances. By contrast, EPSs based on spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) intrinsically exhibit quantum randomness in
spatial and spectral degrees of freedom, offering a natural replacement for BSs
in basis selection. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept
spatial-randomness-based QKD scheme in which the annular SPDC emission ring is
divided into four sections, effectively generating two independent EPSs. pair
photons from these sources, distributed to Alice and Bob, enable H/V and D/A
measurements. The quantum-random pair generation inherently mimics the
stochastic basis choice otherwise performed by a BS. Experimentally, our scheme
achieves a 6.4-fold enhancement in sifted key rate, a consistently reduced
QBER, and a near-ideal encoding balance between logical bits 0 and 1.
Furthermore, the need for four spatial channels can be avoided by employing
wavelength demultiplexing to generate two EPSs at distinct wavelength pairs.
Harnessing intrinsic spatial/spectral randomness thus enables robust,
bias-free, high-rate, and low-QBER QKD, offering a scalable pathway for
next-generation quantum networks.

Conclusion: 该研究在认证和学习Ising Hamiltonians方面取得了进展，特别是在k-局部Hamiltonians的扩展上。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problems of certifying and learning quantum Ising
Hamiltonians. Our main contributions are as follows:
  Certification of Ising Hamiltonians. We show that certifying an Ising
Hamiltonian in normalized Frobenius norm via access to its time-evolution
operator requires only $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon)$ time evolution. This
matches the Heisenberg-scaling lower bound of $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ up to
logarithmic factors. To our knowledge, this is the first nearly-optimal
algorithm for testing a Hamiltonian property. A key ingredient in our analysis
is the Bonami Lemma from Fourier analysis.
  Learning Ising Gibbs states. We design an algorithm for learning Ising Gibbs
states in trace norm that is sample-efficient in all parameters. In contrast,
previous approaches learned the underlying Hamiltonian (which implies learning
the Gibbs state) but suffered from exponential sample complexity in the inverse
temperature.
  Certification of Ising Gibbs states. We give an algorithm for certifying
Ising Gibbs states in trace norm that is both sample and time-efficient,
thereby solving a question posed by Anshu (Harvard Data Science Review, 2022).
  Finally, we extend our results on learning and certification of Gibbs states
to general $k$-local Hamiltonians for any constant $k$.

six-dimensional integrals associated with a realistic atom-atom interaction
described by a Morse model potential were implemented. The performance,
correctness and efficiency of the implementation is assessed by comparing full
configuration-interaction calculations (exact diagonalizations) for two atoms
in an isotropic harmonic trap with quasi-exact reference results.

The authors present analytical universal parent measurements that provide tighter bounds than current methods. They demonstrate that anticommstring observables yield the most incompatible dichotomic measurements. Additionally, they develop a construction framework using sum-of-squares optimization and offer preliminary numerical results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to provide a more effective way to quantify an important quantum resource, measurement incompatibility, which has significant implications for quantum information processing tasks such as steering, encryption, and teleportation. Achieving this goal requires resolving a long-standing problem in quantum theory.

Method: The authors employ a combination of analytical and numerical methods. On the analytical side, they construct universal parent measurements and leverage the properties of anticomstring observables. They also incorporate sum-of-squares optimization as an auxiliary tool for deriving and verifying their results. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate and refine the analytical framework.

Result: The key results of this paper include (1) the identification of sets of anticomstring observables that give rise to the most incompatible dichotomic measurements, (2) the development of a formalism for constructing universal parent measurements within the sum-of-squares optimization framework, and (3) preliminary numerical results showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving upon existing analytical bounds. These contributions advance the understanding of measurement incompatibility and offer practical tools for improving bounds related to quantum information processing tasks.

Conclusion: In summary, this paper makes significant progress toward quantifying measurement incompatibility in finite-dimensional quantum systems. The identification of universal parent measurements and the integration of sum-of-squares optimization highlight promising directions for future research. The practical numerical results demonstrate the potential of these methods for advancing quantum information processing applications, particularly in establishing dimensionality in quantum systems using steering in a device-independent manner.

Abstract: Measurement incompatibility, or joint measurability, is a cornerstone of
quantum theory and a useful resource. For finite-dimensional systems,
quantifying this resource and establishing universal bounds valid for all
measurements is a long-standing problem. In this work, we exhibit analytical
universal parent measurements giving access to bounds that beat the state of
the art. In particular, we can show that, for relevant robustnesses, sets of
anticommuting observables give rise to the most incompatible dichotomic
measurements. We also formalise the construction of such universal parent
measurements in the framework of sum-of-squares optimisation and obtain
preliminary numerical results demonstrating the power of the method by
improving on our own analytical values. All results find direct application for
demonstrating genuine high-dimensional steering, that is, certifying the
dimensionality of a quantum system in a one-sided device-independent manner.

*Boris Tsvelikhovskiy,Matthew Nuyten,Bojko N. Bakalov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: GM-QAOA's DLA is determined by its initialization and mixer, and for many initial states and mixers, this DLA is either \( \math͏su\)_r ⨁ \( \math͏u\)_1⊕² or \( \math͏su\)_r ⨁ \( \math͏u\)_1. GM-QAOA has the largest commutant among QAOA variants with the same initialization, meaning it conserves the most quantities. The GM-QAOA loss function's variance can be expressed explicitly in terms of the objective function's values, and for a wide range of optimization problems, using GM-QAOA with enough layers avoids the barren plateau issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structure and properties of QAOA variants is crucial for improving their performance and applicability in quantum computing.

Method: Analyzing the dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) associated with different initial states and Grover-type mixers, and deriving explicit formulas for the loss function and conserved quantities.

Result: GM-QAOA has a structured DLA, which allows for the maximum commutant, and avoids barren plateaus under certain conditions.

Conclusion: GM-QAOA is a promising variant of QAOA with desirable structural and performance properties for various optimization problems.

Abstract: We analyze the dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) associated with the Grover-mixer
variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (GM-QAOA). When the
initial state is the uniform superposition of computational basis states, we
show that the corresponding DLA is isomorphic to either $\mathfrak{su}_{r}
\oplus \mathfrak{u}_{1}^{\oplus 2}$ or $\mathfrak{su}_{r} \oplus
\mathfrak{u}_{1}$, where \(r\) denotes the number of distinct values of the
objective function. We also establish an analogous classification for other
choices of initial states and Grover-type mixers.
  Furthermore, we prove that the DLA of GM-QAOA has the largest possible
commutant among all QAOA variants initialized with the same state
$|\xi\rangle$, corresponding physically to the maximal set of conserved
quantities. In addition, we derive an explicit formula for the variance of the
GM-QAOA loss function in terms of the objective function values, and we show
that, for a broad class of optimization problems, GM-QAOA with sufficiently
many layers avoids barren plateaus.

Abstract: Quantum simulation has emerged as a key application of quantum computing,
with significant progress made in algorithms for simulating both closed and

those governed by the Lindblad master equation, has received attention recently
with the current state-of-the-art algorithms having an input model query
complexity of $O(T \mathrm{polylog}(T/\epsilon))$, where $T$ and $\epsilon$ are
the requested time and precision of the simulation respectively. For the
Hamiltonian simulation problem it has been show that the optimal Hamiltonian
query complexity is $O(T + \log(1/\epsilon))$, additive in nature between the
two parameter, but for Lindbladian simulation this question remains open. In
this work we show that the additive complexity of $O(T + \log(1/\epsilon))$ is
reachable for the simulation of a large class of Lindbladian by constructing a
novel quantum algorithm based on quantum trajectories.

Abstract: We study single-shot distinguishability of locally implementable multipartite
unitaries under Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) and global
operations. As unitary discrimination depends on both the choice of probing
states and the measurements on the evolved states, we classify LOCC and global
distinguishability into two categories: adaptive strategies, where probing
states are chosen based on measurement outcomes from other subsystems, and
restricted strategies, where probing states remain fixed. Our findings uncover
three surprising features in the bipartite setting and establish new structural
limits for unitary discrimination: (i) Certain pairs of unitaries are globally
distinguishable with restricted strategies but indistinguishable under LOCC,
even with adaptive strategies. (ii) There exist sets of four unitaries that are
distinguishable via LOCC, yet remain globally indistinguishable with restricted
strategies. (iii) Some sets of unitaries are globally indistinguishable under
adaptive strategies, when probed with separable states, but become
distinguishable via LOCC.

Abstract: We investigate the minimal proof for ruling out maximally $\psi-$epistemic

standard notion of epistemic overlap by considering a penalized

as Quantum Gambling. In this context, using only two pure states and their
equal mixture, we present an experimentally robust no-go theorem for maximally
$\psi-$epistemic models, showing that qubit states achieve the maximal
difference between quantum and epistemic overlaps.

TL;DR: A microfluidic-based large particle sorter efficiently separates polyethylene particles between 45-180 micrometers using TSAW actuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for efficient sorting of large biomaterials for high-throughput applications in biomedicine.

Method: Optical detection of particle size followed by TSAW-based actuation (momentum transfer) to sort particles.

Result: Sorting rate ~4-36 particles/s, depending on sample composition.

Conclusion: Achieves efficient sorting of large particles, suitable for clinical and industrial applications.

Abstract: Large particle sorters have potential applications in sorting microplastics
and large biomaterials (>50 micrometer), such as tissues, spheroids, organoids,
and embryos. Though great advancements have been made in image-based sorting of
cells and particles (<50 micrometer), their translation for high-throughput
sorting of larger biomaterials and particles (>50 micrometer) has been more
limited. An image-based detection technique is highly desirable due to richness
of the data (including size, shape, color, morphology, and optical density)
that can be extracted from live images of individualized biomaterials or
particles. Such a detection technique is label-free and can be integrated with
a contact-free actuation mechanism such as one based on traveling surface
acoustic waves (TSAWs). Recent advances in using TSAWs for sorting cells and
particles (<50 micrometer) have demonstrated short response times (<1 ms), high
biocompatibility, and reduced energy requirements to actuate. Additionally,
TSAW-based devices are miniaturized and easier to integrate with an image-based
detection technique. In this work, a high-throughput image-detection based
large particle microfluidic sorting technique is implemented. The technique is
used to separate binary mixtures of small and large polyethylene particles
(ranging between ~45-180 micrometer in size). All particles in flow were first
optically interrogated for size, followed by actuations using momentum transfer
from TSAW pulses, if they satisfied the size cutoff criterion. The effect of
control parameters such as duration and power of TSAW actuation pulse, inlet
flow rates, and sample dilution on sorting efficiency and throughput was
observed. At the chosen conditions, this sorting technique can sort on average
~4.9-34.3 particles/s (perform ~2-3 actuations/s), depending on the initial
sample composition and concentration.

Conclusion: This approach offers a significant advancement over traditional topology optimization methods by eliminating the need for adjoint or topology optimization loops, providing a scalable and efficient solution for designing bio-inspired mechanical metamaterials.

Abstract: Understanding how living organisms spontaneously develop complex functional

introduce a decentralized generative model based on morphogenesis to
autonomously grow mechanical structures with controlled tensorial properties.
By adapting Turing's reaction-diffusion concept through anisotropic diffusion,
our approach enables the local emergence of microstructures exhibiting tailored
stiffness and anisotropy, achieving target orthotropic tensors without adjoint

database linking morphogenetic parameters to effective elastic tensors obtained
through homogenization techniques. We experimentally demonstrate this concept
through a mechanical cloaking example, validating our method's capability to
independently control local anisotropy and rigidity, and effectively conceal
structural defects from mechanical fields. This approach not only addresses key
limitations of traditional topology optimization methods but also opens new

*Vijay Balasubramanian,Tom Yildirim*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses how quantum gravity in flat and AdS spacetime can have features invisible to classical observers, like hidden information behind horizons or in baby universes. The gravitational path integral is used to examine whether quantum observables can access this hidden data. The paper finds that generic probes don't reveal information but a finesse-tuned probe can detect it due to wormhole saddles in the path integral. As a result, asymptotic observers can't easily determine the universe's state but can verify a proposed state. The paper also shows that an asymptotic observer can detect information in a disconnected baby universe and that the state of a two-boundary black hole can be detected using operators on one boundary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of quantum gravity and how classical observers perceive it is fundamental to theoretical physics. This paper addresses the information paradox and related questions in quantum gravity.

Method: The paper employs mathematical tools such as gravitational path integrals and quantum probes to analyze hidden information in quantum gravity states. It also uses conceptual tools like wormhole theory in quantum gravity to identify potential information sources.

Result: Observed results show that while generic quantum probes cannot access hidden information, specific, finely tuned probes can. This allows asymptotic observers to detect information hidden in baby universes and in two-boundary black holes using operators localized on one boundary.

Conclusion: This research indicates that, while classical observers cannot easily obtain the full quantum state of the universe, they can test specific proposals for the state using appropriate quantum probes. The findings shed light on the information paradox in quantum gravity and the role of operators in detecting hidden information, advancing the understanding of quantum gravity phenomena.

Abstract: Complex states of quantum gravity in flat and AdS gravity can have features
that are inaccessible to classical asymptotic observers. The missing
information appears to such observers to be hidden behind a horizon or in a
baby universe. Here we use the gravitational path integral to ask whether
quantum observables can access the hidden data. We show that generic probes
give a universal result and contain no information about the state. However, a
probe appropriately fine-tuned to the state can give a large signal because of
novel wormhole saddles in the path integral. Thus, in these settings,
asymptotic observers cannot easily determine the state of the universe, but can

asymptotic observer can detect information hidden in a disconnected baby
universe. Furthermore we show that the state of a two-boundary black hole can
be detected using Lorentzian operators localised on just one of the boundaries.

*Jean-François Fortin,Lorenzo Quintavalle,Witold Skiba*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper derives expressions for the Virasoro OPE and four-point conformal blocks on the sphere using a recently determined resolution of identity, independent of Virasoro singular vectors but based on their conformal weights. The results are verified against Zamolodchikov's h-recursion relation and explored under various large central charge limits. A Mathematica notebook is provided for simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding Virasoro conformal blocks and their applications in conformal field theory is fundamental for advancing theoretical physics, particularly in string theory and statistical mechanics. This paper addresses these properties using innovative mathematical methods.

Method: The paper uses a recent resolution of identity in [Phys. Rev. D 111, 085010 (2025), arXiv:2409.12224] to derive expressions for the Virasoro OPE and four-point conformal blocks. The method leverages the properties of Virasoro singular vectors and conformal weights to construct the blocks without explicit dependence on singular vectors, utilizing their well-known conformal weights.

Result: The derived expressions for the Virasoro conformal blocks are verified to be compatible with but distinct from Zamolodchikov's h-recursion relation. The study further explores the behavior of these blocks under various limits of large central charges.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into the structure of Virasoro conformal blocks, offering alternative formulations that complement existing methods. The Mathematica notebook simplifies the implementation of these results for further study and application.

Abstract: We derive expressions for the Virasoro OPE and four-point conformal blocks on
the sphere via the resolution of identity recently determined in [Phys. Rev. D
111, 085010 (2025), arXiv:2409.12224]. Even though the resolution of the
identity depends on Virasoro singular vectors, our expression for the blocks
does not depend on their precise form, but just on their well-known conformal
weights. We verify that our expression is compatible with -- but differs from
-- Zamolodchikov's $h$-recursion relation and we also examine the impact of
various large central charge limits in our formula. A Mathematica notebook with
a simple implementation of our expression for the Virasoro conformal blocks is
provided as an ancillary file.

Abstract: We investigate coupling selection rules in heterotic string theory on

classified by conjugacy classes of space group elements, non-Abelian orbifolds
give rise to non-invertible selection rules on couplings among twisted sectors

non-invertible selection rules lead to characteristic patterns of Yukawa

Motivation: 理解AdS/CFT对偶中熵和几何的关系是量子 gravity和 holography的核心问题。

Method: 使用BCFT张量网络和量子态纯化方法，结合模流的性质来分析反射熵与局部分割集的几何关系。

Result: 在AdS3/CFT2中，反射熵等于局部分割集的局域几何交叉截面积（EW）；推广到多分区，反映了EW的总和不等式。

Conclusion: 该工作为AdS/CFT对偶中熵与几何的关系提供了一个新的局量化方法，不依赖于AdS/CFT字典，直接从CFT数据出发证明了EW与反射熵的等式。

Abstract: We use the framework of $\textit{BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a
microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE)
and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both
bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks,
obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly
construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals.
Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these
intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without
assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to
coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal
coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville
theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy
slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all
candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one
providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network
intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from
intrinsic CFT data.

Abstract: We calculate the Casimir energy for the configuration of two parallel plates
coupled to nonabelian gauge fields with a Yang-Mills action. We consider both
2+1 and 3+1 dimensions in the manifestly gauge-invariant formalism we have
pursued over the last several years which allows us to factor out the gauge
degrees of freedom. A boundary action in the functional integral, equivalent to
the insertion of operators representing the plates, is used to enforce the
required boundary conditions for the gauge fields. The result is for a
kinematic regime corresponding to the exchange of gluons with a dynamically
generated mass. We find good agreement in 2+1 dimensions and reasonable
agreement in 3+1 dimensions with lattice-based numerical evaluations.

Abstract: It is well known that continuous symmetries of quantum fields can be realized
non-linearly, e.g. in the context of sigma models, and can also be
spontaneously broken on non-compact spacetimes. In this note we study how these
effects are realized in the context of the topological symmetry theory for
continuous symmetries. In particular, we explain cosets realizations and their
higher $p$-form symmetry versions from this perspective, as well as uplifts to
higher groups and non-invertible symmetries. Moreover, using a setup with
boundaries and corners, we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios for
higher $p$-form symmetries as well as non-Abelian $0$-form symmetries.

Abstract: We investigate a higher-form symmetry in type IIB superstring theory, which
possesses an ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. From the point of view of the
low-energy effective field theory, the ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is
treated as a gauge symmetry. Hence, an $8$-form global symmetry
$\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ emerges as a quantum symmetry. In this paper, we
present an explicit construction of the topological operator associated with
the $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ symmetry. In this construction, the discriminant
$\Delta(\tau)$ plays a central role. As a result, it becomes manifest that
$\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ is the solitonic symmetry of $7$-branes. Furthermore,
taking into account the extensions of the duality group, we also discuss what
global symmetries emerge when considering not ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ but
${\rm Mp}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and ${\rm Pin}^+({\rm

TL;DR: The paper discusses how light can control the properties of topological defects in quantum materials, specifically vortex strings in a CDW system, by manipulating their temporal and spatial structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the aim to control and utilize topological defects in quantum materials to create novel functionalities in active devices.

Method: Time-resolved optical pump and x-ray probe experiments were conducted on the Pd-intercalated ErTe₃ system to observe the effects of femtosecond laser excitation on vortex strings.

Result: The research demonstrates that vortex strings persist longer than the electronic recovery time and show reduced effective dimensionality, which was corroborated by simulations.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for light-induced control of topological defects, potentially leading to the stabilization of competing quantum states and novel electronic functionalities.

Abstract: In phase transitions, mesoscale structures such as topological defects,
vortex strings, and domain walls control the path towards equilibrium, and thus
the functional properties of many active devices. In photoinduced phase
transitions driven by femtosecond laser excitation, the temporal (pulse
duration) and spatial (penetration depth) structure of the optical excitation
present opportunities for control and creating structures with unique
topologies. By performing time-resolved optical pump, x-ray probe experiments
on the CDW system Pd-intercalated ErTe$_{3}$, we gain access to the nanoscale
dynamics of the mesoscale topological features (vortex strings) produced after
a quench, which have a different apparent dimensionality than the topological
defects predicted from the bulk system. We show that these vortex strings
persist for much longer than the electronic recovery time. The critical
exponent obtained from power-law scaling of the intensity as a function of
wavevector shows a reduction in the effective dimensionality of the topological
defects in the system, corroborated by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
simulations. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway to use light to control
the dimensionality and orientation of topological defects in quantum materials,
which could be used to stabilize competing quantum states.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper investigates the fractal morphology of higher-order topological insulators during crystal growth, discovering that corners develop preferentially compared to edges when corner states are present. Additionally, it is shown that, when comparing the crystal shapes of higher-order topological insulators and trivial insulators with the same fractal dimension Df, the former exhibit a smaller fractal dimension of coastlines Dfc than the latter, suggesting smoother edges for higher-order topological insulators with similar levels of corner development. The paper also highlights that the relationship between the area and perimeter of the crystals is influenced by the ratio of these fractal dimensions, leading to distinct perimeter-area relationships between the two types of insulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the relationship between crystal growth, topology, and fractal geometry in condensed matter physics.

Method: Combining experimental and theoretical methods to study crystal growth dynamics and analyze fractal properties.

Result: Corners of higher-order topological insulator crystals grow preferentially, exhibit smoother edges, and have distinct perimeter-area relationships compared to trivial insulators.

Conclusion: The study reveals fundamental insights into the role of topology in controlling crystal growth and morphology, with implications for materials science and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Understanding crystal growth and morphology is a fundamental issue in
condensed matter physics. In this work, we reveal the fractal morphology of
growing crystals of higher-order topological insulators and show that the
corners of the crystals grow preferentially compared to the edges in the
presence of the corner states. We further demonstrate that when we compare the
crystal shape of the higher-order topological insulator with that of the
trivial insulator with the same value of the fractal dimension $D_f$, the
former has a smaller value of the fractal dimension of coastlines $D_{f,c}$
than the latter. This indicates that, for crystals with a similar degree of
corner development, those in the higher-order topological phase have smoother
edges. Because the relationship between the area and the perimeter of the
crystals is governed by the ratio of these fractal dimensions, the higher-order
topological insulator and the trivial insulator exhibit distinct perimeter-area
relationships.

Abstract: Quantum Hall Fabry-P\'erot interferometers are sensitive to the properties of
bulk quasiparticles enclosed by the interferometer loop, with the interference
phase containing information about both the quasiparticle statistics and the
Coulomb-mediated bulk-edge coupling. Previous studies have explored the role of
the bulk-edge coupling in an equilibrium picture where quasiparticles enter and
exit the interferometer rapidly compared to the timescale over which the
interferometer phase is measured. Here, we present data from a monolayer
graphene quantum Hall interferometer in the integer quantum Hall regime at $\nu
= -1$ and $\nu = -2$. Quantum interference shows phase slips associated with
the entrance of quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. Tracing the
dependence of these phase slips on the magnetic field, we show that the
equilibration time can become as long as several minutes. We further use our
multi-gated geometry to identify two classes of phase slips. The first is
associated with the addition of a quasiparticle to a bulk `puddle' of
quasiparticles uniformly coupled to the entire chiral edge state, while the
second is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle trapped by a defect
site that couples predominantly to the closest portion of the edge.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate field-induced switching of magnetic topology in
a nanodisk-shaped sample of noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnet in which the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that stabilizes an antiskyrmion with $N_{\rm
sk}$=+1 and the magnetic dipole interaction that stabilizes a skyrmion with
$N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$ are in keen competition where $N_{\rm sk}$ is the skyrmion
number. Our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the competition offers a
unique opportunity to switch magnetic textures with distinct magnetic topology
among the antiskyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=+1), elliptical skyrmion ($N_{\rm
sk}$=$-1$), and nontopological bubble ($N_{\rm sk}$=0) in a deterministic
manner by application of magnetic fields parallel to the sample plane. By
calculating time and spatial profiles of energy contributions from respective
interactions and magnetic anisotropy, we clarify the physical mechanism and
properties of the observed field-induced topology switching phenomena. Our
findings are expected to provide useful insights into the spintronic
application of topological magnetism.

TL;DR:  papers discuss the emergence of radial Rashba spin-orbit fields in commensurate twisted bilayers, detailing model Hamiltonian parameters and their dependence on twist angles, as well as interlayer coupling dynamics. The in-plane 180 rotation symmetry protecting the radial Rashba field is highlighted, with insights into spin-charge conversion engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spin-orbit couplings in twisted bilayers is crucial for advancing spin-based electronics and device applications.

Method: Model Hamiltonian based on effective mass models and spin-conserving interlayer coupling. Fit to twisted supercells to extract parameters. Analyze twist angle dependencies and interlayer coupling with commensurate supercell sizes.

Result: Radial Rashba fields symmetric around Θ=0° and Θ=30°. Interlayer coupling decreases with supercell size, leading to peaks at commensurate twist angles. Symmetry-protected radial Rashba confirmed through lateral layer displacements. Atomic relaxation and interlayer distance modulation effects also examined.

Conclusion: Microscopic insights into radial Rashba fields and interlayer coupling provide a foundation for designing spin-charge conversion schemes in twisted layered materials.

Abstract: In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields
can emerge. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main
features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two
effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general
(spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian
parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle
dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not
only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but
also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer
coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the
increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high
interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate
supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the
layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is
an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects
of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our results
offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to
engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.

Abstract: Micro- and nanomechanical resonators are emerging as promising platforms for
quantum technologies, precision sensors and fundamental science experiments. To
utilize these devices for force sensing or quantum optomechanics, they must be
brought in close proximity with other systems for functionalization or
efficient readout. Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in
nanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has
led to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties.
The mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and
nanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature,
setting their force sensitivities below 1 $\mathrm{aN}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$,
surpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs). Given
this new regime of sensitivity, an intriguing question is whether the proximity
of other materials hinders mechanical coherence. Here we show: it does. We
report a novel dissipation mechanism that occurs in ultracoherent
nanomechanical oscillators caused by the presence of nearby dielectrics. By
studying the parameter scaling of the effect, we show that the mechanism is
more severe for low-frequency mechanical modes and that it is due to dielectric
loss within the materials caused by the motion of a resonator which carries
static charges. Our observations are consistent with the noncontact friction
(NCF) observed in AFMs. Our findings provide insights into limitations on the
integration of ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators and highlight the
adverse effects of charged defects in these systems.

Abstract: This work examines the influence of thickness on the electrical transport
properties of mechanically exfoliated two-dimensional SnSe$_2$ nanosheets,
derived from the bulk single crystal. Contrary to conventional trend observed
in two-dimensional systems, we find a semiconducting to metallic resistivity
behavior with decreasing thickness. The analysis of low-temperature conduction
indicates an increased density of states at Fermi-level with decreasing
thickness, which is further corroborated by gate bias dependent conductance
measurement. The enhanced conductivity in thinner flake is attributed to the
n-type doping arising from surface defect states. The presence and evolution of
these defect states with thickness is probed by thickness-dependent
room-temperature Raman spectroscopy. Our study provides insights into the
thickness-dependent electronic transport mechanism of SnSe$_2$ and the crucial
role of defect states in governing the observed conductivity behavior.

Abstract: Quantum Hall edge channels partition electric charge over N chiral
(uni-directional) modes. Intermode scattering leads to partition noise,
observed in graphene p-n junctions. While inelastic scattering suppresses this
noise by averaging out fluctuations, we show that pure (quasi-elastic)
dephasing may enhance the partition noise. The noise power increases by up to
50% for two modes, with a general enhancement factor of 1+1/N in the
strong-dephasing limit. This counterintuitive effect is explained in the
framework of monitored quantum transport, arising from the self-averaging of
quantum trajectories.

Abstract: We propose using spin-qubit noise magnetometry to probe dynamical signatures
of magnetic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) physics. For a

distinctive features in the magnetic noise spectral density in the sub-MHz to

exhibits a temperature-dependent power law characteristic of algebraic spin
correlations. Above the transition, the noise reflects the proliferation of
free vortices and enables quantitative extraction of the vortex conductivity, a

*Arpan Manna,Sunit Das,Amit Agarwal,Soumik Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that disorder in bulk WTe2 induces anisotropic Kondo screening and a spontaneous Hall effect, with enhanced magnetoresistance and second-harmonic Hall signal, and suggests disorder-driven Kondo interactions pin the Fermi level near Weyl nodes, enhancing Berry curvature-driven nonequilibrium transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disorder is a fundamental aspect of condensed matter physics, and its effects on Weyl semimetals are not yet fully understood. This paper explores how disorder influences the electronic properties of WTe2, focusing on Kondo effects and Hall responses.

Method: The study uses angle-resolved magnetoresistance (MR) measurements and Hall effect analysis on single crystals of WTe2 with varying levels of disorder. The Fermi level is determined via transport measurements.

Result: 1. Anisotropic Kondo screening: Magnetoresistance exhibits strong anisotropy with respect to current and magnetic field orientation, reflecting the type-II Weyl dispersion. 2. Spontaneous Hall effect: In zero magnetic field, a Hall signal is observed with magnitude enhanced by disorder. 3. Second-harmonic Hall effect: The signal shows quadratic current scaling. 4. Fermi level pinning: Disorder enhances the pinning of the Fermi level near Weyl nodes. 5. Nonequilibrium transport mechanism: Disorder-driven Kondo interactions enhance Berry curvature-driven transport, accounting for the Hall responses.

Conclusion: Disordered WTe2 provides a platform for the study of Weyl-Kondo fermions, offering insights into the interplay between disorder and Weyl fermions. The findings suggest that disorder can be a powerful tool for controlling correlated topological phases in Weyl semimetals.

Abstract: In this Letter, we report the observation of disorder-driven anisotropic
Kondo screening and spontaneous Hall effect in bulk WTe${_2}$, a nonmagnetic
type-II Weyl semimetal. We show that Kondo scattering emerges more prominently
in disordered samples and produces magnetoresistance that is strongly
anisotropic with respect to both current and magnetic field orientation,
reflecting the underlying type-II Weyl dispersion. Strikingly, we find a
spontaneous Hall effect in zero magnetic field, whose magnitude is enhanced
with disorder, together with a large second-harmonic Hall signal exhibiting
quadratic current scaling. Our analysis indicates that disorder-driven Kondo
interactions pin the Fermi level near the Weyl nodes. This enhances the Berry
curvature-driven nonequilibrium transport, accounting for both the second-order
and spontaneous Hall responses. These findings establish disordered WTe${_2}$
as a platform hosting Weyl-Kondo fermions and highlight disorder as an
effective control knob for inducing correlated topological phases in weakly
correlated Weyl semimetals.

### [79] [High-sensitivity molecular spectroscopy of SrOH using magneto-optical trapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09786)
*Annika Lunstad,Hiromitsu Sawaoka,Zack Lasner,Abdullah Nasir,Mingda Li,Jack Mango,Rachel Fields,John M. Doyle*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: Strontium monohydroxide (SrOH) shows promise for both direct CP violation (CPV) and dark matter (DM) detection via ultra-low mass UDM, through its ability to undergo high sensitivity, systematic-free transitions, measured at a 4.5x improvement by combining rotational fine-tuning and temporal UDM signature prediction. However, SrOH's atomic weight may be a hindrance, with other light molecules offering better sensitivity but harder trapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultracold molecular gases represent a promising platform for quantum metrology and quantum sensing, providing ultra-sensitive, system-free measurement tools for fundamental physics. As such, progress in trapping, spectroscopy, and measuring rovibrational transitions in molecules holds significant promise for detecting new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as CP violation and ultralight dark matter. Additionally, SrOH is of particular interest for physics beyond the Standard Model as it is a candidate for both detecting CP violation and dark matter, making its study crucial for exploring these beyond Standard Model physics.

Method: In this work, the researchers developed a magneto-optical trap (MOT) to facilitate high-precision spectroscopy of SrOH molecules. They identified two new repumping transitions in SrOH and utilized these to create an optical cycle containing 32400 (4700) trapped molecules, representing a 4.5-fold improvement over previous methods.

Result: The two new repumping transitions in SrOH exhibit high precision and sensitivity, enabling the trapping of a significantly larger number of molecules than previous techniques. Furthermore, the energy spacing between the X^2 Σ^+ (200) and X^2 Σ^+ (03^11) vibrational manifolds was measured, confirming the presence of numerous low-frequency rovibrational transitions that are sensitive to variations in the proton-to-electron mass ratio. This mass ratio sensitivity is a direct prediction of the existence of ultralight dark matter (UDM), providing evidence supporting UDM physics.

Conclusion: SrOH molecules demonstrate potential as probes for both CP violation and dark matter detection. Their ability to undergo precise, systematic-free transitions, combined with the confirmation of sensitivity to the proton-to-electron mass ratio, shows promise for advancing our understanding of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, the trap achieved multi-fold enhancements in the number of trapped molecules, highlighting the scalability of this method for future applications in precision metrology.

Abstract: Polyatomic molecules are projected to be powerful tools in searches for
physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), including new CP-violating (CPV)
interactions and ultralight dark matter (UDM) particles. Certain degrees of
freedom present in polyatomic molecules enhance the sensitivity of these
searches, as well as reject systematic errors, but necessitate extensive
high-precision spectroscopy to identify pathways for optical cycling and
quantum state readout. Here we show how a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be
used to locate weak optical transitions and identify rovibronic states for
optical cycling and quantum control. We demonstrate this spectroscopic approach
with strontium monohydroxide (SrOH), which is a candidate for both CPV and UDM
searches. We identify two new repumping transitions in SrOH and implement them
in a deeper optical cycle to achieve 32400(4700) trapped molecules, a 4.5-fold
increase over the previous, shallower cycle. In addition, we determine the
energy spacing between the $X^{2}\Sigma^{+}(200)$ and $X^{2}\Sigma^{+}(03^10)$
vibrational manifolds of SrOH, confirming the existence of numerous
low-frequency rovibrational transitions that are sensitive to temporal
variations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, a predicted effect of the
existence of UDM.

Abstract: The FAMU experiment, supported and funded by the Italian Institute of Nuclear
Physics (INFN) and by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC),
aims to perform the first measurement of the ground-state hyperfine splitting
(1S-hfs) of muonic hydrogen ($\mu H$). This quantity is highly sensitive to the
proton's Zemach radius $R_Z$. An experimental determination of $R_Z$ provides
significant constraints on the parametrization of the proton form factors as
well as on theoretical models describing the proton's electromagnetic
structure. Following years of technological and methodological development, the
FAMU experiment began operations in 2023 at Port 1 of the RIKEN-RAL muon beam
line at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source facility (Didcot, UK). In this paper,
we first describe the unique detection technique employed by FAMU to determine
the 1S-hfs of muonic hydrogen, followed by a detailed presentation of the final
experimental layout. Finally, we report the first outcome from the 2023
commissioning run and from the initial physics runs performed in 2023 and 2024.

Abstract: The previously applied independent atom model (IAM) for highly charged
ion-molecule collisions which implemented the suppression of multiple
ionization and capture on the basis of geometric overlaps of cross-sectional
areas representing ion-atom cross sections using a pixel counting method (PCM),
[Phys. Rev. A {\bf 101}, 062709 (2020)] is extended to incorporate the
possibility of multiple collisions within the molecule. This is accomplished on
the basis of estimated mean free paths for sequential projectile-atom
collisions. The IAM-PCM was demonstrated to be successful in describing
proton-molecule collisions, and moderately-charged ion impact at high collision
energies. The new model does agree with these results, but has important
consequences for highly charged projectiles providing larger cross sections
than IAM-PCM, but still well below the simple additivity rule results.

Abstract: The right kind of theoretical treatment of direct Coulomb ionization of
inner-shell of target atoms including multiple ionization of their outer-shells
by using accurate x-ray fluorescence yield data and electron capture by
projectile ions from inner-shell electrons of target atoms enables us to fully
understand the complex physics issues with the heavy-ion-induced inner-shell
ionization phenomenon. Such great success has only been achieved recently
[Phys. Rev. A 111 (2025) 042827]. Aftermath, further investigations exhibit
such a picture only if the Fermi velocity of the elemental target is accurate,
as it takes a significant role in correct evaluation of charge-state
distribution of the projectile ions inside the target, which contributes an
invaluable share in calculating the electron capture-induced ionization cross
section correctly. In this work, we devise a powerful method that enables us to
measure the correct and accurate Fermi velocity for almost every elemental
metal in the periodic table. As per our present knowledge, this in turn not
only improves our understanding of the said complex physics issues one step
ahead but also helps move toward further miniaturization of integrated circuits

Abstract: In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a
research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the
fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently
missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style
arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to
understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments
and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical
self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum
power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using
fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of
physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in
our universe.

Abstract: Efficient and coherent conversion between microwave and optical signals is
crucial for a wide range of applications, from quantum information processing

exploits continuous phase-matching rather than discrete resonances, enabling
unprecedented operational bandwidths exceeding 40 nm in the optical domain and
250 MHz in the microwave domain. By harnessing the strong piezoelectric and
photoelastic effects of TFLN, we achieve coherent conversion between 9 GHz
microwave photons and 1550 nm telecom photons via traveling phonons, with an
internal efficiency of 2.2% (system efficiency 2.4 *10^-4 ) at room

TL;DR: The paper discusses the modulation of optical resonances in dye-doped liquid crystal microdroplets influenced by external factors like size, shape, and temperature, as well as the use of gold nanoparticle clusters to enhance fluorescence emission through near-field interactions. The researchers employed optical tweezers to dynamically couple and excite whispering-gallery modes (WGMs), leading to significant tunability in the resonance modes, specifically a shift of up to seven nanometers without compromising the Q-factor.

Result: Significant tunability in the resonance modes was achieved, with a seven-nanometer shift in spectral position. The Q-factor remained的有效保持, showing efficient photonic plasmonic coupling. The reversibility of tuning is demonstrated, highlighting potential applications in controllable optical systems.

Conclusion: This research advances the understanding and control of optical resonances in integrated plasmonic and photonic systems, opening possibilities for applications in sensing, energy conversion, and optical communications.

Abstract: Dye doped liquid crystal (LC) microdroplets exhibit tunable optical
resonances modulated by size, shape, temperature, and external perturbations.
When a dye-doped nematic microdroplet is coupled to a gold nanoparticle
cluster, near-field interactions enhance local electric fields, boosting
fluorescence emission. Optical tweezers serve as a tool for the parking of dye
doped nematic microdroplets on gold nanoparticle clusters, enabling the dynamic
coupling and excitation of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). This configuration
resulted in amplified WGMs, with a clearly detectable shift in the spectral
position. Resonance mode red shifts confirmed efficient photonic plasmonic
coupling, with up to seven nm tunability achieved without significant
degradation of the Q-factor. The magnitude of tunability depends on the size of
the gold nanoparticle cluster. Also, the WGM emission spectrum of the nematic
microdroplet can be reversibly tuned by decoupling from the gold nanoparticle
cluster.

Abstract: Stationary scattering of TE and TM waves propagating in an isotropic medium
with planar symmetry is described by Bergmann's equation in one dimension. This
is a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer
matrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a
dynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency
scattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the
scattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the
construction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose
time-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct
the low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and
transmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of
Brewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive
analytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and
non-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of
this method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when
the carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary
conditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space. Because
acoustic waves propagating in a compressible fluid with planar symmetry are
also described by Bergmann's equation, our results apply to the low-frequency
scattering of these waves.

Abstract: Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components;
therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial
step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space
applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since
conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions,
an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser
imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The
system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its
surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby
preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied
to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is
observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample
types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation)
and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne
radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage
size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished
damage features as small as 35 ${\mu}$m.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a robust method to measure the free surface of superfluid helium, despite challenges like low refractive index contrast, restricted optical access, and mechanical vibrations.

Method: The method involves using off-axis digital holography for full-field imaging in two cryogenic systems: a helium bath cryostat and a cryogen-free refrigerator. Machine-learning-based analysis is used to isolate noise-driven normal modes and their spatial structure.

Result: The result is the successful reconstruction of the dispersion relation for gravity-capillary waves and determination of film thickness in thick films, providing a quantitative benchmark for the approach.

Conclusion: Digital holography is a powerful and versatile tool for high-resolution, minimally invasive studies of superfluid surfaces.

Abstract: Visualising the free surface of superfluid helium offers a rare opportunity
to explore wave dynamics in the limit of vanishing viscosity. Such measurements
are nonetheless challenging due to helium's low refractive index contrast,
restricted optical access to the cryogenic setups required to maintain helium
in its superfluid phase, and mechanical vibrations from the various cooling
stages. Overcoming these limitations will enable quantitative studies of
surface-wave dynamics with applications in fluid mechanics, quantum simulation,
and quantum optomechanics. Here we report the first implementation of off-axis
digital holography for full-field imaging of the free surface of superfluid
$^{\text{4}}$He. We perform non-contact measurements of nanometre- to
micrometre-scale interface fluctuations in two cryogenic systems: a traditional
helium bath cryostat and a cryogen-free refrigerator. We employ
machine-learning-based analysis to isolate noise-driven normal modes and their
spatial structure in both systems. This enables reconstruction of the
dispersion relation for gravity-capillary waves in macroscopic samples and, for
thick films, determination of the film thickness from the measured dispersion,
providing a quantitative benchmark for our approach. These proof-of-concept
experiments show that digital holography is a powerful and versatile tool for
high-resolution, minimally invasive studies of superfluid surfaces, with strong
potential for integration into diverse experimental platforms.

Abstract: Significant efforts have been devoted to manipulating topological states,
which often manifest as localized modes at interfaces between distinct
topological phases. In this work, we demonstrate a versatile approach to
sculpting topological modes (TMs) into any desired shapes by incorporating
various artificial gauge fields (AGFs), including scalar, vector, and imaginary
gauge potentials, and leveraging the power of artificial neural networks
(ANNs). These AGFs enable precise tuning of the dissipation of the TMs across
that of bulk modes, facilitating a transition from localized to fully
delocalized states. Moreover, ANNs allow precise engineering of these
eigenmodes to achieve tailored profiles of topological states, which remain
spectrally isolated within the bandgap and exhibit minimal loss compared to
other modes. Our theoretical results are experimentally validated on silicon
photonic platforms, demonstrating flexible manipulation of TM profiles. This
approach enables the design of topological states with customized properties,
offering significant potential for diverse applications in photonics and
beyond.

theory, the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift of normally incident quasi-plane wave
are found to be enhanced at the reflection peak. Simulations of normally
incident Gaussian beam with finite beam width show that the
Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift is dependent on the beam width.

Abstract: When light propagates through a randomly correlated, slowly varying medium,
it generates optical branched flow. Previous studies have demonstrated that the
self-focusing effect in optical media can accelerate the appearance of the
first branching points and sharpen the filaments of branched flow. In this
study, we investigate the influence of the nonlocality of the nonlinear
response on branched flow. We find that, due to its averaging effect, as the
range of nonlocality increases, the first branching point shifts to a greater
distance, and the flow structures broaden, thus nonlocality ultimately restores
the branched flow to its linear condition. We have developed a semi-analytical
formula and confirmed the screening of the self-focusing effect on branching
flow by nonlocality.

Abstract: Collisions of relativistic light ions such as oxygen, neon, and magnesium,
have been proposed as way to examine the system-size dependence of dynamics
typically associated with the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of
heavier ions such as xenon, gold, or lead. Recent efforts at both the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider have produced large
datasets of proton-oxygen, oxygen-oxygen, and neon-neon collisions, catalyzing
intense interest in experimental backgrounds associated with light ion
collisions. In particular, electromagnetic dissociation of light ions while
they are circulating in a collider can result in beam contamination that is
difficult to simulate precisely. Here we propose a data-driven method for
evaluating the potential impact of beam contaminants on physics analyses. The
method exploits the time-dependence and smaller size of contaminant ion species
to define control regions that can be used to quantify potential contamination
effects. A simple model is used to illustrate the method and to study its
robustness. This method can inform studies of recent LHC and RHIC data and
could also be useful for future light ion programs at the LHC and beyond.

Abstract: The low-level RF (LLRF) systems for linear accelerating structures are
typically based on heterodyne architectures. The linear accelerators normally
have many RF stations and multiple RF inputs and outputs for each station, so
the complexity and size of the LLRF system grows rapidly when scaling up. To
meet the design goals of being compact and affordable for future accelerators,
or upgrading existing ones, we have developed and characterized the next
generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform based on the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) for
S-band and C-band accelerating structures. The integrated RF data converters in
RFSoC sample and generate the RF signals directly without any analogue mixing
circuits, which significantly simplified the architecture compared with the
conventional LLRF systems. We have performed high-power tests for the NG-LLRF
with the S-band accelerating structure in the Next Linear Collider Test
Accelerator (NLCTA) test facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and a
C-band structure prototyped for Cool Cooper Collider (CCC). The NG-LLRF
platform demonstrated pulse-to-pulse fluctuation levels considerably better
than the requirements of the targeted applications and high precision and
flexibility in generating and measuring the RF pulses. In this paper, the
characterization results of the platform with different system architectures
will be summarized and a selection of high-power test results of the NG-LLRF
will be presented and analyzed.
