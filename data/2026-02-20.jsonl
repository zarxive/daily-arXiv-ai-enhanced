In this work, the influence of the electrical properties on heat transfer across metal/doped semiconductor junctions is investigated. Specifically, thermal boundary conductance at the interfaces between p- and n-doped silicon and titanium is measured by employing frequency-domain photothermal radiometry under varying external conditions. The influence of the doping level of the semiconductor, the barrier height, and the space charge area is analyzed. In particular, a 40% increase in the interface thermal conductance with the application of a current at n-doped silicon/titanium interfaces is reported. The enhancement of the thermal boundary conductance is explained by the shrinking of the surface charga area induced by the electric current. This study opens the way to modulating interfacial heat transfer at metal/semiconductor interfaces through fine tuning of electrical effects."}

One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs."}

Field-cooling from above the Néel temperature is a reliable yet slow re-pinning method in exchange-biased systems. For on-demand reprogrammable devices, localized and rapid exchange bias repinning methods are essential. Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature. We expand the use of our model by identifying material platforms and stack designs that lead to optimized performance, aiding further development of optically reprogrammable devices."}

As a crucial step, we demonstrate optimization of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) fabrication and analysis including the gate stack, bottom contact, graphene patterning and encapsulation process steps. The analysis methods include atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and most importantly electrical characterization. The electrical characterization focuses on comparing different test structures and extraction methods for mobility, contact resistance, IV-curve hysteresis and doping parameters. The comparison shows that the selected measurement test structures and analysis methods can have a large impact on the extracted values and should thus be considered when comparing data sets between different sources.

This can be achieved without the need for obvious morphological or structural asymmetries in the form of the organism, or in the number or organisation of propulsion-generating appendages such as cilia. In this work, we identify and validate a core principle of asymmetric turning in biflagellate microswimmers: propulsive forces interact constructively to drive translation whilst interacting destructively to drive rotation. We explore the ramifications of this tunable biflagellar swimming mechanism across a range of systems, from a simple, back-of-the-envelope model to a detailed computational representation of an exemplar swimmer. This leads to a markedly general quantitative relation between key drivers of asymmetry, such as ciliary beat frequency, and the curvature of emergent trajectories. We discuss how the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which actuates its two cilia in a symmetric breaststroke for forward swimming, may exploit this feature for phototaxis. Finally, we validate our predictions in a Chlamydomonas-inspired robophysical model, implementing closed-loop control to achieve phototactic turning."}

The model explicitly incorporates stochastic particle transport and scattering processes using validated Geant4 cross-sections, while self-consistently evolving the electric potential and field. As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems.

This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

The improved accuracy is achieved through a two-stage generation strategy, in which the first diffusion model is explicitly trained with Maxwells equation-based loss to embed physical insight directly into the inverse design process, while the second model maps the physically consistent intermediate representation to the final structural geometry with significantly higher fidelity than solely data-driven approaches. The performance of MxDiffusion is validated on two representative applications: gold nanostructures patterned on a silica substrate and a highly tunable bandpass filter based on phase change material. In both cases, the proposed framework consistently outperforms a conventional data-driven diffusion model benchmark, particularly for out-of-training-distribution design targets and highly constrained resonance conditions. These results demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of MxDiffusion as a general physics-guided inverse design paradigm."}

In these systems it is known that relativistic effects, such as the Breit interaction and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, are important for an accurate understanding of atomic properties. It is also known that inclusion of correlations alongside the Breit effect is crucial. In this work we include the Breit interaction into all-orders calculations of energy levels and fine structure intervals of ions in the Cs and Fr isoelectronic sequences. This requires modifying the electron Green's function to account for Breit within the all-orders correlation potential method, which sums dominating series of perturbation diagrams exactly using a Feynman diagram technique. We find that Breit corrections to the energies of moderately ionized ions along these sequences are very large, particularly for the f states. We also observe a significant deviation from experiment for these levels. Incorporating Breit into the all-orders correlation potential provides a significant additional contribution beyond including Breit at the second-order level alone. While this does not resolve the disagreement in the energy levels, it does substantially improve the fine-structure intervals beyond what is achieved by including Breit only at second order. Furthermore, we include the frequency-dependent Breit interaction into the Dirac-Fock procedure, and find that this does not significantly modify the energy levels at this order of approximation."}

The incident angle affects all terms in the expansion while the lateral heat conduction appears only in terms of positive even powers.

The main effect of lateral heat conduction is contained in the second order term, which is mathematically negligible in the limit of small depth to lateral scale ratio. At a moderate length scale ratio (e.g., 0.1), however, the contribution from lateral conduction is quite significant and needs to be included in a meaningful approximate solution. In this study, we derive closed form analytical expressions for the first order and the second order terms in the asymptotic expansion. The resulting asymptotic solution is capable of predicting the temperature distribution accurately including the effects of both incident angle and lateral heat conduction even at a moderate length scale ratio."}

Furthermore, we compute the Mandel $Q$ parameter and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ to analyze the statistical properties of the Dunkl squeezed states. We show that, for the squeezed vacuum, the Mandel parameter remains independent of the Dunkl deformation, whereas the correlation function exhibits an explicit dependence on the Dunkl parameter $μ$, which modifies the photon bunching effects. Finally, we show that our results reduce to the standard parametric amplifier case in the limit of vanishing Dunkl deformation parameter."}

To reduce the computational overhead associated with training, particularly when Hessian information is included, we implement graphics processing unit accelerated black box matrix matrix multiplication, achieving an order of magnitude speedups relative to standard implementations. For rate calculations, we introduce a selective Hessian training strategy that distinguishes flexible modes strongly coupled to the transferring proton from more rigid modes weakly coupled to the reaction coordinate. This enables the construction of accurate surrogate potential energy surfaces with substantially fewer Hessian evaluations. Applications to malonaldehyde and Z-3-aminopropenal demonstrate that tunneling rates can be predicted within 20% of exact values while reducing force and Hessian evaluations. The approach is further extended to tunneling splitting calculations for the formic acid dimer and malonaldehyde, yielding splittings in reasonable agreement with experiment and high level theoretical results."}

Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center.

When rhythms arise from limit cycles, phase reduction theory shows that their dynamics are universally modeled as coupled phase oscillators under weak coupling. This simple representation enables direct inference of inter-rhythm coupling functions from measured time-series data. However, strongly rhythmic chaos can masquerade as noisy limit cycles. In such cases, standard estimators still return plausible coupling functions even though a phase-oscillator model lacks a priori justification. We therefore extend the phase description to the chaotic oscillators. Specifically, we derive a closed equation for the phase difference by defining the phase on a Poincaré section and averaging the phase dynamics over invariant measures of the induced return maps. Numerically, the derived theoretical functions are in close agreement with those inferred from time-series data. Consequently, our results justify the applicability of phase description to coupled chaotic oscillators and show that data-driven coupling functions retain clear dynamical meaning in the absence of limit cycles."}

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation."}

The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated.

Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization.

Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current."}

Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling."}

We derive these formulae, which have previously appeared in the literature, in a new manner and highlight certain aspects of them, such as their connection to the density matrix and its eigenvalues. The spacetime nature of the formulation makes it particularly apt in the context of semiclassical and quantum gravity and in connection to black hole entropy. Another useful property of the formulation is its application to settings where no notion of a Cauchy surface exists, such as in the causal set theory approach to quantum gravity. We show example applications of the formulae which demonstrate their ability to reproduce known results.

Compared to ultrafast spectroscopies, these techniques have very high structural-information content and competitive time-resolution, but sensitivity to relative changes in electron scattering intensity is orders of magnitude lower. Hybrid pixel counting detectors (HPCDs) are a promising technology for improved sensitivity and signal-to-noise in UED(S) experiments, as they offer near-zero readout noise and dark counts with the possibility of new acquisition modalities (e.g. shot-to-shot normalization) due to their high frame rates. However, it is well known that HPCDs suffer from count losses at high electron fluxes even in CW beam applications. How this translates to ultrashort electron pulse exposures has yet to be determined and is critical to understanding the application of this technology to ultrafast electron scattering experiments. Here we show that count losses are exacerbated significantly in ultrafast (pulsed) experiments and that HPCDs require count rates to be kept below $\\approx 2$ electrons per pixel per pulse. This count-rate limitation presents a severe constraint on electron bunch charge when interrogating single crystal samples. A model for the electron counting uncertainties in HPCDs across the entire relevant range of average count rates is proposed, from which we derive experimental strategies to optimize data quality in UEDS using direct electron detectors. Finally, we suggest ways HPCDs could be better adapted to ultrashort pulsed beam experiments."}

To clarify how the molecular rotation and the nuclear spins influence the fine and hyperfine structure of molecular Rydberg-Stark spectra, we compare calculated spectra of ortho-D$_2$ with a D$_2^+$ ion core in the rotational ground state ($N^+=0$) for total nuclear spins $I$ of 0 (i.e., without hyperfine structure) and 2 (i.e., with hyperfine structure) with the corresponding spectra of para-H$_2$ with an H$_2^+$ ion core in the first excited rotational state ($N^+=2$) but zero nuclear spin ($I=0$). The calculations show that the hyperfine interaction alone does not significantly modify the Stark effect, but splits each Stark state by almost exactly the hyperfine Fermi-contact splitting of the ion core. In contrast, the effect of the molecular rotation, which is coupled both to the ion-core electron spin by the magnetic spin-rotation interaction and to the Rydberg-electron orbital motion by the core-polarization and charge-quadrupole interactions, induces Stark-state specific splittings that significantly differ from the spin-rotation splitting of the ($N^+=2$) ion core."}

Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes.

Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \\approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \\approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order.

A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Using similarity transformations, we determine the conditions yielding real energy spectra and skin effect, and identify the emergence of exceptional points where spectra transition from real to complex. We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges. These findings reveal the sensitivity of spectral and localization properties to boundary conditions, providing a framework for engineering quantum lattice models with tailored spectral and localization features, with potential applications in quantum devices."}

By combining a perturbative renormalization group analysis and large-scale matrix-product state simulations, we systematically determine the nature of the phase transition as a function of $N$. For $N=2$ and $N=3$, we confirm that the transition is continuous, belonging to the Ising and four-state Potts universality classes, respectively. In contrast, for $N \\ge 4$, our results provide compelling evidence that the transition becomes first order. We further apply these findings to specific lattice models with SO($N$) symmetry, including spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ two-leg ladders, that realize a direct transition between an SO($N$) symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase.

At its heart lies the exchange-correlation functional, a quantity which exactly encapsulates the many-body effects stemming from the quantum mechanical interactions between the electrons. Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency.\n  This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems.\n  This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics."}

In pre-geometric gravity (PGG), spacetime emerges from the spontaneous breaking of a fundamental gauge symmetry. This mechanism dynamically generates general relativity while also revealing a deep connection: the topological Gauss-Bonnet coupling of the theory scales precisely as the de Sitter entropy, an enormous number which reflects the information content of our universe. This coupling acts as a gravitational $θ$-angle parameter, forcing the CC to become quantized into discrete topological sectors. The symmetry-breaking dynamics naturally selects the sector corresponding to the observed vacuum energy. The selected vacuum state is stabilized by the extremely large potential barrier of the pre-geometric Higgs field, which effectively seals it off from quantum tunneling transitions to other topological sectors. The PGG framework thus provides a dynamical explanation for the smallness of the CC, linking gravity, topology and quantum information in a unified picture."}

By supplementing the orthogonal x- and y- complex amplitude components with an additional 45°-component, this approach calculates the retardance between two orthogonal polarization components while eliminating phase offsets, thereby enabling the subsequent recovery of the complete polarization state.

We construct variational quantum circuits that generate symmetry-broken and symmetry-protected topological states with long-range order in one-dimensional systems at finite energy density, where equilibrium states are typically featureless. Importantly, the learned states can exhibit unconventional features with enhanced metrological properties such as a quantum Fisher information close to a GHZ state, but robust against local measurements.

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation."}

The analyzed system is half-metallic with a ferrimagnetic order, presenting a zero net total magnetic moment per unit cell. We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications."}

Here, we demonstrate that correlated disorder enables precise engineering of light scattering from 2D arrays of emitters resulting in strong observable colors. Our analytical framework shows that introducing controlled noise, with tunable probability density functions and correlations, generates three distinct scattering components: diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. Correlation halos, often mistaken for broadened diffraction peaks, are independent features whose positions depend on correlation range and can appear between Bragg peaks. Crucially, they persist far beyond the regime where diffraction orders vanish. The noise probability density function provides an additional control: specific diffraction orders can be selectively suppressed while preserving others. This approach reproduces the scattering signatures of natural photonic structures, e.g. found in Morpho butterflies, and reveals multiple pathways from order to disorder, each with distinct optical properties. Our work provides a practical method for inverse design -finding the disorder that produces desired scattering patterns. This establishes diffuse scattering as a designable quantity, expanding the toolkit for metasurfaces and structural color beyond periodic and hyperuniform structures."}

Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling."}

The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity). We further elaborate about the stability properties of SBSs which have been the subject of some controversy recently."}

Additionally, quantum approaches are particularly suitable when classical methods are observed to get trapped in local minima, the problem size is manageable given hardware constraints (less than 5000 variables for pure quantum annealing), and the time overhead of approximately 10 seconds is acceptable for the application.\n  In contrast, classical methods are recommended when the gradient variance is low (less than 0.2), indicating smooth landscapes where quantum tunneling provides little advantage. Classical approaches are also preferable when the problem size is small and classical solvers can provide nearly instantaneous results, when solution quality requirements are modest and local optima suffice, or when hardware access or cost is a limiting factor.\n  For problems that exceed pure quantum capacity but possess a favorable landscape structure, hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical techniques are recommended. Such hybrid methods are particularly effective when decomposition quality can be verified and both solution quality and scalability are important considerations."}

Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid.

The underlying principle involves optical pumping, which creates a mesoscopic potential landscape whose spatial variations are slow compared to the lattice period. Such a potential localizes a Bloch band into trapped states whose envelope functions, and thus far-field singularity textures, are defined by the pump geometry. Using a honeycomb photonic crystal that supports a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum, we achieve room-temperature telecom-band lasing with real-space polarisation singularities that are reconfigurable in both number and position, while the intrinsic momentum-space singularity at the $Γ$-point is preserved.

This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors."}

Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling."}

Recent work has provided three complementary descriptions of this phenomenon: an emergent $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ organization of static near-zone perturbations, a graded logarithmic and multi-zeta structure in Shell Effective Field Theory (Shell EFT), and an on-shell matching framework based on gravitational Raman scattering with renormalization group (RG) running. We show that these features arise from a common near-zone truncation mechanism. For a massless scalar field, horizon regularity selects a unique static solution forming a highest-weight-type representation, truncating the hypergeometric solution to a finite polynomial and eliminating the independent decaying branch at large radius. This excludes a static Wilson coefficient in the effective theory. We demonstrate that the same truncation operates in the static Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. Analytic continuation of the horizon-regular solution to small frequency via the Coulomb-hypergeometric or Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalisms preserves this truncation as an anchoring condition for the renormalized angular momentum parameter. The resulting low-frequency expansion is controlled by Gamma and hypergeometric functions, generating a graded algebra of logarithms and odd Riemann zeta values. Within this structure no invariant of negative weight exists in the static sector, so the vanishing of the static Love number follows as a structural consequence. This explains the ``zero-sum'' rule of Shell EFT and why the self-induced RG flow in gravitational Raman scattering cannot generate a static invariant."}

These advances have opened new opportunities in high-resolution imaging, ultrafast spectroscopy, interferometry, and the coherent shaping of electron wavepackets. This review surveys stimulated interactions between slow electrons and light, encompassing free-space and near-field mediated mechanisms. We discuss how free-space optical fields coherently modulate electron momentum and energy, and how near-field coupling in nanophotonic and plasmonic structures enables strong, phase-matched, efficient momentum exchange with the electron wavepacket. We further describe electron recoil, which is significant in the slow-electron regime, and temporal and spatial wavepacket shaping that enhances coupling efficiency and extends access to quantum-coherent regimes. Building on these foundations, we outline emerging frameworks including hybrid optical-electrostatic modulation, ponderomotive laser-based aberration correction, and optical electron interferometry. By unifying these developments, stimulated electron-light interactions provide a versatile route to precise beam control, quantum-state engineering, and tailored light-matter coupling, with implications for ultrafast spectroscopy, nanoscale metrology, attosecond pulse generation, electron-photon entanglement, and the creation of nonclassical states of light."}

Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies."}

When restricted to phase-only modulation, intensity must be shaped through global phase interference effects, making the inverse mapping from target intensity to phase highly non-linear and sensitive to local minima. We present a proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop approach in which a transformer maps a target intensity image to a phase-only SLM field and is trained end-to-end through exact FFT-based propagation embedded directly within optimization.

Despite training on limited primitives and restricted digit subsets, the learned generator exhibits out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to unseen digits and hand-drawn target patterns.

This relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing and no more. Here we develop an axiomatisation of quantum computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimisation, including brute force computer search, to optimise quantum computations. The free model may be interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model, but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning."}

This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios.

Current QEC controllers execute all scheduled syndrome (parity-bit) measurement rounds before decoding, even when early syndrome data indicates that the run will result in an error. The resulting excess measurements increase the decoder's workload and system latency. To address this, we introduce an adaptive abort module that simultaneously reduces decoder overhead and suppresses logical error rates in surface codes and color codes under an existing QEC controller. The key idea is that initial syndrome information allows the controller to terminate risky shots early before additional resources are spent. An effective scheme balances the cost of further measurement against the restart cost and thus increases decoder efficiency.\n  Adaptive abort schemes dynamically adjust the number of syndrome measurement rounds per shot using real-time syndrome information. We consider three schemes: fixed-depth (FD) decoding (the standard non-adaptive approach used in current state-of-the-art QEC controllers), and two adaptive schemes, AdAbort and One-Step Lookahead (OSLA) decoding. For surface and color codes under a realistic circuit-level depolarizing noise model, AdAbort substantially outperforms both OSLA and FD, yielding higher decoder efficiency across a broad range of code distances. Numerically, as the code distance increases from 5 to 15, AdAbort yields an improvement that increases from 5% to 35% for surface codes and from 7% to 60% for color codes.\n  To our knowledge, these are the first adaptive abort schemes considered for QEC. Our results highlight the potential importance of abort rules for increasing efficiency as we scale to large, resource-intensive quantum architectures."}

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation."}

We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases.

We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield Γ> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases."}

Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing."}

This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations.

This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias."}

One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts.

Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--García black hole as the seed."}

We demonstrate that the Allan-variance noise floor scales with the inverse of the detected photon number $1/N_r$, confirming shot-noise-limited operation with WVA. Furthermore, this $1/N_r$ scaling experimentally validates that WVA can outperform conventional measurement under fixed detected photon number and detector saturation, in the presence of technical noise, as theoretically predicted [Phys.

This mechanism dynamically generates general relativity while also revealing a deep connection: the topological Gauss-Bonnet coupling of the theory scales precisely as the de Sitter entropy, an enormous number which reflects the information content of our universe. This coupling acts as a gravitational $θ$-angle parameter, forcing the CC to become quantized into discrete topological sectors. The symmetry-breaking dynamics naturally selects the sector corresponding to the observed vacuum energy. The selected vacuum state is stabilized by the extremely large potential barrier of the pre-geometric Higgs field, which effectively seals it off from quantum tunneling transitions to other topological sectors. The PGG framework thus provides a dynamical explanation for the smallness of the CC, linking gravity, topology and quantum information in a unified picture."}

Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center.

We demonstrate continuous key exchange over more than 4 km of metropolitan optical fiber, where the prototype maintained stable, uninterrupted operation across a measurement spanning more than 12 day-night cycles without manual intervention."}

A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws."}

This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation."}

By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases.

We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield Γ> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs.

The obstruction is intrinsic: with finite sampling, normalization becomes a statistical bottleneck, and support mismatch between numerator and denominator estimators can render the empirical objective ill-conditioned and even sub-variational. Moreover, to reproduce the ground state with constant-depth ansatzes or with linear-depth circuits forming unitary 2-designs, the required reweighting range (and hence the sampling cost) grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Motivated by this no-go result, we develop a normalization-free alternative, the unitary variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (U-VQNHE). U-VQNHE retains the practical appeal of a learnable diagonal post-processing layer while guaranteeing variational safety, and numerical experiments on transverse-field Ising models demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness over both VQE and DNP-based variants."}

We show that the Krylov bounds converge to the QFI exponentially fast with increasing order and can surpass the state-of-the-art polynomial lower bounds known to date. Moreover, we show that certain low-order Krylov bound can already match the QFI exactly for low-rank states prevalent in practical settings.

After the boundary is reached, a slight difference appears, but this difference does not amplify with evolution and tends to converge in the later stage. Method B yields a slightly higher dissipative-state probability, indicating that the photon escapes faster. Visualization of the two-dimensional probability distribution shows that the three scenarios (closed system, open system with Method A, and open system with Method B) exhibit identical probability distributions before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, the open systems exhibit significant probability loss, which increases rapidly with evolution. The probability distribution patterns of the two open systems are highly similar, exhibiting synchronized evolution."}

Here, we investigate whether sets of quantum measurements can be modelled by using only devices that are operationally classical, in the sense that they have no superposition properties. This leads us to propose classical measurement models, which we show to be stronger than commutative measurements but weaker than joint measurability. We determine both the exact depolarisation noise rate and the measurement loss rate at which the all projective measurements in $d$-dimensional quantum theory admit a classical model. For finite sets of quantum measurements we develop methods both for constructing classical models and for falsifying the existence of such model via prepare-and-measure setups. Furthermore, we show that this concept also has operational implications. For that, we consider whether quantum measurements with classical side-information can be implemented in sequence without causing a disturbance and we show that classical models imply an affirmative answer. Our work sheds light on superposition as a resource for quantum measurement devices."}

Among existing approaches, variational quantum algorithms and quantum annealing dominate current research; however, both typically rely on one-hot encodings that severely limit scalability. Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) was recently introduced as an alternative paradigm that reduces qubit requirements by embedding problem variables into Pauli correlations. Despite its promise, PCE has not yet been studied in the context of constrained optimization. In this work, we extend the PCE framework to constrained combinatorial optimization problems and evaluate its performance across multiple problem sizes. Our results show that the standard PCE formulation struggles to reliably enforce constraints, which motivates the introduction of the Iterative-$α$ PCE. This iterative strategy significantly improves solution quality, achieving consistent constraint satisfaction while yielding better cut sizes across a wide range of instances. These findings highlight both the limitations of current PCE formulations for constrained problems and the effectiveness of iterative strategies for advancing quantum optimization in the NISQ era."}

Although not a genuine entanglement measure, both TE and OE are connected to the efficiency of matrix product state simulations and thus of fundamental interest. As in many quantum algorithms, at the end of the Grover circuit entanglement decreases as the system converges towards the target product state. While we find that this is well captured in the OE dynamics, quantum trajectories rarely follow paths of reducing entanglement. Optimized unraveling schemes can lower TE slightly, however we show that deep in the circuit OE is generally smaller than TE.

We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector. This thus not quite so simple harmonic oscillator provides an explicit realization of our general contention that antilinearity is more basic to quantum theory than Hermiticity."}

SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates.

This is the case for a canonical problem: estimating the amplitude and frequency of an AC magnetic field, where the generators are parallel to each other.
