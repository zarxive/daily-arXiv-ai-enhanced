This was\nseen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that\ndescribes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay\ndepends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir\ncorrelations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the\nLiouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the\nnonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed\nvacuum reservoir.

From the\nSchrodinger's cat to quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jorsza algorithm,\nquantum superposition plays an important role. It is one fundamental and\ncrucial question how to quantify superposition. Until now, the framework of\ncoherence has been well established as one typical instance of quantum resource\ntheories. And the concept of coherence has been generalized into linearly\nindependent basis, projective measurements and POVMs. In this work, we will\nfocus on coherence measures for projective measurements or orthogonal\nsubspaces. One new condition, order-preserving condition, is proposed for such\nmeasures. This condition is rooted in the mathematical structure of Hilbert\nspaces' orthogonal decomposition. And by generalizing the 1/2-affinity of\ncoherence into subspace cases, we verify that this generalized coherence\nmeasure satisfies the order-preserving condition. And it also satisfies other\nreasonable conditions to be a good coherence measure.

Our results show that\nvariations in the negative cosmological constant significantly affect the\nrelationship between ADM mass and frequency, the critical magnetic monopole\ncharge, the size of the photon ring, and the kinematic characteristics of\nparticles at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Through ray-tracing\nstudies of the accretion disk's appearance, we find that for non-frozen boson\nstars, the absence of an event horizon leads to multiple photon rings appearing\nwithin the central shadow region. In contrast, for frozen boson stars, the\npresence of a critical event horizon causes their images to resemble those of\nSchwarzschild black holes, with no additional photon rings appearing within the\nshadow region. Furthermore, the negative cosmological constant significantly\nalters the image structure: a smaller ISCO radius leads to photon rings being\nobscured at specific viewing angles, preventing their appearance within the\nshadow region."}

Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing,\nwe develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we\nintroduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor\nproduct of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into\nsingle- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries\ngenerated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices).\nSince both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with\nidentity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result\nalso to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit\nrotations.

This yields width corrections to the decay rate and to the clock\nbehaviour under Lorentz boosts. We calculate the decay rate of a particle of\nmass $M$ modeled as a Gaussian wavepacket of width $a$ and centered at zero\nmomentum. We find the decay rate to be $\\Gamma_0 \\big[1- \\frac{3 a^2}{4 M^2}\n+\\mathcal{O}\\big(\\tfrac{a^4}{M^4}\\big)\\big]$ where $\\Gamma_0$ is the decay rate\nof the particle at rest treated as a plane wave. The leading correction is then\nof order $\\tfrac{a^2}{M^2}$. We then perform a Lorentz boost of velocity $v$ on\nthe above Gaussian and find that its decay rate does not decrease\n\\textit{exactly} by the Lorentz factor $\\sqrt{1-v^2}$. There is a correction of\norder $\\tfrac{a^2v^2}{M^2}$. Therefore, the decaying wave packet does not act\nexactly like a typical clock under Lorentz boosts and we refer to it is a \"WP\nclock\" (wave packet clock). A WP clock does not move with a single velocity\nrelative to an observer but has a spread in velocities (more specifically, a\nspread in momenta). Nonetheless, it is best viewed as a single clock as the\nwave packet represents a one-particle state in QFT. WP clocks do not violate\nLorentz symmetry and are not based on new physics: they are a consequence of\nthe combined requirements of special relativity, quantum mechanics and\n\\textit{localized} free particles."}

This can\nbe useful at weak coupling but fails at strong coupling. In this work, we\npresent two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling. We apply the\nseries to a basic integral as well as a QM path integral containing a quadratic\nand quartic term with coupling constant $\\lambda$. The first series is the\nusual asymptotic one, where the quartic interaction is expanded in powers of\n$\\lambda$. The second series is an expansion of the quadratic part where the\ninteraction is left alone. This yields an absolutely convergent series in\ninverse powers of $\\lambda$ valid at strong coupling. For the basic integral,\nwe revisit the first series and identify what makes it diverge even though the\noriginal integral is finite. We fix the problem and obtain, remarkably, a\nseries in powers of the coupling which is absolutely convergent and valid at\nstrong coupling. We explain how this series avoids Dyson's argument on\nconvergence. We then consider the QM path integral (discretized with time\ninterval divided into $N$ equal segments). As before, the second series is\nabsolutely convergent and we obtain analytical expressions in inverse powers of\n$\\lambda$ for the $n$th order terms by taking functional derivatives of\ngeneralized hypergeometric functions. The expressions are functions of $N$ and\nwe work them out explicitly up to third order. The general procedure has been\nimplemented in a Mathematica program that generates the expressions at any\norder $n$. We present numerical results at strong coupling for different values\nof $N$ starting at $N=2$. The series matches the exact numerical value for a\ngiven $N$ (up to a certain accuracy). The continuum is formally reached when\n$N\\to \\infty$ but in practice this can be reached at small $N$."}

In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\\nu=1/3$ Laughlin\nfractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong\nattractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive\ninteraction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction\nbetween the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers\nof quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating\nwhile remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes\nbound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states\nexperimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton\nspectroscopy.
