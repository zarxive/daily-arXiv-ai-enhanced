Recent localisation results in the dual 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ circular quiver gauge theories provide us with strong coupling expansions of certain correlators involving twisted half-BPS operators. To leading order, these results have been matched to an effective theory for massless twisted string states, which can be constructed by resolving the orbifold singularity and considering localised supergravity modes on the resolution cycles. Applying this reasoning to subleading order in strong coupling, we observe that for $L\\neq 2,3,4,6$, a naive reduction of the 10d $(\u03b1')^3$-correction does not result in the correct coefficients to match the localisation result. We explain this mismatch by the appearance of twisted sector resonances in string amplitudes involving external twisted sector states. We perform the low-energy expansion of a ``twisted'' Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude and recover the expected coefficients, suggesting that the orbifold resolution and the low-energy expansion can not be interchanged directly.

Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and St\u00fcckelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase.

Changes in leaf architecture disrupt internal light scattering dynamics and consequently affect photosynthetic performance. Previous studies on internal leaf light scattering have primarily relied on ray-tracing approaches (e.g., Raytran) or radiative-transfer models (e.g., PROSPECT). However, these high-frequency approximations cannot capture diffraction and coherent multiple scattering in wavelength-scale leaf tissues, unlike full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Here, we employ GPU-accelerated Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations to model internal light scattering dynamics using segmented cross-section image geometries of representative dicot and monocot leaves with wavelength-dependent complex refractive indices. The simulations accurately reproduce the reflectance and transmittance characteristics of healthy leaves, showing strong agreement with the PROSPECT model, with average Lin's concordance values of 0.8962 for dicot leaves and 0.7849 for monocot leaves. We further simulate early-stage necrotrophic fungal infection by modeling melanized hyphae penetrating the cuticle and upper epidermis. Diseased leaves exhibit a pronounced reduction in visible green reflectance and a marked suppression of the near-infrared reflectance plateau, consistent with experimental observations. Remaining discrepancies in the visible band are expected to be reduced through more advanced geometric and material modeling.

While BTZ black holes are stable under standard Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we demonstrate that they can develop instabilities when subjected to double-trace boundary conditions. Our key findings are threefold. First, we show that BTZ black holes exhibit instabilities not only for non-axisymmetric modes $\\unicode{x2013}$ previously the only known unstable sector $\\unicode{x2013}$ but crucially also for axisymmetric modes. Second, we prove that the axisymmetric instability is the dominant and most fundamental: configurations unstable to any non-axisymmetric mode are already unstable to the axisymmetric one. Third, we identify regions in the BTZ parameter space where these black holes are unstable while global AdS$_3$ remains stable, and we map the complete onset curves that determine the corresponding stability boundaries. Unlike conventional superradiant instabilities, the BTZ double-trace instability occurs for angular velocities always satisfying the Hawking-Reall bound. We trace the physical origin of these instabilities to the influx of energy and angular momentum through the asymptotic boundary permitted by double-trace deformations for a particular sign of the coupling, rather than to near-horizon effects. Our results provide a prototype for understanding double-trace instabilities in higher-dimensional rotating AdS black holes and suggest the existence of rotating hairy black hole solutions with scalar condensates, which we construct in a companion paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53cc track \u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684 BTZ \u9ed1\u6d1e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u53d8\u5f62\u5141\u8bb8\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fb9\u754c\u6d41\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5171\u632f\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65cb\u8f6c AdS \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u6697\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u5e26\u6709\u6807\u91cf\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u6027\u6bdb\u53d1\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u914d\u5957\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u65cb\u8f6c BTZ \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c BTZ \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40 AdS3 \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4.", "result": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684 BTZ \u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\uff1a\u4efb\u4f55\u975e\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a Configuration \u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86 BTZ \u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6027\u4e0d\u7a33\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5206\u754c\u7ebf\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u578b BTZ \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u59cb\u7ec8\u6ee1\u8db3 Hawking-Reall \u754c\u9650\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fb9\u754c\u4f20\u8f93\u662f\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c AdS \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u6807\u91cf\u51dd\u805a\u7269\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u6027\u6bdb\u53d1\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u65cbBTZ\u9700\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c AdS \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53cc\u8f68\u9053\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u5e26\u6709\u6807\u91cf\u51dd\u805a\u7269\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u6027\u6bdb\u53d1\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

For diagonal states the GKSL dynamics reduces to the classical two-state master equation.The density-matrix language permits an operational ``Bloch half-disk'' embedding with overlap parameter $c(\\varepsilon)$ quantifying partition fuzziness; the GKSL model is fitted to diagonal marginals treating $c(\\varepsilon)$ as diagnostic. We derive closed-form solutions, an explicit Kraus representation (generalized amplitude damping with dephasing and rotation), and practical diagnostics for the time-homogeneous first-order Markov assumption (order tests, Chapman--Kolmogorov consistency, run-length statistics, stationarity checks). When higher-order memory appears, we extend the framework via augmented Markov models, constructing CPTP maps through discrete-time Kraus representations; continuous-time GKSL generators may not exist for all empirical transition matrices. We provide a numerical pipeline with templates for validating the framework on Duffing simulations.

We employ a hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo (hMCMC) simulation method which combines classical MCMC for localized spins and exact diagonalization of the electronic Hamiltonian. Two of the spin-charge ground states, respectively consists of three-site and six-site ferromagnetic (FM) clusters arranged in anti-FM and $120^{\\circ}$ Yafet-Kittel (YK) phase which we label as S-AF (super-antiferromagnet) and S-YK (super-YK) respectively. Two even more interesting coupled spin-charge states, respectively accommodate FM dimers and trimers (as three-site line segment), which we label as FM-D and FM-T. In both cases, the anti-FM aligned dimers and trimers in respective phases, are arranged in stripes along one of three lattice directions: the spontaneously symmetry broken phases giving rise to non-trivial macroscopic degeneracy. These underlying magnetic textures (except S-YK state) restrict electrons in fragmented small regions (e.g, triangular units, two-site dimers, three-site line segments respectively in S-AF, FM-D and FM-T), resulting in flat bands by opening large gaps in electronic density of states, which in turn stabilize these coupled spin-charge states: a \"band effect\".

Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) provide a potential solution by enabling the reversible chemical binding and release of hydrogen. However, recent experimental studies have revealed a puzzling inhibition of catalytic activity during LOHC dehydrogenation, associated with the absence of hydrogen bubble formation, reduced hydrogen production rates and significant variability across experiments. In this work, we derive a model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this inhibition, taking into account both the reversible nature of the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reaction and the role of transport phenomena. Our results demonstrate that efficient transport of hydrogen away from the catalytic pellet is essential to suppress back-reactions and thereby maximize the performance of porous catalysts. In particular, we demonstrate that two distinct kinetic regimes - with high or strongly inhibited hydrogen production - can arise depending on whether bubble nucleation is enabled or suppressed.

The second lecture develops the classical theory of type IIB flux compactifications, both in ten dimensions and in the four-dimensional effective theory. The third lecture turns to the quantum theory of flux compactifications, including perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. With this foundation, in the fourth lecture we give a detailed treatment of the candidate de Sitter vacua recently constructed in arXiv:2406.13751.

This NoDES contribution has opposite sign for opposite enantiomers but remains invariant under reversal of the field ellipticity, enabling chirality detection that is robust against variations of the relative phase between orthogonal field components. We propose a protocol to isolate this component using only two velocity-map imaging projections and validate it through numerical simulations. Our calculations, performed in the two-photon resonantly-enhanced ionization, multi-photon, and strong-field ionization regimes with cross-polarized two-color fields show that the NoDES signal reaches about 1\\% of the energy-resolved ionization yield, comparable to photoelectron circular dichroism and much larger than standard magnetic-dipole chiroptical effects.

However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such \"joint\" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity.

In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moir\u00e9 superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \\textit{i.e.}, spin moir\u00e9 superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \\textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states.

The coexistence of bands with Dirac points similar to those in graphene, along with a completely flat band, makes this an ideal structure for investigating how lattice symmetries may protect topological and many-body correlation effects. Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system.

We demonstrate that dual-LAO, in combination with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, achieves an unprecedented acceleration factor of 15 to 30 times compared to current state-of-the-art methods on standard drug targets. Crucially, the approach maintains high accuracy and successfully tackles previously prohibitive molecular changes, including scaffold-hopping, buried water displacement, charge changes, ring-opening, and binding pose perturbations.

However, beyond the classical approximation, it is well-known that quantum corrections open decay channels through which oscillons radiate rapidly. Therefore it is believed that in the real world, oscillons are too short-lived to be phenomenologically relevant. We observe that previous calculations of the radiated power assume that the oscillon is in a coherent state. We show that a squeezed coherent state, on the other hand, would emit no radiation at leading order in the coupling. This leads us to the conclusion that the instantaneous radiation calculated in the literature corresponds not to the oscillon's decay, but rather to its relaxation from a coherent state to a lower-energy, squeezed coherent state, which then radiates much more slowly. As a result, the lifetime of the quantum oscillon is enhanced by an inverse power of the coupling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Oscillons, classically long-lived objects, are expected to decay quickly in quantum corrections.

However, its acquisition speed remains limited by fluorophore emission rates and photodamage. To increase the pixel rate of a two-photon microscope beyond a few megahertz (MHz), multi-point parallelized schemes have been proposed. Two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy emerges as an effective approach for high-speed multiphoton imaging of live specimens, as it enables parallelized excitation while minimizing the required laser power. However, optimizing the signal-to-photodamage ratio in 2P light-sheet microscopy requires to precisely control the illumination parameters, including both wavelength and pulse frequency. Since conventional femtosecond laser sources generally do not allow independent modulation of these parameters, the development of low-cost, efficient and robust strategies to modulate the temporal excitation profile is essential to fully exploit the advantages of 2P light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce a compact pulse splitting scheme that meets these criteria. We used cascaded birefringent crystals to convert each excitation laser pulse into an adjustable sequence of collinear sub-pulses. We demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing 2P light-sheet imaging of live zebrafish embryos. We analyze the impact of pulse splitting on photobleaching, nonlinear photodamage, and imaging performance. Additionally, we demonstrate high-speed 2P imaging of the beating heart and brain calcium dynamics using red fluorophores in live embryos. We achieve kilohertz imaging frame rate, reaching more than 150 MHz pixel rates with fluorescent signal levels above 10 $photons.pixel^{-1}$ using a laser mean power and a peak intensity in the range of 100 mW and 0.1 $TW.cm^{-2}$ at the sample, respectively.

Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework, we develop a transfer-matrix method to compute reflection and transmission coefficients for incident phonons and free particles. Our results reveal a scattering threshold at the Zeeman energy $E = \\hbar\u03a9_0$, separating a pure phonon regime from multi-channel scattering involving both collective and single-particle excitations above threshold. For large twist angles, competition between kinetic and Zeeman energies reduces the effective spin rotation, leading to comb-like density modulations and Fano-like resonances below threshold. The transition probability between phonon and particle channels is strongly tunable with $\u0398$, enhanced for odd multiples of $\u03c0$ but suppressed for even multiples.

In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Crucially, our implementation allows direct observation of topological transitions in and out of equilibrium, providing a powerful route to the quantum simulation of competing topological superconducting phases that remain elusive in solid-state and ultracold-atom systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u8154\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7531\u62d3\u6251\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u914d\u5bf9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e cavity QED \u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u4ecb cavity \u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684 atomic pseudospins \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 competing chiral p_x+ip_y \u548c d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy} \u914d\u5bf9\u987a\u5e8f\u3002\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5149\u6805\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u901a\u878d\u7684 cavity-lattice \u6ce2\u957f\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u5355\u914d\u5bf9\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7a81\u53d8\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5177\u6709 competing \u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u533a\u57df\u3002\u6700 crucially, our \u5b9e\u73b0\u5141\u8bb8\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u5bdf topological \u8f6citions \u5728\u548c out of equilibrium \u7684\u60c5 Circumstances, our \u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u7ade\u4e89\u6027 topological superconducting phase\u3002", "motivation": " Topological superconductors \u7684\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u4e49\u91cd\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u914d\u5bf9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002 find \u5230\u5de7\u5999\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f competing \u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406 phase \u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": " \u4f7f\u7528 cavity QED \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 atomic pseudospins \u7684\u4ecb\u5bfc coupling \u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027chiral \u548c d \u578b pairing \u914d\u5bf9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5149\u6805\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7684\u6ce2\u957f\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u51c6\u5907\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7a81\u53d8\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002", "result": " \u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 competition \u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7a81\u7136\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u7684 topological \u8f6citions\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528 light \u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u901a\u878d\u6ce2\u957f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684 cavity-lattice \u4ecb\u5bfc couplings\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u51c6\u5907\u548c order parameter \u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 competing \u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u4e0e\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ade\u4e89\u6027 topological superconductors \u5728 cavity QED \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": " \u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684 cavity QED\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u8c03\u63a7\u4e86 competing topological \u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u5448\u73b0\u548c order parameter \u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742 topological \u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this paper, we characterize the incommensurate phases accessible with field applied in the plane with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). A variety of phases with unusual SANS patterns are accessible with magnetic field applied along the $a$ and $a^*$ directions. Many of these phases can be understood to be multi-$q$ phases. One phase in particular, ICM2b (ICM=incommensurate magnetic phase), is rather unconventional in that it is an anisotropic multi-$q$ phase that can rotate freely within the $ab$-plane, dependent on magnetic field direction and history. The stabilization of tunable multi-$q$ incommensurate spin textures \\textit{via} in-plane field sets this class of materials apart from conventional skyrmion materials. We further identify that the propagation vectors of the in-plane phases have a significant commensuration with the diameter of the smallest pocket of the Fermi surface ($2k_{\\text{F}}$). The multi/single-$q$ nature is also correlated with the enhancement of resistivity, suggesting that a gap opens in the electron bands at $q=2k_{\\text{F}}$. We also compare with a phenomenological model of the phase diagram. The richness of phases revealed in this study hint at the frustrated nature of the incommensurate magnetism present in EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ and motivate further probes of these phases and the origin of the stability of spin moir\u00e9 superlattices. Finally, the coupling of the multi-$q$ nature and $q=2k_{\\text{F}}$ commensuration condition reveals the key requirements for a strong SMS transport response.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While this property has been investigated in many weakly-correlated altermagnetic materials, the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure has remained little explored, particularly in metals. Here, we propose NiS2 as a prototypical strongly correlated metallic altermagnet. While at ambient pressure this compound is an altermagnetic Mott insulator, it undergoes a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) while maintaining its altermagnetic ordered phase. By systematically comparing DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT, we disentangle how strong static and dynamic correlations modify the electronic structure. Specifically, the spin splitting of the bands is modified not only through the enhancement of the local magnetic moment caused by static correlations, but also by the momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization caused by dynamic correlations. Moreover, dynamic electronic correlations cause a pronounced lifetime asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles, an effect that is amplified by the particle-hole asymmetry promoted by Hund's correlations. Our results not only shed light on the rich landscape of correlation effects in metallic altermagnets, but also establishes NiS2 as a platform to investigate the interplay between Mott and Hund physics and altermagnetic order.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This theory integrates the optoelectronic imaging hardware front end and computational reconstruction back end into a unified framework. It establishes a complete spatial imaging chain information transfer model with the objective of obtaining the required effective information. The paper innovatively proposes a quantifiable Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) product criterion. It demonstrates that the system information transmission ability is determined by the product of MTF and SNR, and that these parameters can compensate for each other to achieve equivalent information transfer. Validation through a high-resolution Earth observation system case shows that under consistent reconstruction mean square error conditions, increasing time delay integration stages reduces optical aperture size and significantly lowers primary mirror mass. Simulations and physical experiments further indicate that by increasing integration time, low-resolution optical systems achieve reconstructed fidelity comparable to high-resolution systems.

Here, we numerically compute the momentum-space two-point correlation function in a quantum fluid using the truncated Wigner approximation, a general method applicable to both conservative and driven-dissipative systems. We consider a polaritonic fluid of light in a realistic configuration known to yield strong real-space correlations between Hawking, partner, and witness modes.

We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection.

Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments.

This study examines discrete spherical Halbach configurations assembled from permanent magnets placed at the vertices of Platonic and Archimedean solids.

They produce exceptionally flat fourth-order central saddle points, resulting in a usable homogeneous field volume up to a factor of 260 larger than that of traditional Halbach disk or cylindrical arrays. Several magnet assemblies composed of cubical NdFeB magnets are fabricated and their three dimensional field distributions characterized, demonstrating homogeneous regions of up to several cubic centimeters with deviations below 1%.

This methodological framework, referred to as guided progressive reconstructive imaging, relies on a quantization-based description of the acquired intensity, through an elementary derivation. Established direct phase retrieval solutions, such as the Wigner distribution deconvolution approach, can then be adapted to a continuous treatment of received counts, with no need for a dense data representation. Consequently, the result is obtained in the form of a progressively improving estimate, while providing immediate user feedback thanks to a remarkable processing speed, able to surpass the acquisition bandwidth. This fast measurement is enabled by the cumulative usage of a pre-calculated library of kernel-limited guide functions, compiling count-wise contributions as a function of the triggered detector pixel. Hence, the reconstruction offers the same advantages of direct phase retrieval methods, in particular a high dose-efficiency and the absence of complex convergence dynamics, with much less stringent restrictions on the field of view than is typical in current alternatives. Its implementation is also significantly more straightforward and flexible. Overall, this work constitutes a major evolution in the state-of-the-art, facilitating repeatable and low-dose experiments with high accessibility, and being applicable to electron-based imaging, X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The rapid rotation elements behave as a random oscillator which induces Doppler frequency shift into the ultraviolet lasers. As an example, for a disk-shaped phase plate, with the beam acting on the edge at a radius of 10 cm, a rotation frequency of 1 kHz, and a phase-element size of 10 nm, the continuous spectral broadening reaches 0.07%. Further increasing the rotation speed or reducing the phase-element can lead to greater spectral broadening. When multiple URPPs are arranged in series, the superimposed spatiotemporal modulation further enhances the continuous spectral broadening and achieves more effective speckle smoothing. The scheme is applicable to broadening the independent spectrum of optical frequency combs as well as to the mitigation of laser-plasma instabilities in inertial fusion energy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Focusing on the case of scalar perturbations in single-field inflation, we model interactions using a Lindblad equation with a non-unitary contribution quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and of parametrisable amplitude and time dependence. We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates how scalar perturbations in inflationary models can lose quantum correlations due to interactions, such as decoherence, which reduces their purity and squeezing, ultimately making their correlations more classical.", "motivation": "Understanding the quantum vs classical nature of perturbations in inflation is key to studying the origins of structure in the universe.

Our approach establishes a general route to time-optimal quantum sensing beyond standard interferometric architectures, applcable across all quantum platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u73bb\u8272\u7231instein\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u529b\u611f\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u8bae\u4ece\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u81ea\u53d1\u5730\u5f62\u6210\u5e72\u6d89\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u968f\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0-condensed matter physics\u3001quantum gases\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u8bfb\u8005\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u60ef\u6027\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u529b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u611f\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u8ddd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u73b0\u4ee3\u79d1\u6280\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u529b\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u529b\u611f\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u73bb\u8272\u7231instein\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u5728\u632f\u8361\u5149\u683c\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u529b\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5e72\u6d89\u7ed3\u6784\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u60ef\u6027\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u529b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u611f\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u52a8\u91cf\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u5730\u5f62\u6210\u5355\u91cd\u6216\u53cc\u91cd\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u8ddd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u73bb\u8272\u7231instein\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u529b\u611f\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u529b\u573a\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

To ensure the reliability of the results, we employ three complementary methods: the asymptotic iteration method, the direct integration of the wave equation, and the time-domain numerical evolution. We analyze how the model parameters influence the shape of the effective potential of gravitational perturbations and find that the structure of the potential barrier plays a significant role in shaping the quasinormal frequency spectrum. The results obtained from the three methods exhibit strong consistency, thereby ensuring the reliability of the calculations. In particular, the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies exhibit an approximately arithmetic progression, suggesting that the quasi-localized states can be understood as resonances between the barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af-Bonnet\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u539a\u819c\u7684\u51c6\u6b63\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5f15\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u7684Schr\u00f6dinger-like\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fed\u4ee3\u6cd5\u3001\u6ce2\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u6570\u503c\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u52bf\u5792\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u9891\u7387\u8c31\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u90e8\u7684\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u9891\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5448\u7b97\u672f\u7ea7\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u51c6\u5c40\u90e8\u6001\u53ef\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u52bf\u5792\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u632f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5929\u4f53\u6f14\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u9ad8\u65af-Bonnet\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u6709\u7740\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u51c6\u6b63\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fed\u4ee3\u6cd5\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u6570\u503c\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u90e8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5448\u7b97\u672f\u7ea7\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u51c6\u5c40\u90e8\u6001\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u52bf\u5792\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u632f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af-Bonnet\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u539a\u819c\u7684\u51c6\u6b63\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u52bf\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u90e8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5448\u7b97\u672f\u7ea7\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af-Bonnet\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002\u9700\u8981 \u0441\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c, this conclusion is slightly conflicting with the provided content, but it gives a general summary\u3002"}}

The workflow is applied to predict the relative energies of two conformers of the 300-atom Trp-cage miniprotein. The methodology employs wave function-based embedding (EWF) as the underlying fragmentation framework, in which all atoms in the system are explicitly included in the CI treatment. CI calculations for individual fragments are performed using either sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) for challenging fragments or full configuration interaction (FCI) for trivial fragments. To assess the accuracy of SQD for fragment CI calculations, EWF-(FCI,SQD) results are compared against EWF-MP2 and EWF-CCSD benchmarks. Overall, the results demonstrate that large-scale electronic configuration interaction (CI) simulations of protein systems containing hundreds or even thousands of atoms can be realized through the combined use of quantum and classical computing resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8868\u89c2\u5206\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6784\u8c61\u80fd\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u767e\u751a\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8868\u89c2\u5206\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u65ad\u7247\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u4ef7\u7535\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5eb7\u6c38\u5b9a\u7406(EWF)\uff0c\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u65ad\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f83\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65ad\u88c2\u7247\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u5316(SQD)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u65ad\u88c2\u7247\uff0c\u5219\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u914d\u7f6e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528(FCI)\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1SQD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c06EWF-(FCI,SQD)\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0eEWF-MP2\u548cEWF-CCSD\u57fa\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8868\u89c2\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u542b\u6709\u6570\u767e\u751a\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u5927\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea7\u6570\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7684CFI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65ad\u7247\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While the altermagnetic unit cell reconstructs the topological edge states in the strip geometry and leads to the emergence of Dirac points, the in-plane magnetic moments of AM can induce gaps at these points. In an open square geometry, corner modes emerge within these gaps, realizing higher-order topological states. We further verify that the induction of higher-order topology is applicable to all altermagnetic configurations constructed here on the Lieb lattice, and is most pronounced for AM by comparing with the other types of magnetism such as ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism.

The witness also quantifies the magnitude of ODLRO within each particle type, revealing how fermionic and bosonic correlations combine to form the total entanglement of the system, including a bosonic condensation of particle-hole pairs driven by many-body correlations rather than particle statistics. Using the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model, we show how the transition from ODLRO localized to one particle type to ODLRO shared by both particle types captures the onset of collective entanglement in a mixed-particle environment, providing new insight into systems where fermionic and bosonic correlations coexist.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This adds one dimension to the information available, and is essential for pile-up mitigation at high luminosity. The CASSIA sensor project (CMOS Active SenSor with Internal Amplification) focuses on the development of pixel matrices with internal charge multiplication based on monolithic CMOS sensor technologies suitable for application as charged particle tracking and timing detectors. CMOS sensors with in-pixel internal amplification would result in higher signal amplitudes having an improved signal-to-noise ratio, better time resolution and increased sensitivity, making them attractive for high-radiation environments. Their monolithic integration in small pixels reduces the input capacitance of a front-end amplifier and power dissipation making it suitable for fine-pitch low-power detectors. Fast signal rise time due to internal charge amplification improves the response time and timing resolution, all of which makes such a technology attractive for future 4D tracking applications in HEP experiments. This paper presents the first results of the CASSIA sensor, a novel MAPS which uses gain layers fully integrated in a 180nm imaging process to achieve internal signal amplification. In the first measurements presented here we demonstrate the gain behaviour of different pixel implant designs and show that the sensor can be operated with low gain proportional mode as LGAD sensor at lower voltages and as SPAD sensor at higher voltages.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show that under periodic modulation of the cavity length sidebands spaced by the modulation frequency are produced (diffraction in time), enabling the coupling of bound surface acoustic waves with bulk radiation i.e. from a bound state \\textit{to} the continuum. We observe the negative-frequency spectra as spatial reflections along the array via time-domain finite element simulations.

In particular, increasing attention has been devoted to the emergence of non-equilibrium universality classes that have no equilibrium counterparts. A prominent example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class realized in dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates. In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case.

In this context, the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I undergoes a CDW transition at $T_{\\mathrm{CDW}} \\approx 263$~K, providing an exceptional platform to investigate correlated topological CDW states. Here, we uncover an additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \\sim 100$ K, well below the CDW onset, using low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, and thermoelectric measurements. This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($\u03b1$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase.

In general, at a long distance $r$ from the source, the near-surface field is mostly contributed by the geometrical optics term (describing the radiation pattern), a guided wave, and the higher-order reactive contribution referred to as the Norton wave. In the special case of a perfect magnetic conductor interface, the first two terms vanish, so the residual Norton wave determines the steepest achievable field decay profile of $~r^{-3/2}$ (for a two-dimensional horizontal magnetic dipole). In this letter, we reveal that in the presence of a nonlocal metasurface described by the second-order impedance boundary condition, the field decay can be further accelerated by suppressing the Norton wave (approaching the profiles $r^{-5/2}$ and $r^{-7/2}$ for electric and magnetic fields, respectively). In a proposed practical realization of a nonlocal metasurface, the effect is numerically verified and shown to reduce the edge diffraction effects by 10 dB for the shield diameter of only one wavelength, paving the way toward compact antenna systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In previous work this mechanism was demonstrated only in a special case, leaving its general status unclear. By reformulating the construction in the language of Cartan geometry, we expose the underlying gauge structure and show that the argument extends to generic choices of meromorphic data. We then apply this to the pole structure that yields the well-studied $\u03bb$-deformations of the WZW model. The coupled 6d system indeed induces gaugings of the associated $\u03bb$-models, but necessarily introduces Lagrange multipliers enforcing flatness of the gauged connection. The resulting two-dimensional theories are therefore non-Abelian dualisations rather than ordinary gauged $\u03bb$-models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We establish several Raman spectral features that enable unambiguous phase identification across the series.

Traditionally, spectrometers have been calibrated using reference gas cells or reference lamps. However, such conventional methods are not enough to meet the demands for high accuracy and stability. Although frequency-stabilized lasers offer excellent frequency uncertainty, they provide only a single calibration point at a fixed frequency, which is unsuitable for wide-range spectrometer calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a fully stabilized, high-repetition rate electro-optic frequency comb (EO comb) as an absolute frequency reference providing multiple calibration points over a broad spectral range. Our 25 GHz EO comb provides a broadband spectrum spanning from 189.5 THz to 196 THz (corresponding to 1530 nm to 1582 nm), traceable to a frequency standard with a relative standard uncertainty of 10^-13. The well-defined and evenly spaced comb modes can be spectrally resolved by conventional optical spectrometers, enabling wide-range, high-precision frequency calibration. We directly calibrated a commercial spectrometer by referencing its measured frequency values to our well-defined comb modes, thereby evaluating the frequency error with a standard uncertainty of 20 MHz (or relative standard uncertainty of 10^-7), which is limited by the Type A uncertainty (repeatability) of the spectrometer. The proposed method is simple to implement and provides multiple calibration points referenced to the frequency standards over a broad spectral range.

The emergence of MoOCl2, a quasi-one-dimensional metal with in-plane hyperbolicity, overcomes this spectral limit, shifting the focus to the practical visible range. Here, utilizing angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, we uncover a highly anisotropic vibrational response characterized by pronounced Fano resonances and polarization switching, which serve as signatures of strong coupling between phonons and the metallic continuum. Harnessing this interaction, we demonstrate \"Hyperbolic-Enhanced Raman\" (HypER) scattering, where MoOCl2 provides polarization-tunable enhancement factors exceeding 10^7 and picomolar-level detection down to 100 pM, without any nanostructuring.

However, they suffer from poor light extraction efficiency, and accurate composition-specific optical data for these materials remain scarce. This study presents a DFT-FDTD framework to optimize light extraction via compositional tuning and plasmonic enhancement. First, DFT calculations were performed to obtain composition-specific complex refractive index and extinction coefficient values for $x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75$, and $1$. Results show bandgap increased from 1.331 eV for CsSnI$_3$ to 1.927 eV for CsGeI$_3$ with increasing Ge content, while refractive index ranges from 2.2 to 2.6 across compositions. These optical constants were then used as inputs for FDTD simulations of a PeLED structure with optimized Au/SiO$_2$ core-shell nanorods for plasmonic enhancement. A 12.1-fold Purcell enhancement was achieved for CsSn$_{0.25}$Ge$_{0.75}$I$_3$, while light extraction efficiency reached 25% for CsSn$_{0.5}$Ge$_{0.5}$I$_3$. LEE enhancement of 36% was obtained for CsSnI$_3$, and spectral overlap between emitter and plasmon resonance reached 96% for Sn-rich compositions. Design guidelines indicate CsSn$_{0.5}$Ge$_{0.5}$I$_3$ offers optimal balance of extraction efficiency (25%), Purcell enhancement (5.3$\\times$), spectral overlap (93%), and oxidation stability for wearable and flexible optoelectronic applications, while CsSn$_{0.25}$Ge$_{0.75}$I$_3$ is recommended for applications prioritizing spontaneous emission rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "CsSnGeI3 perovskites have tunable bandgaps, but their light extraction efficiency is low and optical data is scarce.

In the present new proof, we trace the need for infinitely many trajectories to the constraint of polynomial boundedness, ultimately tied to causality. We further present numerical results based on the stringy ansatz of H\u00e4ring-Zhiboedov, which illustrates how single-trajectory-like solutions actually emerge as extremal solutions of numerical bootstrap.

To realize high-rate heralded entanglement for quantum repeaters, Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 054209 (2023)] proposed a scheme for heralded-multiplexed generation of quasi-deterministic entangled photon pairs, called zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM). Here, we propose a design of ZALM source using time-bin entanglement and spectral shearing. Additionally, we provide an analysis of experimentally relevant spectral-shearing parameters to optimize the spectral multiplexing. Moreover, we experimentally verify the compatibility of time-bin pulses and spectral shearing, as supported by observation of no phase shift when the same shearing is applied to both time bins. These results expand the benefits of applying a ZALM source to time-bin entanglement use cases. Moreover, more fully demonstrating time-bin and spectral shearing compatibility clears a path towards a broader use of spectral shearing that provides a deterministic frequency shift of high utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aZALM\u6e90\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4 bins\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u5207\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5149\u6e90\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4 bins\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u5207\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u5207\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4 bins\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u5207\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u5207\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4 bins\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u5207\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u4f4d\u7f6e\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5149\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4 bins\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u5207\u4e4b\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u5207\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u76f8\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7ZALM\u6e90\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4 bins\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u526a\u5207\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

So far, the separation of charge and spin currents was facilitated by the electrical spin injection from a ferromagnet (FM) or the injection by a relativistic spin Hall effect. The devices employed are lateral spin valves comprising spatially separated injection and detection electrodes, connected by a spin-propagation channel. The time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking FM spin injection is realized in a geometry with an electrical bias applied between the injection electrode and the channel and is modelled by a conserved spin-polarized drift current. In contrast, the spin injection by the T-symmetric relativistic spin Hall mechanism is driven by an electrical bias applied across the injection electrode alone, and is modelled by a non-conserved spin current transverse to the applied bias. In this work, we use a lateral spin valve with a Mn5Si3 injection electrode to directly demonstrate a TRS-breaking spin injection from a compensated magnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Specifically, the TRS-breaking is demonstrated by the fact that switching between time-reversed states of the compensated magnet changes the detected spin signal. Moreover, the TRS-breaking nature of the spin injection is observed in both experimental geometries with the different electrical biasing, while using the same detection electrode. We show that this unconventional spin-injection is consistent with different magnitudes and propagation angles of electrical currents in the spin-up and spin-down channel in a d-wave altermagnet. Here our symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations are based on the compensated collinear altermagnetic order which has provided a comprehensive microscopic interpretation of earlier structural, magnetic, and anomalous Hall and Nernst measurements in Mn5Si3 thin films.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08TRS\uff09\u7684\u7535\u963b\u65cb\u6d41\u52a8\u7528\u4e8e\u78c1\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7535\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e14\u7535\u538b\u7535\u504f\u7f6e\u65b9\u5411\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u78c1\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u78c1\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u672f\u5728\u81ea\u65cbtronics\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7535\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u78c1\u6ce8\u5165\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7535\u6781\u7684\u5c42\u53e0\u81ea\u65cb\u8f6c College-valve \u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u78c1\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7535\u963b\u65cb\u6d41\u52a8\u5728\u78c1\u6ce8\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u51c0\u78c1\u5316\u7684\u5171\u7ebf\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u7535\u963b\u65cb\u6d41\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u78c1\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u963b\u65cb\u6d41\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u6ce8\u5165\u3002"}}

We analyze the evolution of string order parameters, spin correlations, and charge fluctuations as functions of hopping amplitude and interaction strength in a half-filled band. Our results from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that increasing electron bandwidth progressively suppresses the topological phases, shifting and narrowing their stability regions in the phase diagram.

Starting from the most general kinetic terms and dimension four couplings between the 2-form field and the curvature tensors, we find a two-parameter family of such theories. However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup. There are three types of tensor perturbations, two of which are dynamical.

Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary.

Achieving this control requires both enhanced local electromagnetic fields to boost emission intensity and engineered radiation patterns to direct photons efficiently. Mie voids, consisting of an air cavity surrounded by a high-index semiconductor, are particularly suited for this purpose because they expose their strongest fields in an accessible region for nearby emitters while supporting resonances that shape directional emission through interference. Here, we demonstrate an all-van der Waals nanophotonic platform that couples excitons in atomically thin WS$_2$ to Mie void resonators formed in WSe$_2$. Guided by electromagnetic simulations, we identify void geometries that maximize photoluminescence through synergistic enhancement of excitation and emission processes. We also develop a two-step fabrication strategy that enables independent control of void diameter and depth, providing a route to systematically tune the optical response. Experimentally, we observe up to a 600-fold increase in photoluminescence intensity from monolayer WS$_2$ placed on individual voids compared to on an unstructured WSe$_2$, along with pronounced out-of-plane beaming of light that yields a forward-to-off-axis enhancement of 2.6 dB. Our results establish Mie voids in van der Waals semiconductors as a new platform for controlling light-matter interactions and realizing compact, directional, and efficient nanoscale light sources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH.

In this work, we systematically examine the CISS effect in such multichiral systems by designing a class of multilayer helical architectures constructed of stacked and interfaced individual helical rings, each possessing well-defined local chirality. Through controlled interlayer twisting, a global helical handedness is further imposed, forming a multichiral tubular helix. Theoretical calculations reveal that these two distinct chiral hierarchies lead to several unprecedented CISS phenomena, such as enhanced spin polarization arising from cooperative dual chirality, along with the simultaneous emergence of transverse and longitudinal CISS signals. Moreover, interlayer torsional competition modulates the system's response to external fields. The dual-chiral geometry breaks the conventional symmetry of single helices, inducing an anomalous angular phase shift in magnetoresistance. Furthermore, Floquet analysis reveals that the interplay between local and global chirality enables controlled spin polarization switching under circularly polarized light.

Such excitation commonly creates nanometer-scale domains, even after homogeneous illumination when the position of nucleated domains is not externally defined. However, the physics of domain localization during such ultrafast phase transitions remains unresolved. Here, we use shot-resolved pump-probe resonant x-ray scattering together with a material featuring a periodically modulated magnetic anisotropy landscape to track, in real time, the laser-driven nucleation and localization of nanometer-scale spin textures. We find that nucleation and localization are two distinct processes. Nucleation occurs homogeneously via fluctuations at early times, whereas spatially periodic structures emerge only later and, under suitable conditions, localize in less than one nanosecond. Real-space simulations show that this localization is governed by strong lateral variations in spin-texture lifetimes.

Using a renormalization-group analysis, we show that exchanging Majorana spinons from the Yao-Lee spin liquid generates effective interactions among the conduction electrons and drives a Cooper instability even for arbitrarily weak Kondo coupling. We further find that the induced leading inter-orbital antiferromagnetic interaction selects topological $d+id$ spin-singlet pairing with Chern number $C=\\pm 2$. Meanwhile, the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee spin liquid remain gapless and deconfined in this regime, so the resulting state is a fractionalized topological $d+id$ superconductor (SC*).

Recently, the idea of sub-symmetry-protected topology -- where some of the original symmetries are broken while a remaining subset, called sub-symmetries, continues to protect specific boundary states -- has been developed. Here, we extend sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems from second-order topological insulators to semimetals. By introducing a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation that acts on a single sublattice and selectively preserves specific topological boundary states, we track the evolution of these states and their topological features using numerical and analytical methods, and we show that state-resolved quadrupole moments diagnose which corner or hinge modes remain topological. As a representative example of a second-order topological insulator, we begin with the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We demonstrate that, under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation, sub-symmetry-protected corner states remain pinned at zero energy and maintain quantized state-resolved quadrupole moments. In contrast, corner states on sub-symmetry-broken boundaries shift away from zero energy and lose their quantized character. We further extend this framework to a three-dimensional second-order topological semimetal, constructed by stacking second-order topological insulator layers, and analyze how second-order Fermi arc states -- hinge-localized modes that link the projections of bulk Dirac points, in contrast to conventional surface Fermi arcs -- evolve under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation. While one second-order Fermi arc becomes dispersive and loses its quadrupolar character under a sub-symmetry-breaking perturbation, the remaining second-order Fermi arcs retain chiral symmetry and preserve quantized quadrupolar characters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b50\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u62d3\u6251\u6001\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6001\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6001\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b50\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b50\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u6270\u52a8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u89d2\u6001\u548c\u8fb9\u6001\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u8fb9\u754c\u7834\u574f\u7684\u6001\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b50\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u6001\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

With this formulation of the Kondo lattice, we study a spin chain coupled to two-dimensional Dirac conduction electrons. The spin chain is described by fermionic partons carrying spin and U(1) gauge charge. The heavy-fermion quasiparticle is a bound state of a U(1) matter field carrying unit electric and U(1) gauge charge, and the fermionic parton. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify two symmetry-equivalent regimes: a heavy-fermion metal with a sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust low-frequency transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with an incoherent resonance and vanishing low-frequency transport. For any finite lattice extent in the direction perpendicular to the chain, the Luttinger volume of the heavy-fermion phase counts both composite and conduction electrons, while in the Kondo-breakdown phase it counts only the conduction electrons. The evolution of the composite-fermion spectrum, dynamical spin structure factor, and optical conductivity provides a nonperturbative demonstration of gauge-mediated Kondo breakdown and establishes transport fingerprints of an orbital-selective Mott transition in the context of U(1) gauge theories of heavy fermions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u6001\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u5177\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u590d\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u548c\u8f83\u5f3a\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u590d\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u91d1\u5c5e\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u56e0\u5e93\u4ed1\u5757\u89e3\u91d1\u5c5e\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u65e0\u5e8f\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u548c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u91cd\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u6700\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u4e0e\u4e8c\u7ef4Dirac\u5bfc\u7535\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u65e0\u76f8\u53d8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u548c\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u6001\uff1a\u590d\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u91d1\u5c5e\u548c\u5e93\u4ed1\u5757\u89e3\u91d1\u5c5e\u3002\u524d\u8005\u5177\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u590d\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u548c\u5f3a\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5219\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u65e0\u5e8f\u81ea\u65cb\u5b50\u5171\u632f\u548c\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u8f7d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7U(1)\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u91cd\u5b50\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u4ecb\u578b\u5e93\u4ed1\u5757\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u6027Mott\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u8fd0\u8f93\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

In this study, a facile \\emph{in situ} chemical oxidation strategy was employed to synthesize MOF-derived MnO$_x$, utilizing the structural features of the parent MOF to enhance oxidase-mimicking activity. We systematically investigated the effects of phase evolution, structural modulation, and morphology on the oxidase activity of MnO$_x$ with Fe substitution. The oxidase-like activity was evaluated using the chromogenic substrate 3,3$'$,5,5$'$-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which produced a blue-colored oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) with an absorption peak at 652~nm upon oxidation. While all Fe-doped MnO$_x$ nanostructures exhibited oxidase-like activity, the 10\\% Fe-doped sample (10Fe-MnO$_x$) demonstrated the highest performance, likely due to a synergistic effect of structure, morphology, and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The underlying oxidase mechanism was investigated using steady-state kinetics and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. In addition, a colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of Hg$^{2+}$ and hydroquinone (HQ) in real water samples collected from industrial and natural sources. The calculated detection limits of the 10Fe-MnO$_x$ colorimetric probe for HQ (1.74~$\u03bc$M) and Hg$^{2+}$ (0.47~$\u03bc$M) outperformed those of conventional metal oxide-based nanozymes.

Our system is governed by two coherently coupled nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations, describing the polarization evolution of light in a dispersive nonlinear optical fiber. The analysis reveals the emergence of two fundamentally distinct turbulent regimes. In a first regime, the waves undergo a slow, irreversible thermalization process, which is accurately described by the wave turbulence kinetic equation and the associated H-theorem of entropy growth. In stark contrast with this expected irreversible process, we identify a second different regime, where strong phase-correlations spontaneously emerge, giving rise to a fast reversible oscillatory dynamics of the normal correlator and anomalous phase-correlator.

We study the degradation of quantum entanglement for field modes shared by inertial and accelerated observers in spacelike and lightlike Lorentz-violating vacua that generate identical spacetime metrics. Using the near-horizon Rindler correspondence, we derive analytic expressions for the logarithmic negativity and mutual information and examine their dependence on detector position, frequency, and Lorentz-violation parameters. Despite sharing the same metric, the two Lorentz-violating vacua become distinguishable near the horizon, particularly at low frequencies. We analyze the excitation of a freely falling two-level atom coupled to quantum fields near the horizon. The associated acceleration-radiation transition probabilities are computed explicitly. The resulting atomic response is locally indistinguishable from that in flat spacetime, confirming the validity of the equivalence principle even in the presence of Lorentz-violating corrections.

Using two different approaches, the matrix formulation and the Wick symbol representation, we derive explicit expressions for the states that saturate the uncertainty bound. We show that spin coherent states indeed achieve minimum uncertainty, consistent with their conventional identification as the classical states of spin systems.

These remarkable properties rely on the stability of the SAF skyrmion's topological bound state, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using an atomistic spin model, we analyze the collapse pathways of bilayer SAF skyrmions in homochiral systems, where both ferromagnetic layers share the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors, and in heterochiral systems, where the DMI vectors have opposite directions. We find that pair destruction occurs either by decoupling or by sequential collapse into the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state, so the activation energy is set by the smaller of these two barriers. By examining how these barriers vary with DMI strength, anisotropy, magnetic field, and interlayer exchange, we identify regimes of enhanced stability. In particular, increasing interlayer coupling strengthens homochiral skyrmions but weakens heterochiral ones, while reducing the anisotropy constant effectively stabilizes heterochiral SAF skyrmions.

For the class of right-invariant metrics obeying natural invariance condition we solve the geodesic equations on oscillator group. The solution is given explicitly in terms of elementary functions. Imposing the boundary conditions yield a transcendental equation and the length of the geodesic is given in terms of the solutions to the latter. Since the unitary irreducible representations of oscillator group are classified this allows us to compute, at least in principle, the complexity of any unitary operator belonging to the representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In a different direction, the Kaluza-Klein proposal aims to recover gauge symmetries by means of dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional gravitational theories. Integrating both, gravitational and gauge degrees of freedom in $3+1$ dimensions may be obtained upon dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional emergent gravity. To this end, we show that entangled systems of two and three qubits can be associated with $5+1$ and $9+1$ dimensional spacetimes respectively, which are reduced to $3+1$ dimensions upon singling out a preferred complex direction. In the latter case, this reduction is invariant under a residual $SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1) /\\mathbb{Z}_6$ symmetry, the Standard Model gauge group.

Due to the presence of nonlinear effects, such as mode competition and gain saturation in digital laser systems, it is often necessary to rely on specifically manually tailored approach or iteration processes to find suitable loaded phases in Digital lasers. This study proposes a model based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) and a modified U-Net architecture, with designed loss functions to inverse design the loaded phases. In this work, we employ deep neural networks to learn the nonlinear effects in simulated L-shape digital lasers, enabling the prediction of SLM-loaded phases for both analytical and non-analytical arbitrary structured light fields. The results demonstrate superior performance on non-analytical light fields compared to the current methods in L-shape Digital lasers. Furthermore, a transfer learning strategy is introduced, allowing knowledge obtained from one class of structured beams to be effectively reused for another, thereby enhancing generalization and improving performance under limited training data.

The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We evaluate the resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the photon gas, which arises from a competition between this engineered cooling process and the natural, number non-conserving thermalization with the surrounding bath. Our analysis predicts that for realistic experimental parameters, this mechanism can be used to prepare photonic gases at sub-millikelvin temperatures, considerably below the typical base temperature of a dilution refrigerator.

A popular method of choice is the higher-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, mostly applied to nonrotating BHs. While previous studies demonstrated that the higher-order WKB method can also be used for Kerr BHs in GR, there has been little work on rotating BHs in modified theories of gravity. In this work, we revive the idea by extending WKB calculations of the Kerr QNM spectrum to higher order and assessing its accuracy against continued-fraction tabulated data. We then apply the WKB approximation beyond GR, comparing it against both linearized and continued fraction calculations in the parametrized beyond-Teukolsky formalism and in higher-derivative gravity (HDG) theories.

The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Furthermore, using the Heisenberg equation, another system of Bloch vector equations is derived, which forms an Euler-Poinsot system, as is commonly encountered in the theory of torque-free spinning tops. This is used to prove the Liouville integrability of the corresponding Hamilton equations of motion, whereby formal connections to the Neumann model of classical Hamiltonian dynamics and the Hamiltonian Euler-Poinsot model are drawn to identify the first integrals of motion. Within the same framework, stability criteria for quantum dynamics are then derived which correspond to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion resp. other criteria following from the Energy-Casimir method of classical Newtonian mechanics. Following that, specific solutions to the equations of motion are constructed that encode the complex dynamics of composite quantum systems. Eventually, to show that this formalism provides concrete physical predictions, an analogue of the intermediate axis theorem is derived and the effect of oscillating entanglement is discussed.

This exactly solvable constrained-domain model exhibits spectral reorganisation under symmetry-breaking BCs and provides an operator-domain viewpoint on angular momentum quantisation. We obtain three main results. First, the stationary states are standing waves in the azimuthal coordinate and consequently are \\emph{not} eigenstates of $\\hat{L}_z$; we prove $\\langle L_z \\rangle = 0$ with $\u0394L_z = \\hbar n_\u03c6\u03c0/\u03a6\\neq 0$, demonstrating that angular momentum projection becomes an observable with genuine quantum uncertainty rather than a good quantum number. Second, the effective azimuthal quantum number $\u03bc= n_\u03c6\u03c0/\u03a6$ is generically non-integer, and square-integrability of the polar wavefunctions at both poles requires the angular eigenvalue parameter $\u03bd$ to satisfy $\u03bd- \u03bc\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$. This regularity constraint yields a hierarchy: sectoral solutions ($\u03bd= \u03bc$, satisfying the first-order highest-weight condition) exist for any real $\u03bc> 0$, while tesseral and zonal solutions require integer steps, appearing only when $\u03bc$ itself is integer. Third, application to a Coulomb potential shows that the familiar integer angular momentum spectrum of hydrogen arises from the periodic identification $\u03c6\\sim \u03c6+ 2\u03c0$ that defines the full-sphere Hilbert space domain; modified boundary conditions yield a reorganised spectrum with non-integer effective angular momentum. The model clarifies the distinct roles of single-valuedness (selecting integer $m$ via azimuthal topology) and polar regularity (selecting integer $\\ell \\geq |m|$ via analytic constraints) in the standard quantisation of orbital angular momentum.", "AI": {"tldr": "We solve the stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a particle confined to a 3D spherical wedge with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

The azimuthal standing wave nature of the stationary states leads to the conclusion that angular momentum around the z-axis is not an eigenstate. The expectation value of angular momentum is zero, but its uncertainty is non-zero. 2. The effective azimuthal quantum number \u03bc is generically non-integer, and the polar wavefunctions' square-integrability imposes constraints on the angular quantum number \u03bd, requiring \u03bd - \u03bc to be a non-negative integer. 3. The application to a Coulomb potential reveals that the integer angular momentum spectrum of hydrogen arises from periodic boundary conditions in the azimuthal angle \u03c6, and modified boundary conditions lead to a reorganized spectrum with non-integer effective angular momentum.

This paper proposes the concept of frequency-multiplexed millimeter-wave superconducting qubits and demonstrates a novel architecture that integrates an on-chip cryogenic nonreciprocal space-time-periodic superconducting frequency multiplier as a universal control bus for a frequency-multiplexed qubit array. The bus replaces multiple high-frequency XY drive lines with a single low-frequency input tone, which the multiplier converts into a comb of high-order harmonics, each resonantly addressing a distinct qubit. Crucially, the dynamic and nonreciprocal nature of the bus provides signal gain and intrinsic isolation that simultaneously suppresses Purcell decay, enhancing T1 times across all distinct-frequency qubits, and reduces coherent crosstalk by more than two orders of magnitude. The spatiotemporal modulation enables parametric frequency multiplication and creates wave-propagation dynamics analogous to cosmological expansion, with observed redshift-like broadening and deceleration of magnetic-field wavepackets. Theoretical modeling based on a non-Markovian master equation confirms that the engineered memory kernel extends coherence while reshaping the noise spectrum. Full error-budget analysis shows that the architecture maintains gate errors below the fault-tolerance threshold for arrays exceeding 25 qubits, converting a crosstalk-dominated error budget into one limited by intrinsic material coherence.

Our results demonstrate that ultrafast laser driving can reveal and even induce significant deviations from the commonly adopted Markovian approximation, thereby providing a pathway to probe and control non-Markovian dissipation in driven solid-state systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u5f3a\u8d85\u5feb\u6fc0\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fTHz\u8109\u51b2\u53ef\u4ee5\u9a71\u52a8\u5149\u5b50\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6676\u683c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u58f0\u5b50\u89c6\u4e3a\u53d7\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728Caldeira-Leggett\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531THz\u8109\u51b2\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u58f0\u5b50\u4e0e\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8109\u51b2\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8d85\u5feb\u6fc0\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5e76\u8bf1\u5bfc\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u6001\u56fa\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8017\u6563\u63d0\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8d85\u5feb\u6fc0\u5149\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8109\u51b2\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u58f0\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u901a\u8fc7Caldeira-Leggett\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u63a8\u5bfc\u58f0\u5b50\u4e0e\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u70ed\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u70ed\u6d41\u884c\u4e3a\u968f\u4e0d\u540c\u8109\u51b2\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8d85\u5feb\u6fc0\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c\u58f0\u5b50\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u70ed\u6d41\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8d85\u5feb\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8017\u6563\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u58f0\u5b50\u89c6\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u70ed\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u5feb\u6fc0\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u5feb\u6fc0\u5149\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Here we introduce an inseparability criterion that exposes non-Gaussian entanglement that escapes covariance-based criteria by incorporating higher-order quadrature cumulants.

While continuum limits of two state quantum walks are well established, an explicit continuous spacetime formulation for the lazy three state walk, particularly including noise, has not previously been constructed. Using an SU(3) representation of a Grover type coin together with a Lindblad formulation of decoherence acting either on the coin or the spatial subspace, we systematically expand the discrete dynamics in both space and time to obtain continuum master equations governing the coarse grained evolution. The resulting generators yield a genuine partial differential equation description of the walk, going beyond purely probabilistic or spectral correspondences. We show that the unitary limit is governed by a Dirac-type SU(3) Hamiltonian describing ballistic advection of left and right moving modes coupled by local symmetric mixing, with the rest state acting as an additional internal degree of freedom.

The design employs interleaved encode-entangle-train cycles, where entanglement is applied among qubits hosting neighboring pixels, aligned to device connectivity. This staged, locality-preserving information flow expands the effective receptive field without deep global mixing, enabling efficient use of limited depth and qubits. The design concentrates representational capacity on short-range correlations, reduces long-range two-qubit operations, and encourages stable optimization, thereby mitigating depth-induced and globally entangled barren-plateau effects.

We present a new method to visualize how efficiently a practical measurement scheme captures the information available in the scattered light by mapping out the local contribution to the detection efficiency on the detector surface. We use this tool to experimentally optimize the free space measurement of the amplitude of motion of an optomechanical resonator with a quadrant photodiode. We show that blocking sections of the photodetector enhances sensitivity, counterintuitively yielding a significant improvement in detecting higher-order mechanical modes in the system. We also show how our method can be applied to light scattering measurements of small particles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u6355\u83b7\u6563\u5c04\u5149\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d4b\u632f\u5668\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5206\u9694\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u6563\u5c04\u5149\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u901a\u9053\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8868\u9762\u6620\u5c04\u5c40\u90e8\u63a2\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\u6355\u83b7\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5149\u6d4b\u529b\u8ba1\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9694\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u632f\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u76f4\u89c9\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\u6355\u83b7\u6563\u5c04\u5149\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}
