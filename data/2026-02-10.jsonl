The transition probability therefore emerges as a relational quantity between quantum reference standards rather than an intrinsic property of a single evolving spin state. By incorporating the kinematic motion of the spin vector together with the dynamical evolution, this framework restores consistent energy accounting and reveals the dual-reference structure underlying spin dynamics in rotating magnetic fields."}

While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Our results establish quantum interference as a powerful mechanism for controlling openness in quantum matter and for engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians."}

It is shown that such undulators can be employed for generating photons in the so-called composite twisted states -- the states that are linear superpositions of modes with definite projections of the total angular momentum, amplitudes, relative phases, and polarizations. We find the explicit expressions and the selection rules for these parameters and establish that they can be governed in a predictable way by adjusting the parameters of the multifrequency helical undulator. In particular, the phases of three arbitrary modes admissible by selection rules in the composite state with definite energy can be made arbitrary by tuning the phases of one-frequency undulators comprising the three-frequency one. By solving Diophantine equations, we obtain simple expressions for the complex amplitude of coherent state of photons emitted by a three-frequency helical undulator and for the average number of radiated twisted photons in the case when the ratios of frequencies of the three-frequency undulator are rational numbers. The development of resonances and the control of composite states of radiated photons are studied numerically confirming the theoretical conclusions."}

Starting from the instantaneous condition $\\dot{E}=0$, imposed as a pointwise constraint along a particle trajectory, we obtain a generalized force law that does not assume a specific kinetic-energy function, momentum-velocity relation, or equation of motion. The resulting inertial response naturally decomposes into a component parallel to the acceleration, responsible for changes in kinetic energy, and a transverse component that preserves energy while altering the direction of motion. Imposing rotational equivariance constrains the geometric structure of the force law, while the relativity principle between inertial reference frames further restricts its admissible realizations. In strictly one-dimensional motion, inertial-frame equivalence implies invariance of the total force under inertial boosts; together with local energy conservation, this uniquely fixes the functional form of kinetic energy and momentum. Galilean invariance selects the Newtonian expressions, whereas Lorentz invariance yields the relativistic ones. The framework unifies conservative and non-conservative (yet non-dissipative) dynamics at the single-particle level and clarifies the precise conditions under which energy-based and variational formulations of mechanics are dynamically equivalent. Newtonian and relativistic mechanics thus emerge as symmetry-selected realizations of a common energy-conserving force-energy structure."}

Here we show that qualitative transitions in intelligence instead arise as dynamical phase transitions governed by collective critical dynamics. Building on a unified dynamical field-theoretic framework for cognition, we demonstrate that progressive collective coupling generated by reentrant mixing drives the system toward an infrared critical regime in which an extensive band of slow collective modes emerges. This spectral condensation reorganizes cognitive dynamics from localized relaxation to coherent motion along emergent low-dimensional manifolds. Through numerical analysis of the time-scale density of states, we identify robust power-law scaling of collective relaxation rates with well-defined critical exponents, placing the system within the universality class of self-organized critical many-body dynamics. Criticality alone would generically lead to instability. We further show that homeostatic regulation introduces a gapped stabilizing direction that protects the collective critical sector, yielding a dynamically maintained meta-stable infrared phase in which long-lived inference trajectories persist without collapse. The coexistence of scale-free collective dynamics and global stabilization defines a protected sector-critical regime in which coherence and internal flexibility coexist. Superintelligence therefore corresponds to a distinct dynamical stability class--a self-organized critical phase embedded within a stabilized cognitive manifold--rather than a smooth quantitative continuation of existing cognitive systems."}

Remarkably, we observe a consistent emergent behavior: when optimized solely for task success, models spontaneously internalize reasoning, progressively abandoning verbose textual derivations in favor of implicit latent computation.

By invoking Birkhoff's Ergodic Partition Theorem, we show that this scalar function distinguishes dynamical regimes via its power spectral density: for regular motion it converges to a delta function, whereas for chaotic trajectories the spectrum exhibits an inverse power-law $(1/ω)$ driven by the phenomenon of dynamical stickiness. With this approach, we avoid the computation and simulation of the variational equations and the usage of neighboring orbits, making it the simplest geometrical chaos indicator derivable from Lagrangian descriptors. Its computational efficiency enables the study of high-dimensional systems and allows the generation of large datasets of classified initial conditions, ideal for training Machine Learning models. We validate these findings using the Hénon-Heiles and the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam systems. By linking the geometrical properties of phase space to spectral analysis, this work provides the mathematical justification to establish Lagrangian descriptors as a rigorous, self-sufficient framework for the global analysis of chaos and regularity in Hamiltonian systems."}

We generate four geometries (3F, 2F-SY, 4F, and 2F-USY). All structures resulted in lower density in the range of 0.20-0.38 g.cm^-3. Experiments indicate that the symmetric two-sublattice structure (2F-SY) delivers the best performance, reaching a specific yield strength of 5.91 MPa.g^-1cm^-3 and a specific energy absorption of 279 J.g^-1, whereas 2F-USY architecture yielded the lowest values, with 0.77 MPa.g^-1.cm^-3 and 16 J.g^-1. The 4F geometry provided a specific energy absorption of 254 J.g^-1. The structures deformed through geometric collapse and strut buckling, which was due to diagonal shear in 2F-USY and progressive compaction in 2F-SY and 3F. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed these experimental trends and revealed strong directional anisotropy due to the arrangement of interlocked sublattices, with a stiffness of 24.1 GPa along the z-direction in the case of 4F architecture.

The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation.

These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states.

Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material.

Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks, enabling the utilization of device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) and quantum teleportation to achieve secure and efficient information transfer. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters, incorporating entanglement swapping and entanglement purification with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts toward realizing quantum repeaters, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. We overcome this by developing long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol. This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance. As a direct application, we demonstrate metropolitan-scale DI-QKD, distilling 1,917 secret keys out of 4.05*10^5 Bell pairs over 10 km. We further report a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, extending the achievable distance by more than two orders of magnitude.

The main novelty of this work lies in the development of a method to model the thermal connection between the magnet winding and the collar and pole regions via the TSA.\n  To assess the accuracy and computational efficiency of the novel method, temperature and field variations are computed for a current ramp-up scenario. The thermal solution is coupled to a fully resolved magnetodynamic solution to capture the interaction between thermal and electromagnetic behaviour. The results obtained with the TSA are then compared to classical finite element (FE) solutions with explicitly meshed insulation domains. The TSA predicts the maximum temperature within 2-4% of the reference solution while substantially reducing mesh complexity and achieving up to a 5 times speed-up in computation time. While the TSA has traditionally been employed for short-duration quench simulations with high heat fluxes between magnet turns, these results demonstrate its reliability and efficiency for current ramp scenarios with low heat fluxes, significantly expanding its application range beyond what has been previously reported in the literature.\n  To illustrate potential applications of this new functionality, conduction cooling through the collar region is studied, comparing different cooling configurations and collar materials."}

We develop such a framework by coupling a 3D vertex model of a spheroid to a fibrous ECM network and deriving a 3D Cauchy stress tensor for deformable polyhedral cells, enabling direct cell-level stress quantification in three dimensions. We analyze maximum shear stress in solid-like and fluid-like spheroids: solid-like spheroids exhibit broader stress distributions and radial stress gradients, while fluid-like spheroids show lower stresses with weak spatial organization. Cell shape anisotropy is not generically aligned with principal stress directions, indicating that morphology alone is an unreliable proxy for mechanical state. We further demonstrate strain stiffening at the single-cell level, where elongation produces nonlinear increases in maximum shear stress, allowing boundary cells in otherwise low-stress, fluid-like spheroids to transiently generate forces sufficient to remodel the matrix. To connect strain-induced stress amplification to invasion modes, we introduce an extended 3D vertex model with explicit, tunable cell-cell adhesion springs. In this minimal mechanical framework, single-cell breakout results from strain stiffening combined with reduced adhesion, whereas multi-cell streaming additionally requires anisotropic adhesion strengthened along the elongation axis and weakened orthogonally. Together, these results identify distinct mechanical pathways coupling cell strain, stress amplification, and adhesion organization to spheroid invasion."}

In three dimensions, the scaling theory predicts a quantum phase transition at a critical energy, the mobility edge, separating localized from diffusive states and underpinning metal-insulator transitions in electronic systems. Despite decades of experimental efforts, a direct observation of this emblematic transition for matter waves has remained elusive. Previous attempts with ultracold atoms were hindered by strong and uncontrolled energy broadening, resulting in indirect, sometimes inaccurate, and model-dependent estimates of the mobility edge. Here we implement a novel energy-resolved scheme to prepare atomic matter waves with a narrow energy distribution and track their expansion dynamics over long timescales. This allows for a direct observation of the three-dimensional Anderson transition in a laser-speckle disordered potential, and for a precise measurement of the mobility edge that is independent of any underlying theoretical modeling. Our measurements show excellent agreement with state-of-the-art numerical predictions over a wide range of disorder strengths, resolving long-standing discrepancies between prior experiments and theory. Beyond the three-dimensional Anderson transition, our approach opens new avenues for quantitative investigations of quantum critical phenomena in spatially disordered systems, including the roles of dimensionality, symmetry class, and interactions."}

In this study, we demonstrate a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based reservoir computing system with augmented temporal and spatial nonlinearity by utilizing both gate and substrate terminals as inputs. The ferroelectric polarization state in the next time step can additionally be controlled by modifying the electric field distribution in the gate stack of FeFET through a substrate input, enabling more diverse internal states compared with the case where inputs are applied only to the gate. To introduce a nonlinearity in the time domain, we introduce a delay between a gate input and a substrate input, which facilitates efficient nonlinear mixing between the current and past inputs. As a result, both the short-term memory and nonlinearity of the FeFET reservoir computing system are enhanced with an improved capability of feature extraction of complex input time-series. These findings demonstrate that introducing substrate input provides an additional degree of freedom for controlling ferroelectric polarization dynamics, enabling a flexible, energy-efficient, and highly integrable FeFET-based reservoir computing platform suitable for diverse time-series processing applications."}

Here, we introduce a next-generation SQUID-based microcalorimeter concept that exploits the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of a superconductor operated close to its critical temperature. The resulting mutual-inductance-based readout enables in situ tunable signal amplification, while inherently avoiding hysteretic effects that commonly limit superconducting sensors. Experiments with prototype devices demonstrate robust and reproducible operation over a wide temperature range. Based on our measurements and modeling, we project that an energy resolution below 100meV should be achievable with an optimized absorber-sensor combination. This approach therefore represents a promising pathway towards next-generation cryogenic detectors for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy."}

To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox."}

This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\\mathcal{C}$ being unitary.

To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ (LSAT) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy.

Both symmetries are broken in certain bilayer structures, enabling Rashba splittings in the absence of external electric fields. We determine this zero-field offset and the Rashba parameters that dictate the spin splitting in the linear regime. Surprisingly, the splitting is substantially smaller in bilayers than in monolayers at typical fields. This is clarified within a perturbative microscopic model, revealing that the spin splitting results from a competition between internal polarization and interlayer hybridization. We further introduce the orbital polarization imbalance as an order parameter that captures the asymmetry of the valence bands and determines the spin ordering of the Rashba-split states. Our results are both quantitative and qualitative, as they clarify the nature and origin of Rashba coupling in transition metal dichalcogenides."}

In this work we investigate the fabrication of miniaturised fully-encapsulated transmissive MPLCs within a glass chip using single-step direct laser writing. Our approach relies on the formation of femto-second laser induced birefringent nanogratings with a spatially controllable fast axis orientation. The glass chip is internally patterned with layers of these nanogratings to create multiple geometric phase holograms which imprint controllable phase patterns onto circularly polarised light propagating through them.

We show that the evolution of such structured states corresponds to an open path in the space of quadratic forms, giving rise to a geometric contribution to the emission amplitude that cannot be eliminated by gauge choice or adiabatic arguments. The inverse radius of curvature of the electron wavefront emerges as an effective geometric field that enables radiation even in regions where the external magnetic field vanishes locally. This mechanism generalizes Landau-level radiation to nonasymptotic, structured electron states and establishes a direct connection between noncyclic geometric evolution and photon emission."}

For the conservative systems, due to the critical nature of the chaos, the isolated systems with different parameters are correlated in the phase space, and therefore the isolated system is no longer isolated in the phase space.

While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC.

Traditionally, these measurements are performed with grating or Fourier-transform spectrometers using incoherent light sources. Leveraging coherent light enables powerful frequency-comb-based techniques, but is limited by the technical complexity of efficiently generating broad spectral bandwidths from relatively narrowband and spectrally distant laser sources. Current visible dual-comb spectrometers require implicit compromises between optical bandwidth, experimental simplicity, and acquisition speed. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient dual-comb spectrometer that converts robust Er:fiber frequency combs from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet and visible with thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) nanophotonic waveguides. Using real-time signal processing, we retrieve coherently averaged dual-comb spectra over nearly 120 THz of simultaneous bandwidth in the visible with 100 MHz spectral resolution. With these capabilities, we measure the broadband absorption spectrum of molecular iodine (I2), demonstrating the broadest visible spectral coverage of a dual-comb spectrometer to date. Additional measurements of NO2, atomic rubidium, and atomic sodium further illustrate the achievable combination of spectroscopic bandwidth, resolution, and intrinsic frequency accuracy. Our results demonstrate the powerful integration of low-power frequency combs, nonlinear nanophotonics, and digital signal processing to enable a compact, efficient and versatile approach to high-resolution mapping of complex absorption spectra across 500 THz in the UV-visible and near-infrared spectral regions for multiple applications beyond the research lab"}

This is particularly relevant for capturing the conformational dependence of the ESP (internal polarization) and chemically relevant features such as lone pairs or σ-holes. Across conformational space, the learned charge positions from DCM-net are stable and continuous. Across the QM9 chemical space, two-charge-per-atom models achieve accuracies comparable to fitted atomic dipoles for previously unseen molecules (0.75 (kcal/mol)/e). Three- and four-charge-per-atom models reach accuracies competitive with atomistic multipole expansions up to quadrupole level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e). Pronounced improvements of the ESP are found around O and F atoms, both of which are known to feature strongly anisotropic fields, and for aromatic systems. Across the QM9 reference data set, molecular dipole moments improve by 0.1 D compared with fitted monopoles. Transfer learning on dipeptides yields a 0.2 (kcal/mol)/e ESP improvement for unseen samples and a two-fold MAE reduction for molecular dipole moments versus fitted monopoles.

Here, we visualize and quantify CE-induced surface charges on ultrathin glass using sideband-mode Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Nanoscale atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes are used to scan and induce triboelectric charges on stand-alone glass surfaces under ultra-pure N$_2$ conditions.

Furthermore, electrostatic charges are found to exhibit capacitor-like discharging behavior primarily through the bulk material, yielding a long relaxation time constant of approximately 41~minutes. This behavior differs from the lateral surface discharging observed in thermally grown SiO$2$ thin films reported previously. A self-capacitance analytical model is developed to estimate the corresponding surface charge density ($σ$), yielding comparable values of 136.26~$\\pm$~16.25~$μ$C/m$^2$ at 30~$μ$m and 131.44~$\\pm$~28.41~$μ$C/m$^2$ at 100~$μ$m.

This upgrade imposes stringent requirements on the associated Detector Control System (DCS), which is responsible for the monitoring, control, and safety of the detector. A critical component of the ITk DCS is the Monitoring of Pixel System (MOPS), which supervises the local voltages and temperatures of the new pixel detector modules. This paper introduces a dedicated testbed and verification methodology for the MOPS readout, defining a structured set of test cases for two DCS-readout architectures: a preliminary Raspberry Pi-based controller, the \"MOPS-Hub Mock-up\"(MH Mock-up), and the final production FPGA-based \"MOPS-Hub\" (MH). The methodology specifies the measurement chain for end-to-end latency, jitter, and data integrity across CAN and UART interfaces, including a unified time-stamping scheme, non-intrusive signal taps, and a consistent data-logging and analysis pipeline. This work details the load profiles and scalability scenarios (baseline operation, full-crate stress, and CAN Interface Card channel isolation), together with acceptance criteria and considerations for measurement uncertainty to ensure reproducibility. The objective is to provide a clear, repeatable procedure to qualify the MH architecture for production and deployment in the ATLAS ITk DCS.

This gravitational pair creation corresponds to tunnelling out of a false vacuum. In this work, we study this non-perturbative process using a spacetime resolved numerical approach in the interaction picture. To achieve this, we extend the framework of Computational Quantum Field Theory (CQFT), which allows for efficient numerical time evolution of quantum fields, to spin-$1/2$ fermions in curved spacetime.\n  Using this extended framework, we investigate vacuum excitation of a Dirac field induced by a spacetime-curvature quench. In particular, we evolve the fermionic Minkowski vacuum in a $1\\!+\\!1$-dimensional idealized curved spacetime characterized by a localized ``curvature bump'' generated by a smooth, localized Gaussian deformation of flat spacetime. Vacuum excitation is quantified by computing the fermion--antifermion pair numbers defined with respect to the basis corresponding to flat-spacetime (Minkowski) which is the asymptotic metric corresponding to an observor at infinity.\n  We analyze how the excitation depends on the strength and spatial extent of the curvature deformation and discuss the numerical implementation of CQFT in curved backgrounds. While the post-quench geometry considered here is static and no electromagnetic field is included, the present work establishes a foundation for future investigations of particle creation in genuinely time-dependent curved spacetimes and in the presence of electromagnetic backgrounds."}

We identify conditions when the channel capacity of an ensemble of quantum sensors may surpass the limits of a classical electrically small antenna. Additionally, we discuss modifications to the quantum protocol that enables high-fidelity data recovery even in the presence of sensor noise and channel distortions.

However, it is often unclear whether the probe is responding to the local electric field or other types of intermolecular interactions, inhibiting interpretation of the frequency and effectiveness as probes. This is especially true of molecules whose vibrational frequencies blueshift instead of the more typical redshift in hydrogen bonding configurations. Here we computationally investigate the causes of redshifting versus blueshifting over a range of vibrational reporters. First, we apply adiabatic energy decomposition analysis to a paradigmatic set of probes, finding that redshifting only occurs when electrostatic interactions are strong enough to overcome the dominant and large blueshifting contribution of Pauli repulsion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that field inhomogeneity can further shift the frequency of many probes substantially to either reinforce or counteract the shift expected from a homogeneous field. We find that redshifting is reinforced by electric field inhomogeneity, otherwise field inhomogeneity further weakens the electrostatic contribution relative to Pauli repulsion, leading to blueshifting. Further calculations indicate that the probe's response to field inhomogeneity can be understood by considering the mass of the atoms involved in the stretching mode and sign of the electric field. In explaining the interplay of different intermolecular interactions and field inhomogeneity for many probes, our results should enable the use and interpretation of spectroscopic probes and their connection to electric fields in more complex systems."}

It is known that such an acceleration gives rise to the famous Unruh effect. Interestingly, its Galilean limit already shows the appearance of quantized modes for particles in free space, given by Airy functions. This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition. We provide further mathematical analysis regarding the completeness of the solutions in terms of Hankel functions $H^{(1)}$ of imaginary index and argument, and clarify the nature of the corresponding Sobolev spaces when the boundary condition disappears for the accelerated observer.

In strike contrast with respect to other orientations, these properties are not of extrinsic origin but arise from the interplay of structural order, strain and quantum confinement. The bandgap is shown to be either direct and indirect, depending on the precise composition, which can be explained in terms of the geometrical properties of (111)-oriented bilayers of LaMnO$_3$.

These features and the analysis of the inter-atomic magnetic coupling suggest that the investigated superlattices behave as a Kugel-Khomskii material, at least for the explored compositions. Our results provide not only a new route to an insulating ferromagnet, but also novel insight into the intricate interplay between lattice symmetry, Hubbard physics and Hund's coupling to be exploited in next-generation spintronic applications."}

Here, based on the recently proposed incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, we present a universal IQHE theory that does not rely on magnetic translation symmetry and is applicable to both rational and irrational magnetic fluxes. Using the square lattice as a paradigmatic example, we first show that the IEB framework provides a superior description of its energy spectrum in a magnetic field, as it explicitly reveals the momentum-space distribution of eigenstates. Key to our IQHE theory is that each gap in the IEB spectrum is intrinsically labeled by an integer pair (m,g), defined by the corresponding Bragg planes. When the Fermi energy lies within such a gap, the occupied electron states $N_{\\text{occ}}$ is determined by the k-space volume enclosed by these Bragg planes, leading to the fundamental relation $N_{\\text{occ}}/N_0 = m(φ/φ_0) + g$. Through Středa formula, this leads directly to the quantized Hall conductance $σ_{xy} = m e^2/h$ under arbitrary magnetic fields. Our work resolves the long-standing problem of IQHE under irrational flux, and establishes a new paradigm for IQHE."}

However, generating a dense array of evenly spaced ultra-narrow THz comb lines is challenging. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz comb generation using a photoconductive antenna that transfers a noise-suppressed near-infrared electro-optical (EO) comb into the THz domain. Our noise-suppression strategy, leveraging soliton self-frequency shift and spectral filtering, effectively suppresses EO comb phase noise without requiring active stabilization. The resulting THz comb exhibits broad spectral coverage (0.05-4 THz), narrow comb linewidths (0.3 Hz at the Fourier-transform limit), and excellent frequency stability (8.6*10^-14 at 1-second integration). We further demonstrate asynchronous THz time-domain spectroscopy, resolving ~36,000 comb lines with 50 MHz spacing. Crucially, the inherent frequency agility of the EO comb enables rapid and wide-range tuning of the THz comb line spacing. These attributes position our THz comb as a versatile tool for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precision THz metrology."}

For AKLT states on Bethe lattices and their decorated versions we show that there exists a deterministic, constant-time scheme for their preparation.

Such states naturally emerge upon measuring all the decorative spin-1 sites in the randomly decorated AKLT states. We show that those random-bond AKLT states on trivalent lattices can be converted to encoded random graph states after acting with the same POVM on all sites.

We report on comprehensive crystalstructure studies by means of powder neutron and single-crystal x-ray diffraction on K$_2$ReCl$_6$ and on K$_2$SnCl$_6$. The latter material is used as a reference, because it exhibits the same sequence of structural transitions as K$_2$ReCl$_6$, but possesses a filled 4d shell ruling out a Jahn-Teller distortion.

To generate the relevant electronic states, we employ the recently developed electron/hole-transfer Dynamically-weighted State-Averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method that treats systems with an odd number of electrons. To generate the relevant diabatic states, we employ a two-step optimization over complex-unitary rotations that sequentially maximizes dipole and spin moments through iterative Jacobi sweeps; the resulting update rules are effectively equivalent to those of approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) applied to charge and spin.

Two TPV cell architectures were fabricated on p-type, highly doped (10^17 cm-3) Ge substrates, differing only in rear contact configuration. A standard device with a gold rear contact achieves a peak efficiency of 7.3 % and a power density of 1.77 W/cm2 at an emitter temperature of 1480 C, while a PERC-type device reaches 6.3 % efficiency and 1.22 W/cm2 at 1426 C. The superior performance of the standard device is attributed to lower series resistance, whereas the PERC design exhibits slightly higher efficiency at lower emitter temperatures (4.0 % vs. 3.8 % at 1150 C) due to enhanced rear-surface reflectivity. A detailed TPV model has been developed and validated across both device architectures. The model identifies out-of-band optical losses as the dominant efficiency-limiting mechanism, primarily caused by strong free-carrier absorption in the highly doped Ge substrate. Using this model, we predict device performance under idealized spectral conditions commonly assumed in prior literature. For a simulated AlN/W spectrally selective emitter, efficiencies as high as 22.3 % at 1800 C are obtained, consistent with previous semi-empirical predictions. In contrast, when previously reported Ge devices are modeled under the realistic graphite emitter spectrum used here, projected efficiencies decrease to as low as 8.1 % at 1480 C. These results show that earlier projections remain valid but idealized and underscore the importance of emitter spectral engineering and substrate optimization. Finally, we present the first direct comparison of Ge and InGaAs TPV devices under identical conditions, demonstrating the superior performance of InGaAs while confirming the cost-driven competitiveness of Ge."}

Each star is built from edge-sharing triangles with an antiferromagnetic interaction on the shared side and ferromagnetic interactions on the others. At a critical coupling ratio, the ideal star model - defined by equal ferromagnetic interactions - exhibits a macroscopically degenerate ground state, which we map onto a site percolation problem on the Lieb lattice. This mapping enables the calculation of exponential ground-state degeneracy and the corresponding residual entropy for square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Remarkably, the residual entropy remains high for all studied lattices, exceeding 60\\% of the maximal value ln(2). Despite a gapless quadratic one-magnon spectrum, the low-temperature thermodynamics is governed by exponentially numerous gapped excitations. For a distorted-star variant of the model, the ground-state manifold is equivalent to that of decoupled ferromagnetic clusters, leading to exponential degeneracy with a lower, yet still substantial, residual entropy. At low temperature the system mimics a paramagnetic crystal of non-interacting spins with high spin value ($s=4$ for a square lattice).

Radial asymmetry introduces additional multipole components, notably an octupole term whose magnitude scales with the asymmetry parameter and whose sign depends on the DC polarity applied to the displaced rods. Transmission simulations show that the transmission peak shifts in accordance with the displaced stability apex, while the resolution exhibits a strong dependence on both the asymmetry parameter and the DC polarity. Comparable maximum resolution is obtained for inward and outward displacements under suitable polarity configurations, with outward displacement providing higher transmission efficiency due to an increased effective aperture. These results demonstrate that controlled radial asymmetry provides an effective means to tailor the resolution and transmission characteristics of QMFs operating in the second stability zone."}

However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics."}

In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing."}

These additional orbits (halos) provide new insights into spacetime geometry and potential observational signatures of black holes in modified gravity. We present analytical expressions for the orbital radii, perform a numerical stability analysis, and discuss possible observational implications for black hole shadows.

The present work challenges these claims, as well as subsequent attempts to salvage the original interpretation of the ABL rule.

The extracted birefringence is in good agreement with THz time domain spectroscopy-based measurements, validating the accuracy of the proposed THz polarimetric approach. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) up to 87 dB across 0.23-0.41 THz ensure reliable discrimination of the measured spectral components above the noise floor.

The resulting wave function is also proposed using the trial state in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) to recover dynamical correlations across the full orbital space (DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC). We evaluate the proposed methods on the H6 chain, N2 dissociation, and the addition of singlet O2 to a BODIPY dye.

These new methods exploit the spinor behaviour of 2-level systems, whose signature is the change of sign of a quantum state upon a $2π$ rotation. The spinor behaviour is used to manipulate the phases of single-quantum coherences, in order to prepare a double-quantum precursor state which is rapidly converted into double-quantum coherence by a straightforward $π/2$ rotation. One set of spinor-based methods exploits symmetry-based pulse sequences, while the other set exploits SLIC (spin-lock-induced crossing), in which the nutation frequency under a resonant radiofrequency field is matched to the spin-spin coupling. A variant of SLIC is introduced which is well-compensated for deviations in the radiofrequency field amplitude. The methods are demonstrated by performing double-quantum-filtered $^{19}$F NMR on a molecular system containing a pair of diastereotopic $^{19}$F nuclei.

The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation.

However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics."}

This concept is essential in magnonics, a subfield of spintronics that leverages spin waves for processing and transmitting information. Compared to conventional electronics, magnonics offers lower power consumption and faster operation, making it a promising technology for future devices. Magnons can be confined using both static and dynamic methods, often relying on potential wells and barriers to restrict their free propagation and trap them in designated locations. In this review, we will explore the main strategies for magnon confinement and trapping, including: magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin textures (i.e. domain walls, vortices, skyrmions) nanostructured materials (i.e. nanowires, disks, and magnonic crystals), topological states, chiral magnons and flat band formation, induced by dipole-dipole interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Microwave cavities and resonant magnetic fields, as well as spin-torque effects and Bose-Einstein condensation contribute to magnon localization. Furthermore, spin-wave edge and cavity modes have been observed in two-dimensional magnetic materials and twisted moiré superlattices at a specific twist angle. Magnon trapping has broad applications in computing and data processing, particularly in the development of magnonic crystals, waveguides, and memory elements. Additionally, magnon systems are being explored for quantum computing, where confinement can enhance the coupling between magnons and other quasiparticles in hybrid quantum systems. Precision control of magnons could lead to next-generation spintronic devices, offering improved efficiency and scalability."}

While broadband swept lasers offer a potential solution, generating broadband, ultrafast and linearly sweeping lasers with a narrow linewidth remains a significant challenge, particularly in the fingerprint mid-infrared (mid-IR) band. Here we overcome this limitation by using a microresonator-anchored ultrafast sweeping Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser for mid-IR spectroscopy. We introduce a dual-microresonator-anchor approach: a microcomb provides frequency calibration and a high-Q microresonator resolves the instantaneous FDML lasing lineshape. The strategy enables accurate correction of the FDML laser's sweep nonlinearity and broad linewidth in the near-IR, allowing the FDML laser to function as a high-fidelity mid-IR light via difference frequency generation.

Our noise-suppression strategy, leveraging soliton self-frequency shift and spectral filtering, effectively suppresses EO comb phase noise without requiring active stabilization. The resulting THz comb exhibits broad spectral coverage (0.05-4 THz), narrow comb linewidths (0.3 Hz at the Fourier-transform limit), and excellent frequency stability (8.6*10^-14 at 1-second integration). We further demonstrate asynchronous THz time-domain spectroscopy, resolving ~36,000 comb lines with 50 MHz spacing. Crucially, the inherent frequency agility of the EO comb enables rapid and wide-range tuning of the THz comb line spacing. These attributes position our THz comb as a versatile tool for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precision THz metrology."}

Utilizing this transformation, we study the shadow of this spacetime and the corresponding images from an equatorial thin accretion disk. The presence of the shell gives rise to distinctive features in the observed images. Notably, we observe distinct double photon rings in the images, which can gradually merge into a single ring. Moreover, the shadow boundaries and the photon rings do not exhibit a one-to-one correspondence. The abrupt changes in redshift factor and the truncated photon regions profoundly influence the image, producing distinctive features such as the step-like structures.

Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity.

This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition.

For interference-aware channel assignment, we give a compact QUBO/Ising formulation in which pairwise interference induces same-channel couplings and one-hot constraints are enforced via quadratic penalties (or, optionally, constraint-preserving mixers). Within RQAOA, fixing high-confidence variables or relations reduces the problem dimension, stabilizes training, and concentrates measurement effort on a shrinking instance that is solved exactly once below a cutoff. On simulated instances of modest size, including a four-user, four-channel example, the method consistently returns feasible assignments and, for the demonstrated case, attains the global optimum. These results indicate that recursion can mitigate parameter growth and feasibility issues that affect plain QAOA, and suggest a viable pathway for near-term quantum heuristics in wireless resource allocation."}

Rev. Lett. 107(5), 053601 (2011)] has attracted significant interest in both fundamental and applied optics due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. In this approach, the superposed modes exist in orthogonal polarization states and therefore do not interfere with each other. When optical gadgets are employed for characterization, the corresponding polarization distribution can be observed. In this work, we report that the characteristic (non-uniform) polarization distribution of vector beams is not inherently present in their field distribution. Instead, the observed polarization features arise during characterization as a consequence of the geometric phase difference introduced between the superposed modes by the optical gadgets.

By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration. We show that the high-Q multimode response of the SAW resonator enables spectrally selective acoustic addressing of triplet transitions near 105 MHz. Coherent control is evidenced by Rabi oscillations, with a Rabi frequency that increases linearly with the square root of the applied RF input power over the measured drive range, consistent with driven two-level dynamics under acoustic excitation.

In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing."}

We find that the intrinsic device parameters determining the qubit frequency and the baseline energy relaxation times ($T_1$) exhibit high robustness against thermal stress, characterized by frequency deviations typically confined within 0.5\\% and non-degraded coherence baselines. In stark contrast, the environmental variables, specifically the background magnetic flux offsets and the microscopic landscape of two-level system (TLS) defects, undergo a significant stochastic reconfiguration after each cycle. By employing frequency-dependent relaxation spectroscopy and a quantitative metric, the $T_1$ Spectral Topography Fidelity, we demonstrate that thermal cycling acts as a ``hard reset'' for the local defect environment. This process introduces a level of spectral randomization equivalent to thousands of hours of continuous low-temperature evolution. These findings confirm that while the fabrication quality is preserved, the specific noise realization is statistically distinct for each thermal cycle, necessitating automated recalibration strategies for large-scale quantum systems."}

For a single In-CrSb interface, the superconducting gap oscillates in magnetic field for both field orientations, which strongly resembles the transition into the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state.

Originally conceived to elucidate the physics of a molecular chain of polyacetylene, this model has found widespread applications in exploring a wide range of topological phenomena in photonics and beyond. In this chapter, we aim to provide an overview of topological photonics in one-dimensional (1D) settings. After briefly introducing paradigmatic 1D models, including the SSH, Rice-Mele, and AAH models, we review recent advances in experimental studies and applications of topological photonics based on 1D platforms. Our discussion highlights demonstrated examples, such as the nonlinear tuning of topological states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian photonic SSH lattices, as well as nonlinear harmonic generation and topological lasing in SSH-type photonic microstructures. We further discuss characteristic topological phenomena in other representative 1D settings, including Floquet systems, topological pumping, quasicrystals, and synthetic non-Hermitian systems. Finally, we examine selected examples of two-dimensional (2D) photonic topological crystalline insulators that are closely linked to the SSH model.

Beyond Second Order Perturbations", "comment": "44 p, no figures", "summary": "Black hole perturbation theory beyond second order is not well understood because typically one defines the meaning of gauge invariance order by order which is ambiguous. In this series of works we therefore developed a new approach which disentangles the meaning of gauge invariance from the perturbative order. It is based on the reduced phase space approach to the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity and constructs a non-perturbative, albeit implicit, formulation of the dynamics of only observables that are gauge invariant to all orders. To obtain explicit expressions, perturbation theory is then employed, but now only perturbations are considered that are gauge invariant to all orders. There are both spherically symmetric and non-symmetric observables and the formulation takes the (perturbative) backreaction between those fully into account. The formulation has access to both the exterior and interior of the dynamical horizon.\n  In previous papers of this series we have introduced the general formalism and performed consistency checks with second order results obtained in other approaches. The real virtue of our approach starts emerging at higher than second order where we expect differences from previous works both due to backreaction effects and because we work with observables that are gauge invariant to all orders, not only up to a given order. In this paper, we consider the third order. Also new to our approach is that we start from a non-perturbative, namely polynomial, version of the constraints which therefore are finite polynomials in all degrees of freedom before reducing, rather than an infinite series. This allows for an exact and non-perturbative, while implicit, solution of the constraints which does not need to truncate the series and thus is of tremendous technical advantage."}

However, achieving this goal is currently hindered by the stringent requirement for an ultrahigh mechanical quality factor ($Q_c$). Here, we propose a dual-channel cooling scheme based on squeezing-enhanced quantum interference within a hybrid levitated cavity-magnomechanical system to overcome this limitation.\n  By synergizing squeezing effects with quantum interference between the magnon-CM and cavity-CM channels, our scheme simultaneously suppresses Stokes (heating) scattering while enhancing anti-Stokes (cooling) scattering.~We demonstrate that this cooling mechanism reduces the critical $Q_c$ required for ground-state cooling by three orders of magnitude, making it achievable in the experimentally accessible regime of $Q_c \\sim 10^4$. Furthermore, the net cooling rate is enhanced by nearly 180-fold compared to that of conventional single-channel cooling. This improvement is accompanied by a two orders of magnitude reduction in both the steady-state CM occupancy and the cooling time. Importantly, this enhanced performance remains robust even deep within the unresolved-sideband regime. Our results provide a feasible path toward preparing macroscopic quantum states by actively controlling the cooling dynamics, thereby relaxing the constraints on intrinsic material properties."}

To meet this need, Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has emerged as a noncontact, high-resolution elastography tool that probes the GHz-frequency longitudinal modulus of materials. This longitudinal modulus reflects both elastic and viscous behavior at microscopic scales. However, interpreting Brillouin spectra in biological specimens is challenging: in highly hydrated samples the Brillouin shift is dominated by water dynamics, and the GHz longitudinal modulus does not directly equate to conventional low-frequency stiffness measures (e.g. Young's or shear moduli). Debates remain about how hydration and polymer relaxation influence the Brillouin signal, and how to relate it to macroscopic biomechanics. In particular, the longitudinal viscosity measured by Brillouin scattering includes a contribution from bulk viscosity, which is absent in standard shear rheology and often overlooked. To address these issues, we used different hydrogel systems and solvent mixtures to show Brillouin spectra are modulated but not dominated by hydration. By varying gelatin concentration, we demonstrated that Brillouin shifts can either positively or negatively correlate with water content, depending on the underlying mechanical response. Measurements on ethanol water mixtures further clarify this behavior. Although the Brillouin shift varies strongly with composition, it does not follow water content monotonically and instead reflects changes in the mixture's mechanical properties. By comparing longitudinal, bulk, and shear viscosities, we also showed that bulk viscous dissipation plays a significant role in the Brillouin response. These results established a mechanical framework for interpreting Brillouin spectrum in hydrated and biomolecular systems."}

Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement\" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity.

Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons. These findings establish perovskite QD superlattices as a promising platform for room-temperature collective optical phenomena and quantum light generation, advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies."}

This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems."}

They have demonstrated notable improvements in thresholds and scaling in surface and Floquet code memories. In this work, we use erasure qubits on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes from the quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) regime. Owing to their sparse structure and favorable rate-distance trade-offs, BB codes are practical candidates for QEC. We introduce BiBiEQ, a novel framework that compiles a given BB code into an erasure-aware memory circuit C_E. This erasure circuit C_E comprises erasure checks (ECs), resets, and erasures spread over a user-specified erasure check schedule (2EC, 4EC). BiBiEQ converts this erasure circuit C_E into the stabilizer circuit C for general-purpose decoding. BiBiEQ provides two engines for this conversion, BiBiEQ-Exact and BiBiEQ-Approx. BiBiEQ-Exact preserves the joint-erasure correlations and serves as our accuracy benchmark, while BiBiEQ-Approx uses an independence approximation to accelerate large sweeps and expose accuracy-throughput trade-offs. Using BiBiEQ, we decode the stabilizer circuits to get a per-round logical error rate (LER) for the BB codes and quantify the effect of the EC schedules on the correctable operating region below the pseudo-threshold. The 4EC schedule keeps the accuracy of both engines close to one another, making BiBiEQ-Approx a reliable proxy for BiBiEQ-Exact for faster sweeps. Below the pseudo-threshold, the code distance (d) hop from distance (d) 6 to 10 yields a drop in LER by 10-17x larger than distance (d) 10 to 12, showing that most gains are realized by d=10."}

Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons. These findings establish perovskite QD superlattices as a promising platform for room-temperature collective optical phenomena and quantum light generation, advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies."}

The strength of both correlations is governed solely by the squeezing parameter and is independent of the coherent amplitude. We further examine the impact of inevitable optical losses in various channel configurations. The results show that while losses degrade correlations, EPR steering remains monogamous and exhibits stricter resilience thresholds than entanglement. Our analysis, supported by parameter extension techniques, confirms that the steering condition is more stringent than the inseparability criterion, clearly demonstrating that steering forms a strict subset of entanglement. These results elucidate the correlation structure in a readily generated multimode state and offer practical insights for developing asymmetric quantum protocols, such as one-sided device-independent tasks, where EPR steering serves as a critical resource."}

We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect.

Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature.

By explicitly incorporating the full set of structural constraints inherent to Choi states, our approach exploits the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism for rigorous certification of quantum channels. The entanglement dimensionality of quantum channels is first certified by introducing a witness and numerically determining its Schmidt-number-dependent bounds. This certification method reproduces known analytical benchmarks and is applied to dephasing and depolarizing noise channels, thereby confirming its validity. To provide a more complete assessment of channel performance, the entanglement fidelity of quantum channels is also certified using a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations based on localizing matrices. Lower bounds on the entanglement fidelity are obtained that are compatible with either the full set of observed statistics or a single witness value."}

In contrast to low-power domain where the output power distribution in the cores is random with large fluctuations sensitive to fiber disturbances, at high power of the input pulse injected in the central core the output power becomes equalized between the cores with fluctuations reduced to <5% being insensitive to disturbances. Similar behavior is observed in cut-back experiments showing that equi-partition is approached at a distance of ~5 m. The performed modeling describes well the experimental results and clarifies mechanisms of the new effect reasoned by a large nonlinear phase shift changing along the pulse and thereby resulting in statistical averaging over the pulse length of multidirectional power transfer processes between cores, thus leading to the robust equilibrium (equi-partitition for hexagonal MCF topology). At the same time, the combined output beam measured in a far field takes a stable bell-shaped profile instead of speckled beam at low powers, similar to the beam self-cleaning effect in multimode fibers."}

The structure of the solution allows one to identify new resummed factors that completely absorb all test-mass logarithms and transcendental numbers via exponentials and $Γ$-functions at any post-Newtonian (PN) order. The corresponding residual relativistic and phase corrections are thus polynomial with rational coefficients, that are in fact PN-truncated hypergeometric functions. Our approach complements the recent proposal of Ivanov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135 (2025) 14, 141401], notably recovering the corresponding renormalization group scaling of multipole moments from first principles and fixing the scaling constant. In the test mass limit, our approach (pushed up to 10PN) yields waveforms and fluxes that are globally more accurate than those obtained using the standard factorized approach of Damour et al. [Phys. Rev. D 79 (2009), 064004]. The method generalizes straightforwardly to comparable mass binaries implementing the new concept of universal anomalous dimension of multipole moments and might be eventually useful to improve current state of the art effective-one-body waveform models for coalescing binaries."}

We first rigorously establish the nonintegrability of the deformed Fredkin spin chain with periodic boundary conditions by mapping it to a nearest-neighbor composite-spin representation and excluding all admissible $3$-local conserved charges.

We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature. Power spectral analysis shows that these configurations give rise to low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, offering a unified explanation for the multiple quasi-periodic oscillations observed in rapidly spinning X--ray binaries."}

Here we show that coupling molecular chirality to the topological structure of twisted light generates a protected phase observable that survives strong scattering. When Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum propagate through chiral media, spin-orbit interaction converts circular birefringence into an azimuthal rotation of the helical wavefront. Remarkably, this chiral phase memory persists at scattering strengths that fully depolarize conventional beams, with the rotation magnitude preserved quantitatively between transparent solutions and strongly scattering tissue. The sign of the azimuthal rotation encodes molecular handedness: opposite enantiomers produce mirror-symmetric phase maps even after multiple scattering. Differential measurements between conjugate topological charges isolate the chiral contribution while cancelling achiral background, enabling the resolution of refractive-index changes of order 10-6. These results establish topological phase observables as robust carriers of weak chiral light-matter interactions in complex media, opening new routes for chiroptical spectroscopy and sensing beyond the ballistic-photon regime."}

The model naturally resolves the initial singularity resulting in an infinite number of smooth non-singular bounces, while accommodating a phase of accelerated expansion driven by a scalar field rolling at a constant rate. The presence of a timelike extra dimension induces high-energy corrections to the effective Friedmann dynamics, allowing anisotropic shear to be dynamically suppressed near the bounce and rendering the background evolution stable. We derive the full background dynamics analytically and demonstrate that uniform-rate inflation can be consistently embedded within an anisotropic braneworld framework. Primordial scalar and tensor perturbations are analysed using the $δN$ formalism, ensuring that only physically relevant modes exiting the horizon during inflation contribute to observable quantities. Remarkably, we find that observational consistency can be achieved with different levels of anisotropy in the two different scenarios we consider, without compromising the smoothness or stability of the bounce.

The resulting wave function is also proposed using the trial state in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) to recover dynamical correlations across the full orbital space (DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC). We evaluate the proposed methods on the H6 chain, N2 dissociation, and the addition of singlet O2 to a BODIPY dye. For the H6 chain, DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC reproduces the accuracy of the level of the complete-active-space counterpart with the quantum device ibm kobe.

These states constitute full continuous spectra in the 1D and 2D cases alike. In 1D, these are spatially even and odd eigenstates. The 2D states may carry any value of the vorticity (alias magnetic quantum number). Asymptotic approximations for wave functions of the 1D and 2D eigenstates, valid far from the center, are derived analytically, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerically found counterparts. Special exact solutions for vortex states are obtained in the 2D case. These findings suggest an extension of the concept of bound states in the continuum, in quantum mechanics and paraxial photonics. Gross-Pitaevskii equations are considered as the nonlinear extension of the 1D and 2D settings. In 1D, the cubic nonlinearity slightly deforms the eigenstates, maintaining their stability. On the other hand, the quintic self-focusing term, which occurs in the photonic version of the 1D model, initiates the dynamical collapse of states whose norm exceeds a critical value."}

We resolve this by constructing a graph model directly from the causal structure of entanglement wedges. By proving a key \"no-short-cut\" theorem, we show that minimization over graph cuts reduces to a consideration of cuts corresponding to unions of complete HRT surfaces, establishing the equivalence of the covariant and static holographic entropy cones.

Furthermore, the net cooling rate is enhanced by nearly 180-fold compared to that of conventional single-channel cooling. This improvement is accompanied by a two orders of magnitude reduction in both the steady-state CM occupancy and the cooling time. Importantly, this enhanced performance remains robust even deep within the unresolved-sideband regime.

Therefore, both the complex and quaternionic solutions are more general than previous cases, thus opening the way to further one-dimensional solutions to be researched in the non-relativistic theory."}

It is shown that such undulators can be employed for generating photons in the so-called composite twisted states -- the states that are linear superpositions of modes with definite projections of the total angular momentum, amplitudes, relative phases, and polarizations. We find the explicit expressions and the selection rules for these parameters and establish that they can be governed in a predictable way by adjusting the parameters of the multifrequency helical undulator. In particular, the phases of three arbitrary modes admissible by selection rules in the composite state with definite energy can be made arbitrary by tuning the phases of one-frequency undulators comprising the three-frequency one. By solving Diophantine equations, we obtain simple expressions for the complex amplitude of coherent state of photons emitted by a three-frequency helical undulator and for the average number of radiated twisted photons in the case when the ratios of frequencies of the three-frequency undulator are rational numbers. The development of resonances and the control of composite states of radiated photons are studied numerically confirming the theoretical conclusions."}

Consequently, the trials generated sequentially in an experiment may exhibit non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) behavior. This non-i.i.d. behavior can introduce security concerns and result in faulty estimates when performing information tasks such as quantum key distribution, self-testing, verifiable quantum computation, and resource allocation in quantum networks. To certify the performance of such tasks, one can make a random decision in each trial, either spot-checking some desired property or utilizing the quantum resource for the given task. However, a general method for certification with a sequence of non-i.i.d. spot-checking trials is still missing. Here, we develop such a method. This method not only works efficiently with a finite number of trials but also yields asymptotically tight certificates of performance.

This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance.

The spinor behaviour is used to manipulate the phases of single-quantum coherences, in order to prepare a double-quantum precursor state which is rapidly converted into double-quantum coherence by a straightforward $π/2$ rotation. One set of spinor-based methods exploits symmetry-based pulse sequences, while the other set exploits SLIC (spin-lock-induced crossing), in which the nutation frequency under a resonant radiofrequency field is matched to the spin-spin coupling.

The method employs a sequency-ordered Quantum Walsh-Hadamard Transform (QWHT), a comparator-based oracle that coherently marks basis states within an arbitrary sequency range, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to estimate the total probability mass in the selected band. This enables the detection of structured signal components, including both high- and low-sequency features, as well as the identification of rapid sign-change behavior associated with noise or anomalies. The proposed method can be embedded as a module within a larger quantum algorithm; in this setting, both the input and output remain fully quantum, enabling seamless integration with upstream and downstream quantum operations. We show that the sequency-ordered QWHT can be implemented with circuit depth $O(\\log_2 N)$ (equivalently $O(n)$ for $N=2^n$) when acting on an amplitude-encoded quantum state, whereas computing the full Walsh-Hadamard spectrum of an explicit length-$N$ classical signal requires $O(N\\log_2 N)$ operations via the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform. This results in an exponential quantum advantage when the QWHT is used as a modular block within a larger quantum algorithm, relative to classical fast Walsh-Hadamard transform-based approaches operating on explicit data. From an application perspective, the proposed sequency band-energy estimation may be interpreted as a structure-based anomaly indicator, enabling the detection of unexpected high-sequency components relative to a nominal low-sequency signal class. The algorithm is applicable to quantum-enhanced signal processing tasks such as zero-crossing analysis, band-limited noise estimation, and feature extraction in the Walsh basis."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) offers a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the probabilistic nature of non-local entangling gates. Qudit circuit compression schemes mitigate this issue by encoding multiple qubits onto qudits. However, these schemes become inefficient when only a subset of the encoded qubits is required to participate in the non-local entangling gate, leading to an exponential increase in the number of non-local gates. In this Letter, we address this bottleneck by demonstrating the existence of multi-level control-Z (CZ) gates for qudits encoded in multiple spatial modes in LOQC. Unlike conventional two-level CZ gates, which act only on a single pair of modes, multi-level CZ gates impart a conditional phase shift for an arbitrarily chosen subset of the spatial modes. We present two explicit linear optical schemes that realize such operations, illustrating a fundamental trade-off between prior information about the input quantum state and the physical resources required. The first scheme is realized with a constant success probability of $1/8$ independent of the qudit dimension using a single non-local entangling gate, at the cost of state dependence, which is significantly better than the current success probability of $1/9$. Our second scheme provides a fully state independent realization reducing the number of non-local gates to $\\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1}+2^{r_2})$ as compared to the existing bound of $\\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1+r_2})$ where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the number of qubits to be removed as control in the qudits. The success probability of the realization is $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{2^{r_1}+2^{r_2}}$.

Recent experimental advances have enabled the tailoring of noise properties through Pauli twirling, transforming arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels. This underpins theoretical descriptions of fault-tolerant quantum computation and forms an essential tool in noise characterization and error mitigation. Pauli-Lindblad channels have been introduced to aptly parameterize quasi-local Pauli errors across a quantum register, excluding negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters relying on the Markovianity of the underlying noise processes. We point out that caution is required when parameterizing channels as Pauli-Lindblad channels with nonnegative parameters. For this, we study the effects of Pauli twirling on Markovianity. We use the notion of Markovianity of a channel (rather than that of an entire semigroup) and prove a general Pauli channel is non-Markovian if and only if at least one of its Pauli-Lindblad parameters is negative. Using this, we show that Markovian quantum channels often become non-Markovian after Pauli twirling. The Pauli-twirling induced non-Markovianity necessitates the use of negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters for a correct noise description in experimentally realistic scenarios. An important example is the implementation of the $\\sqrt{X}$-gate under standard Markovian noise. As such, our results have direct implications for quantum error mitigation protocols that rely on accurate noise characterization."}

Moreover, it provides a systematic way to construct Bell inequalities that are tailored to specific quantum information processing tasks.

Despite numerous pioneering efforts toward realizing quantum repeaters, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. We overcome this by developing long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol. This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance. As a direct application, we demonstrate metropolitan-scale DI-QKD, distilling 1,917 secret keys out of 4.05*10^5 Bell pairs over 10 km. We further report a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, extending the achievable distance by more than two orders of magnitude. Our work provides a critical building block for quantum repeaters and marks an important step toward scalable quantum networks."}

In the context of supervised learning, most of the works that tackle classification problems with parameterized quantum circuits constrain their scope to the setting of binary classification or perform multiclass classification via ensembles of binary classifiers (strategies such as one versus rest). Those few works that propose native multiclass models, however, do not justify the choice of observables that perform the classification. This work studies two main classification criteria in multiclass quantum machine learning: maximizing the expected value of an observable representing a class or maximizing the fidelity of the encoded quantum state with a reference state representing a class. To compare both approaches, sets of Pauli strings and sets of projectors into the computational basis are chosen as observables in the quantum machine learning models. Observing the empirical behavior of each model type, the effect of different observable set choices on the performance of quantum machine learning models is analyzed in the context of Barren Plateaus and Neural Collapse. The results provide insights that may guide the design of future multiclass quantum machine learning models."}

The protocol employs excitation-preserving partial-SWAP collisions between two disjoint qubit registers, mediated by $m$ ancillary ``shuttle'' qubits, and poses Dicke-state preparation as a \\emph{closed-loop design} problem: given the target $(n,m)$, automatically infer collision strengths that maximize fidelity under practical constraints. Concretely, we formulate a two-parameter, bound-constrained optimization over intra-register and shuttle--register collision angles and solve it using a multi-start strategy with L-BFGS-B, yielding a reproducible controller prescription (optimized $γ_{\\mathrm{in}}$, $γ_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, and minimal-round convergence points) for each target. This removes the need for projective measurements and extends collisional entanglement generation beyond the single-excitation (W-state) sector to arbitrary $m$. Crucially, we optimize \\emph{within} imperfect collisional dynamics where errors act throughout the sequence, including stochastic interaction dropouts (missing collisions) and standard decoherence channels. Strikingly, across wide error ranges the optimized controller preserves high preparation fidelity; imperfections manifest primarily as a modest increase in the required number of collision rounds.

The main proposition of PI is to minimise variationally a loss function, formally ensuring that a neural surrogate of the solution has the DE locally satisfied. The nature of such formulation encouraged the exploration of equivalent quantum algorithms, where the surrogate solution is expressed by variational quantum architectures. The locality of typical loss functions emphasises the DE to hold at an ensemble of points sampled in the domain, but encounters issues when generalising beyond such points, or when propagating boundary conditions. Issues which affect classical and quantum PI algorithms alike. The quest to fill this gap in robustness and accuracy against mainstream DE solvers has led to a plethora of proposals in various directions. In particular, classical DE solvers have long employed the weak form - an integral based approach aiming at imposing a global condition on the solution - prioritising a good average behaviour instead of ``overfitting'' select points. Here, we propose and explore to combine contributions from both local and global loss functions in PI routines, to exploit the advantages and mitigate the weaknesses of both. We showcase this intuition in a variety of problems focusing on differentiable quantum architectures, and demonstrating in particular how orchestrating such hybrid loss formulation with domain decomposition can offer a strong advantage over local-only strategies."}

However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus.

We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox."}

For insulators, the zero-point energy density is proportional to quantum fluctuation of electric polarization in the many-body ground state, a fundamental quantum geometric property of solids known as the quantum weight. Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material. In addition, since zero-point energy depends on the circuit's capacitor, it yields a measurable static force acting on the capacitor plates, which we call quantum geometric force. The proposed effects provide direct experimental access to the many-body quantum geometry and reveal a new macroscopic quantum effect in solids induced by vacuum fluctuation."}

The ability to perform such spatial reformatting operations has many future applications in both classical and quantum photonics, spanning from optical communications to photonic computing and imaging. MPLCs are intricate optical systems consisting of a cascade of inverse-designed diffractive optical elements, typically separated by free-space. In this work we investigate the fabrication of miniaturised fully-encapsulated transmissive MPLCs within a glass chip using single-step direct laser writing. Our approach relies on the formation of femto-second laser induced birefringent nanogratings with a spatially controllable fast axis orientation. The glass chip is internally patterned with layers of these nanogratings to create multiple geometric phase holograms which imprint controllable phase patterns onto circularly polarised light propagating through them. We experimentally demonstrate two proof-of-concept glass-embedded 700x700x2000 micrometer cubed MPLCs: a 3-mode and a 10-mode Hermite-Gaussian mode sorter. We discuss the fabrication challenges and future improvements of these devices. Our work plots a path towards the rapid prototyping of robust monolithic MPLC technology."}

Tobar"], "title": "Split-Post Microwave Displacement Transducer with Quadratic Readout", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer."}

These phenomena have been extensively studied across various platforms, including quantum optics, cold atom systems, superconducting circuits, and condensed matter physics. Rydberg atoms, with their long-range interactions and flexible controllability, provide a promising platform for the experimental realization of non-Hermitian physics. This review primarily summarizes the key experimental and theoretical achievements in the field of non-Hermitian physics within Rydberg atomic systems in recent years. It outlines the fundamental construction of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals the effective dissipation mechanisms induced by Rydberg atomic interactions, and discusses their impact on spectral properties and symmetry breaking. These studies not only deepen the understanding of quantum phase transitions in non-Hermitian many-body systems but also highlight the unique value of Rydberg atomic platforms in realizing and controlling topological states."}

In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing."}

Using the universal CFT Wightman function, we compute the detector's reduced density operator perturbatively, retaining both excitation probabilities and coherences. As a concrete resource-theoretic application, we implement magic resource (mana) harvesting with a qutrit probe. For a CFT dual to global AdS, we show that the harvested mana sharply distinguishes the two admissible scalar quantizations in the Breitenlohner--Freedman window, with the standard quantization yielding systematically larger mana than the alternate one. Our results provide a viable way of testing holography principle through quantum information resource."}

In this study, we analyze the genuine N-partite entanglement, measured by negativity, of bosonic and fermionic GHZ states, focusing on scenarios where a subset of $m$ ($m<N$) constituents interacts with Hawking radiation generated by a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement\" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity. Our study reveals the intrinsic relationship between quantum entanglement of bosonic and fermionic fields in curved spacetime from a new perspective, and provides theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate field-based quantum resources for relativistic quantum information tasks under extreme gravitational conditions."}
