Abstract: Hybrid photon counting detectors (HPCDs) have unlocked new capabilities for x-ray-based measurements at synchrotrons around the world in the last 30 years. By leveraging independently optimized sensor and readout layers, they offer high quantum efficiency ($> 80 \%$), ultra-low dark counts, sub-pixel point-spread function, and high count rates ($> 10^{6}$ counts per pixel per second). Furthermore, their small pixel size and large active area endow them with excellent coverage and resolution for both real-space and reciprocal space imaging. Here, we demonstrate that HPCDs are also well-suited for laboratory-based nanoscale x-ray tomography (nano-xCT). We perform nano-xCT on an integrated circuit fabricated at the 130-nm node and produce a 3D reconstruction with 40 times more photons collected 20 times faster than in this group's previous work, for an overall speedup of 800$\times$. We review the technical considerations of using an HPCD for tabletop tomography. We quantify our reconstruction image quality using well-established metrics, including the modulation transfer function (MTF), Fourier shell correlation (FSC), and contrast-to-noise (CNR), to validate our choice of experimental parameters that provide sufficient resolution and imaging speed. Using these metrics, we determine that even under current experimental conditions, 160 nm wiring features are reconstructed at 75-80 nm spatial resolution.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: SG101 is a promising thermal neutron sensitive transparent glass scintillator with excellent detection efficiency, energy resolution, and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) performance when coupled with EJ200 or EJ276 organic scintillators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to develop a highly effective scintillator for thermal neutron detection, which is crucial for applications like neutron capture experiments and non-destructive testing.

Method: The researchers evaluated the detection efficiency, energy resolution, and PSD of SG101 under AmBe neutron irradiation. They also coupled it with EJ200 and EJ276 organic scintillators to assess the system's performance.

Result: The coupling of SG101 with EJ200 achieves a figure of merit (FOM) of 3.81 for thermal neutron/gamma separation. Conversely, the coupling with EJ276 resolves thermal neutrons, fast neutrons, and gamma rays with FOM values of 3.46 and 2.21, respectively. Additionally, correlation analysis reveals significant physical correlations in fast thermal neutron and gamma events within a 100 us time window.

Conclusion: SG101 demonstrates significant potential for high-efficiency thermal neutron detection and precise event tagging in systems combined with appropriate organic scintillators.

Abstract: We present a detailed characterization of the thermal neutron sensitive transparent glass scintillator SG101, benchmarked against the conventional LiF ZnS(Ag)based scintillator EJ426. The detection efficiency, energy resolution, and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) performance ofSG101 were evaluated under AmBe neutron irradiation. When coupled with organic scintillators(EJ200 or EJ276),the SG101 EJ200 system achieves a figure of merit (FOM) of 3.81 for thermal neutron/gamma separation, while the SG101 EJ276 configuration resolves three distinct particle populations gamma rays, fast neutrons, and thermal neutrons with FOM values of 3.46 and2.21, respectively. Correlation analysis reveals that the number of fast thermal neutron coincidence events significantly exceeds the accidental background, and the count of gamma fast thermal neutron triple-coincidence events is also far higher than the expected accidental rate, confirming significant physical correlations for both event types within a 100 us time window. These results demonstrate that SG101 is a promising candidate for applications requiring high-efficiency thermal neutron detection and precise event tagging coupling with a scintillator with PSD approach

*Yousen Zhang,Brett Viren,Mary Bishai,Sergey Martynenko,Xin Qian,Rado Razakamiandra,Brooke Russell*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRED, a GPU-accelerated simulation package for next-generation neutrino detectors with pixelated charge readout. It leverages community-driven software ecosystems for sustainability and extensibility. Two main contributions are presented: an effective-charge calculation using Gaussian quadrature rules and a sparse, block-binned tensor representation for efficient FFT-based computation of induced signals. The former captures sub-grid structure without requiring dense sampling and the latter achieves low memory usage and scalable runtime. The underlying data representation is applicable to large-scale detectors and other sparse activity computational problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is motivated by the need for efficient and accurate simulation of next-generation neutrino detectors. These detectors have complex geometries and require high performance computing solutions to account for the large number of pixels and their respective charge distributions. The challenge is to develop a tool that is both computationally efficient and maintainable, given the increasing size and complexity of modern neutrino detectors.

Method: The method presented in this paper combines GPU acceleration with numerical integration techniques and sparse tensor representations. The effective-charge calculation is performed using Gaussian quadrature rules, which provide a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The sparse, block-binned tensor representation is used to model the induced signals on readout electrodes in a memory-efficient and scalable manner. The implementation leverages community-driven software ecosystems to ensure sustainability and extensibility.

Result: The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the effective-charge calculation based on Gaussian quadrature rules provides an efficient way to capture sub-grid structure without requiring dense sampling. This is a significant improvement over traditional methods that rely on dense sampling, which can be computationally expensive and inaccurate. Second, the sparse, block-binned tensor representation enables efficient FFT-based computation of induced signals. This approach reduces memory usage and achieves scalable runtime, making it suitable for large-scale detectors and other sparse activity computational problems. The benchmark studies conducted in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these methods.

Conclusion: TRED is a valuable tool for simulating next-generation neutrino detectors. It addresses the challenges of computational efficiency and maintainability by introducing innovative numerical integration methods and sparse data representations. The paper demonstrates that TRED can handle large-scale simulations and is applicable to a broader range of computational problems involving sparse activity.

### [4] [Stratified Sampling for Quasi-Probability Decompositions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11245)
*Joshua W. Dai,Bálint Koczor*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种还原困难量子电路的通用方法，通过分解为更容易处理的变体，能够在保持 Born 样本方差的同时显著降低配置方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，如何高效地执行量子算法和协议成为一个重要挑战。该论文旨在通过降低配置方差来提高现有量子算法的效率。

Method: 该论文提出了一种基于分层抽样的方法来优化量子概率分解（QPD），并通过动态规划实现任意乘积形式 QPD 的分层。

Result: 模拟实验显示，与传统方法相比，该方法在普通情况下减少了约 60%-80% 的整体方差，在最坏情况下也减少了约 10% 的方差。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过分层抽样优化 QPD 能够显著提升量子算法的效率，且无需额外量子资源即可应用到实际相关算法中。

Abstract: Quasi-probability decompositions (QPDs) have proven essential in many quantum algorithms and protocols -- one replaces a ``difficult'' quantum circuit with an ensemble of ``easier'' circuit variants whose weighted outcomes reproduce any target observable. This, however, inevitably yields an increased configuration variance beyond Born-rule shot noise. We develop a broad framework for accounting for and reducing this variance and prove that stratified sampling -- under ideal proportional allocation -- results in an unbiased estimator with a variance that is never worse than naïve sampling (with equality only in degenerate cases).
  Furthermore, we provide a classical dynamic programme to enable stratification on arbitrary product-form QPDs. Numerical simulations of typical QPDs, such as Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) and Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (PAI), demonstrate constant-factor reductions in overall variance (up to $\sim 60$--$80\%$ in an oracle model) and robust $\sim 10\%$ savings in the pessimistic single-shot regime. Our results can be applied immediately to reduce the net sampling cost of practically relevant QPDs that are commonly used in near term and early fault-tolerant algorithms without requiring additional quantum resources.

*Anasuya Lyons,Benjamin J. Brown*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 这项研究提出了基于 Mayorana 粒子的拓扑量子计算方案，并通过错误校正实现了容错量子计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，如何构建一个容错的量子计算机一直是难题。Kitaev 的工作为拓扑量子计算奠定了基础，本文则进一步提出了基于 Majorana 粒子的方案，并通过错误校正实现了容错性，为现代量子硬件的发展提供了新思路。

Method: 研究者通过引入 Majorana 粒子和 Majorana 边界条件，结合位操作逻辑门，设计了一个基于 Majorana 量子位的错误校正机制。

Conclusion: 这项研究奠定了一种基于 Majorana 粒子的容错量子计算方法，并为未来实际构建量子计算机提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In seminal work (arxiv:quant-ph/9707021) Alexei Kitaev proposed topological quantum computing (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:quant-ph/0001108, arXiv:0707.1889), whereby logic gates of a quantum computer are conducted by creating, braiding and fusing anyonic particles on a two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new method for unconditional vector magnetometry using diamond NV centers and elliptical polarized microwaves, eliminating the need for prior field knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The method addresses a significant limitation of current diamond-based magnetic sensors, expanding their applicability in various fields.

Method: Utilizes diamond NV centers combined with elliptically polarized microwaves to achieve vector magnetometry without prior field information.

Result: The method enables simultaneous measurement of magnetic field magnitude and direction without relying on external calibration.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens new possibilities for real-time, versatile magnetometry across different industries.

Abstract: Quantum sensors based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been a central topic in the sensing community for more than a decade. The extraordinary properties at room temperature of the spin system in diamond have made it one of the most prominent quantum platforms for the development of commercial quantum sensors. In particular, the sensitivity of the electronic spin in NV centers has made diamond-based magnetic sensors of special interest for their potential application in medical, industrial or navigation solutions. However, the use of these sensors for universal vector magnetometry was constrained by the need for previous knowledge on the field being measured to fully exploit their benefits. In this work, we show a method to perform unconditional vector magnetometry without the need of external information on the magnetic field, based only on the spatial arrangement of the diamond and the microwave antenna combination. While previous NV-based vector magnetometry methods require partial knowledge of the magnetic field (e.g. a calibrated bias field), we exploit the possibilities of selecting particular directions of the spins in the diamond with elliptically polarized microwave fields. We prove that our method allows to estimate both magnitude and direction of external magnetic fields without further assumptions or constraints.

Abstract: Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.

Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for direct first-principles simulation of electron-nuclear dynamics on a first-quantized real-space grid. Our algorithm achieves best-in-class efficiency for block-encoding the pre-Born-Oppenheimer molecular Hamiltonian by harnessing the linear scaling of swap networks for implementing the quadratic number of particle interactions, while using a novel alternating sign implementation of the Coulomb interaction that exploits highly optimized arithmetic routines. We benchmark our approach for a series of scientifically and industrially relevant chemical reactions. We demonstrate over an order-of-magnitude reduction in costs compared to previous state-of-the-art for the $\rm NH_3+BF_3$ reaction, achieving a Toffoli cost of $8.7\times10^{9}$ per femtosecond using $1362$ logical qubits (system + ancillas). Our results significantly lower the resources required for fault-tolerant simulations of photochemical reactions, while providing a suite of algorithmic primitives that are expected to serve as foundational building blocks for a broader class of quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Resolving signals with closely spaced frequencies is central to applications in communications, spectroscopy and sensing. Recent results have shown that quantum sensing protocols can exhibit superresolution, the ability to discriminate between spectral lines with arbitrarily small frequency separation. Here, we revisit this problem from the perspective of quantum control theory, utilizing the filter function formalism to derive general, analytic conditions on quantum control protocols for achieving superresolution. Building on these conditions, we develop an optimal control framework, the utility of which is demonstrated through numerical identification of superresolution control protocols in the presence of realistic, experimentally-relevant constraints. We further extend our results to entangled initial states and assess their potential advantage. Our approach is broadly applicable to a wide variety of quantum sensing platforms, and it provides a systematic path to discover novel protocols that surpass conventional resolution limits in these systems.

Abstract: Simulating chemical reactions is a central challenge in computational chemistry, characterized by an uneven difficulty profile: while equilibrium reactant and product geometries are often classically tractable, intermediate transition states frequently exhibit strong correlation that defies standard approximations. We present a protocol for dissipative ground state preparation that exploits this structure by treating the reaction path itself as a computational primitive. Our protocol uses an approach where a state prepared at a tractable geometry is propagated along a discretized reaction coordinate using Procrustes-aligned orbital rotations and stabilized by engineered dissipative cooling. We show that for reaction paths satisfying a localized Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) drift condition in the strongly correlated regime, the algorithm prepares ground states of chemical systems with $N_o$ orbitals to an energy error $ε_E$ with a total gate complexity scaling as $\widetilde{O}(N_o^{3}/ε_E)$. We provide logical resource estimates for benchmark systems including FeMoco, Cytochrome P450, and Ru-based carbon capture catalysts.

*Malaquias Correa Anguita,Sara Marzban,William F. Braasch,Twesh Upadhyaya,Gabriel Landi,Nicole Yunger Halpern,Jelmer J. Renema*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Maxwell's demon can use information to create a temperature gradient between modes of light, which is stronger when the photons are indistinguishable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of information in thermodynamics, particularly in quantum systems, is crucial for the development of quantum technologies and the unification of physical theories.

Method: The researchers used a linear-optics platform with programmable modes to measure and manipulate photons. They compared systems with distinguishable versus indistinguishable photons to observe the effect of particle statistics on thermodynamic work extraction.

Result: The experiment showed that a demon (likely referring to the Maxwell's demon setup) can create a temperature difference that is statistically greater when photons are indistinguishable, aligning with quantum predictions about boson behavior.

Conclusion: This work confirms a long-standing theory about the interaction between thermodynamics, information, and quantum statistics and provides a novel method to validate boson-sampling platforms, potentially impacting quantum computing efforts.

Abstract: Maxwell's demon elucidates the value of information in thermodynamics, using measurement and feedback: he evolves an equilibrated gas into a nonequilibrium state, from which one might extract work. The demon can evolve the system farther from equilibrium, on average, if the particles obey Bose-Einstein statistics than if they are distinguishable. We experimentally support this decade-and-a-half-old prediction by comparing indistinguishable with distinguishable photons. We use a fully programmable linear-optics platform, whose local photon statistics were shown recently to behave thermally. Our demon nondestructively measures the number of photons in a subset of the modes. Guided by the outcome, he conditionally interchanges the measured and unmeasured modes. This interchange creates a positive temperature difference between a mode in a particular subset and a mode in the other. The temperature difference is greater, on average, if the photons are indistinguishable. This result bolsters a long-standing prediction about the interplay among thermodynamics, information, and quantum particle statistics. Additionally, this work suggests a thermodynamic means of weakly validating boson-sampling platforms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Scalable quantum computers and quantum networks require the combination of quantum processing nodes with efficient light-matter interfaces to distribute quantum information in local or long-distance quantum networks. Neutral-atom arrays have both been coupled to Rydberg states to enable high-fidelity quantum gates in universal processing architectures, and to optical cavities to realize interfaces to photons. However, combining these two capabilities and coupling atom arrays to highly excited Rydberg states in the mode of an optical cavity has been an outstanding challenge. Here we present a novel cavity-coupled Rydberg array that achieves this long-standing goal. We prepare, detect, and control individual atoms in a scalable optical tweezer array, couple them strongly to the optical mode of a high-finesse optical cavity and excite them in a controlled way to Rydberg states. We show that strong coupling to an optical cavity - demonstrated via the dispersive shift of the resonance of the cavity in presence of the atoms - and strong Rydberg interactions - demonstrated via the collective enhancement of Rydberg coupling in the atomic array - can be achieved in our setup at the same spatial location. Our presented experimental platform opens the path to several new directions, including the realization of quantum network nodes, quantum simulation of long-range interacting, open quantum systems and photonic-state engineering leveraging high-fidelity Rydberg control.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Krylov diagnostics can identify the nature of low-energy excitations in quantum many-body systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems is important for various applications, including quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Method: Lanczos algorithms are used to quantify operator growth in quantum systems and diagnose properties such as quantum chaos.

Result: The study shows that Krylov staggering parameter correlates with the edge versus bulk character of the gap, providing a robust diagnostic tool for bulk-edge phase transitions.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of Krylov subspace methods in studying low-energy excitations and their localization properties in quantum systems.

Abstract: Krylov subspace methods quantify operator growth in quantum many-body systems through Lanczos coefficients that encode how operators spread under time evolution. While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce \emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of quantum nonreciprocity induced via a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in an otherwise achiral, waveguide quantum electrodynamics. Using the full quantum master equation and input-output formalism for two-level systems coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide and driven by a coherent field, we show that an engineered DMI enables strong nonreciprocity in an otherwise reciprocal system, with tunable behavior governed by driving strength, detunings, and phase of the DMI. Using it not only demonstrates nonreciprocal transmission but also demonstrates nonreciprocal quantum entanglement and photon bunching. The system can end up in a pure state as certain decohering channels do not participate. The pure state leads to power-independent perfect transparency. Conditions are derived and depend on the propagation phase, the relative detuning of the two qubits, and the exchange interaction. At these pure-state points, the steady-state entanglement is reciprocal and admits a closed-form expression; away from them, phase control generates strong entanglement nonreciprocity. The DMI also reshapes photon statistics, redistributing two-photon correlations and shifting superbunching from transmission (no DMI) to reflection at finite DMI. These results establish DMI as a versatile resource for engineering nonreciprocity, transparency, entanglement, and photon correlations in waveguide QED, enabling isolators, routers, and superbunching light sources without requiring chiral waveguides.

Abstract: Operating matter-wave interferometers as quantum detectors for fundamental physics or inertial sensors in real-world applications with unprecedented accuracies relies on noise rejection, often implemented by correlating two sensors. Such sensors can be spatially separated (gradiometry or gravitational-wave detection) or consist of different internal states (magnetometry or quantum clock interferometry), in which case a signal-amplitude modulation may serve as a signature of a differential phase. In this work, we introduce Phase Estimation from Amplitude Collapse (PEAC) by applying targeted fitting methods for different magnetically sensitive substates of an atom interferometer. We demonstrate that PEAC provides higher trueness (up to 80% bias reduction) than standard tools for perfectly correlated signals. At its working point near, but not exactly at phase settings resulting in vanishing amplitude, it achieves precision competitive with standard methods, contrasting prior claims of optimal operation at vanishing amplitude. PEAC presents a generally applicable complementary evaluation method for correlated interferometers without phase stability, increasing the overall accuracy and enabling applications beyond atom interferometry.

Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) remains computationally challenging due to its NP-complete nature despite its central role in scheduling, logistics, and design optimization. We introduce a fully quantum Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for ILP that implements a coherent random walk over the discrete feasible region using only reversible quantum circuits, without quantum-RAM assumptions or classical pre/post-processing. Each walk step is a unitary update that prepares coherent candidate moves, evaluates the objective and constraints reversibly -- including a constraint-satisfaction counter to enforce feasibility -- and encodes Metropolis acceptance amplitudes via a low-overhead linearized rule. At the logical level, the construction uses $\mathcal{O}(n\log_2 N)$ qubits to represent $n$ integer variables over the interval $[-N,\,N-1]$, and the Toffoli-equivalent cost per Metropolis step grows linearly with the total logical qubit count. Using explicit ripple-carry adder constructions, we support linear objectives and mixed equality/inequality constraints. Numerical circuit-level simulations on a broad ensemble of randomly generated instances validate the predicted linear resource scaling and exhibit progressive thermalization toward low-cost feasible solutions under the annealing schedule. Overall, the method provides a coherent, resource-characterized baseline for fully quantum constraint programming and a foundation for incorporating additional quantum speedups in combinatorial optimization.

### [17] [The necessary and sufficient condition for perfect teleportation and superdense coding and all the suitable states for teleportation and superdense coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11293)
*Dafa Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the LU invariance of several quantum information protocols, including perfect teleportation (PTP), superdense coding with two bits (PSDC-2) and two qubits (PSDC-3), as well as the teleportation protocol proposed by Nielsen. It finds that PTP and PSDC-2 are LU-invariant, while PSDC-3 is not. A necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be suitable for each protocol is provided, and the paper demonstrates that PTP and PSDC-2 require only 1 ebit of shared entanglement, in contrast to earlier findings that suggested the need for genuine entanglement. Furthermore, it is shown that any state in the SLOCC class W is unsuitable for PSDC-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the LU invariance of quantum protocols is essential in quantum information theory, particularly in designing tasks that can be reliably performed using equivalent quantum states without needing to distinguish between them.

Method: The authors analyze the properties of various quantum states and protocols by examining their behavior under local unitary (LU) transformations. They derive conditions under which a protocol remains invariant under such transformations and explore the implications of these conditions.

Result: PTP and PSDC-2 are LU-invariant, whereas PSDC-3 is not. PTP and PSDC-2 require only 1 ebit of shared entanglement, and the authors identify all genuine entangled and separable states suitable for these protocols. Additionally, it is established that no state in the SLOCC class W is suitable for PSDC-3.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding of LU invariance in quantum information tasks, revealing that PTP and PSDC-2 do not require genuine entanglement and that PSDC-3 has distinct behavior under LU transformations, which may prompt further explorations into related SLOCC classes.

Abstract: It is known that two local unitaries (LU) equivalent states possess the same amount of entanglement and can be used to perform the same tasks in quantum information theory (QIT). For a protocol for a task in QIT, we call a protocol LU invariant if two LU-equivalent states are either both suitable for the protocol or neither is. So far, no one has discussed whether a protocol for a task in QIT is LU invariant. In [Phys. Rev. A, 74, 062320 (2006)], Agrawal and Pati proposed the perfect teleportation protocol (PTP) and the protocol for superdense coding to transmit 2-bit classical information by sending one qubit (PSDC-2) and 3-bit classical information by sending two qubits (PSDC-3). In this paper, we show that PTP and PSDC-2 are LU invariant. That is, two LU equivalent states are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 or neither of them is. We show that PSDC-3 is not LU invariant. We also indicate that the teleportation proposed in <cite>Nielsen</cite> is not LU invariant. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be suitable for PTP, PSDC-2, and PSDC-3, respectively. Via the LU invariance of PTP and PSDC-2, we prove that a state is suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 if and only if it has 1 ebit of shared entanglement, respectively and find all genuine entangled states and separable states which are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2, respectively. So far, no one has indicated that PTP and PSDC-2 do not require genuine entanglement. Agrawal and Pati suggested to study if there are subclasses of W SLOCC class which are suitable for PSDC-3. So far, it still remains an unsolved question. We show that any state of the SLOCC class W is not suitable for PSDC-3.

Result: 证明了不许信息传递可以作为测试独立性假设的工具，并对其进行了具体应用。

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解量子力学的独立性问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Besides well-known conditions of locality or factorisability, deriving the Bell inequalities requires assuming that the distribution of hidden variables and Alice's and Bob's measurement settings be independent of each other. We show that (analogously to violations of locality due to action at a distance) certain violations of this Measurement Independence assumption can be associated with a notion of signalling in principle, thus making them also testable in principle, and spell out the appropriate conditions. Accordingly, we show that by imposing no-signalling one can prove a version of Bell's theorem that does not require the assumption of Measurement Independence. We discuss the "Schulman model" as an example, as well as lessons for "experimental metaphysics".

Conclusion: 该方案通过合理利用所有轴向振动模式，显著提高了 trapped-ion 器件中大字符串量子位之间的相互作用效率和操作精度。

Abstract: Entangling interactions between distant qubits can be mediated via an additional degree of freedom. In conventional trapped-ion schemes, realizing a well-defined, coherent gate typically requires spectrally addressing a specific bus mode. As the ion number increases, the coupling to each individual motional mode becomes weaker, so gates on large ion strings mediated by a single mode are necessarily slow. Moreover, addressing a large number of modes demands complex driving schemes, and the fundamentally perturbative character of these approaches imposes constraints on achievable gate speed and fidelity.
  Here, we introduce a scheme for entangling trapped-ion qubits using a time-dependent magnetic-field gradient, in which all axial motional modes participate in mediating the interaction and the gate construction is nonperturbative. The framework can be used to implement both multi-qubit gates and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs in a linear ion string. Through several explicit examples, we highlight the advantages over existing magnetic-gradient schemes and show how gates on multiple ion pairs can be carried out simultaneously.

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has been developed to target near term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers as a method to find the eigenvalues of Hamiltonians. Unlike fully quantum algorithms such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), VQE based methods are hybrid algorithms that utilize both quantum and classical hardware to combat issues with the near term quantum hardware such as small numbers of available qubits and the decoherence of qubits. Different adaptations (flavors) of VQE have been implemented to combat these scalability issues on NISQ devices compared to standard VQE. These different flavors are modifications of the underlying VQE ansatz to reduce the computational workload on the quantum hardware. In this review we focus on 3 main areas related to VQE. The first focus is on flavors of VQE that fall under the categories of circuit complexity reduction, chemistry inspired ansatz, and extensions of VQE to excited states. The remaining portion of the review focuses on benchmarking the accuracy of VQE methods and an overview of the current state of quantum simulators.

Coherent states satisfying all Klauder's criteria are explicitly constructed, and their physical properties including normalization, continuity, resolution of the identity, temporal stability, and action identity are rigorously proven.

Abstract: Integrated photonics provides a powerful approach for developing compact, stable and scalable architectures for the generation, manipulation and detection of quantum states of light. To this end, several material platforms are being developed in parallel, each providing its specific assets, and hybridization techniques to combine their strengths are now possible. This review focuses on AlGaAs, a III-V semiconductor platform combining a mature fabrication technology, direct band-gap compliant with electrical injection, low-loss operation, large electro-optic effect, and compatibility with superconducting detectors for on-chip detection. We detail recent implementations of room-temperature sources of quantum light based on the high second- and third-order optical nonlinearities of the material, as well as photonic circuits embedding various functionalities ranging from polarizing beamsplitters to Mach-Zehnder interferometers, modulators and tunable filters. We then present several realizations of quantum state engineering enabled by these recent advances and discuss open perspectives and remaining challenges in the field of integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs.

Abstract: Superradiant biphoton emission from atomic ensembles provides a powerful route to generating highly correlated quantum light, yet its microscopic physical origin has remained incompletely understood. In particular, it is often unclear how collective enhancement, spontaneous emission, and vacuum fluctuations jointly give rise to both paired biphoton generation and unavoidable unpaired background within a single, self-consistent framework. Here we present a fully quantum microscopic theory within a unified Heisenberg--Langevin--Maxwell framework that explicitly incorporates dissipation and quantum noise, thereby revealing the microscopic origin of superradiant biphoton emission in atomic ensembles. The theory provides a consistent description of parametric gain and unpaired noise within the same open-quantum-system framework and applies to both Doppler-free cold atomic ensembles and Doppler-broadened warm vapors. In the high-optical-depth regime, the coupled propagation equations admit analytical solutions, under which the biphoton dynamics rigorously reduce to an effective collective two-level emission process. Within this limit, the biphoton correlation time and spectral properties are shown to obey closed-form scaling relations governed by optical depth and excited-state decoherence. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of superradiant biphoton generation and clarify the fundamental role of vacuum fluctuations and dissipation in setting the brightness, pairing efficiency, and temporal structure of atomic biphoton sources, with direct relevance to quantum networking and atomic quantum interfaces.

Abstract: The realisation of utility-scale quantum computing inextricably depends on the design of practical, low-overhead fault-tolerant architectures. We introduce the \textit{Pinnacle Architecture}, which uses quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes to allow for universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation with a spacetime overhead significantly smaller than that of any competing architecture. With this architecture, we show that 2048-bit RSA integers can be factored with less than one hundred thousand physical qubits, given a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, code cycle time of $1$ \textmu s and a reaction time of $10$ \textmu s. We thereby demonstrate the feasibility of utility-scale quantum computing with an order of magnitude fewer physical qubits than has previously been believed necessary.

Abstract: Materials defects in Josephson junctions (JJs), often referred to as two-level systems (TLS), couple to superconducting qubits and are a critical bottleneck for scalable quantum processors. Despite their importance, understanding the microscopic sources of TLS and how to mitigate them has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, correlated approach to trace the microstructural origins of strongly-coupled TLS in Josephson circuits. We assembled a massive dataset of TLS across 6,000 Al/AlOx/Al JJs and more than 600 atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. We statistically link fabrication, microstructure, and TLS occurrence, revealing a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Correspondingly, we find a two-thirds reduction in TLS prompted by a change in electrode fabrication parameters. These results demonstrate a robust, data-driven methodology to understand and control defects in quantum circuits and pave the way for significantly reducing TLS density.

Abstract: We experimentally studied the switching off processes in the double-resonator coupler superconducting quantum circuit.In both frequency and time-domain, we observed the variation of qubit-qubit effective coupling by tuning qubits'frequencies. According to the measurement results, by just shifting qubits' frequencies smaller than 50 MHz, the effective qubit-qubit coupling strength can be tuned from switching off point to two qubit gate point (effective coupling larger than 5 MHz) in double-resonator superconducting quantum circuit. The double-resonator coupler superconducting quantum circuit has the advantage of simple fabrications, introducing less flux noises, reducing occupancy of dilution refrigerator cables, which might supply a promising platform for future large-scale superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Quantum Byzantine Agreement (QBA), a cornerstone of quantum blockchain, offers inherent advantages in security and fault tolerance over classical protocols, guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. However, existing multiparty QBA protocols face challenges for large-scale deployment due to exponential communication complexity or reliance on complex multi-particle entanglement. To address this, we propose a multiparty circular QBA protocol that adopts a semi-decentralized architecture, leveraging circular message gathering and quantum digital signatures to achieve quadratic communication complexity and enhanced fault tolerance. Our protocol is experimentally feasible, requiring only weak coherent states, and is compatible with existing star-shaped quantum networks. Simulations conducted on a global satellite-to-ground network demonstrate that the protocol sustains high consensus rates among multiple users, even when employing different key generation protocols under realistic conditions. This work presents a scalable framework for large-scale QBA networks, establishing the foundation for a practical quantum blockchain that enables secure and fault-tolerant decentralized services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum gravity is a major goal in theoretical physics, especially since general relativity and quantum mechanics are yet to fully align.

Method: Superposed states of a gravitational source are generated, and interference leads to a repulsive force on the probe particle. The Heisenberg picture and weak values are used in the analysis.

Result: The experiment shows a successful generation of a repulsive gravitational force through quantum interference of two distinct gravitational states.

Conclusion: This experiment provides evidence of quantum effects in gravitational interactions, pointing toward a potential path for quantum gravity research.)

Abstract: We show that a single spatially superposed 'source' mass acting on a 'probe' matter wavepacket can reveal the quantum nature of the gravitational field. For this we use a specific state preparation and measurement of the superposed source mass, including a postselection, which altogether results in a repulsive gravitational force on the probe particle. A classical gravitational field can never lead to repulsion, as the effect requires quantum interference of two distinct states of gravity. We also present a calculation in the Heisenberg picture under the formalism of weak values that illustrates how repulsion is achieved. Finally, we estimate the range of parameters (masses and the spatio-temporal extent of interference) for which the experiment is feasible.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce constructions for non-Abelian qLDPC codes obtained by gauging transversal Clifford gates using measurement and feedback. In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincaré duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian Clifford stabilizer code, whose stabilizers are reminiscent of the action of a Type-III twisted quantum double. Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate. For both constructions, the resulting gauged codes are shown to have properties analogous to 2D non-Abelian topological order -- e.g. the analog of a single anyon on a torus. We conclude by demonstrating that our gauging procedures enable magic state preparation via the measurement of logical Clifford gates. Consequently, our gauging constructions offer a protocol for performing non-Clifford operations on any qLDPC code.

### [30] [The Power of Two Bases: Robust and copy-optimal certification of nearly all quantum states with few-qubit measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11616)
*Andrea Coladangelo,Jerry Li,Joseph Slote,Ellen Wu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents robust quantum state certification protocols using simple single-qubit measurements, which are inapplicable for large-scale quantum systems due to limited robustness. Two protocols are introduced: the first achieves constant robustness with additional qubit measurements, while the second offers near-constant robustness using only single-qubit measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale quantum systems and their applications require efficient and reliable state certification methods. While previous approaches using single-qubit measurements are insufficient for robustness in large systems, this paper addresses this gap by introducing improved certification protocols.

Method: The authors propose two quantum state certification protocols. The first protocol involves using a single qubit measurement along with additional qubit measurements, while the second relies solely on single-qubit measurements in the Z or X basis.

Result: The first protocol achieves constant robustness, meaning it can reliably certify states within a constant error margin regardless of system size. The second protocol offers near-constant robustness, achieving an error margin decreasing as 1/log n. The protocols are based on a new uncertainty principle for conditional fidelities.

Conclusion: These contributions provide novel, efficient quantum state certification methods that enable scalability for large-scale quantum systems, marking a significant advancement in practical quantum information science applications.

Abstract: A central task in quantum information science is state certification: testing whether an unknown state is $ε_1$-close to a fixed target state, or $ε_2$-far. Recent work has shown that surprisingly simple measurement protocols--comprising only single-qubit measurements--suffice to certify arbitrary $n$-qubit states [Huang, Preskill, Soleimanifar '25; Gupta, He, O'Donnell '25]. However, these certification protocols are not robust: rather than allowing constant $ε_1$, they can only positively certify states within $ε_1=O(1/n)$ trace distance of the target. In many experimental settings, the appropriate error tolerance is constant as the system size grows, so this lack of robustness renders existing tests inapplicable at scale, no matter how many times the test is repeated.
  Here we present robust certification protocols based on few-qubit measurements that apply to all but a $O(2^{-n})$-fraction of pure target states. Our first protocol achieves constant robustness, i.e. $ε_1=Θ(1)$, using a single $O(\log n)$-qubit measurement along with single-qubit measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the other qubits. As a corollary of its robustness, this protocol also achieves constant (in $n$) copy complexity, which is optimal. Our second protocol uses exclusively single-qubit measurements and is nearly robust: $ε_1=Ω(1/\log n)$. Our tests are based on a new uncertainty principle for conditional fidelities, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Distributed architectures are gaining prominence in quantum machine learning as a means to overcome hardware limitations and enable scalable quantum information processing. In this context, we analyze the design and performance of distributed Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) architectures for learning functions of quantum states directly from data, restricting measurements to easily implementable projective measurements in the computational basis. The aim is to determine which schemes can effectively recover specific properties of input quantum states, including both linear and nonlinear features, while also quantifying the resource requirements in terms of measurements and reservoir dimensionality. We compare standard three-layer QELM with a spatially multiplexed architecture composed of multiple independent three-layer units for linear (quantum) tasks, showing a linear reduction in resource requirements per unit. For nonlinear properties, the study examines the multiple-injection architecture and introduces a novel distributed design that incorporates entanglement between subsystems within a spatially multiplexed framework, evaluating its performance through the reconstruction of complex nonlinear quantities such as polynomial targets, Rényi entropy, and entanglement measures. Our results demonstrate that the distributed design enables the reconstruction of higher-order nonlinearities by increasing the number of interacting subsystems with reduced resources, rather than increasing the size of an individual reservoir, providing a scalable and hardware-efficient route to quantum property learning.

Abstract: Space-based distribution of quantum entanglement will be essential for global quantum networking and secure communications. Modelling and analysis of the performance of satellite entanglement pair distribution is important for the architecture and design of constellations and space systems. Entanglement-based quantum key distribution, in the absence of quantum repeaters, is especially prone to finite key effects due to low coincident count rates compared to trusted node single-path links. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive study of finite-key effects in the context of direct dual downlink quantum key distribution taking into account the characteristics of the overpass geometries. We develop a high-fidelity model of pair distribution from a low Earth orbit satellite that captures orbital dynamics, elevation-dependent loss, background noise, and extraneous detector effects. We integrate this with a rigorous finite-key security framework for the BBM92 protocol to optimise secret key length across different overpass geometries, orbital altitudes, and optical ground station (OGS) separations. These results provide quantitative performance bounds and design guidelines for near-term SatQKD missions, enabling informed trade-offs between satellite payload complexity, ground infrastructure, and achievable secure key throughput.

### [33] [Single-shot GHZ characterization with connectivity-aware fanout constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11839)
*Giancarlo Gatti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We propose a method to convert CNOT blocks into fanout gates without ancilla qubits, achieving logarithmic depth for some architectures and using circuit depth for specific IBM quantum processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to efficiently implement quantum operations, such as fanout gates, is critical for many quantum algorithms. Reducing depth while avoiding ancilla qubits enhances practicality.

Method: The method involves transforming depth-$L$ CNOT blocks for $n$-qubit GHZ states into fanout gates with depth $2L-1$, applicable even without ancilla qubits. It incorporates known logarithmic-depth GHZ state preparation techniques and applies to various architectures, including IBM's fez.

Result: The proposed technique enables the construction of fanout gates with depth $2	ext{log}_2(n)-1$ and $O(n^{1/2})$ under heavy-hex restrictions, achieving a specific IBM quantum processor ($ibm_{fez}$) a 156-qubit fanout construction with depth 33. It also allows measuring complete sets of commuting observables from the $n$-body Pauli group in the same depth as the fanout construction.

Conclusion: This method optimizes the depth of fanout gates and related measurements in quantum computing architectures, particularly IBM's, providing a practical approach for efficient quantum circuit design without ancilla qubits.

Abstract: We propose a practical recipe to transform any depth-$L$ block of CNOTs that prepares $n$-qubit GHZ states into an $n$-qubit fanout gate (multitarget-CNOT) of depth $2L-1$, without the need for ancilla qubits. Considering known logarithmic-depth circuits to prepare GHZ-states, this allows us to construct an $n$-qubit fanout gate with depth $2\log_2(n)-1$, reproducing previous ancillaless constructions. We employ our recipe to construct $n$-qubit fanout gates under heavy-hex connectivity restrictions, obtaining a depth of $O(n^{1/2})$, again reproducing previous complexity theory constructions. Using this recipe on the \textit{ibm\_fez} architecture yields a $156$-qubit fanout construction with depth $33$. Additionally, we show how to employ these $n$-qubit fanout constructions to measure complete sets of commuting observables from the $n$-body Pauli group with the same depth, allowing for efficient single-shot characterization of any GHZ-like state in a given known basis, e.g. fully characterizing a single copy of a $156$-qubit GHZ state using circuit depth $33$ in $\textit{ibm\_fez}$ (its preparation requires an additional depth of $17$).

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种新型变点检测协议，显著扩展了量子变点检测的应用范围。

Abstract: We study sequential quantum changepoint detection in settings where the pre- and post-change regimes are specified through constraints on the expectation values of a finite set of observables. We consider an architecture with separate measurement and detection modules, and assume that the observables relevant to the detector are unknown to the measurement device. For this scenario, we introduce shadow-based sequential changepoint e-detection (eSCD), a novel protocol that combines a universal measurement strategy based on classical shadows with a nonparametric sequential test built on e-detectors. Classical shadows provide universality with respect to the detector's choice of observables, while the e-detector framework enables explicit control of the average run length (ARL) to false alarm. Under an ARL constraint, we establish finite-sample guarantees on the worst-case expected detection delay of eSCD. Numerical experiments validate the theory and demonstrate that eSCD achieves performance competitive with observable-specific measurement strategies, while retaining full measurement universality.

Abstract: High-dimensional quantum systems leverage an expanded Hilbert space to enhance resilience against decoherence and noise. However, standard quantum teleportation is fundamentally limited by the quadratic growth of measurement complexity and high classical communication overhead, requiring the resolution of $d^2$ Bell states and $2\log_2 d$ classical bits. In this study, we propose a resource-efficient high-dimensional coherence teleportation (REHDCT) protocol. By designing $d$ sets of specialized positive operator-valued measure (POVM) bases, our protocol achieves a 50\% reduction in classical communication by utilizing one of the $d$ designed POVM sets, which effectively scales the measurement complexity from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing initial phase engineering to align the target qudit with the measurement basis, theoretically perfect teleportation of quantum coherence can be achieved for arbitrary qudit states. A quantitative robustness analysis reveals that the protocol remains highly resilient to operational errors, maintaining an efficiency above 99.6\% even under a 0.1 rad phase deviation for $d=16$. Our analysis under various noise models (amplitude damping, phase flip, depolarizing, and dit-flip) confirms that high-dimensional systems exhibit an expanding quantum advantage window as dimensionality increases. Notably, under dit-flip noise, perfect coherence teleportation can be restored through the optimal selection of the POVM basis. These findings establish REHDCT as a practical, hardware-friendly framework for resource-efficient quantum communication in future high-dimensional networks.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of calibrating and benchmarking superconducting qubits by reducing the time required for conventional calibration methods through the use of a co-located FPGA-based workflow. This workflow streamlines pulse generation, data acquisition, analysis, and feed-forward, thereby minimizing CPU overhead. The authors implement sparse-sampling and on-FPGA inference techniques, including computationally efficient methods for estimating exponential and sine-like response functions, and on-FPGA implementations of Nelder-Mead optimization and golden-section search. These methods enable low-latency primitives for readout calibration, spectroscopy, pulse-amplitude calibration, coherence estimation, and benchmarking. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques by successfully estimating $T_1$ in 10 ms, optimizing readout parameters in 100 ms, optimizing pulse amplitudes in 1 ms, and performing Clifford randomized gate benchmarking in 107 ms on a flux-tunable superconducting transmon qubit. A closed-loop on-FPGA recalibration protocol is employed to continuously recalibrate for 6 hours, resulting in more than 74,000 consecutive recalibrations and gate errors that consistently outperform the baseline initial calibration. Correlation analysis indicates that recalibration suppresses coupling of gate error to control-parameter drift while preserving coherence-linked performance. The paper also explores uncertainty versus time-to-decision under sparse-sampling approaches to identify optimal parameter regimes for efficient estimation of qubit and pulse parameters.

The demonstrated techniques result in substantial improvements in the efficiency and performance of qubit calibration, with continuous recalibration enabling high-throughput operation. The success of these methods in maintaining gate performance despite control-parameter drift highlights their potential for robust and real-time qubit characterization in quantum computing architectures.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的快速发展，尤其是在化学和材料科学中的应用，准确估算量子系统的低态能谱变得至关重要。然而，现有的量子相位估计方法，如量子子空间对角化和量子Krylov算法，虽然在理论上具有优势，但由于高度敏感于噪声，特别是在嘈杂的数据环境中，其实际应用前景仍需进一步验证。

Method: 研究中提出了一种新的噪声处理方法，基于广义特征值问题的旋转变换和阈值处理。具体来说，通过应用保持特征向量不变的正交变换（旋转）到广义特征值问题上，并在旋转后进行阈值处理，从而减少了对噪声的敏感性。

Conclusion: 总的来说，研究提出了一种改进的噪声处理方法，显著提高了量子计算中解决广义特征值问题的能力。尽管当前的结果主要集中在量子子空间对角化中，但这一改进方案的潜在应用范围更加广泛，特别是在需要解决噪声强烈的广义特征值问题的领域。这为量子计算在化学和材料科学中的实际应用奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Quantum subspace diagonalization and quantum Krylov algorithms offer a feasible, pre- or early-fault tolerant alternative to quantum phase estimation for using quantum computers to estimate the low-lying spectra of quantum systems. However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum subspace diagonalization that has the potential to better control sensitivity to noise. Our approach leverages eigenvector-preserving transformations (rotations) of the generalized eigenvalue problem prior to thresholding. We study this effect in practical settings by applying this rotation thresholding scheme to an iterative quantum Krylov algorithm for several chemical systems, including the industry-relevant Fe(III)-NTA chelate complex. We develop a particular heuristic to select the rotation angle from noisy data and find for certain systems and noise regimes that the samples required to reach a target error for ground state estimation can be reduced by a factor of up to 100. Furthermore, with oracle access to the optimal transformation, more dramatic improvements are possible and we observe reductions in sample requirements by up to $10^4$, motivating the continued development of methods that can realize these improvements in practice. While we develop our approach in the context of quantum subspace diagonalization, the improved thresholding scheme we develop could be advantageous in any context where one must solve noisy, ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for preparing Matrix Product States (MPS) using a combination of heuristic and variational optimization methods, achieving good trade-offs between circuit depth, gate count, and fidelity for large-scale quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size of quantum systems requires exponentially more resources, so efficient state preparation methods like MPS are crucial. This paper addresses the challenge of balancing circuit complexity and accuracy.

Method: The framework combines heuristic circuits (staircase and brick wall disentanglers) with variational optimization. It also introduces entropy-based qubit reordering, entanglement-based techniques, and low-level optimizations to reduce circuit depth and gate count.

Result: The framework successfully prepares MPS for systems of 19–50 qubits with optimized trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth. The results show that brick wall circuits perform well in minimizing depth, while staircase-like circuits reduce gate count.

Conclusion: This framework provides a scalable and principled approach for MPS preparation, enabling near-term quantum applications with improved efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Preparing arbitrary quantum states requires exponential resources. Matrix Product States (MPS) admit more efficient constructions, particularly when accuracy is traded for circuit complexity. Existing approaches to MPS preparation mostly rely on heuristic circuits that are deterministic but quickly saturate in accuracy, or on variational optimization methods that reach high fidelities but scale poorly. This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits provide warm-start initializations for variational optimization, enabling high-fidelity state preparation for large systems. Target MPSs are either specified as physical quantum states or constructed from classical datasets via amplitude encoding, using step-by-step singular value decompositions or tensor cross interpolation. The framework incorporates entanglement-based qubit reordering, reformulated as a quadratic assignment problem, and low-level optimizations that reduce depths by up to 50% and CNOT counts by 33%. We evaluate the full pipeline on datasets of varying complexity across systems of 19-50 qubits and identify trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth. Optimized brick wall circuits typically achieve the lowest depths, while the optimized staircase-like circuits minimize gate counts. Overall, our results provide principled and scalable protocols for preparing MPSs as quantum circuits, supporting utility-scale applications on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: The quantum Cramér-Rao (QCR) bound sets the ultimate local precision limit for unbiased multiparameter estimation. Yet, unlike in the single-parameter case, its saturability is not generally guaranteed and is often assessed through commutativity-based conditions. Here, we resolve the logical hierarchy of these commutativity conditions for unitary parameter-encoding transformations. We identify strict gaps between them, uncover previously assumed but missing implications, and construct explicit counterexamples to characterize the boundaries between distinct classes. In particular, we show that commutativity of the parameter-encoding generators alone does not ensure the saturability of the QCR bound once realistic noise produces mixed probe states. Our results provide a systematic classification of saturability conditions in multiparameter quantum metrology and clarify fundamental precision limits in noisy distributed quantum sensing beyond idealized pure-state settings.

Abstract: Deterministic preparation of high-excitation Fock states is a central challenge in bosonic quantum information, with control complexity that generically explodes as the Hilbert space dimension grows. Here we introduce resonant subspace engineering (RSE), a protocol that analytically confines the infinite-dimensional bosonic dynamics to a two-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by an initial coherent state and the target state. State transfer then reduces to a geodesic rotation on a synthetic Bloch sphere, governed by resonance and phase-matching conditions we derive in closed form. For single Fock states, RSE achieves $O(n^{1/4})$ scaling in both evolution time and gate depth, showing a fundamental improvement over existing deterministic schemes. The construction generalizes to $K$-component superpositions via a $(K{+}1)$-dimensional invariant subspace with full $\mathrm{SU}(K{+}1)$ controllability, requiring only 3-5 iterations of operations for superpositions spanning photon numbers 70--100. RSE provides a scalable and analytically transparent framework for large-scale bosonic state engineering and gate synthesis across single- and multimode platforms.

Abstract: Analytical and algebraic geometry are valuable tools for dealing with problems involving analytical functions and polynomials. In what we connote as spatial quantum sensing the goal is, given an underlying field and a set of quantum sensors interrogating the field in a set of positions, to find an estimator for some property the field. This property can have multiple forms, be it distinguishing the source of a target signal, or evaluating the field (or a derivative thereof) in an arbitrary position. In this work we also link this problem to networks of quantum sensors, and the role and usefulness of entangling these sensors. We find that the estimators that come out as a solution to the problem are such that a non-local entangled strategy provides maximum precision. We start by working under the assumption of polynomial fields, which relates to the interpolation problem, and then generalize for any signal that is modeled via analytical functions, giving rise to any general least-squares estimator. We discuss the effects of the placement of the sensors in the estimation, namely, how to find well defined, construction error-free placements for the sensors. In the case of interpolation we provide concrete examples and proofs in a $m$-dimensional array of sensors, and discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for the more general cases. We provide clear examples of the possible use-cases and statements, and compare a non-local entangled strategy with the best local strategy for an interpolation problem, showing the benefit in terms of precision in a distributed sensing scenario. This is a key tool for a wide-range of problem in sensing problems, ranging from large-scale such as earth-sized experiments, to local-scale, such has biological experiments.

### [43] [Quantum-Coherent Thermodynamics: Leaf Typicality via Minimum-Variance Foliation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12212)
*Maurizio Fagotti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A thermodynamic framework is introduced where energy fluctuations retain quantum coherence by organizing states into minimum-variance leaves based on quantum Fisher information. A leaf-canonical ensemble is defined, recovering the Gibbs ensemble on a commuting leaf. Leaf typicality extends eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium, where observables depend only on the leaf and energy, with states evolving from optimal ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to develop a thermodynamic framework in quantum physics that accounts for quantum coherence in energy fluctuations, moving beyond classical equilibrium concepts by introducing minimum-variance leaves and the leaf typicality hypothesis.

Method: The paper employs concepts from quantum statistical mechanics, including the quantum Fisher information, to organize states into minimum-variance leaves. It then defines the leaf-canonical ensemble and formulates the leaf typicality hypothesis for extending eigenstate thermalization to non-equilibrium scenarios.

Result: The key result is a novel thermodynamic framework that incorporates genuinely quantum-coherent contributions to energy fluctuations. The leaf canonical ensemble is recovered in equilibrium, and the leaf typicality hypothesis provides a pathway for studying out-of-equilibrium thermalization through the lens of quantum coherent states organization.

Conclusion: This framework offers a new approach to understanding non-equilibrium thermalization in quantum systems by organizing states based on quantum Fisher information and defining a leaf-dependent canonical ensemble. The leaf typicality hypothesis suggests that local observables depend solely on the leaf and energy, providing a basis for extending eigenstate thermalization to beyond equilibrium states.

Abstract: Equilibrium statistical ensembles commute with the Hamiltonian and thus carry no coherence in the energy eigenbasis. We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into "minimum-variance leaves," defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by the quantum Fisher information. On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a "leaf typicality" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble.

Result: 结果显示，考虑测量后态可以显著提高Discrimination性能，在某些情况下甚至可以达到任意大的提升比例。

Conclusion: 在量子测量Discrimination中，后态信息的利用是一个被忽视但具有重大意义的研究方向。

Abstract: The standard approach to quantum measurement discrimination is to perform the given unknown measurement on a probe state, possibly entangled with an auxiliary system, and make a decision based on the measurement outcome obtained. In this work, we go beyond the standard aforementioned scenarios by consider not only the classical measurement outcome of a measurement, but also its the post-measurement quantum state. More specifically, instead of considering only the positive-operator valued measure (POVM) operators, we consider their associated Lüders' instrument associated with them. We prove that, when the post-measurement quantum states are available, the task of discriminating two qubit projective measurements is equivalent to discriminating two copies of quantum states associated to each projector pair, extending previous results known for the case where probe states are separable. Then, we proceed by showing that the advantage of considering post-measurement states in measurement discrimination can be large. We formalise this claim by presenting a family of pairs of measurements where the ratio between the discrimination bias of the measurement discrimination task with and without post-measurement states can be arbitrarily large. This shows that, while the post-measurement state was neglected in most of the previous literature, its use can significantly improve the performance of quantum measurement discrimination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Certifying quantum devices, especially those producing entangled states, is essential for ensuring their correct functioning and application in quantum computing and communication.

Method: The authors propose using discrete Fourier transforms to measure the indistinguishability of photons in linear optical systems, building on techniques for multi-photon state verification.

Result: They successfully implement and test this method, confirming high fidelity for multi-photon states used in quantum computing and metrology.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust and scalable way to verify quantum states crucial for quantum technologies.

Abstract: Certification is important to guarantee the correct functioning of quantum devices. A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum advantage demonstrations and for so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). This setting derives its computational power from the indistinguishability of the photons, i.e., their relative overlap. Therefore, standard fidelity witnesses developed for distinguishable particles (including qubits) do not apply directly, because they merely certify the closeness to some fixed target state. We introduce a measure of fidelity suitable for this setting and show several different ways to witness it, based on earlier proposals for measuring genuine multi-photon indistinguishability. We argue that a witness based upon the discrete Fourier transform is an optimal choice. We experimentally implement this witness and certify the fidelity of several multi-photon states.

The setup minimizes thermal load on the refrigerator and demonstrates scalability for hybrid quantum computing platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid quantum computing systems have potential to leverage the strengths of different qubit types, but face significant challenges in integration, particularly related to magnetic field sensitivity.

Method: The authors propose a cryogenic setup with two spatially and magnetically decoupled sample volumes inside a single dilution refrigerator. One volume hosts flux-tunable superconducting qubits, while the other contains a spin ensemble with a superconducting solenoid generating magnetic fields up to 50 mT. Multiple layers of shielding, including Cryophy and additional aluminum shields, are used to suppress magnetic crosstalk. The solenoid's thermal impact is minimized.

Result: The setup successfully suppresses magnetic crosstalk by more than eight orders of magnitude, ensuring qubit stability. The solenoid adds minimal thermal load to the refrigerator, and the scalable design enables low-loss integration of superconducting qubits and spin ensembles, marking progress toward scalable hybrid quantum computing platforms.

Conclusion: This work is a significant step toward achieving scalable hybrid quantum computing systems by addressing key integration challenges through advanced shielding and decoupling techniques.

Abstract: A hybrid quantum computing architecture combining quantum processors and quantum memory units allows for exploiting each component's unique properties to enhance the overall performance of the total system. However, superconducting qubits are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, while spin ensembles require finite fields for control, creating a major integration challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the first experimental setup that satisfies these constraints and provides verified qubit stability. Our cryogenic setup comprises two spatially and magnetically decoupled sample volumes inside a single dilution refrigerator: one hosting flux-tunable superconducting qubits and the other a spin ensemble equipped with a superconducting solenoid generating fields up to 50 mT. We show that several layers of Cryophy shielding and an additional superconducting aluminum shield suppress magnetic crosstalk by more than eight orders of magnitude, ensuring stability of the qubit's performance. Moreover, the operation of the solenoid adds minimal thermal load on the relevant stages of the dilution refrigerator. Our results enable scalable hybrid quantum architectures with low-loss integration, marking a key step toward scalable hybrid quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: We map the phase diagram of a two-mode atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate with Fano-Feshbach and coherent three-body recombination (cTBR) terms. The standard second order phase transition observed as the molecular energy is tuned through the Feshbach resonance, is replaced by a first order transition when cTBR becomes prominent, due to a double-well structure in the free energy landscape. This transition is associated with atom-molecule entanglement, bistability, and molecular metastability. Our results establish cTBR as a powerful knob for quantum state engineering and control of reaction dynamics in ultracold chemistry.

Abstract: In static lattice systems, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem enforces the pairing of Weyl points with opposite chiralities, which precludes the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in equilibrium. Periodic driving provides a viable route to circumvent this no-go constraint. Here, we propose a scheme to realize and control unpaired Weyl points using ultracold atoms in a three-dimensional (3D) optical Raman lattice under continuous periodic driving. By engineering distinct relative symmetries between the lattice and multiple Raman potentials, the configuration generates an effective 3D spin-orbit coupling and yields a tunable topological-insulator phase. Through adiabatic periodic modulation of this system, we show that eight Weyl points emerge in the quasienergy spectrum of the low-energy sector, whose net chirality can be precisely tuned. A nonzero total chirality directly corresponds to the formation of unpaired Weyl points. Furthermore, by implementing a synthetic magnetic field via laser-assisted tunneling in this setup, we demonstrate that the chirality imbalance drives a quantized charge current in the weak-field regime, providing a direct signature of the CME. We verify that the adiabatic condition of the driving protocol, as well as the proposed experimental preparation and detection techniques, are within reach of current ultracold-atom experiments. This work establishes a realistic and controllable platform for exploring chiral-anomaly physics and nonequilibrium topological phenomena linked to Weyl fermions.

Motivation:  collisions between cold polar molecules are of great importance in quantum physics and can be manipulated using laser techniques.

Method:  Theoretically investigated using coupled Schrödinger equations with a Hamiltonian based on laser-dressed states.

Result:  By adjusting detunings and intensities, significant control over collision dynamics is achieved.

Conclusion:  This work provides a foundational approach to control and optimize ultracold molecular collisions using optical means.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collisions between ultracold polar molecules in the presence of two lasers ensuring a Raman resonant transition on individual molecules to suppress photon scattering, taking the example of bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules. By varying laser detunings and intensities, we enable a repulsive long-range interaction potential between molecules. After solving a set of coupled Schrödinger equations with the Hamiltonian written in the basis of laser-dressed states of the molecule pair at infinite distance, we identify quasi-resonant conditions under which elastic collisions are favored over inelastic and reactive ones, by a factor of about 2, thus demonstrating a promising pathway for efficient two-photon optical shielding of ultracold molecular collisions. The results are analyzed in terms of scattering length of the colliding laser-dressed molecules, which exhibit prominent resonances assigned to the interaction of the entrance channel with other specific channels, consistent with the existence of a quasi-bound level of the long-range molecular pair induced by the lasers.

Abstract: The four-boson universality suggests the existence of the second excited tetramer state in a system of cold ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ atoms. It is not bound but could be seen as a resonance in the atom-trimer scattering. This process is rigorously calculated using the momentum-space transition operator framework with two realistic interatomic potentials. The $S$-wave phase shift and cross section show a resonant behavior below the excited trimer threshold, but there are sizable nonresonant contributions from $P$ and $D$ waves as well. The position and width of the resonant state is determined, and for the latter significant finite-range effects are found.

Conclusion: Matter-wave microscopy offers a powerful tool for studying exotic quantum states and their hidden properties.

Abstract: Quantum gas microscopes probe quantum many-body lattice states via projective measurements in the occupation basis, enabling access to various density and spin correlations. Phase information, however, cannot be directly obtained in these setups. Recent experiments went beyond this by measuring local current operators and local phase fluctuations. Here we propose how Fourier-space manipulation in a matter-wave microscope allows access to various long-range off-diagonal correlators in experimentally realistic settings, realizing a many-body phase microscope. We demonstrate in particular how the fermionic d-wave superconducting order parameter in arbitrary Hubbard-type models, the non-equal time Green's function yielding the spectral function, or the hidden order of composite bosons in a fractional Chern insulator can be directly measured. Our results show the great potential of matter-wave microscopy for accessing exotic correlators including phases and coherences and characterizing intriguing quantum many-body states.

Abstract: Modern experimental techniques can generate magnetic fields of the form H(t) = H0 z-hat + H1 [x-hat cos(ωt) + y-hat sin(ωt)], at frequencies within an order of magnitude of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) frequencies, ωn0 and ωe0, respectively, when acting on atoms or molecules. We derive simple closed-form expressions for the exact nuclear- and electronic-spin wave functions that enable controlled transitions between entangled states, allowing an atom or molecule to function as a quantum computer. These solutions also enable precise NMR or EPR measurements of nuclear moments in atoms and molecules. We present examples relevant to measurements of the nuclear moments of 14N, 7Li, and 133Cs. Because existing hyperfine measurements of the lowest three nuclear moments of 133Cs are mutually inconsistent, the proposed NMR/EPR experiments provide a route to measuring all seven of its nuclear moments with high precision.

Abstract: While Rydberg-Rydberg interactions are essential for quantum nonlinear optics and quantum information processing, their role in microwave and radio-frequency sensing remains poorly understood. Here we experimentally investigate Rydberg interaction-induced nonlinearity in cold-atom Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). In a three-level EIT system, increasing photon-photon interactions produces nonlinear spectral broadening accompanied by resonance shifts, while a microwave-dressed four-level system exhibits pronounced nonlinear broadening without detectable spectral shifts. Our three-level data can be explained by a conditional superatom model, whereas our four-level observations are surprisingly captured by a simple dephasing model. Comparisons with three representative models provide key insights to the role of many-body interactions in Rydberg EIT spectroscopy. Furthermore, our results clarify the conditions under which microwave field characterization can be performed in the nonlinear regime without introducing systematic bias. Our study advances both fundamental understanding of many-body physics and practical development of atomic sensors.

Abstract: We demonstrate a synthetic gauge phase in Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) using room-temperature rubidium vapor. By exploiting polarization selection rules in a ladder-type system involving ground, intermediate, and Rydberg states, multiple Zeeman sublevels form closed-loop transitions that acquire a gauge phase. We show that the relative polarization angle between the linearly polarized probe and coupling lasers directly controls this gauge phase, which modulates the EIT transmission and Rydberg state population, consequently controlling the linewidth of EIT due to Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions between atoms. Our approach provides a simple polarization-based method for realizing synthetic gauge physics and manipulating many-body interactions in atomic ensembles without requiring laser cooling and dipole traps.

Abstract: Molecular polaritons have drawn great interest in recent years as a possible avenue for providing optical control over chemical dynamics. A central challenge in the field is to identify physical phenomena that require a quantum rather than a classical treatment of electrodynamics. In this work, we use our recently developed mean-field quantum (mfq) and full-quantum (fq) real-time nuclear--electronic orbital (RT-NEO) time-dependent density functional theory methods to simulate polaritonic dynamics for a molecule under vibrational strong coupling when a quantized cavity mode is initialized in a Fock state rather than a coherent state. Our previous work showed that a coherent state initial condition for the cavity mode leads to polariton formation for both the mfq-RT-NEO and fq-RT-NEO methods. Herein, we show that the mfq-RT-NEO method, which does not allow light--matter entanglement, does not predict polariton formation for a Fock state initial condition. Similar to the mfq-RT-NEO method, the fq-RT-NEO method does not predict oscillations of the cavity mode coordinate and molecular dipole operator expectation values for a Fock state initial condition. However, the fq-RT-NEO method does predict oscillations of the expectation values of even powers of these operators as well as light--matter entanglement, implicating polariton formation with a Fock state initial condition. All these observations can be explained with model systems. These results suggest that using a quantized cavity mode initial condition that does not have a direct analogy to an initial condition in classical electrodynamics can lead to physical phenomena that can only be described by a quantum treatment of the cavity mode.

Motivation: The motivation behind this study is the long-standing goal in physical chemistry to achieve quantum-state-controlled reactivity, which has important implications for understanding and controlling reaction mechanisms at a fundamental level.

Method: The authors likely used computational chemistry methods to simulate the vibrational-state-dependent behavior of the ion-molecule reaction between O2+ and the two isomers of C3H4, analyzing the resulting branching ratios and product formation to demonstrate the effect of vibrational excitation.

Result: The results show that vibrational excitation of O2+ leads to the selective formation of a new product, C2O+, and changes in branching ratios, providing direct evidence for quantum-state control in the reactivity of molecular systems.

Conclusion: The findings advance the understanding of how vibrational states can influence reaction pathways and pave the way for controlling reactivity through quantum-state manipulation in future studies.

Abstract: Quantum-state-controlled reactivity is a long-standing goal in the field of physical chemistry. In this work, we explore the vibrational-state-dependent behavior of the ion-molecule reaction between O2+ in distinct vibrational states and two isomers of C3H4, allene (H2C3H2) and propyne (H3C3H). While most products are formed regardless of the vibrational state of O2+, the branching ratios are influenced by vibrational excitation, and a new product, C2O+, appears exclusively in the excited-state reactions. This selective formation of C2O+ demonstrates that vibrational excitation can effectively activate a reaction pathway, providing direct evidence of quantum-state control in reactivity. These results represent an important step towards the goal of quantum-state-controlled chemistry in molecular systems.

Abstract: High-throughput quantum-chemical calculations underpin modern molecular modelling, materials discovery, and machine-learning workflows, yet even semi-empirical methods become restrictive when many molecules must be evaluated. Here we report the first hardware-native realisation of semi-empirical electronic structure theory on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), implementing as a proof of principle Extended Hückel Theory (EHT) and non-self-consistent Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB0). Our design performs Hamiltonian construction and diagonalisation on the FPGA device through a streaming dataflow, enabling deterministic execution without host intervention. On a mid-range Artix-7 FPGA, the DFTB0 Hamiltonian generator delivers a throughput over fourfold higher than that of a contemporary server-class CPU. Improvements in eigensolver design, memory capacity, and extensions to nuclear gradients and excited states could further expand capability. Combined with the inherent energy efficiency of FPGA dataflow, this work opens a pathway towards sustainable, hardware-native acceleration of electronic-structure simulation and direct hardware implementations of a broad class of methods.

In this work, we introduce a simple regularization that removes this singularity and yields a well-behaved integrand that can be accurately evaluated on a uniform grid. The approach -- termed Regularized End-point Gradient (REG) TI -- is demonstrated on a model system and on predicting the relative stability of paracetamol polymorphs for which quasi-free methyl rotations lead to a near singularity in standard TI. We expect REG TI to simplify anharmonic free energy calculations for solids and to potentially enable their automation.

Abstract: In Fermilab's PIP-II machine protection system, beam loss signals from various detectors are digitized at 125 MS/s. Noise from both high-frequency sources and low-frequency 60 Hz AC power equipment can contaminate the data. To suppress noise across these ranges especially 60 Hz and its harmonics, which overlap with beam loss signal frequencies advanced digital processing beyond standard filtering is required. Several real-time functional blocks were simulated and tested on an FPGA: (1) a dual time-constant discharging integrator filter, (2) a de-ripple baseline extraction and storage block, and (3) a fast-recovery discharging integrator. The nonlinear IIR integrator filter removes high-frequency noise and feeds into the baseline extractor. Upon detecting abrupt beam loss, it switches to a longer time constant to prevent baseline distortion. The de-ripple block calculates a valid baseline by averaging over multiple 60 Hz periods, storing results in a 4096-word FPGA RAM. This baseline is subtracted from raw data before integration by the fast-recovery block, which resets quickly after use. All blocks achieved expected performance.

Abstract: Intrabeam scattering refers to the effects of the Coulomb interaction acting between pairs of charged particles within a bunch in an accelerator. One of the main consequences of intrabeam scattering is a change in the emittances of a bunch: in some circumstances (in particular, in hadron storage rings operating above transition), the transverse and longitudinal emittances may grow over time without limit. This may restrict the performance of machines for which maintaining low beam emittance is an important requirement. In this note, we describe some of the models used to analyse the effects of intrabeam scattering, and present in particular the Piwinski formulae for the emittance growth rates. We compare the predicted changes in emittance with measurements in a number of machines operating in different parameter regimes.

Abstract: Blinking and multiphoton emission in metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) limit their use as single-photon quantum emitters. Conventional models distinguish between trion-related A-type blinking and defect-assisted BC-type blinking, both expected to degrade single-photon purity in a dark state. Here, time-resolved spectroscopy on individual PQDs reveals a qualitatively different regime in which low emitting dark states exhibit higher single-photon purity than bright states. For those PQDs state-resolved $g^{(2)}(τ)$ analysis shows that the exciton photoluminescence quantum yield decreases by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the biexciton one is suppressed by a factor of $\sim 10$. This leads to a moderate improvement of single-photon purity with $g^{(2)}_0$ decreased from 0.155 to 0.120. In contrast, PQDs with fluorescence lifetime--intensity distribution patterns characteristic for A-type blinking, display the expected increase of $g^{(2)}_0$ in charged, trion-dominated states. To explain the observed improvement of single-photon purity of low-emitting dark states, we propose a self-trapped-exciton (STE) mechanism that selectively blocks biexciton formation by diverting hot excitons into long-lived, weakly emissive STE configurations. This STE-mediated blinking channel explains why certain low-emitting states improve, rather than degrade, single-photon purity and suggests a lattice-driven route to perovskite quantum emitters with intrinsically suppressed multiphoton events.

Abstract: We investigate the properties of trions in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) monolayers using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) adapted to two-dimensional systems. Excitons and trions in monolayer TMDCs with the chemical composition MX$_2$ in the 2H phase are studied systematically. We computed the associated exciton and trion binding energies. We find in addition to the known $J = 0$ trion the existence of a bound state with orbital angular momentum $J = 1$. The results for $J = 0$ are benchmarked against existing calculations from the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Furthermore, we analyze the trion internal structure and geometry through their probability density distributions, accounting for the effects of different material shows that GEM -- widely used in studies of strongly interacting few-body systems -- is well adapted to allow comprehensive and computationally efficient investigations of trions and potentially other weakly bound few-body states in layered materials. In addition, we systematically exploit the effect of strain and dieletric environment in the $J = 1$ trion predictions, illustrated for the MoS$_2$ monolayer example.

Abstract: Despite three decades of experimental study, optical gain in colloidal quantum dots still lacks a microscopic theory capable of explaining gain thresholds approaching one exciton per dot, their size dependence, or the anomalously small effective stimulated-emission cross sections observed across materials. Existing descriptions treat quantum dots as effective two-level systems comprised of an exciton and a biexciton, attributing gain thresholds to biexciton Auger recombination. This assumption is inconsistent with state-resolved optical pumping experiments and basic spectroscopic constraints. Here we present a microscopic theory of optical gain explicitly anchored in the Einstein relations governing absorption and stimulated emission. Within this framework, gain is determined by a spectral balance between stimulated emission from single excitons and excited-state absorption into biexcitonic manifolds, rather than by biexciton lifetimes. Using a spin-boson description of excitons coupled to a lattice bath, we show that gain thresholds and effective gain cross sections are controlled by the interplay of biexciton stabilization and exciton-lattice dressing. The theory unifies disparate materials by quantitatively explaining all longstanding gain phenomenology in CdSe quantum dots and predicts a continuous crossover to effective four-level, near-thresholdless gain in dynamically disordered lattices such as perovskite quantum dots.

Abstract: Thermodynamics coupled with quantum features on electron and hole dynamics in Dirac materials is quite interesting and crucial for real device applications. The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence. This study reveals information about the interaction potential-DOS relationship in the Dirac materials.

Abstract: Using mean-field theory, we determine the electronic phase diagram of undoped AB-stacked bilayer graphene in the presence of a transverse electric field. In addition to multiple competing electronic instabilities characterized by excitonic order parameters, our framework incorporates the long-range Coulomb energy associated with interlayer polarization. This long-range interaction plays a crucial role, as it significantly influences both the structure and the relative energies of the competing ordered states. We derive a set of self-consistency equations and solve them both numerically and analytically. Our findings reveal that, as the bias field is varied, the bilayer undergoes a cascade of first-order transitions between several ordered insulating phases for which order-parameter structures are explicitly identified. Some of these phases are characterized by two inequivalent single-particle gaps, whose magnitudes depend on the valley and spin quantum numbers. Field-driven transitions are accompanied by discontinuous and non-monotonic variations of the single-electron gap. We relate our results to Hartree-Fock numerical calculations and to experimental research, including observations of fractional metallic phases that emerge upon doping the bilayer system.

Abstract: Topological wave phenomena in continuous media are fundamentally challenged by unbounded spectra and the absence of a compact Brillouin zone, which obstruct conventional bulk--interface formulations. We develop a unified phase-space framework for screened magnetized plasma based on a pseudo-Hermitian formulation with a positive-definite metric, enabling a generalized Schrödinger description and a Weyl-symbol analysis of the bulk generator. We show that the bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry--Chern monopoles, including a higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge $+2$ that generically splits into two spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Weyl points under symmetry breaking. To characterize topology in this noncompact setting, we introduce a strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of the bulk spectrum, extending band Chern topology to continuum systems. This invariant governs the spectral flow of interface modes induced by spatial variations of the magnetic field and establishes a bulk--interface correspondence at the level of phase-space symbols. By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge. We further show that this correspondence persists under collisional damping, provided that a finite strip gap remains and no exceptional points enter it. Our results provide a systematic phase-space framework for topological wave transport in continuous media beyond compact-band and idealized Hermitian settings.

Abstract: We investigate the charge and spin transport in a non-Hermitian ring of electrons subject to an external Zeeman field. By introducing non-Hermiticity through anti-Hermitian hopping in the nearest neighbour bonds, we demonstrate that anti-Hermiticity, along with the applied Zeeman field significantly modify the energy spectrum and strongly influence transport properties. As a result, we obtain that when antiferromagnetic Zeeman field is considered, a finite charge current emerges in both the real and imaginary parts of the current, which are in contrast to the ferromagnetic case where only the imaginary current exist. On the other hand, in both cases, the spin current vanishes. Interestingly, we reveal an emergence and strong enhancement of spin currents under balanced spin population upon introducing quasiperiodicity in the presence of antiferromagnetic ordering. At the same time, the charge current also exhibits substantial enhancement due to quasiperiodic modulation. These results highlight non-Hermitian quantum rings as versatile platforms for unconventional spin-charge transport.

Abstract: The integration of topological insulators (TIs) with graphene offers a pathway to engineer hybrid quantum states, yet the impact of strain at the 2D limit remains a critical open question. Here, we investigate the structural properties of ultrathin (1 quintuple layer) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ grown on single-layer graphene and, motivated by the structural modulations observed at the TI surface, explore theoretically how such nanoscale corrugations may influence the electronic behavior of the system. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM), we observe a periodic rippling of the heterostructure with a wavelength of ~$\sim8.7$ nm. Energetic analysis reveals that these ripples are not intrinsic but are driven by strain from the substrate during cooling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that while the ideal flat heterostructure exhibits a hybridization gap of $\sim40$ meV, the ripple-induced structural modulation closes this gap, restoring a metallic state. This gapless phase is not a trivial metal. By combining an effective moiré ladder model with spin-resolved DFT, we find that the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling is redistributed across a dense manifold of minibands. The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting. Remarkably, while the flat system is effectively spinless in this ultrathin limit due to hybridization, the ripples actively restore the spin polarization. Our findings suggest that rippled TI/graphene heterostructures provide an interesting platform to develop spintronics, where geometric modulation unlocks dense helical states that are inaccessible in the pristine flat limit.

Abstract: A two-dimensional crystal melts via the proliferation and unbinding of topological defects, yet quantitatively predicting the melting temperature $T_m$ in real systems is challenging. Here we resolve this discrepancy in quantum Hall electron bubble phases by combining Corbino-geometry transport experiment in an ultraclean GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well for Landau levels 2 to 5 with Hartree--Fock elasticity and the full Kosterlitz--Thouless--Halperin--Nelson--Young melting criterion including the finite-temperature renormalization-group calculation. The theoretically obtained $T_m$ quantitatively captures the measured solid-liquid phase transition boundaries across all probed ranges, validating the bubble-crystal interpretation and establishing defect--mediated melting as a predictive framework for strongly interacting electronic solids. This agreement further supports using bulk transport to probe the energetics of topological defects and screening in quantum Hall physics, and the approach is readily extendable to other electronic crystals, including the generalized Wigner crystal in moiré Chern bands.

Abstract: Coherent control of two-level quantum systems is typically achieved using resonant driving fields, forming the basis for qubit operations. Here, we report a mechanism for inducing complete Rabi oscillations in monochromatically driven two-level quantum systems, when the drive frequency is much larger than the Larmor frequency of the qubit. This effect$\unicode{x2015}$Rabi oscillations induced by nonresonant geometric drive (RING)$\unicode{x2015}$requires that the control field is elliptical, enclosing a nonzero area per cycle. We illustrate the effect with numerical simulations, and provide an analytical understanding via a simple effective Hamiltonian obtained from Floquet theory and perturbation theory. We show that RING enables coherent oscillations without relying on resonant energy exchange, allows for high-pass noise filtering, provides access to non-Abelian phases in finite magnetic fields. We detail a realization in electrically driven spin-orbit qubits and argue that the RING mechanism enables amplification of the Rabi frequency using the same gate voltage amplitudes at higher drive frequencies. Our results broaden the landscape of quantum control techniques, by highlighting a pathway to achieving coherent oscillations under off-resonant driving conditions.

Abstract: We study the non-Hermitian topology of multi-terminal transport in a quantum spin-Hall device described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. We show that breaking time-reversal symmetry alone does not imply non-reciprocal transport or a non-Hermitian conductance matrix. Instead, non-Hermitian topology arises only when transport becomes directionally imbalanced. We identify two distinct mechanisms that generate such a response: spin-selective coupling at the contacts and an out-of-plane Zeeman field that unbalances the counter-propagating helical edge modes. We show, for unpolarized leads, that the spin polarization-dependent response to Zeeman fields, provides a transport-based probe of the intrinsic spin polarization of the helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-Hermitian skin effect is more sensitive than conductance elements to detect the spin polarization of the edge states. Our results clarify the conditions required for non-Hermitian topology in quantum spin-Hall transport and establish non-Hermitian skin effect as a diagnostic tool for spin-selective coupling and edge-state polarization.

TL;DR: Superconducting resonators with solid-state qubits can perform complex quantum operations, but achieving both strong coupling and low loss requires balancing qubit lifetime and coupling strength.

Motivation: The combination of solid-state qubits with superconducting resonators holds potential for scalable and high-speed quantum operations, making it a topic of growing interest in the quantum computing field.

Method: The authors analyze qubit-resonator interactions, considering factors like spin-charge admixture, qubit lifetimes, and photon loss. They employ theoretical models and demonstrate feasibility through experiments.

Result: The study shows that optimized operating points balance coupling strength, qubit stability, and readout fidelity. Additionally, they propose using squeezed fields to improve performance.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for optimizing qubit-resonator systems, with potential applications in various qubit platforms, enhancing scalability and stability of quantum architectures.

Abstract: Superconducting resonators coupled to solid-state qubits offer a scalable architecture for long-range entangling operations and fast, high-fidelity readout. Realizing this requires low photon-loss rates and qubits with tunable electric dipole moments that couple strongly to the resonator's electric field while maintaining long coherence times. For spin qubits, spin-photon coupling is typically achieved via spin-charge hybridization. However, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: a large spin-charge admixture enhances the coupling strength, which boosts readout and resonator-mediated gate speeds, but exposes the qubit to increased decoherence, thereby increasing the threshold required for strong coupling and limiting the time available for accurate state measurement. This makes it essential to identify optimal operating points for each qubit platform. We address this for the donor-based flip-flop qubit, whose microwave-controllable electron-nuclear spin states make it suitable for coupling to microwave resonators. We demonstrate that, by choosing intermediate tunnel couplings that balance strong interaction with long qubit lifetimes, high-fidelity readout and strong coupling are simultaneously achievable. We also map out the respective charge-photon couplings and photon-loss rates required. Furthermore, we show that experimental constraints on charge-photon coupling and photon loss can be mitigated using squeezed input fields. As similar trade-offs appear in quantum-dot-based qubits, our methods and insights extend naturally to these platforms, offering a potential route toward scalable architectures.

Result: The system shows that above-threshold currents make it deterministic, while sub-threshold currents maintain stochastic switching, offering a path for in-device learning.

Conclusion: Studying phase transitions in materials can provide insights for designing next-generation, memory-efficient devices.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling phase transitions is a fundamental part of physics and has been central to many technological revolutions, from steam engines to field-effect transistors. At present, there is strong interest in materials with strongly coupled structural and electronic phase transitions, which hold promise for energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a structural phase transition and controlling its plasticity naturally leads to built-in memory, a key feature for emulating neurons and synapses in neuromorphic technologies. Here, $\textit{operando}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is used to study the evolution of the nano-domain distribution at the micron-scale in neuromorphic devices made from the archetypal Mott insulator vanadium dioxide. It is found that after electrical switching, slow nano-domain reconfiguration occurs on timescales of thousands of seconds and that the domains undergo a jamming transition, offering control over switching stochasticity at the micron scale. More precisely, repetitive above-threshold currents plastically drive the system into a jammed/glassy state where switching becomes deterministic, while sub-threshold currents erase the short-term memory contained in the nano-domain distribution, recovering stochastic switching, thus offering a path for in-device learning. The results illustrate the importance of studying the nanoscale physics associated with phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, even for macroscopic devices, and offer guidance for future device operation schemes.

Abstract: Determining the Fermi surface (FS) volume in underdoped cuprates is crucial for understanding the nature of the strongly correlated pseudogap phase. Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping.

Abstract: We introduce stratified symmetry operators and stratified anomalies in quantum lattice systems as generalizations of onsite symmetry operators and onsite projective representations. A stratified symmetry operator is a symmetry operator that factorizes into mutually independent subsystem symmetry operators; its stratified anomaly is defined as the collection of anomalies associated with these subsystem operators. We develop a cellular chain complex formalism for stratified anomalies of internal symmetries and show that, in the presence of crystalline symmetries, they give rise to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) constraints. This includes LSM anomalies and SPT-LSM theorems. We apply this framework to modulated $G$ symmetries, which are symmetries whose total symmetry group is ${G_\mathrm{tot} = G \rtimes G_\mathrm{s}}$, with $G_\mathrm{s}$ the crystalline symmetry group. Notably, a nonzero stratified anomaly within a fundamental domain of $G_\mathrm{s}$ (e.g., a unit cell) does not always imply an LSM anomaly for modulated symmetries. Instead, the existence of an LSM anomaly also depends on how $G_\mathrm{s}$ acts on $G$. When $G_\mathrm{s}$ is the lattice translation group, we find an explicit criterion for when a stratified anomaly causes an LSM anomaly, and classify LSM anomalies using homology groups of $G_\mathrm{s}$-invariant cellular chains. We illustrate this through examples of exponential and dipole symmetries with stratified anomalies, both in ${(1+1)}$D and ${(2+1)}$D, and construct a stabilizer code model of a modulated SPT subject to an SPT-LSM theorem.

Abstract: Three-dimensional electron gases in strong magnetic fields host partially flat bands that disperse along the field direction yet exhibit Landau-level quantization in the transverse dimensions. Early work established that for spin-polarized electrons confined to the lowest Landau level band, repulsion triggers a charge density wave (CDW) in which electrons 'self-layer' into integer quantum Hall states, while attraction generates a non-Fermi liquid (rather than a superconductor). We revisit this problem with physically motivated deformations -- including generalized local interactions, higher Landau level bands, restoration of spin, and explicit breaking of spatial symmetries -- paying particular attention to the competition between CDWs and superconductivity. Our main findings are: (1) Generic local interactions can stabilize a nematic CDW in which integer quantum Hall layers spontaneously 'tilt', yielding unconventional Hall response. (2) We numerically establish that the non-Fermi liquid appears stable to perturbations that preserve effective dipole conservation symmetries that emerge within a Landau level band. (3) Upon explicitly breaking translation symmetry, attraction catalyzes a novel layered superconductor that hosts Weyl nodes, superconducts within each layer, and insulates transverse to the layers. These results expand the rich phenomenology of interacting bulk electrons in the high-field regime and potentially inform the design of field-resistant superconductivity in low-carrier-density materials.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the $T$-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we perform the state-of-the-art thermal tensor-network computation on the Shastry-Sutherland model under a magnetic field. Our simulation results suggest the existence of a symmetric intermediate phase with $T$-linear specific heat at low temperature, occupying a large parameter space and separating the plaquette-singlet phase and antiferromagnetic phase at low fields and other symmetry-breaking phases at high fields before the system is fully polarized. Such an unexpected novel state bears an astonishing similarity to the experimental findings in the material. It opens the door to further investigations of the possible liberation of deconfined magnetized Dirac spinons by the competing interactions in this highly frustrated quantum magnet model, and by the combined effects of magnetic field and pressure in the the associated Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.

Abstract: We have experimentally investigated the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of a prototype spin-frustrated one-dimensional spin-chain system, the famous Haldane-chain system, R2BaNiO5 (R = Nd, Gd, Er, Dy). The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively. Our study presents a pathway for tuning MCE switching and the MCE effect over large temperature regions in d-f coupled spin-frustrated and spin-chain oxide systems.

Abstract: Inspired by recent discovery of metallic $d$-wave altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O, we develop a self-consistent microscopic many-body calculation of density-wave order for an itinerant altermagnetic metal. We show that the strong $d$-wave spin-momentum locking inherent to the altermagnetic band structure reconstructs the Fermi surface into spin-selective quasi-1D open sheets. This unique topology of Fermi surface drives an instability toward spin-resolved electronic charge density waves (CDWs), in which the ordering wave vectors for spin-up and spin-down electrons condense along two mutually orthogonal directions, forming spin-resolved stripe phases. As a consequence, this results in pronounced gap openings near the Fermi surface, and the superposition of these spin-resolved stripe orders leads to a checkerboard CDW in the charge channel and an antiphase spin-density-wave modulation in the spin channel. Upon increasing temperature, the density-wave order melts at $T_c$ due to thermal phase fluctuation while the gap opening persists, giving rise to a robust pseudogap regime, which eventually closes at a higher temperature $T_g$. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce the key features observed in the spectroscopic measurements, offering a consistent and generic understanding of the reported phenomena in KV$_2$Se$_2$O and, more broadly, in metallic altermagnets with strong spin-momentum locking.

Abstract: Anomaly matching for continuous symmetries has been the primary tool for establishing symmetry enforced gaplessness - the phenomenon where global symmetry alone forces a quantum system to be gapless in the infrared. We introduce a new mechanism based on \textit{symmetry spans}: configurations in which a global symmetry $\mathcal{E}$ is simultaneously embedded into two larger symmetries, as $\mathcal{D}\hookleftarrow\mathcal{E}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{C}$. Any gapped phase with the full symmetry must, upon restriction to $\mathcal{E}$, arise as the restriction of both a gapped $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric phase and a gapped $\mathcal{D}$-symmetric phase. When no such compatible phase exists, gaplessness is enforced. This mechanism can operate with only discrete and non-anomalous continuous symmetries in the UV, both of which admit well-understood lattice realizations. We construct explicit symmetry spans enforcing gaplessness in 1+1 dimensions, exhibit their realization in conformal field theories, and provide lattice Hamiltonians with the relevant symmetry embeddings.

Abstract: We investigate the spectral statistics of an interacting fermionic system derived by projecting the Hubbard interaction onto the two lowest-energy, degenerate flat bands of the dice lattice subjected to a $π$-flux. Surprisingly, the distributions of level spacings and gap ratios correspond to distinct Gaussian ensembles, depending on the parity of the particle number. For an even number of particles, the spectra conform to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, as expected for a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian. In stark contrast, the odd-parity sector exhibits exact double degeneracy of all eigenstates even after resolving all known symmetries, and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble accurately describes the spacing distribution between these doublets. The simultaneous emergence of two different random-matrix ensembles within a single physical system constitutes an unprecedented finding, opening new avenues for both random matrix theory and flat-band physics.

Abstract: We report calorimetric, magnetic, and neutron scattering studies on an S = 5/2, nearly Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K2Mn(SeO3)2 with weak XXZ easy-axis anisotropy. Multiple magnetic phases are identified, including a non-collinear Y phase in zero field, a field-induced collinear m = 1/3 magnetization plateau, and a high-field V phase. In the Y phase, the magnetic excitation spectrum exhibits both single-magnon excitations and an extended high-energy continuum. Both features are well described by non-linear spin wave theory. In the field-induced phases, complex effects of the spectrum renormalization even for large S = 5/2 material are clearly detectable. These results underscore the essential role of magnon-magnon interactions in the dynamics of large-S Heisenberg spin systems on a triangular lattice.

Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.

TL;DR: This paper explores heavy-fermion metals as a model system for studying Kondo entanglement and quantum criticality using symmetry decomposed elastoresistance. The study reveals strain-dependent Kondo scattering fingerprints in YbRh2Si2 under uniaxial strain and magnetic fields, with the isotropic A1g elastoresistance displaying temperature-dependent behavior. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements indicate that elastoresistance probes the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of heavy-fermion metals and their potential for quantum criticality is a key motivation in condensed matter physics. This paper contributes by using elastoresistance as a tool to study Kondo scattering and related phenomena.

Method: The researchers employed symmetry decomposed elastoresistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along specific crystallographic directions in YbRh2Si2. They measured the responses in the A1g, B1g, and B2g symmetry channels and analyzed the data using scaling techniques and linear thermal expansion measurements.

Result: The study found that the isotropic A1g elastoresistance exhibits significant temperature-dependent behavior, with sign changes and approaches, suggesting insights into Kondo scattering effects. By combining elastoresistance data with linear thermal expansion measurements, the researchers revealed that the elastoresistance probes the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and indicates quantum criticality at low temperatures, specifically at 2 K.

Conclusion: This work provides a detailed understanding of strain-dependent Kondo scattering in heavy-fermion metals and demonstrates the effectiveness of elastoresistance as a diagnostic tool for studying quantum criticality in correlated electron systems.

Abstract: Heavy-fermion metals are prototype correlated electron systems for the study of Kondo entanglement and quantum criticality. We use the symmetry decomposed elastoresistance to uncover the fingerprints of strain-dependent Kondo scattering as function of temperature and magnetic field in the prototypical tetragonal Kondo lattice YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K.

Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagomé lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders.

Abstract: Odd-parity magnetism has attracted significant interest for its unconventional spin splitting. However, a concrete microscopic route for its realization remains elusive. In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we propose material candidates for the realization of our theory. Our results establish van der Waals heterostructures as a practical platform for non-relativistic spintronics with electric control of odd-parity spin textures.

Abstract: Volumetric lithography offers a path to scalable fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nanoscale architectures, yet existing approaches are limited by quasi-two-dimensional exposure physics or slow serial writing. We present a single-exposure volumetric fabrication strategy that enables creation of ultrahigh-aspect-ratio 3D structures with 6 um minimum features. An inverse-designed volumetric (holographic) phase mask generates an extended-depth-of-field intensity distribution inside a photoresist volume while preserving high transverse resolution, enabling uniform polymerization of the full volume in a single exposure. With exposure times of approximately 20 s, we fabricate lattices, Penrose tilings, and micromechanical elements with feature sizes down to 6 um over volumes up to 800 x 800 x 720 um^3, achieving aspect ratios exceeding 120:1. Quantitative analysis of capillary flow in hollow lattices demonstrates controlled fluid transport with an effective capillary transport coefficient of 176.3 um/(ms)^(1/2). In situ nanoindentation-based micro-compression reveals that the printed 3D hexagonal close-packed lattices exhibit a well-defined linear elastic regime with an effective Young's modulus of 5.7 GPa, followed by progressive buckling and densification characteristic of mechanically robust cellular architectures. Overlapping, tilted and multi-mask exposures further enable quasi-3D complex geometries with potential for reconfigurability. This approach establishes a new regime of high-throughput volumetric fabrication.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a switchable high-Q light absorber based on a reconfigurable metasurface enabled by a lowloss phase-change material (PCM). By leveraging the coupling between guided-mode resonance and Fabry-Perot modes, mediated by the phase-transition dynamics of the embedded PCM, the resonance Q factor can be actively tuned. This allows the system to switch from a perfect dark state, governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum, to a critically coupled resonance with a finite Q factor. Consequently, the metasurface exhibits perfect absorption in the amorphous state and a reflection-dominated response in the crystalline state.

Motivation: 随着微波信号越来越广泛地应用于通信和雷达等领域，如何提高测量系统的频宽和实时性成为关键挑战。

Method: 通过在光纤环路中添加色散补偿纤维，实现了较长的累积色散，进而降低了 chirp率的需求，解决了高频分辨率和采样率的问题。

Result: 该方法使得在固定分析频宽下，实现了 27.9 MHz 的高频分辨率。同时，固定采样率时，能够通过调节分析带宽，满足较小带宽下的脉冲采样需求。该技术还具有延伸分析带宽至 100 GHz 以上的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究突破了光分形系统在性能和硬件上的限制，为开发高分辨率、超宽频宽的微波实时测量系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Dispersion-based photonics-assisted microwave measurement systems provide immense potential for real-time analysis of wideband and dynamic signals. However, they face two critical challenges: a difficulty in achieving high frequency resolution over a wideband analysis bandwidth, and a reliance on large-bandwidth-and-high-sampling-rate oscilloscopes to capture the resulting ultra-narrow pulses. We introduce a dynamic dispersion accumulation technique to overcome these limitations. By circulating the optical signal in fiber loops containing a dispersion-compensating fiber, we achieve a high accumulated dispersion of -215700 ps/nm. This high dispersion relaxes the required chirp rate of the chirped optical signal, enabling two distinct advantages: When the analysis bandwidth is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a longer temporal period, yielding a record-high frequency resolution of 27.9 MHz; When the temporal period is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a smaller bandwidth, generating a wider pulse and thus relaxing pulse sampling requirements at the expense of analysis bandwidth. This sacrifice in analysis bandwidth can be compensated by a duty-cycle-enabling technique, which holds the potential to extend the analysis bandwidth beyond 100 GHz. This work breaks the performance and hardware limitations in dispersion-based systems, paving the way for high frequency resolution, wideband microwave measurement systems that are both real-time and cost-effective.

TL;DR: Ta_2O_5 integrated waveguides have enabled significant advances in supercontinuum generation, offering low pump energy and excellent bandwidth performance, making them ideal for precision spectroscopy and metrology applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of next-generation chip-scale systems for precision spectroscopy and metrology drives the need for improved supercontinuum generation techniques on integrated photonic platforms.

Method: The authors fabricated a low-loss Ta_2O_5 integrated waveguide using the Damascene process and achieved a two-octave-spanning spectrum with a peak power of 1.36 kW at a pump energy of 92.9 pJ, along with an ultrabroad axial resolution of micrometers and a sensitivity roll-off length of 3.1 mm.

Result: The Ta_2O_5 waveguide significantly outperforms comparable sources in terms of low energy consumption, large bandwidth, and excellent metrology capabilities.

Conclusion: Ta_2O_5-based integrated photonic platforms demonstrate remarkable potential for expanding the capabilities of photonic applications in precision sensing, imaging, and metrology.

Abstract: Supercontinuum generation (SCG) on integrated photonic platforms is a pivotal technology for developing next-generation chip-scale systems for precision spectroscopy and metrology. While significant progress has been made with silicon (Si) and silicon nitride ($Si_3N_4$) platforms, they are often constrained by two-photon absorption (TPA) or moderate nonlinear coefficients, necessitating a trade-off between energy efficiency and bandwidth. Tantalum pentoxide ($Ta_2O_5$), possessing both high nonlinearity and a wide bandgap, emerges as a promising candidate; however, current implementations remain challenged by high pump energy consumption. Here, we report a low-loss $Ta_2O_5$ integrated waveguide fabricated via the Damascene process. It enables the generation of a two-octave-spanning spectrum with a low pulse energy of only 92.9 pJ (60 fs, 1550 nm). Notably, the corresponding peak power is a mere 1.36 kW, which is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art comparable broadband sources. Furthermore, at the maximum pump energy, our spectrum exhibits an ultrabroad coverage from 450 nm to 3400 nm, spanning nearly three octaves. Supported by numerical simulations, we analyze the dynamics of soliton fission. Furthermore, a Michelson interferometry system developed using this source exhibits superior performance, achieving not only micrometer-scale axial resolution but also a 6 dB sensitivity roll-off length of 3.1 mm. This exceptional roll-off performance, combined with a displacement measurement sensitivity of 346 nm, underscores the immense potential of the $Ta_2O_5$ platform for applications in biomedical imaging and precision metrology.

Result: Closed-form expressions for parametric gain maxima were derived, analytically modeling interband coupling. An asymmetric design achieving compact 7 GHz spacing without mode competition was successfully demonstrated.

Conclusion: This research provides design principles for engineering nonlinear optical dynamics in coupled resonator systems, significantly advancing coherent photonic computing and quantum information processing technologies.

Abstract: Coupled resonators form band-like optical states that support rich nonlinearities beyond what is possible in single resonators. In these systems, four-wave mixing mediates interband coupling, displaying multimode dynamics that span both spatial and spectral degrees of freedom. In this study, we propose a framework describing the onset and control of hybridized optical parametric oscillation in three coupled silicon nitride microring resonators. In a symmetric configuration, we observe the emergence of diverse phase-matching pathways defined by the dispersive band structure. We develop an analytical model that captures the parametric gain of these interband processes and derive closed-form expressions for the dominant gain maxima; the analytical framework itself readily extends to more complex coupled networks. We further report an asymmetric design that co-engineers mode overlap and dispersion to operate on a compact 7-GHz spacing, free from mode competition. Our findings establish design principles for engineering nonlinear dynamics in coupled-resonator platforms, with implications for coherent photonic computing and quantum information processing.

Abstract: Photon pairs play a vital role in modern science, driving extensive research into their generation. Yet, the narrow phase-matching bandwidth of conventional crystals has largely confined studies to specific wavelengths, leaving research on broadband tunable sources underexplored. Here, we employ a non-critical phase-matched lithium niobate (LN) crystal to generate widely tunable photon pairs. The generated near-infrared (NIR) photon pairs exhibit a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR > 20 dB) and are tunable across the 800-1600 nm range. We further showcase the utility of NIR photon pairs in spectroscopy by detecting carbon monoxide (CO) gas absorption. This approach will facilitate the design of advanced LN-based photonic experiments.

Abstract: This work focuses on optical tunneling across thin three-layer planar structures embedded in a thick and transparent dielectric medium. First, compact transmittance expressions for different configurations are obtained using a generalized Fresnel coefficient method. These expressions are subsequently used to analyze various tunnelling outcomes. We show that two types of tunneling effects can be distinguished, depending on the kind of waves that are present in the core layer. When harmonic waves propagate in this layer, the transmittance formula and the phase condition for resonant tunneling are identical to that obtained in a Fabry-Perot etalon. However, in the case of evanescent or damped waves in the core layer, the new expression for transmittance provides another resonant condition related, this time, to the wave amplitude. For clarity, transparent materials are addressed first (including ideal metals), and the implications of absorption are studied later. Different angular-spectral maps are displayed to exemplify the main features of the tunneling effect in each analyzed configuration. To highlight, it is shown that tunnelling can occur in photonic systems with thicknesses up to several wavelengths.

TL;DR: A new method for unidirectional light emission using non-Hermitian wave physics in photonic crystals offers robust control over light emission directionality and switchability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise control over light emission directionality is crucial in fields like optical communications, laser technology, and photonic sensors. This research aims to develop a method for this control using non-Hermitian wave physics.

Method: The researchers propose using non-Hermitian hybridization of resonances in spatially separated layers of a hetero-bilayer photonic crystal. By engineering interlayer coupling, they create hybrid photon bands that exhibit strong unidirectional radiation while maintaining high quality factors. The directionality is determined by a topological vortex in a pseudo-polarization field, which results from the front/back intensity imbalance.

Result: The proposed method enables unidirectional light emission across a broad spectral and momentum range with robustness against perturbations. Additionally, by adjusting the surrounding refractive index, the emission direction can be switched, leading to a reconfigurable far-field response.

Conclusion: This research represents a significant advancement in non-Hermitian wave physics, offering new possibilities for topological photonic sensing, switchable light sources, and potentially unidirectional lasing mechanisms.

Abstract: Controlling how an open photonic system exchanges energy with its environment-and in particular how it radiates into the far field-is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian wave physics and a key enabler for directional photonic functionalities. Here, we propose a new route to robust unidirectional emission based on the non-Hermitian hybridization of resonances localized in spatially separated layers of a hetero-bilayer photonic crystal. By tailoring the interlayer coupling, we engineer hybrid photonc bands that exhibit strong unidirectional radiation across a broad spectral and momentum range while maintaining theoretically high quality factors. This asymmetric emission is organized by a topological vortex in a pseudo-polarization field defined from the front/back intensity imbalance, which endows the directionality with robustness against perturbations. We further show that, by tuning the surrounding refractive index, this singularity can be displaced in parameter space, enabling reversible switching of the emission direction and a reconfigurable far-field response. This framework opens perspectives for topological photonic sensing and for directional and switchable light sources, including unidirectional lasing supported by high-quality-factor modes.

*Michal Ziemczonok,Koen Vanmol*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses two major advancements in three-dimensional two-photon polymerization (TPP): design freedom and variable degree of conversion (DC). The authors present an open-source slicer and a calibration methodology for determining refractive index (RI) based on variable DC. Experimental results demonstrate accurate and repeatable RI measurements for grayscale lithography and bio-mimicking applications. The work aims to enhance TPP systems and workflows by enabling point-wise dose control and RI engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to overcome the limitations of achieving variable DC in TPP, which has been a challenge due to the lack of software support for fabrication and measurement techniques. The authors aim to provide a solution that facilitates more precise control over material properties, such as RI, enabling advanced structural designs and functionalities.

Method: The method involves the development of an open-source slicer for 3D printing with variable DC and a calibration methodology to determine RI for any DC value. The authors conducted experiments demonstrating the accuracy and stability of their approach in applications like grayscale lithography and bio-mimicking microphantoms.

Result: The results show that the calibration methodology achieves excellent repeatability, accuracy, and stability in measuring RI for various DC values. The experimental applications, such as grayscale printing and bio-mimicking structures, validate the effectiveness of variable-DC TPP in creating complex designs with precise control over material properties.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive toolbox for 3D RI engineering, opening new possibilities in TPP technology and enabling innovative inventions through point-wise dose control.

Abstract: In two-photon polymerization (TPP), the degree of conversion (DC) of the resin has an effect on a broad range of material properties like refractive index (RI) or stiffness. Heterogeneous DC can substitute material doping and multimaterial structures, and outright enable structure designs not possible otherwise. However, obtaining variable DC in the polymer, typically achieved by implementing a variable exposure dose, is held back due to the lack of software support for fabrication and measurement techniques for validation, adding up to a high barrier of entry.
  This work presents two major breakthroughs in (3+1)D TPP: design freedom and variable-DC fabrication, that are provided by an open-source slicer, as well as calibration methodology for determination of the RI for any DC. Application examples include grayscale lithography, control over writing direction and trajectories, as well as bio-mimicking microphantoms with carefully engineered 3D RI. Results of the RI calibration demonstrate excellent repeatability, accuracy and stability of variable-DC structures. Supported by in-depth metrological analysis, the goal is to popularize variable DC printing within TPP community and to get more out of the existing TPP systems and workflows. In summary, this work provides a complete toolbox for 3D RI engineering and sets the stage for new inventions enabled by point-wise dose control.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Coherent perfect tunneling in the presence of loss and asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge in wave transport, a universal problem across optics, acoustics, and quantum mechanics. Here we demonstrate coherent perfect tunneling at an exceptional point in a passive one-dimensional waveguide cascade with three coupled interfaces. Using a waveguide-invariant scattering framework, we show that the suppression of a selected output channel originates from a directional scattering degeneracy rather than from resonance or absorption collapse. This exceptional-point condition emerges when interference between boundary-induced feedback loops promotes a simple zero of the scattering response to a second-order degeneracy. As a direct consequence, fixed coherent excitation produces a robust quartic leakage law within a transparency-dominated tunneling window. These results establish directional degeneracy as a general mechanism for loss-tolerant tunneling enabled by exceptional points across a broad class of wave systems.

Abstract: In the present paper, we construct a theoretical description of a three-dimensional photonic topological insulator in the form of a simple cubic lattice of bianisotropic resonators that is based on a dyadic Green's function approach. By considering electric and magnetic dipole modes and the interactions between different numbers of the nearest resonators, we obtain the Bloch Hamiltonians and the corresponding tight-binding models and analyze the band diagrams, spatial structure of the eigenmodes, and their localization, revealing quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of high-symmetry points in the absence of bianisotropy and the emergence of in-gap states localized at a domain wall upon the introduction of bianisotropy. Finally, we visualize the Berry curvature distributions to study the topological properties of the considered models.

Conclusion: Fourier ViT代表了一种高效解决强相位和多领域相位重建问题的新方法，其优异的性能为相关领域的研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes rapidly difficult in the strong-phase regime, where a crystal contains distortions beyond half a lattice spacing. An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\pm π/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\mathrm{Ca}_x\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($χ^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $χ^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$χ^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline.

Abstract: The infra-red behaviour of gauge theories coupled to matter remains an open problem in quantum field theory. For a given gauge group, such theories are expected to flow to an interacting conformal fixed point over a range of fermion or scalar flavours, known as the `conformal window.' Their nature is important for understanding critical phases and phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm like the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), yet remains challenging for conventional non-perturbative approaches. In this work, we study a family of fuzzy-sphere models corresponding to non-linear sigma models with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry extended to the strongly-coupled region. These theories are expected have an infra-red fixed point described by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in three space-time dimensions with $N$ flavours of fermions. They can be viewed as a generalisation of the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ DQCP, corresponding to $N=2$. We investigate them using quantum Monte Carlo for $N$ up to $16$. We find evidence that for $N\geq4$ the phase diagram contains a critical phase that appears to be absent for $N=2$. Within this phase, we measure the two-point correlation function and the excitation spectrum, which exhibit emergent conformal symmetry. We also extract the scaling dimension $Δ_φ$ of a leading operator and find consistency with large-$N$ expectations.

Abstract: A covariant implementation of diffeomorphisms in the presence of local symmetries is a nontrivial aspect of gravitational theories. In Double Field Theory, this is achieved through the so-called generalized Kosmann derivative. In this work, we show that the generalized Kosmann derivative admits a natural formulation entirely in terms of generalized fluxes through the inclusion of a compensating term that plays the role of a generalized momentum map, yielding a fully determined and covariant operator that provides a covariant realization of generalized diffeomorphisms. When parameterized in terms of the field content of heterotic supergravity, the resulting symmetry transformations give rise to momentum maps at the supergravity level, offering a duality-covariant interpretation of these objects. This framework provides a natural setting for the construction of conserved currents and Noether charges in doubled geometry with internal symmetries, with direct implications for black hole thermodynamics and its higher-derivative corrections in a duality-covariant setting.

Motivation: the paper explores connections between integrable field theories, Chern-Simons theory, and the Yang-Baxter equation, which are important in theoretical physics and mathematical physics.

Method: we derive a novel integrable field theory by reducing 6d holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on twistor space, analyze its symmetry properties, and relate it to the Yang-Baxter sigma model through symmetry reduction and algebraic methods.

Result: the 4d integrable field theory has a semi-local symmetry linked to solutions of the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation, and it is connected to anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations and defects in Chern-Simons theory.

Conclusion: this work deepens our understanding of integrable field theories and their geometrical origins, providing new insights into the Yang-Baxter equation and its physical realizations.

Abstract: We derive a novel two-field four-dimensional integrable field theory (IFT) from 6d holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on twistor space. The four-dimensional IFT depends on a skew-symmetric linear operator acting on a Lie algebra, and when this operator is specialised to a solution of the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation, the IFT develops a semi-local symmetry associated with this solution. The resulting 4d analogue of the Yang-Baxter sigma model is related by symmetry reduction to the well-known 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model. An important implication that we find is the embedding of the equations of motion of the 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model in the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The 6d Chern-Simons theory on twistor space can alternatively be symmetry reduced to a 4d Chern-Simons theory configuration with disorder surface defects. The latter realises the Yang-Baxter sigma model, implying a "diamond" for the Yang-Baxter sigma model obtained from twistor space.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the Hayward-AdS black hole and compare it with its singular counterpart from which it can be constructed through the imposition of an additional constraint. The singular black hole displays a rich phase structure, including reentrant phase transitions reminiscent of those observed in higher-dimensional Kerr-AdS spacetimes. After the constraint is imposed, the resulting Hayward-AdS black hole continues to exhibit Van der Waals-type $P-V$ criticality. However, its Gibbs free energy profile differs qualitatively from that of standard RN-AdS black holes. In addition, we extend the analysis by employing thermodynamic topology to characterize the global structure of the phase space. We find that the topological charge of the singular black hole is $-1$, whereas that of the Hayward-AdS black hole becomes $+1$. This change of topological charge indicates that the constraint not only regularizes the geometry but also induces a qualitative transformation in the thermodynamic configuration space.

Abstract: We establish a holographic gravitational dual for the fundamental dynamical equations governing operator growth in Krylov subspace. Specifically, we show that the deep interior of the Krylov subspace maps directly to the near-horizon regime of AdS$_2$ gravity. We demonstrate that, in the continuum limit, the discrete evolution on the Krylov chain transforms into the dynamics of a continuous field, which is isomorphic to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field in the AdS$_2$ throat. This correspondence identifies the linear growth rate of Lanczos coefficients with the Hawking temperature, $α=πT$, thereby recovering the saturation of the maximal chaos bound. Notably, the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, a fundamental stability criterion in AdS gravity, emerges as a necessary consistency requirement for the dual description of Krylov subspace dynamics. Our results advance a Krylov-based holographic dictionary in a unified $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ representation, revealing that the emergent geometry of Krylov subspace is a reflection of the near-horizon AdS spacetime.

Abstract: We apply the localization method to the BFSS matrix model with a particular class of boundary conditions, that is related to a scattering problem of 11-dimensional M-theory. For the boundary condition that corresponds to the three-point amplitude of gravitons, we exactly compute the partition function of the model based on the localization method.

Abstract: In this essay and utilizing the holographic Renormalization Group (RG) flow, we demonstrate how the effective action of a non-gravitating quantum field theory in the ultraviolet (UV) develops an Einstein-Hilbert term in the infrared (IR). That is, gravity is induced by the RG flow. An inherent outcome of holography that plays a crucial role in our analysis is the \textit{RG flow of boundary conditions}: the rigid Dirichlet conditions on the background metric in the UV become an admixture of Dirichlet and Neumann as we flow to the IR, thereby ``unfreezing'' the metric and transforming it from a non-dynamical background into a dynamical field. This mechanism, which is a conceptually new addition to the standard Wilsonian RG flow, also provides the mechanism to evade the Weinberg-Witten no-go theorem. Within the GR from RG picture outlined here, the search for a quantum theory of gravity by treating the metric as a fundamental field may be a hunt for a phantom -- akin to seeking the atomic structure of water by quantizing the equations of hydrodynamics.

Abstract: Following the previously developed approach to the calculation of quantum corrections to the effective potential in arbitrary scalar field theories in the leading logarithmic approximation, we extended it to the next-to-leading order. Based on Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmerman renormalization procedure and the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk theorem, we construct recurrence relations and renormalization group equations that allow one to sum up the leading and subleading logarithms in all orders of perturbation theory. The formalism is applicable to an arbitrary scalar potential, renormalizable or not. To verify the results, we compare them with a renormalizable model treated within the standard renormalization group approach.

Motivation: Understands the role of symmetries and their constraints in RG flows, particularly focusing on additional structures like braiding and their impact on conformal dimensions.

Method: Mathematical analysis of symmetry categories, braiding, and their influence on conformal dimensions in RG flows.

Result: Established a half-integer condition for the sum of UV and IR conformal dimensions of symmetry objects undergoing RG flows.

Conclusion:  symmetry categories, especially with braiding, impose critical restrictions on the behavior of RG flows by dictating conditions on conformal dimensions, which is vital for comprehending the dynamics of phase transitions and critical phenomena in quantum field theories.

Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.

Abstract: Single-minus tree-level $n$-gluon scattering amplitudes are reconsidered. Often presumed to vanish, they are shown here to be nonvanishing for certain "half-collinear" configurations existing in Klein space or for complexified momenta. We derive a piecewise-constant closed-form expression for the decay of a single minus-helicity gluon into $n-1$ plus-helicity gluons as a function of their momenta. This formula nontrivially satisfies multiple consistency conditions including Weinberg's soft theorem.

Abstract: Holographic entanglement entropy is a key concept linking quantum information theory and gravity. Since the original conjecture of Ryu and Takayanagi, holographic entanglement entropy has been generalized beyond Einstein--Hilbert gravity to include higher-curvature corrections. In most existing generalizations, however, it is implicitly assumed that the bulk spacetime geometry is Riemannian, i.e. torsion-free. Here we propose a prescription for incorporating torsion into holographic entanglement entropy in the boundary theory dual to five-dimensional Chern--Simons gravity. We argue that the entanglement entropy acquires an additional universal divergent term proportional to the logarithm of the UV cutoff, and that this term is generated solely by torsion.

We argue that the presence of domains with negative energy density and violation of the energy conditions most likely do not lead to destabilization of solitons.

Abstract: Hecke operators acting on modular functions arise naturally in the context of 2d conformal field theory, but in seemingly disparate areas, including permutation orbifold theories, ensembles of code CFTs, and more recently in the context of the AdS$_3$/RMT$_2$ program. We use an equidistribution theorem for Hecke operators to show that in each of these large $N$ limits, an entire heavy sector of the partition function gets integrated out, leaving only contributions from Poincaré series of light states. This gives an immediate holographic interpretation as a sum over semiclassical handlebody geometries. We speculate on further physical interpretations for equidistribution, including a potential ergodicity statement.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we obtain analytical solutions for a $(3+1)$-dimensional black string and a BTZ black hole, both sourced by the Dekel-Zhao dark matter (DM) density profile. Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions.

Abstract: We numerically construct asymptotically extremal black holes through the nonlinear evolution of a charged scalar field. Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with "hair"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity.

Abstract: The novel proposal to invoke the split of the Ricci scalar into bulk and boundary terms in the gravitational action, opens up a new avenue of investigation into stellar dynamics. The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories. We find that the fixed curves were generally stable with nearby paths approaching the fixed curves.

Abstract: The uncertainty principle constitutes a fundamental pillar of quantum theory, representing one of the most distinctive features that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes.

Abstract: We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) as a diagnostic tool for probing frame-dragging effects and accretion disk physics in the spacetime of a rotating regular magnetic black hole (BH). Specifically, we analyze the precession of bound orbits and the epicyclic oscillations of test particles under small perturbations in the equatorial plane. We demonstrate how the BH nonminimal coupling parameter (lambda/M^4) and dimensionless magnetic charge (Q/M) significantly influence the three fundamental epicyclic frequencies. By applying the relativistic precession model and employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC), we constrain the BH characteristic parameters, including mass, spin, magnetic charge, and nonminimal coupling, using observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries: GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, and GRS 1915+105. Furthermore, we examine the Lense-Thirring, geodetic, and general spin precession frequencies of a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer around the black hole. Our theoretical results indicate that the regular charged black hole suppresses these precession frequencies compared with the Kerr black hole case.

Abstract: Gravitational effects associated with black holes are widely believed to universally degrade quantum entanglement, with the loss of maximal entanglement being particularly severe and even irreversible for bosonic fields. In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of the four-qubit cluster state ($CL_4$) for fermionic fields in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations. Moreover, our results indicate that, within a relativistic framework, the $CL_4$ state constitutes a high-quality quantum resource with potential applications in relativistic quantum information processing, and may significantly improve the performance of such protocols.

Abstract: In context of Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theories of gravity, it has recently been obtained that the post-Newtonian parameters should be generalized in the context of strongly gravitating bodies, and that its generalization -- the so-called $\textit{exact parameters}$ -- actually depends on the pressure and energy density of a considered celestial body. Here we develop two new methods to numerically obtain the $\textit{exact parameters}$ by means of usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff computation, and find that the difference with the value of standard post-Newtonian parameters can be more than 80% in some situations. We also provide the connection with the Damour-Esposito Farèse non-pertubative parameter $α_{DEF}$. We then apply the methodology to the case of Entangled Relativity, and derive these exact parameters for the Sun and the Earth, as well as for neutron stars. We argue that current and foreseeable experiments are likely able to constrain the theory under the assumption that $\mathcal{L}_m=-ρ$, where $ρ$ is the total energy density. If $\mathcal{L}_m=T$ instead, as often advocated in the literature, then there is no deviation with respect to General Relativity and the prospects of testing Entangled Relativity become much more remote in time, as only compact objects with extreme electric or magnetic fields could lead to some deviation from General Relativity.

Abstract: Emergent modified gravity provides a covariant framework for holonomy effects in models of loop quantum gravity with consistent black hole solutions coupled to a scalar field. Several independent studies of the Hawking thermal distribution are shown here to lead to the same final result. This internal consistency is a direct consequence of general covariance, which is analogous to the situation in classical general relativity but highly nontrivial in the context of modified canonical gravity. Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically. Accounting for backreaction, corrected covariant semi-classical stress-energy tensors are computed in various vacuum states. Thanks to these results, the new concept of a net stress-energy tensor makes it possible to compute evaporation rates directly from energy conservation laws.

Abstract: We revisit the notion of massive particle hypersurfaces and place it within a unified framework alongside photon hypersurfaces in stationary spacetimes. More precisely, for Killing-invariant timelike hypersurfaces $T=\mathbb{R}\times S_0$, where $S_0$ is a smooth embedded surface in a spacelike slice $S$ of the stationary spacetime, we show that $T$ is a photon hypersurface or a massive particle hypersurface if and only if $S_0$ is totally geodesic with respect to certain associated Finsler structures on the slice: a Randers metric governing null geodesics and a Jacobi--Randers metric governing timelike solutions of the Lorentz force equation at fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio. We also prove existence and multiplicity results for proper-time parametrized solutions of the Lorentz force equation with fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio, either connecting a point to a flow line of the Killing vector field or having periodic, non-constant projection on $S$.

Abstract: The relation between spin and statistics in quantum field theory relies on Poincaré invariance, a symmetry that is lost in the presence of a gravitational field, and replaced in general relativity by the principle of general covariance. In a nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, beyond the picture of gravitational perturbations propagating on a flat background, it is an open question whether the gravitational field must still satisfy a bosonic statistics. By implementing the principle of general covariance through the requirement of invariance under active diffeomorphisms in loop quantum gravity, we find that the space of kinematical states of the gravitational field includes not only bosonic states, but also subspaces of fermionic and mixed statistics.

We also reimplement the waveform models \texttt{PhenomXAS} and \texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how dark matter (DM) distributions affect the Kerr orbits of EMRIs and gravitational wave emission, concluding that DM halos can significantly alter detectability thresholds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the influence of DM distributions on EMRI dynamics and gravitational wave emission is crucial for detecting DM halos.

Method: Analyzed radial pressure effects on orbital evolution and GW emission by comparing different DM modeling approaches, including distribution functions and anisotropic fluid models.

Result: Radial pressure in DM affects orbital dynamics, and a fully relativistic treatment of DM is important for detectability thresholds.

Conclusion: Radial pressure and relativistic modeling of DM are essential for describing EMRIs' dynamics and GW signatures in DM halos.

Abstract: We investigate different treatments of dark matter (DM) distributions surrounding extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) to assess their impact on orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission. Density profiles derived from the mass current and from the energy-momentum tensor using a distribution function yield consistent results, but both differ substantially from profiles obtained using an anisotropic fluid model based on Einstein cluster ansatz. We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms. By analyzing waveform dephasing and mismatches, we show that a fully relativistic treatment of DM distributions can substantially alter the detectability thresholds of DM halos. Our results demonstrate that radial pressure and relativistic modeling of DM are essential for accurately describing the dynamics and observational signatures of EMRIs embedded in DM halos.

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe and may have an enhanced abundance in bouncing cosmologies, where a long contracting phase can amplify perturbations. We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(ζ_c \sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores how the microstructure of quantum foam influences the late-time evolution of the universe using the Barrow--Tsallis entropy framework, finding exact relationships between quantum gravitational and nonextensive parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the connection between quantum gravity and macroscopic cosmological evolution is crucial for developing a complete theory of quantum gravity, aiming to reconcile general relativity and quantum mechanics.

Method: The authors developed a method for parameter estimation in cosmological models, applying it to analyze the interplay between microscopic quantum gravitational effects and macroscopic nonextensive entropy.

Result: Exact mathematical relationships were derived linking the quantum foam parameter to the nonextensive parameter and their feasibility for describing the universe's late evolution was confirmed.

Conclusion: This work bridges quantum foam microstates with macroscopic cosmological entropy, offering new insights into quantum gravity's implications for the universe’s ultimate evolution.

Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges of quantum gravity is to understand how the microscopic degrees of freedom of the cosmological horizon shape the evolution of the Universe. One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact. Therefore, the uncertainty in the relationship between the model parameters depends only on the current uncertainty in the values of the cosmographic parameters.

### [126] [Black Holes Trapped by Ghosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12101)
*Cheng-Yong Zhang,Yunqi Liu,Bin Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper reveals a nonlinear regime in black hole dynamics, challenging the traditional linear perturbation theory and offering new insights into gravitational-wave physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of black holes and their associated gravitational waves is crucial in astrophysics and theoretical physics. The paper suggests that the traditional linear perturbation theory may not capture the full complexity of black hole evolutions.

Method: Mathematical modeling and phase space analysis were used to identify the saddle-node ghost and its effect on black hole dynamics.

Result: The presence of a long-lived nonlinear regime before the linear phase suggests new phenomena in black hole spectroscopy and gravitational wave detection.

Conclusion: The discovery of a nonlinear bottleneck in black hole evolution opens new avenues for research in gravitational physics and cosmology.

Abstract: Violent cosmic events, from black hole mergers to stellar collapses, often leave behind highly excited black hole remnants that inevitably relax to equilibrium. The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations.

Abstract: Spin networks in Loop Quantum Gravity are traditionally described by unitary holonomies corresponding to noiseless transformations. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate general quantum channels that model effects of environment, which can become significant at the Planck scale. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, are consistent with the gauge invariance of spin networks. This enables the introduction of generalized spin network states that can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators. Furthermore, the associated notion of an inner product is proposed, allowing for introduction of the Hilbert space. We illustrate these constructions with examples involving a Wilson loop and a dipole network.

TL;DR: Astronomers report unusual Einstein cross images of HerS-3 with a bright central spot, suggesting gravitational lensing by compact stars as a possible explanation. They also suggest that such stars may exhibit unique characteristics in their lensed images, possibly serving as criteria for identifying regular stars in future observations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, the authors propose that compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may explain the central bright spot in Einstein cross images. The motivation is rooted in extending gravitational lensing studies from stars to black holes to identify regular stars.

Method: The authors analyze the optical properties of gravitational lenses produced by compact stars and compare them to those of ordinary black holes. They likely use theoretical models and possibly simulations or observations of gravitational lensing phenomena to draw their conclusions.

Result: The key results include the proposal that gravitational lensing by compact stars can produce central bright spots observed in Einstein cross images. The results also suggest that such stars produce unique characteristics in their lensed images, which may help in distinguishing regular stars from black holes.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the authors propose that compact stars can produce Einstein cross images with central bright spots through gravitational lensing. They also suggest that these images possess distinct characteristics that can serve as observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future studies.

Abstract: Recently, astronomers discovered unusual Einstein cross images of the galaxy HerS-3, which feature a bright central spot. Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.

### [129] [Transition from traveling fronts to diffusion-limited growth in expanding populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11540)

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种关于趋化性生物扩散的新模型，其生长速率介于线性和二次方之间。实验和理论分析表明，当营养供应有限时，生物密度分布和前向速度表现出特定的非线性行为。与现有模型相比，该模型更精确地描述了实际细菌群体的扩散过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过数学模型研究趋化性生物群落的非线性扩散行为，尤其是在有限资源时的生物密度分布以及前向速度，显得尤为重要。

Method: 使用了递归展开法和双重尺度法，获得了在不同营养浓度下生物密度分布和前向速度的渐近表达式。实验数据证明了模型的准确性。

Result: 当代谢率与营养浓度成正比时，假设密度分布为指数型，在营养耗尽之前，生物密度逐渐向内部迁移，从而前向速度缓慢下降。对不同速率的趋化性实验，发现存在一个临界点，在临界点之后系统表现出线性和二次方程的结合。

Conclusion: 在趋化性生物群落中，当资源有限时，群体的前向生长行为由非线性的动力学方程所描述。这与实际结果中的亚线性扩展模式吻合。这不仅帮助更好地理解趋化性生物的流动，也为预测其他微生物的繁殖高潮阶段提供了工具。

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion equations describe various spatially extended processes that unfold as traveling fronts moving at constant velocity. We introduce and solve analytically a model that, besides such fronts, supports solutions advancing as the square root of time. These sublinear fronts preserve an invariant shape, with an effective diffusion constant that diverges at the transition to linear spreading. The model applies to dense cellular aggregates of nonmotile cells consuming a diffusible nutrient. The sublinear spread results from biomass redistribution slowing due to nutrient depletion, a phenomenon supported experimentally but often neglected. Our results provide a potential explanation for the linear rather than quadratic increase of colony area with time, which has been observed for many microbes.

Abstract: Objective. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a fundamental mechanism underlying learning and memory, yet its investigation at the network level in vitro remains challenging, particularly when optogenetic stimulation is used. The objective of this work is to develop a robust experimental and analytical framework for inducing and quantifying optogenetically driven LTP in neuronal cultures recorded with microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Approach. We first systematically investigate the effect of widefield optogenetic stimulation frequency on evoked neuronal activity, to identify a test-stimulus that reliably probes network responses without inducing activity modulation. By analyzing spike-rate dynamics during repeated stimulation, we characterize frequency-dependent response adaptation consistent with Channelrhodopsin-2 photocycle kinetics. Based on these results, an optimized low-frequency test-stimulus is selected and combined with a spatially confined tetanic optogenetic stimulation to induce LTP. Network responses are quantified using post-stimulus time histograms and a normalized efficacy metric, enabling electrode-wise and network-level analysis of plasticity. Main results. Low-frequency optical stimulation (<= 0.2 Hz) preserves stable evoked responses, whereas higher frequencies induce a pronounced sigmoid-like decay in firing rate. Following tetanic stimulation, a subset of electrodes exhibits robust and long-lasting potentiation, persisting for several hours. Significance. This work provides a systematic methodology for studying activity-dependent plasticity in optogenetically driven neuronal networks.
