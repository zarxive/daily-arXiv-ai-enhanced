A\nchallenging problem that remains open in all of these scenarios is the fully\ndeterministic and direct manipulation of the systems' loss and gain on\ntimescales relevant to coherent control of excitations. Here we demonstrate the\nrapid manipulation of the gain and loss balance of excitations of a magnonic\nhybrid system on durations much shorter than their decay rate, allowing us to\nexploit non-Hermitian physics for coherent control.

Among these applications, designing on-chip\nspectrometers for RF spectrum analysis is particularly challenging since it\nrequires combining high resolution and large bandwidth with a fast update rate.\nExisting chip-scale spectrometers cannot achieve the resolution required for RF\nanalysis, setting aside challenges in maintaining a fast update rate and broad\nbandwidth. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a silicon\nphotonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based RF spectrum analyzer that combines an\nultra-high-resolution speckle spectrometer with an interferometric\nRF-to-optical encoding scheme. The PIC-based speckle spectrometer uses a\npath-mismatched multimode interferometer with inverse designed splitters to\ncompensate for waveguide loss, enabling a record-high resolution of 100 MHz\n(0.8 pm at a wavelength of 1550 nm). To further improve the resolution of the\noverall RF spectrum analyzer, we modify the RF-to-optical encoding scheme by\ndirecting the RF signal through a path mismatched interferometer and encoding\nthe outputs of the RF interferometer on separate optical carriers. This further\nreduces the RF spectral correlation width of the combined system, enabling the\nRF spectrum analyzer to resolve RF tones separated by 10 MHz across a bandwidth\nof 10 GHz. Since this approach operates as a single-shot spectrometer, it can\nsupport fast update rates, providing a path to compact, persistent wideband RF\nspectrum analysis."}

To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM\nwith the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation\nbetween TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic\nquantum baths.

An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of\nmeasurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to\narea-law TE scaling.

We define subsystems relative to a particle\ninsertion in the boundary theory. This leads to a natural notion of partial\ntrace and reduced density matrices. The corresponding entanglement entropy\ntakes the form of a generalized horizon entropy in the bulk dual; revealing the\nemergence of edge modes in the entangling surfaces. We match the entanglement\nentropy of the DSSYK in an appropriate limit to an area computed through a\n\\emph{Ryu-Takayanagi formula} in dS$_2$ space with entangling surfaces at\n$\\mathcal{I}^{\\pm}$; providing a first principles example of holographic\nentanglement entropy for dS$_2$ space. This formula reproduces the\nGibbons-Hawking entropy for specific entangling regions points; while it\ndecreases for others.

By comparing it with the other\nlocal minimum, one can determine which model is near the minimum of the\npotential for string backgrounds, that will be the true vacuum in string\ntheory, in the sense of the values of the potential. We will be able to find\nthe true vacuum in string theory through a series of such researches. In this\npaper, we perform this analysis of a certain simple heterotic\nnon-supersymmetric model explicitly, where the six-dimensional internal spaces\nare products of two-dimensional spaces of constant curvatures, and the\ngeneration number of massless fermions is given by the flux quantization\nnumbers. As a result, we obtain a constraint between the compactification scale\nand the flux quanta."}

Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently\nargued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law)\nscaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM\nwith the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation\nbetween TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic\nquantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding\ndistillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue\nthat TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine\nnon-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex\ntemporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is\nnegligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of\nmeasurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to\narea-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d\ncircuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary\npoints, as well as numerically away from them.

In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective\nmeasurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and\ndecoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits,\nMDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed\nstates rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay\ngives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical\nsimulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the\ntwo-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we provide a\ndiagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables\nefficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body\nnumerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase\ntransitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional Hamiltonians.

On the boundary, the field\noperator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right\nRindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both\nthese regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of\nthe energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one\npresents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and\nthe second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the\nboundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free\ngeometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the\nRindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the\nboundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion\ncondensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative\neverywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and\nthe energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region.\nFor a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions\n$D\\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero.\nThis behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the\ngeometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter\ncase, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of\nthe energy-momentum tensor becomes zero."}

We implement an\noriginal method, which involves solving the hydrodynamic continuity equation to\nextract the superfluid fraction tensor from the measured in situ density\ndistribution of the fluid at rest. In parallel, we apply an independent\ndynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity\nmeasurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield\nconsistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured\ndensity profiles."}
