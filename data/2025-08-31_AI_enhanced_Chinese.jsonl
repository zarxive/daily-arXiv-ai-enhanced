To illustrate the power of the qubit\nparametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital\nHubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor\nseries expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how\nthe Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition.

The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and\nmicro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales\nrelevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and\ndark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as\nthe energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors\nwhich record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small\nmineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by\nastrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A\nseries of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution\nof these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system\nand the Milky Way. Mineral detector research is highly multidisciplinary,\nincorporating aspects of high energy physics, condensed matter physics,\nmaterials science, geoscience, and AI/ML for data analysis. Although realizing\nthe scientific potential of mineral detectors poses many challenges, the\nMD$\\nu$DM community looks forward to the continued development of mineral\ndetector experiments and the possible discoveries that mineral detectors could\nreveal.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper discusses the third meeting focused on neutrino and dark matter detection using mineral detectors, highlighting their evolution, applications, and potential for scientific discoveries.", "motivation": "Understanding and detecting neutrinos and dark matter are key goals in modern physics, and mineral detectors provide a unique approach to achieve this.", "method": "The paper reviews the development of mineral detector technology through historical context, current achievements, and future prospects, incorporating multiple scientific disciplines.", "result": "The paper emphasizes the technological advancements and the potential of mineral detectors to contribute to fundamental physics research, particularly in neutrino physics and dark matter detection.", "conclusion": "The study underscores the importance of continued research and collaboration in advancing mineral detector technology for future scientific breakthroughs."}}

While\nentanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly\nmore challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we\ntheoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In\nparticular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate\ntwo experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite\ntemperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically\ncalculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below\nwhich the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is\naccessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the\nvicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with\nmutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by\nthe coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain\ngeneralized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization.\nMoreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale\nextensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement\nbetween coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is\nlargely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of\nentanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium\nregimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive\nentanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, finding appropriate additives may be challenging,\nsince we lack knowledge on their interactions with the plastics and with\nmoisture, and the interplay between them. In this work, we study a commercial\nadditive as well as two new potential additives for their antistatic and slip\nproperties in polyethylene by means of atomistic molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We reveal the most favorable interactions between polyethylene,\neach of these molecules and water, along with providing a microscopic picture\nof their interfacial structure. All additives interact with water mainly by\ntheir polar heads, with water acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor\ndepending on the additive. As expected, water does not enter the polyethylene\nmatrix; it accumulates at its surface instead, without any preferencial\norientation. The additives studied exhibit remarkably different structures when\nthey are mixed with the polymer: two of them enter the polymer matrix to\nvarious degrees, either by intercalating their chains with the polyethylene\nones or by forming miscellar-like structures, while the third one stays at the\nsurface. When water is incorporated into the system, the structure of some of\nthe additive/polyethylene systems changes. The magnitude and nature of these\nchanges depend on the relative concentrations of all species. If the additives\nare in low concentrations, water stays at the surface of the material, in a\ndrop-like shape. The additives penetrate and organize the polymer more or less\ndepending on whether water is present or not. We predict that one of our two\nproposed molecules has promising antistatic properties while the other one\ncould be applied as a slip agent.

Although differing in radial structure, these orbit branches are\ntopologically equivalent. Remarkably, when the outer potential barrier exceeds\nunity, bound orbits with energy $E>1$ become possible, in addition to the\nstandard $E<1$ branches. When the peak reaches $E=1$, up to three distinct\nbound orbit branches may coexist. We also identify a novel eccentricity\nbehavior, the innermost branch becomes increasingly circular with increasing\nenergy or angular momentum, while outer branches exhibit greater eccentricity\nand a larger apastron-periastron separation. These features, absent in previous\nstudies, are unique signatures of non-monotonic metric functions.

Suppressing measurement noise and\nachieving high sensitivity require accurate alignment of multiple onboard\ninterferometers after laser link acquisition. However, due to huge armlengths\nand varying point-ahead angles, the fine alignment of the transmitted beams can\nbe particularly challenging, which needs to take into account both received\nlaser power and far-field wavefront errors. To tackle this issue for TianQin\nwhich has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment\nstrategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the\ntransmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated\nthrough a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding\nintensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value\ncompensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the\nproposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad\nfrom the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length\ncoupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement\ngiven a transmitted beam aberration of $\\lambda/40$ RMS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5929\u5143\u661f\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d4b\u9ad8\u6b66\u5668\u7684\u5149\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5929\u5143\u661fMessier\u662f\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u51c6\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u675f\u662f\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Quatri-foil\u626b\u63cf\u6d4b\u5b9a\u70b9\u5bf9\u51c6\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdc\u7aef\u536b\u661f\u7684\u5149\u5f3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f73\u5bf9\u51c6\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5149\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u70b9\u5bf9\u51c6\u89d2\u5ea6\u5747\u503c\u768420\u7eb3\u5f27\u5ea6\u5185\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u8fdc\u573a\u6ce2\u9762\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3 telescope \u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5929\u5143\u661f\u5728\u957f\u81c2\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u70b9\u5bf9\u51c6\u89d2\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u51c6\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

We revisit the hairy black hole family in a recent\npaper by Nekouee et al. demonstrating that the equatorial restriction employed\nin such a work eliminates the genuinely Finslerian features and showing that\nthe claimed new solutions reproduce previously known results obtained by Ovalle\net al.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7403\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86Finsler\u5ea6\u91cf\u800c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7684$S^2$\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u9996 contrib: \u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5706\u73af\u5149\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u6709\u6548\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caFinsler\u7248\u672c\u7684Sagnac\u6548\u5e94\u3002 second contrib: \u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e Fix $(e^{\nu}, e^{\theta})$ \u7684\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86Nekouee \u7b49\u4eba\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e00\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7ecf\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u771f\u6b63Finsler\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u58f0\u79f0\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ea\u662fOvalle \u7b49\u4eba\u5148\u524d\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u5149\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fFinsler\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eKilling\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u96f6\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u5bfc\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5728\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u6c42\u89e3\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd8\u662f\u5728\u5149\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\uff0c\u90fd\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u5728Finsler\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b Quantized \u4e86\u5149\u8f68\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u7403\u5750\u6807\u65f6\u7a7a\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u5176\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Despite this, in order for the\nmodel to be efficiently trainable, the number of parameters must scale as\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$. This imbalance implies the existence of\ncorrelations between the Fourier modes, which depend on the structure of the\ncircuit. In this work, we demonstrate that this phenomenon exists and show\ncases where these correlations can be used to predict ansatz performance. For\nseveral popular ansatzes, we numerically compute the Fourier coefficient\ncorrelations (FCCs) and construct the Fourier fingerprint, a visual\nrepresentation of the correlation structure. We subsequently show how, for the\nproblem of learning random Fourier series, the FCC correctly predicts relative\nperformance of ansatzes whilst the widely-used expressibility metric does not.\nFinally, we demonstrate how our framework applies to the more challenging\nproblem of jet reconstruction in high-energy physics. Overall, our results\ndemonstrate how the Fourier fingerprint is a powerful new tool in the problem\nof optimal ansatz choice for QML.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This background is the accumulated\nsignal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes\ninformation about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the\nUniverse, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from\nthe early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically\nsignificant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical\nscenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3\npower-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\\Omega_{\\rm\nGW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.0\\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement\nover previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to\n$\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.8\\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x\nsensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting\nnon-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise\nsources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with\npopulation models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we\nfind our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are\napproaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits\nshown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary\nblack hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference\nresults and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background\narising from compact binary coalescences is $\\Omega_{\\rm CBC}(25{\\rm\nHz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest\ncontribution is due to binary black holes only, $\\Omega_{\\rm BBH}(25{\\rm\nHz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "The research investigates the isotropic gravitational-wave background using data from O1 to O4a, providing constraints on its energy density and sensitivity to various theories.", "motivation": "Understanding the isotropic gravitational-wave background helps interpret compact binary mergers and detect exotic physics or early cosmic processes.", "method": "A cross-correlation analysis of data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo was employs to search for the gravitational-wave background.", "result": "Constraints on the isotropic gravitational-wave background's energy density show an improvement, and new limits are placed on specific gravity theories.

Since their inception, there\nhave been several numerical and analytic studies of the BDNK equations which\nhave revealed their promise in modeling relativistic flows when viscous,\nfirst-order corrections to ideal hydrodynamics are important. In this paper, we\npresent numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in\nMinkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We\nnumerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite\ndifference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid\nstructure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We\npresent three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of\nequilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy\ndensity, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case\nwith sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though\ninitialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the\nregime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in\nthe solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This\nbehavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs\nat much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D\nconformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities\nin solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial\ndata. The numerical methods we employ on the two-sphere can be readily extended\nto include variations in the radial direction, allowing for full ($3+1$)D\nsimulations of the BDNK equations in astrophysical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bemfica et al. improved the accuracy of relativistic hydrodynamics by refining the BDNK equations to include first-order viscous correction to ideal hydrodynamics.
