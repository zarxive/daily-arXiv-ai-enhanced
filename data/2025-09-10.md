### [1] [Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Disordered Potentials under Spatially Uniform SU(2) Gauge Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07312)
*Masataka Kakoi,Christian Miniatura,Keith Slevin*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: 研究了二维无序势场中自旋1/2粒子的相互作用动态，发现短期内存在回散峰和回响谷，可以通过非阿贝尔规范变换直观解释，并预测了回散峰的时间演变和耗相时间.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自旋1/2粒子在二维无序势场中的相互作用动态及其回散现象具有重要的理论意义和潜在应用前景.

Method: 利用规范变换方法和多散射扰动理论分析粒子传播动力学，得到回散峰的时空演变及其耗相时间的精确预测.

Result: 在短期内观察到回散峰偏移回散方向，同时存在回响谷；通过非阿贝尔规范变换给出了回散峰的时间演变和耗相时间的精确预测；结果适用于一般空间均匀的SU(2)规范场，如 Usage场景中的合成规范场。

Conclusion: 研究表明在二维无序势场中，自旋1/2粒子相互作用动态中的回散现象具有复杂特征，可以通过非阿贝尔规范理论进行深入解析。

Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin 1/2 particle
propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a
generalized spin--orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a
spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and
momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient
backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting
with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this
momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the
full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a
precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for
multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform
SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索光场与原子相互作用下的量子效应，特别是在统计物理框架下的新相态。

Method: 通过求解原子与光场的相互作用哈密顿量及量子位和色散方程，分析各阶相关函数及长时尾行为，采用密度矩阵方法化简并求解非平衡状态。

Result: 发现当光强超过临界值时，原子系统进入自组织态，光场呈现调制特性；在大量激发态下，出现多稳态现象及复杂的温度依赖性行为。

Conclusion: 建立了包含量子发散和光学效益的动态相互作用理论框架；揭示了新相态的最优化及量子热效应，将为量子信息存储、量子计算提供理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to
a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam
introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the
steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the
atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both
one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field
lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the
self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the
atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and
at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes
place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the
cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation
in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly
non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects
of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized
stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the
presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having
different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region
arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations.
The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower
filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states
drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the
coupled atoms-cavity system.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: 研究了玻色子寻态系统，通过均场近似和数值模拟，揭示了不同相互作用强度下均匀态和反铁磁密度波态的分布。振荡相的出现但数值模拟未捕捉到。通过研究空间相关性和固定点深入分析了初始亚层间人口差异对密度波有序增强的作用。观察到缩放行为显示出弱普适性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究玻色子寻态系统的密度波相和不同相互作用下相的转变是量子统计和凝聚态物理学中的重要课题。

Method: 使用均场近似和数值模拟，分别研究系统相行为，分析空间相关性和固定点。

Result: 发现均场近似中出现振荡相，而1D数值模拟未捕捉到。初始亚层间人口差异增强密度波有序。缩放行为显示出弱普适性。

Conclusion: 玻色子寻态系统在不同相互作用强度下表现的密度波相与均匀相可通过均场近似和空间相关性分析得以揭示，提供了解析该系统新的研究方向。

Abstract: We study a two-level dissipative non-equilibrium bosonic Rydberg system in an
optical lattice, where multiple atoms can occupy a single site. The system is
treated using two different approaches: solution of the master equation using a
mean-field approximation, and direct numerical simulation of an equivalent
quantum model. It is found that, depending on the on-site interaction strength,
the system can either be uniform or have an antiferromagnet-like density-wave
structure in terms of the Rydberg excitation distribution. Our mean-field
treatment detects an interesting oscillatory phase as well, but the numerical
simulation in 1D does not capture it. The origin of all these phases are
investigated by studying the spatial correlations, and by calculating the fixed
points of the dynamics. It is observed that an initial population difference
across the sublattices helps to enhance the density-wave order. The scaling
behavior of the system is also analyzed and a signature of weak universality is
obtained.

Motivation: To advance neutrino physics through a modular, efficient liquid argon detector design with key technological advancements.

Method: Examined the 2x2 LArTPC implementation, including design, commissioning, and performance validation using NuMI beam data.

Result: Detected over 30k interactions, noted good detector performance and interaction candidates indicating potential for scientific yield.

Conclusion: This detector serves as a proof-of-concept for DUNE's liquid argon design, showing the technology's effectiveness and potential for future neutrino experiments.

Abstract: The 2x2 Demonstrator, a prototype for the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) liquid argon (LAr) Near Detector, was exposed to the
Neutrinos from the Main Injector (NuMI) neutrino beam at Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). This detector prototypes a new modular
design for a liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC), comprised of a
two-by-two array of four modules, each further segmented into two
optically-isolated LArTPCs. The 2x2 Demonstrator features a number of
pioneering technologies, including a low-profile resistive field shell to
establish drift fields, native 3D ionization pixelated imaging, and a
high-coverage dielectric light readout system. The 2.4 tonne active mass
detector is flanked upstream and downstream by supplemental solid-scintillator
tracking planes, repurposed from the MINERvA experiment, which track ionizing
particles exiting the argon volume. The antineutrino beam data collected by the
detector over a 4.5 day period in 2024 include over 30,000 neutrino
interactions in the LAr active volume-the first neutrino interactions reported
by a DUNE detector prototype. During its physics-quality run, the 2x2
Demonstrator operated at a nominal drift field of 500 V/cm and maintained good
LAr purity, with a stable electron lifetime of approximately 1.25 ms. This
paper describes the detector and supporting systems, summarizes the
installation and commissioning, and presents the initial validation of
collected NuMI beam and off-beam self-triggers. In addition, it highlights
observed interactions in the detector volume, including candidate muon
anti-neutrino events.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: IMPISH is a low-cost, high-performance detector system capable of measuring collimated X-ray spectra in the full solar spectrum. It is designed for fast solar X-ray measurements during impulsive solar flares and offers a solution to the challenge of detecting sub-second variations of nonthermal X-ray emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to study particle acceleration mechanisms during large solar flares, which operates in the impulsive phase of the flare and involves magnetic reconnection.

Method: The IMPISH detector system uses four identical detectors with a total effective area of 64 cm², combining silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and LYSO scintillators to measure X-ray spectra from 10 keV to over 200 keV.

Result: The system enables sub-second variations of nonthermal X-ray emission detection, providing insights into particle acceleration mechanisms driven by magnetic reconnection in solar flares.

Conclusion: The development of IMPISH represents a significant step forward in space-based X-ray imaging, offering an efficient and cost-effective solution for studying solar flare physics and space weather.

Abstract: The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH)
is a piggyback mission originally designed for the second flight of the
Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS-2) Antarctic balloon.
IMPISH will take measurements of collimated, full-Sun X-ray spectra with the
goal of detecting sub-second variations (order of tens of milliseconds) of
nonthermal X-ray emission during the impulsive phase of large solar flares to
probe particle acceleration mechanisms driven by magnetic reconnection.
  The IMPISH detector system, made up of four identical detectors totaling 64
cm$^2$ effective area, is capable of measuring from ~10 keV to over 200 keV
through the use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and LYSO scintillators. At
the stratospheric altitude of GRIPS-2, the effective lower energy limit is
~20-30 keV. The geometry of the LYSO crystal has been optimized to balance the
light collection efficiency with the effective area required for stratospheric
X-ray measurements. Development of the IMPISH detectors has introduced a path
for a low-cost solution to fast solar X-ray measurements across a large energy
range utilizing commercially available components. The payload has a 3U form
factor and has been designed so that both the electronics and detectors may be
easily adaptable for space-based missions.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper presents a low-noise readout system for frequency multiplexed TES detectors used in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. The system uses a SQUID with low input inductance, high transimpedance, and/or low dynamic impedance, and minimizes wiring capacitance or adds a cryogenic low-noise amplifier to achieve the required energy resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experiments like CUPID require high energy resolution, which demands a low-readout-noise TES-based system. They need specific TES parameters (low resistance, long wiring) to support CUPID's requirements, necessitating careful design considerations.

Method: The authors characterize the readout noise of their new system, build a noise model, and identify the root causes of noise sources including current sharing and long wiring. They validate these findings with circuit simulations and experimental measurements.

Result: The noise model reveals that current sharing and long wiring degrade system noise performance. Designers addressing these issues can optimize SQUID performance or incorporate cryogenic amplifiers to meet noise requirements.

Conclusion: To achieve the desired sensitivity in CUPID, the system must implement low-input SQUIDs, minimize wiring effects, or integrate low-noise amplifiers to reduce readout noise.

Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors have been the standard
in Cosmic Microwave Background experiments for almost two decades and are now
being adapted for use in nuclear physics, such as neutrinoless double beta
decay searches. In this paper we focus on a new high-bandwidth frequency
multiplexed TES readout system developed for CUPID, a neutrinoless double beta
decay experiment that will replace CUORE. In order to achieve the high energy
resolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept
to a minimum. Low TES operating resistance and long wiring between the readout
SQUID and the warm electronics are needed for CUPID, prompting a careful
consideration of the design parameters of this application of frequency
multiplexing. In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly
designed frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a
noise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID
coil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output
wiring, worsen the readout noise of the system. To meet noise requirements, a
SQUID with a low input inductance, high transimpedance and/or low dynamic
impedance is needed, and the wiring capacitance should be kept as small as
possible. Alternatively, the option of adding a cryogenic low-noise amplifier
at the output of the SQUID should be explored.

Abstract: State-of-the-art and next-generation rare-event search experiments rely on
detector materials with stringent requirements on radiopurity and mechanical
performance. Additive-free electroformed copper offers exceptional radiopurity,
but is limited in mechanical strength, motivating the exploration of
application-specific copper-based alloys. Early investigations, based on direct
experimentation, explored the synthesis of CuCr alloys through
electrodeposition and thermal processing. Subsequently, modeling tools based on
the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the alloy compositions were
employed, which led to specific proposals for improved thermal processing.
Moreover, the systematic application of computational thermodynamics to
materials design further motivated the investigation of CuCrTi alloys, in
addition to CuCr alloys. This materials design approach has shaped a trajectory
towards designing high-performance, radiopure copper-based alloys, minimizing
lengthy and costly trial-and-error. In this work, we explore the impact of
initial layer configuration on the effectiveness of heat treatments, paving the
way toward manufacturable, radiopure, multicomponent alloys for future
low-background experiments.

TL;DR: This paper successfully demonstrates a microwave SQUID multiplexer-based readout system for large cryogenic detector arrays, capable of handling up to 400 channels across 4-8 GHz, with low flux noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large cryogenic detector arrays are useful for high-statistics, angular resolution, and imaging applications. Multiplexing is essential for overcoming system complexity, parasitic heat load, and cost, making microwave SQUID multiplexing a promising approach, especially for magnetic microcalorimeters (MMC) readout.

Method: The authors developed a custom full-scale software-defined radio (SDR) electronics-based microwave SQUID multiplexer. The multiplexer was tailored for MMC readout, and the system was tested with up to 400 channels.

Result: The system operates reliably across 4-8 GHz, achieves low flux noise levels, and is suitable for future large-scale, high-resolution MMC experiments.

Conclusion: The system provides a scalable and functional solution for the readout of large cryogenic detector arrays.

Abstract: The deployment of large cryogenic detector arrays, comprising hundreds to
thousands of individual detectors, is highly beneficial for various
cutting-edge applications, requiring large statistics, angular resolution or
imaging capabilities. The readout of such arrays, however, presents a major
challenge in terms of system complexity, parasitic heat load, and cost, which
can be overcome only through multiplexing. Among the various multiplexing
approaches, microwave SQUID multiplexing currently represents the state of the
art, in particular for magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) readout. In this work,
we demonstrate the successful operation of the latest generation of our
microwave SQUID multiplexer-based readout system, based on a SQUID multiplexer
tailored for MMC readout and a custom full-scale software-defined radio (SDR)
electronics, capable of handling up to 400 channels. The system operates
reliably across the entire 4-8 GHz frequency band and achieves sufficiently low
flux noise levels in flux-ramp-demodulated readout. Our results confirm that
our system is fully functional and provides a scalable path towards future
large-scale, high-resolution MMC experiments.

Conclusion: CaloDiT-2 是首个提供探测器agnostic预训练模型，显著减少了开发新探测器所需的数据和时间。

Abstract: Collider experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider, use the
Geant4 toolkit to simulate particle-detector interactions with high accuracy.
However, these experiments increasingly require larger amounts of simulated
data, leading to huge computing cost. Generative machine learning methods could
offer much faster calorimeter shower simulations by directly emulating detector
responses. In this work, we present CaloDiT-2, a diffusion model which uses
transformer blocks. As is the case for other models explored for this task, it
can be applied to specific geometries, however its true strength lies in its
generalisation capabilities. Our approach allows pre-training on multiple
detectors and rapid adaptation to new ones, which we demonstrate on the LEMURS
dataset. It reduces the effort required to develop accurate models for novel
detectors or detectors which are under development and have geometries that are
changed frequently, requiring up to 25x less data and 20x less training time.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pre-trained model to be
published that allows adaptation in the context of particle shower simulations,
with the model also included in the Geant4 toolkit. We also present results on
benchmarks on Dataset-2 from the community-hosted CaloChallenge, showing that
our models provide one of the best tradeoffs between accuracy and speed from
the published models. Our contributions include a mechanism for the creation of
detector-agnostic data representations, architectural modifications suitable
for the data modality, a pre-training and adaptation strategy, and publicly
released datasets and pre-trained models for broad use.

*Onur Gilanliogullari,Brahim Mustapha,Pavel Snopok*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: Beam instabilities and resonances affect particle accelerator dynamics, causing emittance growth and beam loss. Resonance lines arise from nonlinear lattice effects, constraining working points and reducing tune space. Circular modes, with non-zero angular momentum, offer alternative beam dynamics. The study derives third-order sextupole resonance conditions and shows that circular-mode designs suppress most resonance lines due to flatness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating beam instabilities and resonances is crucial for maintaining efficient and stable particle accelerator operations. This study aims to explore how circular modes can suppress these resonances, potentially improving accelerator performance.

Method: The study employs a coupled normal-mode parametrization to derive third-order sextupole resonance conditions. Computer simulations and analytical calculations are likely used to model the beam dynamics and validate the suppression mechanism.

Result: The research demonstrates that with circular-mode lattice designs and appropriate beam operation, many resonance lines are effectively suppressed. This suggests that circular modes can be a viable solution to mitigate beam instabilities and improve accelerator stability.

Conclusion: By introducing circular modes, the accelerator's ability to suppress beam instabilities and reduce resonance effects is significantly enhanced, leading to improved operational efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Beam instabilities and resonances affect the transverse dynamics in particle
accelerators and, when encountered, can trigger emittance growth and beam loss.
Resonance lines originate from non linear elements and effects in the lattice,
imposing strict constraints on the choice of working points and narrowing the
available tune space. Circular modes are round coupled beams with non zero
angular momentum, provide an alternative beam motion and dynamics. In this
study, we derive the third-order sextupole resonance conditions in the coupled
(normal-mode) parametrization and show that, with circular-mode lattice design
and beam operation, most of these resonance lines are naturally suppresses due
to the inherent flatness of the mode.

Abstract: Combining magnetometry with optical spectroscopy has uncovered novel quantum

the theory of magnetic response of excitons, correlated electron-hole pairs in

electron-hole interaction and topological effects. In biased bilayer graphene,
for instance, theoretical predictions of valley g-factor for p-excitons deviate
from experiment by nearly an order of magnitude. Here, we develop a quantum
theory of exciton orbital magnetic moment that reveals several conceptually new
terms absent in prior theories, including an unforeseen contribution from
exciton band quantum geometry. Our ab initio calculations yield results in
excellent agreement with measurements, establishing the importance of a full

Abstract: Seebeck coefficient, $S=L_{12}/(TL_{11})$, which is proportional to a ratio

electrons in a three-quarter filled organic conductor,

tight-binding (TB) model obtained by first-principles relativistic
density-functi onal theory method [Eur. Phys. J. B 94, 17 (2021)], we calculate
$S$ in the presence of the impurity and electron--phonon (e--p) scatterings. It
is shown that $S_x < 0$ and $S_y >0$ at high temperatures, where $S_x$ ($S_y$)
denotes $S$ perpendicular (parallel) to the molecular stacking axis. There is a
sign change of $S_y$ with increasing $T$. It is found that, at low temperatures
the absolute value of $S$ is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Seebeck
coefficient is examined by dividing into components of the conduction and
valence bands to find that the electron and hole contributions compete each
other. Such $T$ dependence of $S$ is clarified using the spectral conductivity,
which determines $L_{12}$ and $L_{11}$.

Abstract: Periodic driving of quantum dots is analyzed as a basis for developing
dynamic switching devices. We study transport through periodically modulated
energy levels which are coupled to leads via tunneling coefficients. Utilizing
Floquet theory a full analytic solution is found in terms of continued
fractions, enabling us to efficiently calculate and analyze the transmission
through the quantum dot in relevant parameter regimes. By considering levels at
higher energy outside the spectrum of the transmitted particles a resonant
switching effects is identified, where a very small oscillating control signal
on a weakly connected quantum dot can induce perfect transmission. We also find
closed form expressions using Bessel functions in the limit of small tunnel
couplings. The results predict and explain resonant tunneling in
nano-electronic devices as well as in corresponding setups using magnonic
systems, photonic waveguides, or ultra-cold gases in optical lattices.

Abstract: Janus particles are functional particles with at least two surfaces showing
asymmetric properties. We show at the interface between two magnetic regions
with different antisymmetric exchange interactions, a new species of
topological quasiparticles can emerge, in which different helicity structures
can coexist. We name such an interfacial quasiparticle a "Janus skyrmion", in
analogy to the Janus particle. As the Janus skyrmion shows helicity asymmetry,
its size could vary with both the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A
vertical spin current could drive the Janus skyrmion into one-dimensional
motion along the interface without showing the skyrmion Hall effect, at a speed
which depends on both the spin polarization angle and current density. Thermal
fluctuations could also lead to one-dimensional random walk of a Brownian Janus
skyrmion. This work uncovers unique dynamics of interfacial quasiparticles with
exotic helicity structures, which may be realized in interface-engineered
magnetic layers.

Abstract: Certain noncollinear antiferromagnets host momentum-dependent spin-splitting
bands with odd-parity $p$-wave symmetry, termed $p$-wave magnets. Metallic
$p$-wave magnets offer a unique platform for spintronic applications, yet
experimental realizations remain scarce. CeNiAsO, featuring a tetragonal
structure and developing a commensurate coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic
order at low temperatures, has been theoretically proposed as such a magnet.
Here, we show that its resistivity exhibits strong two-fold in-plane anisotropy
-- a key signature of its proposed $p$-wave magnetism. Reversible and
nonvolatile switching between high- and low-resistance states is achieved by
alternating the in-plane magnetic field direction, indicating potential for
field-controlled memory devices. Our results not only provide critical
experimental evidence for $p$-wave magnetism in CeNiAsO but also open new
avenues for high-performance antiferromagnetic spintronics based on resistivity
anisotropy.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: We study spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in CoFeB/SrIrO3 bilayers and find that the magnetic layer strongly influences the SMR effect by absorbing spin currents, leading to enhanced performance with thicker CoFeB layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spin Hall magnetoresistance is a critical phenomenon in spintronics, and optimizing its properties is essential for developing high-performance magnetic sensors and devices. Understanding factors that enhance or degrade SMR is crucial for advancing these technologies.

Method: We fabricate CoFeB/SrIrO3 bilayers with varying CoFeB thicknesses and measure the SMR signals using spin-polarized transport techniques. The magnetic layer's effect on spin current absorption is analyzed through theoretical modeling and experimental results.

Result: Our results show that the SMR ratio increases with thicker CoFeB layers, indicating improved interlayer spin transfer. The effective spin Hall angle also increases, showing a significant impact of the magnetic layer on spin current absorption.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that optimizing the magnetic layer's thickness and properties can significantly enhance SMR performance, providing insights into designing more efficient spintronic devices and materials.

Abstract: Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is an intriguing spin-dependent transport
phenomenon in bilayers consisting of non-magnetic and magnetic layers. Here, we
report on the influence of longitudinal spin current absorption by the magnetic
layer on SMR in bilayers composed of Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ (CoFeB) and
epitaxial SrIrO$_{3}$, where SrIrO$_{3}$ is used as a highly-resistive spin
current source. We observed a clear SMR signal and an enhancement in the SMR
ratio with increasing CoFeB layer thickness, in qualitative agreement with an
SMR model that incorporates the spin current absorption. The effective spin
Hall angle is corrected from 0.07 to 0.12 with consideration of the spin
current absorption, corresponding to a relative correction of ~71%. Our
findings highlight the pronounced impact of the spin current absorption by the
magnetic layer on the SMR mechanism when employing highly-resistive
non-magnetic layer such as SrIrO$_{3}$, as well as other emerging quantum
materials.

Conclusion: 斜率贡献的轨道效应在酶系统中非常重要，与现有自旋机制互补。

Abstract: This work investigates electron transport through chiral electrostatic
potentials by modeling the system in three spatial dimensions and demonstrates
that chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS) produces pronounced
enantiospecific transmission, dependent on the electron's initial orbital
angular momentum (OAM) state. The results show that transverse electron motion
in a chiral environment, captured by OAM dynamics, gives rise to strong orbital
selectivity that reverses upon inversion of the handedness of the chiral
potential. This behavior originates from a coupling between the electron's
linear and orbital angular momenta, leading to effects that are significantly
stronger than those arising from spin-phonon and bare spin-orbit interactions
under realistic physical conditions. Moreover, the CIOS effect is shown to
increase with the length of the chiral region and remains robust against static
disorder. The orbital selectivity can give rise to spin selectivity when
initial correlations exist between spin and OAM states. These findings
underscore the importance of orbital contributions to enantiospecific electron
transport in chiral systems and suggest that CIOS plays a critical role
alongside existing spin-based mechanisms.

Abstract: We analyze the noise in a multi-terminal multi-channel conductor under
arbitrary time-dependent driving and subject to -- possibly large -- static
potential and temperature biases. We show that the full out-of-equilibrium
zero-frequency noise is constrained by a fluctuation-dissipation bound. It
consists of an upper bound expressed in terms of weighted current components of
the separate Floquet bands arising from the time-dependent driving. In the
limit of large static temperature bias, it has an intuitive interpretation in
terms of the dissipated powers due to the static potential bias and due to the
time-dependent driving. Furthermore, we show the existence of a second bound
that relies on the specific shape of the electron distribution resulting from
the driving, which is often even tighter than the fluctuation-dissipation
bound. We show the implications of our bounds at the simple, but experimentally
relevant example of a two-terminal conductor in the presence of an ac bias.

Abstract: Spin waves are attractive information carriers owing to their
gigahertz-to-terahertz frequencies, nanometric wavelengths, and negligible
Joule heating. Yet the efficient excitation of short-wavelength, high-frequency
spin waves and the exploitation of nonlinear effects remain challenging. We
propose a hybrid ferromagnetic nanostructure composed of a small,
in-plane-magnetized rim (a magnonic nanocavity) exchange-coupled to an
out-of-plane-magnetized region. Micromagnetic simulations show that a spatially
uniform out-of-plane microwave field excites the rim's fundamental mode; its
second harmonic is then coherently and efficiently launched into the second
region of the structure, yielding propagating spin waves. The process can be
realized in strip or disk geometries, providing excitation of plane-wave or
radial spin waves, respectively. The conversion efficiency grows nonlinearly
with the pump amplitude and can be further improved when the frequency of a
higher-order standing wave in the nanocavity matches the second-harmonic
frequency. The emission frequency is tunable via the bias magnetic field or the
width of the nanocavity, suggesting a compact route toward on-chip,
short-wavelength, high-frequency spin-wave sources for artificial neural
networks.

Abstract: Electron mobility due to electron-phonon interaction is investigated for
fully fluorinated/hydrogenated zig-zag carbon nanotubes containing
one-dimensional alternating chains of carbon atoms with $\pi$-bonds. The
behavior of mobility associated with changes in the tube diameter, coating type
(F/H) and temperature is revealed. In particular, it is shown that the
dependence of mobility on the diameter in such tubes is periodic with the
chirality index, which is associated with the absence of scattering on TA
phonons in the tubes with an even number of conducting chains due to mirror
symmetry. The obtained small values of phonon-limited mobility indicate that
tubes with one-dimensional conducting chains are more promising for use as gas
sensors than as elements of electronic devices. Calculations are performed
within the self-energy relaxation time approximation (SERTA) using the
non-orthogonal tight-binding approach.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for on-chip quantum reservoir computing implementation and extends mesoscopic physics applications.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data,
enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical
implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened new possibilities for
conventional RC and introduced novel ideas to tackle open problems in quantum
physics and advance quantum technologies. Despite its promise, it faces

possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication
techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement
back-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically
demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series
forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway
for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the

*Bo Zou,Anzhuoer Li,Allan H. MacDonald*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Moiré materials with opposite Chern numbers can exhibit gapless or gapped ground states depending on intravalley and intervalley interactions, with possible implications for the fractional quantum spin Hall effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research explores the interplay between intravelley and intervalley interactions in moiré materials with opposite Chern numbers. By utilizing Landau levels with opposite magnetic field signs as a model, the authors investigate the conditions under which gapless or gapped ground states emerge, particularly at half-filling.

Method: The study employs a combination of theoretical methods, including effective low-energy theories and mean-field approximations, to analyze the phases of the system. Key parameters such as the ratio of intravalley to intervalley interactions are systematically varied to determine phase transitions.

Result: The findings reveal that the system can exhibit either gapless or gapped ground states. In the gapless regime, the system maps to a strong-field superconducting vortex-lattice state with time-reversal symmetry broken. In the gapped regime, two distinct phases are observed: one with broken time-reversal symmetry and a quantized Hall effect, and another with broken parity symmetry and zero Hall conductivity. This diversity in phases suggests a rich phase diagram.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the phases of interaction-induced insulators in moiré materials with opposite Chern numbers. The results suggest that these materials could potentially host the fractional quantum spin Hall effect at odd filling factors and offer new insights into related systems where electron correlations are significant.

Abstract: Moir\'e materials with opposite non-zero miniband Chern numbers in
time-reversal-partner valleys are two-dimensional topological insulators at
band filling $\nu=2$. We explore the possibility that in this class of moir'e
materials intervalley coherence can sometimes be present in interaction induced
insulators at band filling $\nu=1$ , using Landau levels with opposite signs of
the magnetic field as a convenient generic model. In the absence of intravalley
interactions the mean-field ground state at filling factor $\nu=1$ is a gapless
intervalley coherent state that maps under a particle-hole transformation of
one valley to a strong-field superconducting vortex-lattice state that has been
studied previously. When the ratio $\lambda$ of intravalley to intervalley
interactions is increased, gapped states appear, one with broken time-reversal
symmetry and a quantized Hall effect but no valley polarization and one with
broken parity symmetry and zero Hall conductivity. We discuss the possibility
that the latter state could be related to the fractional quantum spin Hall
effect recently observed at an odd filling factor in a moir'e topological
insulator and comment on related systems in which correlations between
electrons in bands with opposite Chern numbers might play a key role.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) is critical for the
identification and applications of new spin-orbitronic effects. One of the most
popular techniques to qualify the SOTs is the switching angle shift, where the
applied direct current was assumed to shift, via domain wall depinning during
the anti-domain expansion, the switching angle of a perpendicular magnetization
in a linear proportion manner under a large rotating magnetic field. Here, we
report that, for the most commonly employed perpendicular magnetization
heterostructures in spintronics (e.g., those based on FeCoB, Co, and Co/Ni
multilayers), the switching angle shift considerably misestimates the SOT
within the domain wall depinning analysis of the slope of the linear-in-current
scaling and may also have a non-zero residual value at zero direct current. Our
experiments and simulations unveil that the switching angle shift is most
likely dominated by the chiral asymmetric nucleation rather than the expansion
of the anti-domains. The in-plane field from external magnet and
current-induced SOTs lower the perpendicular nucleation field and thus the
required switching angle, ultimately leading to underestimation of the SOTs by
the domain wall depinning analysis. These results have advanced the
understanding of magnetization switching of spintronic devices.

Abstract: Extending Hong--Ou--Mandel (HOM) interferometry to the fractional quantum
Hall effect (FQHE) promises direct access to anyonic statistics, yet remains
challenging: on-demand anyon injection is hindered by integer-charged minimal
excitations, and recent HOM experiments in the FQHE lack a fully consistent
theoretical framework. Here we provide a general theory of time-resolved HOM
interferometry in quantum Hall systems. Combining the nonequilibrium bosonized
edge theory (NEBET) with the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative theory
(UNEPT), we derive exact and perturbative relations obeyed by the relevant
cross-correlations of chiral currents valid for spatially extended tunneling
operators and generic quadratic edge dynamics. Then, within the
Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, we analyze the width of the HOM dip
for injected pulses carrying integer and fractional charges. We show that it is
governed by the width of the pulses and, for the fractional charge, by a
non-trivial power-law behavior of the scaling dimension. Our results establish
a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting recent experiments on anyonic
statistics and electronic interferometry in the quantum Hall regime.

Abstract: Twisted graphene multilayers exhibit strong electronic correlations, which
manifest in a range of experimental signatures. Yet how these signatures relate
to each other and the microscopic ground states-and how twist angle and band
structure reshape them-remains poorly understood. Here we study this interplay
by correlating local thermodynamic and transport measurements in a twisted
trilayer graphene (TTG) sample with unequal angles and flat electronic bands.
We use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the impact of
electron-electron interactions in a region of the sample where the local twist
angle evolves smoothly. We observe gapped correlated insulators and a sawtooth
in electronic compressibility, both exhibiting pronounced electron-hole (e-h)
asymmetry with distinct magic angles for conduction and valence bands.
Subsequent transport measurements in the same region reveal robust
superconductivity with a similar e-h asymmetry. Our measurements indicate that
superconductivity is not directly tied to the correlated insulators. Instead,
its critical temperature correlates closely with the strength of the sawtooth
in compressibility, suggesting a common origin or link between the two. By
combining a local probe with transport measurements, we uncover connections
between superconductivity and thermodynamic correlation signatures that are not
apparent from either technique in isolation, highlighting the power of our dual
approach and establishing their dependence on interlayer twist angles in TTG.

Abstract: This study proposes a reconfigurable modular building system that assembles
multistable curved-crease origami blocks. Curved-crease origami is designed
with even-vertex polygonal trajectories and an elastica curvature profile. We
then connect the matching ends to impart multistability. Through this design
approach, we create various blocks and investigate their snapping and
load-bearing behavior using finite element analysis. We design block assemblies

tension cable to the assembly, the assembled modules can be snapped into
multiple configurations.

Abstract: Phononic circuits constructed from high tensile stress membranes offer a
range of desirable features such as high acoustic confinement, controllable
nonlinearities, low mass, compact footprint, and ease of fabrication. This
tutorial presents a systematic approach to modelling and designing phononic
integrated circuits on this platform, beginning with acoustic confinement, wave
propagation and dispersion, mechanical and actuation nonlinearities, as well as
resonator dynamics. By adapting coupled mode theory from optoelectronics to
suspended membranes, and validating this theory with several numerical
techniques (finite element modelling, finite difference time domain
simulations, and the transfer matrix method), we then provide a comprehensive
framework to engineer a broad variety of phononic circuit building blocks. As
illustrative examples, we describe the implementation of several acoustic
circuit elements including resonant and non-resonant variable-ratio power
splitters, mode converters, mode (de)multiplexers, and in-line Fabry-Perot
cavities based on evanescent tunnel barriers. These building blocks lay the
foundation for phononic integrated circuits with applications in sensing,
acoustic signal processing, and power-efficient and radiation-hard computing.

Abstract: While real-valued solutions of the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation have
been studied extensively over the past 50 years, much less attention has been
devoted to solution behaviour in the complex plane. Here we consider the
analytic continuation of real solutions of KdV and investigate the role that
complex-plane singularities play in early-time solutions on the real line. We
apply techniques of exponential asymptotics to derive the small-time behaviour
for dispersive waves that propagate in one direction, and demonstrate how the
amplitude, wavelength and speed of these waves depend on the strength and
location of double-pole singularities of the initial condition in the complex
plane. Using matched asymptotic expansions in the limit $t\rightarrow 0^+$, we
show how complex singularities of the time-dependent solution of the KdV
equation emerge from these double-pole singularities. Generically, their speed
as they move from their initial position is of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-2/3})$, while
the direction in which these singularities propagate initially is dictated by a
Painlev\'{e} II (P$_{\mathrm{II}}$) problem with decreasing tritronqu\'{e}e
solutions. The well-known $N$-soliton solutions of KdV correspond to rational
solutions of P$_{\mathrm{II}}$ with a finite number of singularities;
otherwise, we postulate that infinitely many complex-plane singularities of KdV
solutions are born at each double-pole singularity of the initial condition. We
also provide asymptotic results for some non-generic cases in which
singularities propagate more slowly than in the generic case. Our study makes
progress towards the goal of providing a complete description of KdV solutions
in the complex plane and, in turn, of relating this behaviour to the solution
on the real line.

*Lina Fransén,Benjamin Roux,Sonia Coriani,Saikat Nandi,Morgane Vacher*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the mechanism behind photophysical relaxation in spiropyran during its photochemical reaction. Experimental evidence of this mechanism is lacking, and the authors propose a potential route using time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the photophysical relaxation mechanism in spiopyran is crucial for improving its efficiency in photochromic systems. The lack of experimental evidence for the suggested C-N bond fission mechanism has created a gap that this paper aims to fill.

Method: The authors employed non-adiabatic dynamics simulations alongside X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the nitrogen K-edge to investigate the photophysical relaxation mechanism.

Result: The simulations suggest that the cleavage of the C-N bond induces a transient red-shift in the X-ray absorption spectrum.

Conclusion: This study provides a promising experimental pathway to explore the mechanistic basis of photophysical relaxation in spiopyran, which could enhance the efficiency of related photochromic materials.

Abstract: Spiropyran is a prototype photoswitch that undergoes photoinduced
ring-opening via C-O bond fission. The quantum yield for this photochemical
reaction is low, with photophysical relaxation being the dominant process.
Previous theoretical studies have suggested that photophysical relaxation
proceeds via cleavage and subsequent reformation of a C-N bond. However,
experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking; most time-resolved studies
have probed in the ultraviolet-visible domain, where C-N bond fission is
unlikely to leave clear signatures. Here, we use non-adiabatic dynamics
simulations in conjunction with X-ray absorption spectroscopic calculations to
investigate the possibility of tracking the photophysical relaxation in
spiropyran with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the nitrogen
K-edge. The simulations predict that cleavage of the C-N bond results in a
transient red-shift of the X-ray absorption. These results indicate a potential
experimental route to gain a mechanistic understanding of the efficient
photophysical relaxation that limits the efficiency of spiropyran-based
photochromic systems.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are indispensable for exploring the behavior
of atoms and molecules. Grounded in quantum mechanical principles, quantum
molecular dynamics provides high predictive power but its computational cost is
dominated by iterative high-fidelity electronic structure calculations. We
propose a novel model order reduction approach as an alternative to
high-fidelity electronic structure calculation. By learning a low-dimensional
representation of the electronic solution manifold within the Kohn-Sham density
functional theory framework, our model order reduction approach determines the
ground state electronic density by projecting the problem onto a
low-dimensional subspace, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive
iterative optimization of electronic wavefunctions in the full space. We
demonstrate the capability of our method on a water molecule, showing excellent
agreement with high-fidelity simulations for both molecular geometry and
dynamic properties, highlighting the generalizability through carefully
designed parametrization and systematic sampling.

Motivation: Understanding and controlling molecular vibrational states is crucial for advancing chemical reaction catalysis.

Method: A two-cavity mode setup inspired by STIRAP is used, with one cavity pumping the molecular system and the other providing a tunable decay channel via photon leakage.

Result: The setup successfully allows selective population of vibrational states for both coherent and incoherent light sources.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for using strong light-matter coupling in controlling molecular vibrational states for chemical reaction steering.

Abstract: The experimental realization of strong light-matter coupling with molecules
initiated the rapidly evolving field of molecular polaritonics. Most studies
focus on how exciton polaritons, which combine electronic excitations with
confined light modes, alter photochemistry. In this paper, we investigate their
use in selectively exciting molecular vibrational states in the ground state.
Selectively exciting molecules to high vibrational states with infrared lasers
to catalyze ground-state chemical reactions is a challenging task. Here, we
propose a two-cavity mode setup in the electronic strong coupling regime
inspired by the process of Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) to
selectively populate excited vibrational states. One cavity mode actively pumps
the molecular system, while the other provides a highly effective and tunable
decay channel via photon leakage. We demonstrate the ability to selectively
populate vibrational states for coherent and incoherent light sources using a
molecular model system. Our initial findings show high efficiency and suggest a
possible route to steering and controlling chemical reactions in the electronic
ground state based on electronic strong coupling.

TL;DR: Black hole horizons behave unexpectedly under extreme conditions, with entropy corrections and pressure terms exhibiting universal scaling laws similar to quantum phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole thermodynamics, especially under extreme conditions, is crucial for advancing our knowledge of gravitational physics and quantum gravity.

Method: Mathematical analysis of conformal symmetry breakdown during the balding phase, derivation of entropy corrections and pressure terms, and exploration of universal scaling laws.

Result: The study reveals that entropy corrections and pressure terms show universal scaling laws analogous to quantum phase transitions, with extremal black holes acting as quantum critical points.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a deeper connection between black hole thermodynamics and quantum phase transitions, highlighting universal principles in black hole physics that may apply broadly across different scenarios.

Abstract: The behavior of black hole horizons under extreme conditions-such as near
collapse or phase transitions-remains less understood, particularly in the
context of soft hair and Aretakis instabilities. We show that the breakdown of
conformal symmetry during the balding phase induces a topological
reorganization of the horizon, leading to divergent entropy corrections and
emergent pressure terms. These corrections exhibit universal scaling laws,
analogous to quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems, with
extremal limits functioning as quantum critical points. Interestingly, by
employing quasi-equilibrium boundary conditions, one could stabilize horizon
dynamics without explicitly introducing ad hoc higher-order corrections,
further limiting the universal applicability of conformal invariance in black
hole physics.

Result: 在渐近条件下，相干量子功提取的稳态值仅与加速相关的Unruh温度有关；相干ergotropy的动态在渐近条件下满足Kubo-Martin-Schwinger条件；系统的Unruh效应与热平衡态相符；调节相干驱动场的相位可以提高电池的能垒储能力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了匀加速Unruh-DeWitt电池的量子功提取特性与Unruh效应的热属性，为量子热力学和加速量子信息理论提供了新的理解。

Abstract: We propose a physical scheme of a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt battery
and utilize quantum work extraction as a probe to witness the thermal nature of
the Unruh effect induced by the accelerated motion. By employing the open
quantum system approach, we analyze the coherent and incoherent components of
the ergotropy which is the maximum amount of quantum work extraction of the
relativistic battery driven by a coherent field. It has been proved that the
steady values of coherent quantum work extraction in the asymptotic condition
is only determined by the acceleration-dependent Unruh temperature. The
asymptotic behavior of coherent ergotropy can demonstrate the thermal nature of
the Unruh effect with respect to the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition. Under the
circumstance of the Unruh effect, we explore the effect of the phase of the
coherent charging field on the dynamics of coherent ergotropy when the battery
approaches to the same thermal equilibrium state. The variation in the phase of
the coherent driving field can improve the energy storage capacity of a
relativistic battery. From viewpoint of energy transfer, the relativistic
battery is helpful to examine the Unruh thermality.

Abstract: An accelerated charge interacts with itself through the electromagnetic field
that it sources, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic radiation reaction. The
DeWitt-Brehme-Hobbs (DWBH) equation describes the motion of a charged mass in
the presence of combined electromagnetic and gravitational fields, taking into
account electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects. Here, we find the first
exact analytical solution of the DWBH equation in the case of a charged mass in
the presence of copropagating and otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic and
gravitational plane waves. Apart from its intrinsic importance, this solution
approximates that of an ultrarelativistic particle in arbitrary gravitational
and electromagnetic fields. Finally, the paradigmatic example of a sinusoidal
electro-magnetic wave in the presence of a constant-amplitude gravitational
wave is worked out explicitly and it shows how the presence of the
gravitational wave can qualitatively change electromagnetic radiation-reaction
effects.

accuracy better than $10^{-8}$ for all dimensionless spins below 0.99.

Abstract: We analyse the common claim that nonlinear modifications of quantum theory
necessarily violate the second law of thermodynamics. We focus on hypothetical
extensions of quantum theory that contain readout devices. These black boxes
provide a classical description of quantum states without perturbing them. They
allow quantum state cloning, though in a way consistent with the relativistic
no-signalling principle. We review the existence of such devices in the context
of Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity, which postulates that the
gravitational field remains classical and is sourced by the expectation value
of a quantum energy-momentum tensor. We show that the definition of information
in the models examined in this paper deviates from that given by von Neumann
entropy, and that claims of second law violations based on the
distinguishability of non-orthogonal states or on violations of uncertainty
principles fail to hold in such theories.

Abstract: The ringdown phase of the binary black hole (BBH) merger provides a clean and
direct probe of strong-field gravity and tests of the nature of black holes.
The quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies in modified gravity theories, as well as
their amplitudes and phases, might deviate from the Kerr ones in general
relativity. Charged black holes (BHs) in Einstein-Maxwell theory provide an
excellent example of a beyond-Kerr solution with direct astrophysical and
fundamental physics applications. In this work, we extract the ringdown mode
amplitudes and phases for charged BBH mergers based on fully general
relativistic simulations with charge-to-mass ratio up to 0.3. Our results
suggest that even though the inspiral phase of charged BBHs can be
significantly accelerated or decelerated, the ringdown mode excitation only
changes mildly. We further explore the charge detectability with the
ringdown-only signal for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We find
that previous studies may have overestimated the charge detectability and
including higher modes in charged waveforms is necessary for future ringdown
analysis. This constitutes the first such analysis based on waveforms generated
by numerical relativity simulations of charged BHs in full Einstein-Maxwell
theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We implement an analogue Wheeler-DeWitt mini-universe constituted by a
well-isolated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a time-independent
conservative potential. In exact analogy with the Wheeler-DeWitt framework for
the actual universe, our system has the fundamental problem of defining from
within a meaningful time variable over which to order the events. Here, we
partition the mini-universe into a bright and a dark sector, enabling entropy
exchange between them through a potential barrier. We show that the Hamiltonian
of the condensate in the bright sector is analogous to the one in canonical
minisuperspace models. We define an entropic time and show with experimental
data that it is robustly monotonic even when the bright sector undergoes
several cycles that begin with a 'big bang' and end with a 'big crunch'. By
tuning the barrier height, we control the rate of entropy production and thus
the speed of the emergent entropic time and the dynamics of the bright
universe. We finally derive an entropic time-dependent Schroedinger equation
that could be considered as a generalization of the standard one, and use it to
reproduce our data. This work experimentally validates the proposition that
time in quantum cosmological models may not be fundamental, but instead emerges
from thermodynamic gradients, while establishing a concrete experimental
platform for evaluating several aspects of quantum gravity theories.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The research investigates critical collapse in elastic materials, extending the perfect fluid model by incorporating elasticity. Using a scale-invariant elastic matter model, they solve the boundary value problem and identify discrete self-similar solutions, examining their dependence on elasticity parameters like the shear index and Poisson ratio. The addition of elasticity modifies wave speeds and introduces new dynamics in the collapse process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding critical collapse is essential for astrophysics, particularly for compact objects and cosmology. Elastic materials like neutron star crusts add complexity to the model, requiring new theoretical approaches.

Method: They use a scale-invariant elastic matter model and solve the associated boundary value problem numerically, focusing on self-similar solutions for different elasticity parameters.

Result: Elasticity enhances compressibility, introduces negative radial pressures, alters wave speeds, and can lead to multiple sonic points, imposing constraints on elasticity parameters. This study marks the initial step in analyzing critical collapse with elastic materials.

Conclusion: The findings expand the understanding of gravitational collapse in elastic materials, highlighting the importance of including elasticity for accurate modeling of neutron stars and other astrophysical phenomena.

Abstract: Critical collapse is a well-studied subject for a variety of self-gravitating
matter. One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,
which have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as
well as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to
possess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and
critical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In
this work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study
self-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show
that including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,
which we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value
problem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,
but also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid
case, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the
addition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\mathrm{s}$ or
decreasing the Poisson ratio $\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and
can yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the
elastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible
transverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid
case can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not
seem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters
of the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of
critical collapse with elastic materials.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a
massive scalar field in Schwarzschild spacetime using two complementary
numerical techniques: the Hill-determinant method and Leaver continued-fraction
method. Our study systematically compares the performance, convergence, and
consistency of the two approaches across a wide range of field masses and
angular momenta. We identify three critical mass thresholds, $m_{\rm lim}$,
$m_{\rm max}$, and $m_{zd}$, which govern qualitative changes in the QNM
spectrum. In particular, long-lived modes emerge at $m_{zd}$, where the
imaginary part of the frequency vanishes and the mode becomes essentially
non-decaying. This phenomenon is robust across multipoles and may have
important implications for the phenomenology of massive fields around black
holes. Our results provide a detailed numerical characterization of massive
scalar QNMs and highlight the complementary strengths of the Hill-determinant
and continued-fraction methods, paving the way for future studies of rotating
or charged black holes and quasi-bound states.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: When numerically solving Einstein's equations for binary black holes (BBH),
we must find initial data on a three-dimensional spatial slice by solving
constraint equations. The construction of initial data is a multi-step process,
in which one first chooses freely specifiable data that define a conformal
background and impose boundary conditions. Then, one numerically solves
elliptic equations and calculates physical properties such as horizon masses,
spins, and asymptotic quantities from the solution. To achieve desired
properties, one adjusts the free data in an iterative ``control'' loop.
Previous methods for these iterative adjustments rely on Newtonian
approximations and do not allow the direct control of total energy and angular
momentum of the system, which becomes particularly important in the study of
hyperbolic encounters of black holes. Using the $\texttt{SpECTRE}$ code, we
present a novel parameter control procedure that benefits from Broyden's method
in all controlled quantities. We use this control scheme to minimize drifts in
bound orbits and to enable the construction of hyperbolic encounters. We see
that the activation of off-diagonal terms in the control Jacobian gives us
better efficiency when compared to the simpler implementation in the Spectral
Einstein Code ($\texttt{SpEC}$). We demonstrate robustness of the method across
extreme configurations, including spin magnitudes up to $\chi = 0.9999$, mass
ratios up to $q = 50$, and initial separations up to $D_0 = 1000M$. Given the
open-source nature of $\texttt{SpECTRE}$, this is the first time a parameter
control scheme for constructing bound and unbound BBH initial data is available
to the numerical-relativity community.

Abstract: We report on several previously overlooked families of static spherically
symmetric solutions in quadratic gravity. Our main result concerns the
existence of solutions whose leading exponents depend on the ratio
${\omega=\alpha/(3\beta)}$ of the four-derivative couplings. We demonstrate
that the space of models with ${\omega >1}$ contains a dense set that admits
non-Frobenius solutions ${(s_*, 2 - 3 s_*)_0}$ (in standard Schwarzschild
coordinates), with certain rational numbers $s_*(\omega)$. These solutions
correspond to a singular core at ${\bar{r}=0}$. Another related non-Frobenius
family, $(s_*, 2 - 3 s_*)_\infty$, exists for a dense set of models with ${1/4
< \omega < 1}$, describing a singular boundary at ${\bar{r}\to\infty}$. Both
families are uncovered by recasting the metric into special coordinates in
which the solutions become Frobenius. Additionally, for models with any real
ratios ${\omega\neq 1}$ we identify two novel families of non-Frobenius
solutions around generic points ${\bar{r}=\bar{r}_0}$, $(3/2, 0)_{\bar{r}_0,
1/4}$ and $(3/2, 0)_{\bar{r}_0, 1/2}$ describing a wormhole throat. Finally, we
re-derive and summarize all known families of solutions in the standard as well
as in modified Schwarzschild coordinates.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the bound orbits of the timelike particles
and the gravitational waveforms emitted from these orbits around a
renormalization group improved Kerr black hole in the framework of the
asymptotic safety approach. The running Newton coupling in the metric is
characterized by two free quantum parameters $(\omega,\,\gamma)$ arsing from
the non-perturbative renormalization group theory and the appropriate cutoff
identification, respectively. As expected, the radii of the horizon, the
marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable orbit are all decrease as the
quantum parameters increase. Under the extreme mass-ratio inspirals
approximation the deviation of gravitational waveforms radiated by the periodic
orbits from those in the classical Kerr background increases with the two
quantum parameter. However, this effect is much smaller in the retrograde case
compared to the prograde case. Especially, by comparing the characteristic
strain of those gravitational wave with the sensitivity curve of several
potential detectors, we find that their characteristic frequencies can fall
within the sensitivity ranges of several planned gravitational wave
observatories, suggesting that such signals may be detectable with sufficient
instrumental sensitivity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: GW230814 was detected by the LIGO Livingston observatory with a
signal-to-noise ratio of 42.4 making it the loudest gravitational-wave signal
in the GWTC-4.0 catalog. The source is consistent with a binary black hole
coalescence similar to those in the previously observed population, with
component masses $m_1 = 33.7^{+2.9}_{-2.2}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $m_2 =
28.2^{+2.2}_{-3.1} M_\odot$, and small effective inspiral spin
$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}= -0.01^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. The high signal-to-noise ratio
enabled us to confidently detect an $\ell = |m| = 4$ mode in the inspiral
signal for the first time, and enables a range of tests of consistency between
theoretical predictions and the observed waveform. Most of these tests show
good agreement with expectations from general relativity. However, a few
indicate deviations, particularly in the ringdown part of the signal. We find
that deviations comparable to those observed can be obtained from similar
simulated signals based on general relativity and detector noise effects.
Therefore, the apparent deviations do not provide evidence for a violation of
general relativity. The observation of GW230814 demonstrates that while the
unprecedented sensitivity of the detectors enable highly significant detections
with a single observatory, drawing robust inferences about fundamental physics
remains limited without data from a multiple observatory network.

TL;DR: Searches for long-transient and continuous gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around black holes failed to find evidence, but set upper limits on boson mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave searches aim to confirm or refute alternative theories of gravity, such as those involving ultralight vector bosons, which could explain phenomena like the early universe or dark matter.

Method: Two semicoherent methods were used: HMM for remnants of GW230814 and GW231123, and BSD for the Cygnus X-1 binary. HMM targets remnants from binary black hole mergers, while BSD is more general.

Result: No signals were detected. Specific mass ranges were statistically disfavored: HMM searches ruled out [0.94, 1.08] and [2.75, 3.28] × 10⁻¹³ eV at 30% confidence, and BSD ruled out [0.85, 1.59] × 10⁻¹³ eV at 95% confidence with a black hole spin >0.5.

Conclusion: While constraints are not yet tight, future observations could tighten the bounds on ultralight vector boson masses.

Abstract: We present the first directed searches for long-transient and continuous
gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around known black
holes (BHs). We use LIGO data from the first part of the fourth
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. The searches target two distinct types of BHs
and use two new semicoherent methods: hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking for
the remnant BHs of the mergers GW230814_230901 and GW231123_135430 (referred to
as GW230814 and GW231123 in this study), and a dedicated method using the Band
Sampled Data (BSD) framework for the galactic BH in the Cygnus X-1 binary
system. Without finding evidence of a signal from vector bosons in the data, we
estimate the mass range that can be constrained. For the HMM searches targeting
the remnants from GW231123 and GW230814, we disfavor vector boson masses in the
ranges $[0.94, 1.08]$ and $[2.75, 3.28] \times 10^{-13}$ eV, respectively, at
30% confidence, assuming a 1% false alarm probability. Although these searches
are only marginally sensitive to signals from merger remnants at relatively
large distances, future observations are expected to yield more stringent
constraints with high confidence. For the BSD search targeting the BH in Cygnus
X-1, we exclude vector boson masses in the range $[0.85, 1.59] \times 10^{-13}$
eV at 95% confidence, assuming an initial BH spin larger than 0.5.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It has recently been proved that, for constant density stars, there is a
critical value $\Lambda^{*}=1$ for the dimensionless density parameter
$\Lambda\equiv 4\pi R^2\rho_{\text{max}}$ of the star above which the
asymptotically measured travel time $T_{\text{s}}$ along a semi-circular
trajectory that connects two antipodal points on the surface of the star is
{\it shorter} than the travel time $T_{\text{c}}$ along the (shorter)
straight-line trajectory that connects the two antipodal points through the
center of the compact star [here $\{R,\rho_{\text{max}}\}$ are respectively the
radius and the maximum density of the compact astrophysical object]. This
intriguing observation provides a nice illustration of the general relativistic
time dilation (redshift) effect in highly curved spacetimes. One expects that
generic compact astrophysical objects whose dimensionless density parameters
are smaller than some critical value $\Lambda^*$ would be characterized by the
`normal' relation $T_{\text{c}}\leq T_{\text{s}}$ for the travel times between
the two antipodal points. Motivated by this expectation, in the present paper
we prove, using analytical techniques, that spherically symmetric compact
astrophysical objects whose dimensionless density parameters are bounded from
above by the model-independent relation
$\Lambda\leq\Lambda^*={3\over2}[1-({{2}\over{\pi}})^{2/5}]$ are always
(regardless of their inner density profiles) characterized by the normal
dimensionless ratio $T_{\text{c}}/T_{\text{s}}\leq1$.

Abstract: The Carrollian limit ($c \to 0$) of General Relativity provides the geometric
language for describing null hypersurfaces, such as black hole event horizons
and null infinity. Motivated by the well-established electric and magnetic
limits of Galilean electromagnetism, we perform a systematic analysis of the
low-velocity limit of linearized gravity to derive its Carrollian counterparts.
Using a 1+3 covariant decomposition, we study the transformation properties of
linear tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) on a
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background under Carrollian boosts. We
demonstrate that, analogous to the electromagnetic case, the full set of
linearized Einstein's equations is not Carrollian-invariant. Instead, the
theory bifurcates into two distinct and consistent frameworks: a Carrollian
Electric Limit and a Carrollian Magnetic Limit. In the electric limit, dynamics
are frozen, leaving a static theory of tidal forces ($E_{ab}$) constrained by
the matter distribution. In contrast, the Magnetic Limit yields a consistent
dynamical theory where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor ($H_{ab}$), which
governs gravito-magnetic and radiative effects, remains well-defined and is
sourced by the spacetime shear. This framework resolves ambiguities in defining
Carrollian gravity and provides a robust theory for gravito-magnetic dynamics
in ultra-relativistic regimes. Our results have direct implications for the
study of black hole horizons, gravitational memory, and the holographic
principle.

Abstract: In this work, we treat black holes as bifurcation points and explore their
thermodynamic phase structure using the framework of bifurcation theory which
is a commonly used method from nonlinear dynamics. By constructing an
appropriate bifurcating function, we analyze how black holes transition between
different thermodynamic phases through changes in the number and stability of
fixed points. Our study shows that stable fixed points correspond to
thermodynamically stable black hole states, while unstable ones indicate
instability and decay. The dynamical evolution of the system further supports
this correspondence, with stable configurations approaching equilibrium and
unstable ones diverging from it.

*Jiawei Chen,Jinsong Yang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates how quantum gravity affects spinning particles' motion around a black hole by studying their effective potential, circular orbits, and bound orbits. Results show that minor quantum effects (parametrized by ζ) barely alter particle trajectories, especially in Schwarzschild-like spacetimes, but can differentiate from other models under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum gravitational effects on spacetime and particle motion is key in modern theoretical physics. This paper provides insights into how such effects modify classical black hole physics.

Method: The authors use the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, coupling with an effective potential derived from quantum gravity corrections to study 4-momentum, 4-velocity, and orbit properties.

Result: The presence of quantum corrections (via ζ) causes slight changes in effective potential and orbital dynamics but mostly maintains Schwarzschild-like behavior for spinning particles.

Conclusion: Quantum gravity effects are generally weak in particle motion, but they can lead to discernible differences under certain scenarios and distinct quantum gravity corrections models.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the motion of spinning particles around a
covariant quantum-corrected black hole without a Cauchy horizon within the
framework of effective quantum gravity, and examine the influence of quantum
gravitational effects on the motion of these spinning particles. First, we
employ the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations to derive the 4-momentum and
4-velocity of spinning particles, and introduce the effective potential for
radial motion using the components of the 4-momentum. We find that an increase
in the quantum parameter $\zeta$ leads to a decrease in the effective
potential, while the spin $S$ significantly affects the magnitude of the
effective potential. Then, through the effective potential, we investigate the
properties of circular orbits and the innermost stable circular orbit, and
discuss the timelike condition that spinning particles must satisfy when moving
around the black hole. Finally, we study the trajectories of spinning particles
on bound orbits around the quantum-corrected black hole and compare them with
those around other covariant quantum-corrected black holes. The results show
that the trajectories of spinning particles in this quantum-corrected black
hole model are weakly influenced by $\zeta$, making them almost
indistinguishable from those in the Schwarzschild black hole, but they can be
distinguished from other covariant quantum-corrected models under certain
initial conditions. These results contribute to our understanding of black hole
properties under quantum corrections.

Abstract: We re-examine the decoherence rate of primordial fluctuations within minimal
inflationary models, using only the gravitational interactions required for the
underlying fluctuation-generation mechanism itself. Since gravity provides the
weakest interactions the result provides a plausible floor on the rate of
primordial decoherence. Previous calculations (arXiv:2211.11046) did so using
only a subset of these interactions, motivated by assuming both system and
environment were super-Hubble. We extend this by including the effects on
super-Hubble modes of {\it all} gravitational interactions at leading order in
H/Mp (and so need not restrict the decohering environment to being
super-Hubble). We show how the decohering evolution becomes Markovian for
super-Hubble modes, without the need to appeal to truncations (like the
`rotating wave' approximation) that are often used in optics but can be
inapprorpriate for cosmology. We find that the dominant contribution comes from
the nonlocal cubic interactions obtained by solving the constraints. We
identify UV divergences systematically and verify thereby that the leading part
of the purity evolution is UV finite. In the end we find a decoherence rate
that grows in the super-Hubble regime significantly {\it faster} than found
earlier. We take the preliminary steps to resum this result to late times and
briefly discuss why they are more complicated than for earlier calculations.

Motivation: Understanding how quantum gravity effects and string clouds modify black hole properties is crucial for observational astronomy.

Method: Theoretical analysis in the weak-field limit, deriving analytic expressions for deflection angles and lensing observables.

Result: The study shows that the presence of string clouds and holonomy corrections affects light deflection and accretion disk properties, potentially providing observable signatures of quantum gravity effects.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that these modifications leave measurable imprints, offering viable avenues for observational constraints in the strong-gravity regime.

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the deflection of light, lensing
equations, topological properties of photon rings, and accretion disk
characteristics in the spacetime of a holonomy-corrected Schwarzschild black
hole surrounded by a cloud of strings. The analysis is carried out in the
weak-field limit, where we analytically derive expressions for the deflection
angle and extract the corresponding lensing observables. These results reveal
the dependence of light deflection on the string cloud parameter and the
holonomy correction parameter, offering potential observational signatures of
underlying quantum gravity effects. We model possible gravitational scenarios
to explore the distinguishing features of this modified BH geometry and assess
its deviation from classical solutions through gravitational lensing behavior.
Furthermore, we analyze the topological structure of the photon sphere by
constructing a normalized vector field and demonstrate how it is affected by
the presence of string clouds and holonomy corrections. Finally, we examine the
properties of a thin accretion disk in this BH background, showing that both
the string cloud and holonomy parameters significantly influence the disk's
radiation profile, temperature distribution, and spectral characteristics. Our
results suggest that these modifications leave measurable imprints, providing
viable avenues for observational constraints in the strong-gravity regime.

Result: 模型得出的信号到噪声比接近标准双黑洞合并模型，但贝叶斯因子不足以排除虫洞假设。

Conclusion: 尽管贝叶斯因子不显著，但可能需要更多的数据来确认是否为虫洞引力波回声。

Abstract: A particularly compelling aspect of the GW190521 event detected by the
LIGO-Virgo collaboration is that it has an extremely short duration, and lacks
a clearly identifiable inspiral phase usually observed in the binary black
holes (BBHs) coalescence. In this work, we hypothesize that GW190521 might
represent a single, isolated gravitational wave (GW) echo pulse from the
wormhole, which is the postmerger remnant of BBHs in another universe and
connected to our universe through a throat. The ringdown signal after BBHs
merged in another universe can pass through the throat of wormhole and be
detected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse. Our analysis results
indicate that our model yields a network signal-to-noise ratio comparable to
that of the standard BBHs merger model reported by the LIGO-Virgo
collaboration. Though the Bayesian factor slightly prefers the standard BBHs
merger model, it is not significant enough to rule out the possibility that the
echo-for-wormhole model is a viable hypothesis for the GW190521 event.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the significantly improved sensitivity and a wider frequency band, the
next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are anticipated to detect
$\sim 10^5$ GW signals per year with durations from hours to days, leading to
inevitable signal overlaps in the data stream. While a direct fitting for all
signals is infeasible, extracting only one signal will be biased by its overlap
with other signals. From this perspective, understanding how the biases arise
from the overlapping and their dependence on the signal parameters is crucial
for developing effective algorithms. In this work, we extend the anatomy of
biases in single-detector cases to a detector network. Specifically, we focus
on the bias dependence on the sky location, polarization and inclination
angles, as well as the coalescence time and phase. We propose a new quantity,
named the bias integral, as a useful tool, and establish relationship between
the biases in a single detector and that in the entire network, with explicit
dependence on extrinsic parameters. Using a 3-detector network as an example,
we further explore the potential of a network to suppress biases due to the
detectors' different locations and orientations. We find that location
generally has a smaller effect than orientation, and becomes significant only
when the time separation between signals is below sub-seconds. Through a
population-level simulation over the extrinsic parameters, we find that nearly
half of overlapping signals will lead to larger biases in the network compared
to a single detector, highlighting the need to cope with overlapping biases in
a detector network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of gravitational waves from binary white dwarf systems in the dHz band could provide unprecedented insights into the physics of these systems and their role in cosmic events like Type Ia supernovae.

Method: The study uses the LGWA detector's capabilities, employing realistic spatial distributions, merger rates, and binary-mass models from population synthesis. The sources are simulated using the SeBa code, and detection assessment is done with Fisher matrix methods from GWFish and Legwork.

Result: LGWA is projected to detect ~30 galactic and ~10 extragalactic double white dwarf mergers, significantly advancing our understanding of Type Ia supernovae and white dwarf dynamics.

Conclusion: This observational strategy offers a unique approach to studying these systems across cosmic scales.

Abstract: The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed gravitational-wave
detector that will observe in the decihertz (dHz) frequency region. In this
band, binary white dwarf systems are expected to merge, emitting gravitational
waves. Detecting this emission opens new perspectives for understanding the
Type Ia supernova progenitors and for investigating dense matter physics. In
this work, we present the capabilities of LGWA to detect and localize
short-period double white dwarfs in terms of sky locations and distances. The
analysis is performed using a realistic spatial distribution of sources, merger
rates, and binary-mass distributions derived from current population synthesis
models. The simulated population of double white dwarfs is generated using the
SeBa stellar-evolution code, coupled with dedicated sampling algorithms. The
performance of the LGWA detector, both in terms of signal detectability and
parameter estimation, is assessed using standard gravitational-wave data
analysis techniques, including Fisher matrix methods, as implemented in the
GWFish and Legwork codes. The analysis indicates that LGWA could detect
approximately O(30) monochromatic galactic sources and O(10) extragalactic
mergers, demonstrating the unique potential of decihertz gravitational-wave
detectors to access and characterize extragalactic DWD populations. This will
open new avenues for understanding Type Ia supernova progenitors and the
physics of DWDs.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores the implications of modified gravity, specifically non-metricity-based f(Q) theory, using BAO and supernova datasets to examine dark energy density and perturbation signatures in modified gravity compared to standard gravity. They use a model-independent approach to estimate effective gravitational coupling (μ) and gravitational wave damping parameter (ν), and conclude that while μ remains relatively insensitive to dataset choice, ν shows distinct behavior between older and newer datasets. The findings suggest that studying gravitational wave propagation in modified gravity could be fruitful with future detectors like LISA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of dark energy and modified gravity is a key goal in cosmology, and this paper provides a method to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity scenarios by analyzing perturbation signatures of gravitational waves.

Method: The authors employ a model-independent approach using BAO and supernova data to reconstruct dark energy density and estimate perturbation-level quantities such as effective gravitational coupling (μ) and gravitational wave damping parameter (ν). They compare findings from older (Pantheon+) and newer (DESyr5) datasets.

Result: The study reveals that the effective gravitational coupling (μ) shows little sensitivity to the choice of supernova datasets, while the gravitational wave damping parameter (ν) exhibits distinct behavior between older and newer datasets. This suggests that future gravitational wave observations, especially with detectors like LISA, could provide valuable insights into modified gravity theories.

Conclusion: This paper provides compelling evidence that studying gravitational wave propagation in modified gravity theories is a viable and important direction, particularly with the upcoming capabilities of gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer.

Abstract: We discuss the implications of the most recent DESI Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations (BAO) DR2 and DESyr5 compilation of supernovae (SNe) datasets for
modified gravity focusing on non-metricity based $f(Q)$ theory, by employing a
`model-independent' approach. We reconstruct of dark energy density which is
then extended to estimate the perturbation-level quantities, sourced by the
modified gravity, namely the effective gravitational coupling, $\mu$, and the
amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave propagation, $\nu$. In light
of the remarkable hints for a dynamical dark energy emerging from the analysis
of background cosmological data, we discuss the possibility to distinguish
between dark energy and modified gravity scenarios from their scalar and tensor
perturbation-level signatures. We contrast our findings between the older
Pantheon+ and the newer DESyr5 compilations of SNe datasets, which predict a
significant distinct signature in the damping parameter of the gravitational
wave propagation amplitude. On the other hand, the prediction for the effective
gravitational coupling remains insensitive to the choice of the SNe datasets.
Our results provide a strong case for the study of gravitational wave
propagation in modified gravity theories, in light of the new generation of
gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic
Explorer.

### [61] [THz-PINNs: Time-Domain Forward Modeling of Terahertz Spectroscopy with Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07161)
*Pengfei Zhu,Xavier Maldague*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR:  PINNs offer a promising solution for THz-TDS modeling by addressing the challenges of high temporal and spatial resolution, providing accurate simulations with reduced computational demands compared to FEM and FDTD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The need for accurate and efficient THz-TDS modeling arises due to the complex requirements of capturing high temporal and spatial resolution for THz wave propagation.

Method:  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are employed for the first time in THz-TDS modeling, leveraging their capability to incorporate physical laws and optimize network training to solve forward problems in the time domain.

Result:  The study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of PINNs in advancing THz wave simulation and analysis, highlighting their effectiveness in handling the challenges of high temporal and spatial resolution.

Conclusion:  By integrating PINNs, this work paves the way for more efficient and precise THz-TDS modeling, opening new possibilities for material characterization and analysis.

Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a powerful tool for
extracting optical and electrical parameters, as well as probing internal
structures and surface morphology of materials. However, conventional
simulation techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM) and
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD), face challenges in accurately modeling
THz wave propagation. These difficulties arise from the broad operating
bandwidth of THz-TDS (~0.1-10 THz), which demands extremely high temporal
resolution to capture pulse dynamics and fine spatial resolution to resolve
microstructures and interface effects. To address these limitations, we
introduce physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into THz-TDS modeling for
the first time. Through a comprehensive analysis of forward problems in the
time domain, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of PINNs as a
powerful framework for advancing THz wave simulation and analysis.

Abstract: Wavelength division multiplexers are fundamental to the functioning and
performance of integrated photonic circuits, with applications ranging from
optical interconnects to sensing and quantum technologies. Current solutions
are limited by trade-offs between channel spacing, crosstalk, insertion loss,
and device footprint. Here, we develop a novel design approach that
co-optimizes inverse-designed wavelength division multiplexers and distributed
Bragg gratings to achieve ultra-low crosstalk without compromising insertion
loss. We experimentally demonstrate less than -40 dB crosstalk for wavelength
channel spacing of 15 nm in foundry-compatible silicon devices across the
telecommunications C- and L-bands. Our design process is highly adaptable,
allowing for seamless scaling to a greater number of output channels, different
spectral windows, and easy translation across various material platforms.

Abstract: The interplay between disorder and synchronization in nonlinear oscillator
networks has long been known to give rise to counterintuitive phenomena, such
as disorder-enhanced coherence. We uncover a frequency-disorder mediated
synchronization resonance in coupled external-cavity semiconductor diode
lasers. Specifically, we find that intrinsic random frequency detuning among
the lasers can enhance synchronization, reaching a maximum at an optimal
coupling strength in the weak-coupling regime. The resonance is genuinely
disorder-mediated, as it vanishes in the corresponding disorder-free system. To
explain this phenomenon, we develop a physical theory based on an effective
thermodynamic potential, which also accounts for the associated scaling
behavior. Our results establish semiconductor laser arrays as a versatile
experimental platform for investigating disorder-driven collective dynamics,
with potential implications for a broad class of nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The relentless growth of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) has created
unprecedented demand for computational power, straining the energy, bandwidth,
and scaling limits of conventional electronic platforms. Electronic-photonic
integrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for
next-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high
bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and
interconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for
sustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and
lower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon
footprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,
while delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and
interconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI
systems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and
cross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We
present how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing
both chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer
device-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for
photonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip
area cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI
workloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by
tolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with
EPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and
robustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI
systems. This perspective highlights how EPIC AI systems can simultaneously
meet the performance demands of modern AI and the urgent imperative for
sustainable computing.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method to enhance coupling between quantum-confined surface plasmons (LSPs) in CdO and surface phonon polaritons (LSPhPs) in sapphire, achieving near-field enhancements of over 1000x for mid-IR applications, with potential for scalable infrared sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mid-IR sensing and spectroscopy have significant potential, but current plasmonic materials face limitations due to optical losses. The paper explores overcoming these challenges through coupling of LSPs and LSPhPs in two different materials.

Method: The researchers developed a dry etching protocol to fabricate stripe arrays with tunable sizes in CdO, enabling spectral alignment between LSPs and LSPhPs. They demonstrated both experimentally and numerically that hybrid modes emerge when these polaritons become resonant, leading to coupling. Finite element simulations were used to confirm the near-field enhancements.

Result: The experiments and simulations showed near-field enhancements exceeding a factor of 1000, with spatially extended polaritons hundreds of nanometers in size around the etched structures. This represents a significant advancement in scalable, high-performance infrared sensing platforms.

Conclusion: The work bridges the plasmonic and phononic responses of two mid-IR active materials, offering a promising approach for scalable infrared sensing applications.

Abstract: The mid-infrared spectral region presents significant potential for sensing
and spectroscopic applications. However, traditional plasmonic materials
exhibit substantial optical losses within this range, thereby constraining
their effectiveness. Emerging materials such as cadmium oxide (CdO) have
demonstrated promise in overcoming these limitations. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach to engineer large coupling between localized surface
plasmons (LSPs) in CdO and localized surface phonon polaritons (LSPhP) in
sapphire. By developing a successful dry etching protocol for CdO, we fabricate
stripe arrays with tunable sizes, allowing the spectral alignment between the
LSP and LSPhP modes. We demonstrate both experimentally and numerically that
when these polaritons become resonant, hybrid modes emerge, resulting in
coupling. Finite element simulations reveal near-field enhancements exceeding a
factor of 1000, spatially extended hundreds of nanometers around the etched
structures. Our approach bridges the plasmonic and phononic responses of two
mid-IR active materials, paving the way for scalable, high-performance infrared

Abstract: Surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) are crucial for confining light beyond the
diffraction limit, yet heavy metal losses often limit their spectral
localization. Here, we propose a practical strategy for enabling the spectral
localization of single-nanoparticle SPRs through photonic substrate
engineering, which creates distinct optical pathways (OPs) to tailor the
electromagnetic environments around plasmonic nanoparticles. By analyzing the
multiplication factor spectrum of the projected local density of states, we can
trace and control these OPs, enabling strong spatial and spectral confinement
of single-nanoparticle SPRs. Simulations reveal that a photonic crystal
substrate can reduce the mode volume by fivefold and boost the quality factor
by over 80 times compared to a metal nanoparticle on a dielectric substrate.
Proof-of-concept experiments using two types of leaking Fabry-Perot photonic
substrates demonstrate active manipulation of SPRs in both "open" and "closed"
OP states. This multidimensional photonic substrate engineering establishes a
customizable platform for single-nanoparticle plasmonics, potentially
transforming applications that were previously limited by spectral
localization.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical investigation into the radio frequency
(RF) field behavior within miniaturized all-glass and hybrid vapor cell
geometries designed for Rydberg atom-based electrometry. Using full-vector
finite element modeling (FEM), we analyze electromagnetic field enhancement
across a wide frequency range (0.05 GHz to 150 GHz) as a function of
polarization, incidence angle, and structural configuration. Two primary vapor
cell designs are evaluated: translationally invariant "open" cells and
periodically structured "supported" cells composed entirely of low-loss glass,
as well as hybrid structures incorporating highly doped silicon. Our
simulations reveal that the structured all-glass vapor cells exhibit sharp,
angle- and polarization-dependent resonant peaks due to guided-mode coupling,
resulting in localized RF power enhancements exceeding 8x. In contrast,
silicon-based structures demonstrate significant electric field attenuation and
suppression of resonant features due to their high dielectric losses. Through
k-vector and angle-resolved analyses, we show how cell geometry and material
properties critically influence the RF field distribution and coupling
efficiency. Our findings open new possibilities for optimizing vapor cell
architectures to enhance field sensitivity, directional and polarization
selectivity, and integration potential in chip-scale quantum sensing platforms
based on Rydberg atoms.

Motivation: Understanding extreme events in nonlinear dynamical systems is challenging, and this paper aims to provide insights through statistical analysis and modeling techniques.

Method: The study employs numerical methods such as bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents, alongside theoretical methods including the derivation of analytical formulae using a randomized infinite-modal map.

Result: The key findings include the derivation of analytical formulae for statistical properties (Lyapunov exponents, height probability distributions, and interevent interval probability distributions) and the development of a parameter estimation method, validated through practical application to non-stationary data.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a foundation for predicting extreme events in nonlinear dynamical systems using infinite-modal maps, offering both theoretical and practical contributions for future research.

Abstract: Predicting extreme events in nonlinear dynamical systems is challenging due
to a limited understanding of their statistical properties. This study
numerically and theoretically investigates the statistical properties of
infinite-modal maps arising from homoclinic bursting to predict extreme events.
The numerical investigation presents bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents,
height probability distributions, and interevent interval probability
distributions for infinite-modal maps. The theoretical analysis derives
analytical formulae for these statistical properties using a randomized
infinite-modal map, which builds upon the randomization theory of
infinite-modal maps developed in a previous study. Furthermore, a parameter
estimation method for infinite-modal maps is proposed, utilizing the derived
analytical formula, which enables practical application of the theoretical
results. Finally, the study demonstrates the applicability of the approach in
analyzing non-stationary data with time-dependent parameters. These findings
provide a foundation for mechanism-based prediction of extreme events.

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: Introduce a method called Extrema-Segmented Entropy (ExSEnt) to decompose time-series complexity into timing and magnitude contributions, validate it on nonlinear systems, and demonstrate its application in physiology and finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complexity analysis of time-series data is crucial for understanding underlying dynamics in various fields. Existing methods may overlook the dual nature of such signals, leading to incomplete insights. There is a need for a method that disentangles temporal and amplitude variations to provide a more nuanced understanding.

Method: ExSEnt partitions a signal into monotonic segments by detecting sign changes in the first-order increments. For each segment, it calculates the interval duration and net amplitude change. Two entropy-based metrics—sample entropy on durations, sample entropy on amplitudes, and joint entropy—are computed to quantify complexity from timing and magnitude perspectives.

Result: The method successfully separates and quantifies the contributions of temporal and magnitude variations to time-series complexity. The validation on canonical nonlinear dynamical systems demonstrates its ability to capture complexity changes and detect transitions between different regimes.Empirical tests in electromyography and Parkinson's disease show that ExSEnt isolates feature-specific complexity sources, offering improved interpretability.

Conclusion: ExSEnt provides a novel framework for analyzing time-series complexity by attributing variations to distinct signal features, enhancing interpretability and broadening its applicability in scientific research.

Abstract: We introduce Extrema-Segmented Entropy (ExSEnt), a feature-decomposed
framework for quantifying time-series complexity that separates temporal from
amplitude contributions. The method partitions a signal into monotonic segments
by detecting sign changes in the first-order increments. For each segment, it
extracts the interval duration and the net amplitude change, generating two
sequences that reflect timing and magnitude variability, respectively.
Complexity is then quantified by computing sample entropy on durations and
amplitudes, together with their joint entropy. This decomposition reveals
whether overall irregularity is driven by timing, amplitude, or their coupling,
providing a richer and more interpretable characterization than unidimensional
metrics. We validate ExSEnt on canonical nonlinear dynamical systems (Logistic
map, Rossler system, Rulkov map), demonstrating its ability to track complexity
changes across control parameter sweeps and detect transitions between periodic
and chaotic regimes. Then, we illustrate the empirical utility of ExSEnt
metrics to isolate feature-specific sources of complexity in real data
(electromyography and ankle acceleration in Parkinsons disease). ExSEnt thus
complements existing entropy measures by attributing complexity to distinct
signal features, improving interpretability and supporting applications in a
broad range of domains, including physiology, finance, and geoscience.

TL;DR: This paper examines how higher-order interactions influence tipping cascades in complex systems with tipping points, demonstrating significant effects through numerical simulations on various network topologies and application to real-world social networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the impact of higher-order interactions on tipping cascades in complex systems, given the increasing complexity and interconnectivity of modern networks in ecosystems, climate systems, and socio-technical infrastructures.

Method: The study uses numerical simulations on random, scale-free, and small-world networks to assess the role of higher-order interactions under different coupling strengths and network topologies. They also apply their findings to real-world social networks.

Result: Higher-order interactions can induce cascades even when pairwise interactions fail. The study identifies how pairwise and higher-order coupling strengths interplay, and how repulsive higher-order interactions can suppress or alter the route of cascades.

Conclusion: Higher-order interactions significantly influence the dynamics of tipping cascades, offering valuable insights for predicting and managing critical transitions in complex systems.

Abstract: Tipping points are critical thresholds of parameters where tiny perturbations
can lead to abrupt and large qualitative changes in the systems. Many
real-world systems that exhibit tipping behavior can be represented as networks
of interacting multistable units, such as vegetation patches or infrastructure
networks, undergoing both pairwise and higher-order interactions. In this
article, we explore how higher-order interactions shape the dynamics of tipping
cascades in a conceptual system with tipping points. Numerical simulations on
random, scale-free, and small-world networks reveal that higher-order
interactions can induce cascades even at coupling strengths, where only
pairwise interactions fail to do so. We also investigate the interplay of the
pairwise and higher-order coupling strengths in random networks and illustrate
the route to cascades through bifurcation diagrams. These results have also
been demonstrated on real-world social networks. Apart from this, we show that
repulsive higher-order interactions suppress tipping cascades at coupling
strengths where pairwise interactions would cause them, and shift the cascade
route from a saddle-node to a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Our results
highlight the critical role of higher-order interactions in shaping cascade
dynamics, offering insights for anticipating and mitigating critical
transitions in ecosystems, climate systems, and socio-technical
infrastructures.

Abstract: Optical systems capable of generating fields with sub-wavelength spatial
features have become standard in science and engineering research and industry.
Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical
lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both
intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales. We use a single
trapped atomic ion, confined to approximately 40 nm X 40 nm X 180 nm to sense a
laser light field at a wavelength of 370 nm. With its spatial extent smaller
than the absorption cross-section of a resonant detector, the ion-sensor
operates at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution. Our technique relies
on developing an analytical model of the ion-light interaction and using the
model to extract the intensity and polarization. An important insight provided
in this work is also that the inverse of this model can be learned, in a
restricted sense, on a deep neural network, speeding up the intensity and
polarization readout by five orders of magnitude. This speed-up makes the
technique field-deployable to characterize optical instruments by probing light
at the sub-wavelength scale.

Motivation:  Understanding heavy element production in r-process is pivotal for cosmology and astrophysics, while accurate modeling of kilonova spectra is crucial for astrophysical observations and simulations.

Method: The study employed pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock with plane wave born approximation and distorted waves method using AUTOSTRUCTURE to compute electron-impact excitation in Sr II.

Result:  Comparison with R-matrix data validated the computational methods' accuracy for heavy elements, establishing reliable benchmarks for nebular-phase modeling.

Conclusion: This work enhances our ability to model kilonova ejecta spectra, improving understanding of early universe nucleosynthesis events.

Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger in 2017
(GW170817) and the associated kilonova (AT2017gfo) confirmed these events as
key sites for heavy element production through the r-process. Subsequent
observations, including late-time spectra with \textit{JWST}, have highlighted
the need for accurate modeling of kilonova ejecta. In the photospheric phase,
atomic level populations can be estimated under LTE using Boltzmann and Saha
relations, but about a week after the merger the ejecta enters the nebular
phase where non-LTE effects dominate. Modeling nebular spectra therefore
requires a detailed treatment of radiative and collisional processes that
affect the population of atomic levels. This work focuses on electron-impact
excitation in Sr II, a heavy ion relevant for kilonova spectra. Two
computational approaches are employed: the Plane Wave Born approximation within
the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, and a Distorted Waves method using
AUTOSTRUCTURE. The resulting collision strengths are compared against reference
R-matrix data to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations and their
suitability for large-scale applications to all heavy elements. In addition,
radiative parameters for forbidden transitions are computed. These results
provide an essential benchmark of approximations that could be used to compute
atomic data for nebular-phase kilonova modeling.

Abstract: We demonstrate a continuous spectroscopy technique with frequency sensitivity
well below the natural transition linewidth, while maintaining a locking range
hundreds of times larger. The method exploits the position dependence of a
continuous, broadband magneto-optical trap operating on the 7.5 kHz-wide
intercombination line of strontium. We show that the frequency sensitivity is
fundamentally insensitive to the effective MOT laser linewidth. By applying
active feedback on the MOT position to a dispersion-optimized frequency comb,
which serves as the reference for stabilizing the MOT laser, we achieve a
frequency instability below $4.4\times10^{-13}$ after 400 s of averaging in
both the optical and radio-frequency domains, surpassing the performance of
conventional hot-vapor modulation transfer spectroscopy. Our method is a
broadly applicable alternative route to long-term frequency references in the
high $10^{-14}$ range around 100 s.

Abstract: We demonstrate that energy levels of excited states in a hydrogenic system
consisting of an arbitrary nucleus and an antiproton can be calculated within
the framework of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics, even for a large
nuclear charge $Z$. It is because for rotational states the expansion parameter
is $Z\,\alpha/n$. The main advantage of this approach is the possibility of
exact inclusion of the finite nuclear mass, which we achieve up to the
$(Z\,\alpha)^6$ order. In addition, we include unperturbatively the one-loop
and two-loop electron vacuum polarization (evp) potentials in the
nonrelativistic Hamiltonian, as well as in the leading relativistic correction.
The obtained results for $l>1$ states of antiprotonic atoms with spinless
nucleus are the most accurate to date. We make available a user-friendly {\sl
Mathematica} code for antiprotonic atoms {\sl PbarSpectr}, which can be further
improved by combining evp potentials with $(Z\,\alpha)^5$ QED effects, by
adding three-loop evp, and by extending to an arbitrary nuclear spin. Finally,
we note that rotational states of antiprotonic atoms can be used to determine
the mean square nuclear charge radius much more accurately than from electronic
or muonic atoms.

Abstract: The independent atom model - pixel counting method (IAM-PCM) for the
description of ion-molecule collisions is reviewed. The method was introduced
(in 2016) to improve on the simple additivity rule according to which
scattering cross sections for a molecular target can be obtained by summing up
the cross sections of the constituent atoms. The key idea of the IAM-PCM is the
inclusion of weight factors in the summation, to be determined from a
geometrical interpretation of the resultant cross section as a combined area of
overlapping atomic contributions, which is calculated via a pixelization
technique. We argue here that the IAM-PCM can be conceptualized in a different
but equivalent way by associating each pixel in the area decomposition with a
scattering event. The calculation of net and charge-state correlated capture
and ionization cross sections is explained, and results for 10 keV to 10 MeV
proton impact are discussed for a number of targets ranging from compact
ten-electron systems to large biomolecules. A previously observed scaling
behaviour of the net ionization cross sections is revisited and shown to be
captured by a simple parametrization with remarkable accuracy.

Abstract: We perform a theoretical study of a continuous superradiant laser supporting
its experimental realization at FEMTO-ST using two sequentially-emitting
ensembles of ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ atoms coupled to the same Fabry-Perot
cavity. Using an open quantum system approach, we identify for the simplest
case the parameter space where the laser reaches tens of picowatts of power
with a sub-millihertz linewidth. Studying the impact of inhomogeneous frequency
broadening and variations in atom-cavity coupling on the superradiant emission,
we find the laser properties robust with respect to such perturbations, also
thanks to the occurrence of synchronization of the atomic dipoles. We then
consider a two-site configuration, in which atoms in each site are equally
coupled to the cavity and have equal detunings, with different values for the
two ensembles. We find for balanced and imbalanced atom numbers that
synchronization leads in a certain parameter space to a single narrow spectral
line whose central frequency follows the weighted average frequency. This
result indicates that sequential loading can enable continuous superradiant
emission for metrological applications, provided that the relative frequencies
of the two ensembles are controlled to the level required by the target
stability.

### [80] [Transient localization from fractionalization: vanishingly small heat conductivity in gapless quantum magnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07062)
*Shi Feng,Penghao Zhu,Johannes Knolle,Michael Knap*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper suggests that transient localization in gapless quantum spin liquids can suppress thermal conductivity despite theoretical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the transport properties of quantum spin liquids is crucial for explaining experimental observations and advancing condensed matter physics.

Method: The authors investigate a Kitaev ladder model under a uniform magnetic field, analyzing the fractionalization of spin degrees of freedom into visons and spinons.

Result: In moderate magnetic fields, visons lead to heavy spinons, causing transient localization that suppresses thermal conductivity at finite frequencies, with some restoration at extremely low frequencies.

Conclusion: This work identifies transient localization as a key mechanism in the anomalous transport of gapless spin liquids, offering new insights into the study of quantum spin systems.

Abstract: Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a
vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions.
Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient
localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects
or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform
magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and
spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static
disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the
translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses
the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow
frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely
hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a
signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting
anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.

TL;DR: The paper identifies MnF₂ as an altermagnet by demonstrating chirality in polarized INS measurements, emerging as a key material for future spintronics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to identify and characterize altermagnets, a class of materials with unique magnetic properties combining aspects of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. The authors propose using polarized inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to directly observe the chirality of magnon bands, which is a novel approach in studying these materials.

Method: The authors conducted polarized inelastic neutron scattering experiments on MnF₂. They measured the magnon bands' splitting caused by long-range dipolar coupling and analyzed the neutron scattering cross-section to determine the material's chirality. They used a domain-biased sample to reveal a nonzero chirality in the magnon modes.

Result: The experiments revealed that MnF₂ exhibits chirality in its magnon bands, confirming it as an altermagnet. This finding is significant as it validates the use of polarized INS for characterizing altermagnets and highlights the potential of MnF₂ for spintronics applications.

Conclusion: This study successfully demonstrates that MnF₂ is an altermagnet by observing chirality in its magnon spectrum. The use of polarized INS offers a powerful tool for detecting altermagnetic properties in other materials, paving the way for future research and applications in spintronics.

Abstract: Motivated by possible spintronics applications in antiferromagnets, it was
recently observed that symmetry admits magnets that combine attractive features
of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These systems, dubbed altermagnets,
have been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from
ARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year.
Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of
magnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in
MnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of
the splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of
neutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to
measure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct
characterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In
this article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal
antiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material
is, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in
this material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar
coupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the
dipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased
sample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross
section that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature
that clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights
the potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through
its exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.

acoustic phonon driven by electronic nematicity in
BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ using inelastic X-ray scattering, with a focus on
the optimally doped sample ($x = 0.31$) sample, a system exhibiting signatures
of a putative nematic quantum critical point and minimal disorder among iron
pnictides. We observe only a modest softening of the phonon frequency and no
evidence of critical damping, suggesting that the nematic quantum critical
fluctuations couple only weakly to the lattice from our quantum critical model.
Given the close proximity of the structural and magnetic transition
temperatures in the underdoped sample, which implies that spin-nematic
fluctuations couple strongly to the lattice. We conjecture that the quantum
critical nematic fluctuations are predominantly orbital in origin.

TL;DR: We propose a nonequilibrium description of correlated electron systems using an extended time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory to understand heavy-fermion systems' dynamics after terahertz excitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex dynamics in correlated electron systems, especially heavy-fermions, is crucial for advancing materials science and quantum physics.

Method: Used an integrated approach combining dynamical mean-field theory, noncrossing approximation, and quantum field theory to model system dynamics.

Result: Identified two key mechanisms: enhanced hybridization shifting from Kondo to mixed-valence, and long Kondo coherence time recovery. Matches experimental results in terahertz spectroscopy.

Conclusion: This framework allows microscopic understanding and direct measurement of Kondo coherence times and quasiparticle weights, aiding classification of heavy-fermion quantum phase transitions.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the nonequilibrium temporal
dynamics of correlated electron systems for realistic system parameters and the
consequent, often exponentially long time scales. It is based on an entirely
integro-differential formulation of time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory,
the noncrossing approximation, and the quantum representation of a driving
electromagnetic field. For heavy-fermion systems, we identify two key
nonequilibrium mechanisms governing their time evolution after a single-cycle
terahertz excitation: transient, instantaneous shift from the Kondo toward the
mixed-valence regime by an enhanced, photoassisted hybridization, and slow
recovery of the heavy-fermion state due to the long Kondo coherence time. This
explains recent time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy experiments
microscopically and establishes the latter as a technique for direct
experimental access to the Kondo coherence time and to the heavy-fermion
quasiparticle weight, central for the classification of heavy-fermion quantum
phase transitions.

Conclusion: 该研究利用精确的微观理论计算，验证了非相互作用的带偶极矩CF自由海模型对CF金属系统静电力结构因子S(q)行为的预测。这为理解此类系统的态性质提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Field theories of the composite-fermion (CF) metal model it as a Fermi sea of
composite fermions coupled to an emergent gauge field. Within a random phase
approximation, these theories predict that the Landau damping of the gauge
field resulting from its coupling to the low-energy, long-wavelength CF
particle-hole excitations modifies the electrons' density-density correlation
function related to the static structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q$. This
produces a non-analytic correction $\propto q^{3}\ln q$ to $S(q)$ (with the
magnetic length $\ell_{B}=1$). Thanks to the recently developed quaternion
formulation for Jain-Kamilla projection of CF wave functions, the evaluation of
$S(q)$ from the accurate microscopic theory of composite fermions has now
become possible for systems containing as many as $N=900$ CFs, which enables a
reliable determination of the small-$q$ behavior of $S(q)$. We study CF metals
corresponding to electrons at Landau level filling factors $\nu=1/2$ and $1/4$,
and for completeness, also of bosons at $\nu=1$ and $1/3$. In the
$q\rightarrow0$ limit, our microscopic calculation reveals a $q^{3}$ term in
$S(q)$ of the CF metals rather than $q^{3} \ln q$. This behavior is
well-predicted by a model of a non-interacting Fermi sea of dipolar CFs, which
also obtains its coefficient accurately.

TL;DR: The paper explores chirality in S=1 magnetic systems, focusing on a chiral antiferromagnetic Ni(II) chain with pyrimidine ligands. They find long-range magnetic order below 1.82 K, driven by chiral modulation of easy-axis anisotropy, not Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions or geometrical frustration. Spin-wave theory and Monte Carlo simulations validate their findings, though more work is needed to understand the additional dispersionless spin excitations observed by inelastic neutron scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of chirality in magnetic systems is crucial for novel material design and quantum information applications, making this work significant in the field of condensed matter physics.

Method: They use muon spin rotation, neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, and Monte Carlo simulations to study the magnetic properties of the compound.

Result: The key findings are the evidence of long-range magnetic order due to chirality, the absence of typical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions or geometrical frustration, and the presence of dispersionless spin excitations beyond linear spin-wave theory.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for studying chirality in magnetic systems and suggests that chiral anisotropy could be a dominant mechanism in some low-dimensional magnetic materials.

Abstract: Chirality in magnetic systems gives rise to a wide range of exotic phenomena,
yet its influence in $S=1$ chains remains largely unexplored. Here, we present
a comprehensive experimental study of a chiral antiferromagnetic (AFM) $S=1$
chain, [Ni(pym)(H$_{2}$O)$_{4}$]SO$_{4} \cdot$ H$_{2}$O (pym = pyrimidine),
where the Ni(II) octahedral orientation exhibits a four-fold chiral
periodicity. Muon spin rotation measurements indicate the onset of long-range
magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} = 1.82(2)\,\mathrm{K}$. Neutron diffraction
measurements reveal a chiral AFM order driven by a chiral modulation of the
easy-axis anisotropy direction, rather than the typical scenario of
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, geometrical frustration or higher-order
interactions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements reveal dispersive
spin-wave excitations well described by linear spin-wave theory, with
Hamiltonian parameters $J_{0} = 6.81(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (intrachain exchange),
$J'_{1\rm a} = -0.091(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (interchain exchange), and $D =
-3.02(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (easy-axis single-ion anisotropy). These parameters are
further validated by Monte Carlo simulations of the magnetisation.
Additionally, the INS data reveal multiple dispersionless bands, suggesting the
presence of further excitations beyond the scope of our linear spin-wave
theory.

Motivation: Exploring topological quantum computing using quantum dots is driven by the potential for scalable quantum processing, which is a key challenge in current quantum computing efforts.

Method: The authors propose an experimentally feasible architecture and use many-body time-dependent simulations based on exact diagonalization to analyze the dynamics of Majorana zero modes and braiding operations, including the effects of Coulomb interactions and pairing disorder.

Result: The analysis reveals that weak interactions or pairing disorder can cause oscillations in braiding fidelity, limiting braiding speed. Additionally, comparing fusion outcomes demonstrates a signature of non-Abelian Majorana modes that can be experimentally accessed.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into topological quantum computation using quantum dots, even under realistic conditions with weak interactions and disorder.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum dot platforms have opened new pathways for
realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and simulating topological quantum
computation. Here we propose an experimentally feasible setup for implementing
topological $\sqrt{X}$- and $X$-quantum gates in an interacting $Y$-shaped
quantum-dot array. The proposed novel architecture enables both braiding and
charge readout through simple fusion operations controlled by gate-tunable
potentials. Using many-body time-dependent simulations based on exact
diagonalization, we analyze the braiding and fusion dynamics of MZMs in the
presence of nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions and pairing disorder. We
compute diabatic errors, braiding fidelity, and the time- and space-resolved
electron and hole components of the local density of states to monitor the
braiding process. Our results show that even weak interactions or pairing
disorder induce oscillations in the braiding fidelity, thereby setting an upper
bound on the braiding speed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that comparing fusion
outcomes before and after braiding provides a direct and experimentally
accessible signature of the non-Abelian nature of MZMs in quantum dot systems.

Abstract: Warm dense matter is a highly energetic phase characterized by strong
correlations, thermal effects, and quantum effects of electrons. Thermal
density functional theory is commonly used in simulations of this challenging
phase, driving the development of temperature-dependent approximations to the
exchange-correlation free energy. In this work, a finite-temperature extension
of the two-legged adiabatic connection construction is demonstrated for the
uniform electron gas and asymmetric Hubbard dimer at warm dense matter
conditions. This provides the structure of a temperature- and density-dependent
weighting scheme for a hybrid exchange-correlation approximation. The
construction also provides evidence that nonlinear thermal effects on the
balance between exchange and correlation, as well as that between kinetic,
entropic, and potential components of the correlation, persist and can even be
emphasized by strong electron-electron interaction. These findings point
additionally to a complicated interplay between temperature, density, and
interaction strength in the strong correlation character of these model
systems.

Motivation: The limitation of existing measurement techniques due to pulse-induced noises and short pulse durations necessitated seeking more robust methods for pulsed magnetic field analysis.

Method: The methodology includes a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber fixture, a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, and an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac interferometer for high-resolution optical measurements.

Result: The technique successfully measured MOKE for ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic samples at magnetic fields exceeding 40 T and down to 77 K, significantly expanding the scope of previous pulse-field MOKE measurements.

Conclusion: This advancement broadens the application of MOKE in pulsed magnetic field environments, providing a versatile and scalable tool for studying magnetic properties.

Abstract: Magnetic field is one of the most fundamental control parameters in materials
science. Pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that
are inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that
measurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to
short pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noises originating
from field pulses. Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), change in states of
light polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has potential to
become a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range
of materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed
fields. Nevertheless, since MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE
measurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new
method to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse
width. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber
fixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the
high-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac
interferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE of various ferromagnetic or
ferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, largely extending limits of
previously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements. Our apparatus is simple
enough to be compatible with larger-scale experiments in pulse-field
facilities, thus becoming a new promising tool to optically investigate
materials properties in pulsed fields.

modes are induced within the band gap, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic
dispersion relations from the band edges. Here, by generalizing the underlying
mechanism of the remarkable strong-correlation effects, this study shows that
various spin and charge perturbations, including magnetization of spin-gapped
Mott and Kondo insulators, can induce electronic modes. The emergent modes can
change the band structure, provided that a macroscopic number of spins or
charges are excited by the perturbations at a moment. The origins and
dispersion relations of the emergent modes are elucidated by investigating the
selection rules and using the Bethe ansatz and effective theory for weak
inter-unit-cell hopping. The theoretical results are validated by numerical
calculations for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models, periodic Anderson
models, Kondo lattice models, and ladder and bilayer Hubbard models. This study
significantly advances the fundamental understanding of the changes in the band
structure driven by spin and charge perturbations and paves the way for
band-structure engineering in strong-correlation electronics, utilizing the
unconventional characteristics of strongly correlated insulators.

Abstract: We present a calculation of the imaginary part of the polarizability of a
Wigner crystal using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. The oscillations of
the localized electrons about their equilibrium positions are treated in the
harmonic approximation and the electric dipole-moment -- dipole-moment
correlator is computed by a normal mode expansion. The amplitudes and phases of
the different normal modes are assumed to be statistically independent. In the
first case, polarizability is computed in the high temperature limit, $k_B
T>>\hbar \Omega_W$ (here, $\Omega_W$ is the Wigner frequency, analogous to the
Debye frequency of the phonon case). In the second case, a general expression
(valid both at high and low temperature limits) is obtained using a
phenomenological damping model. The connection between our general expression
and that of the Lorentz oscillator model is discussed. It turns out that the
Wigner crystal would be transparent for applied frequencies greater than the
Wigner frequency. A standard ellipsometry set-up can test the predictions of
the theory.

Conclusion: 理论结果为理解二维 Hubbard 模型中的电子自旋易化提供了可靠的解释，同时也为赝_gap 状态下的材料研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We compute the electron spin susceptibility in the pseudogap regime of the
two-dimensional Hubbard model in the framework of a SU(2) gauge theory of
fluctuating magnetic order. The electrons are fractionalized in fermionic
chargons with a pseudospin degree of freedom and bosonic spinons. The chargons
are treated in a renormalized mean-field theory and order in a N\'eel or spiral
magnetic state in a broad range around half-filling below a transition
temperature $T^*$. Fluctuations of the spin orientation are captured by the
spinons. Their dynamics is governed by a non-linear sigma model, with spin
stiffnesses computed microscopically from the pseudospin susceptibility of the
chargons. The SU(2) gauge group is higgsed in the chargon sector, and the
spinon fluctuations prevent breaking of the physical spin symmetry at any
finite temperature. The electron spin susceptibility obtained from the gauge
theory shares many features with experimental observations in the pseudogap
regime of cuprate superconductors: the dynamical spin susceptibility
$S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ has a spin gap, the static uniform spin susceptibility
$\kappa_s$ decreases strongly with temperature below $T^*$, and the NMR
relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ vanishes exponentially in the low temperature limit
if the ground state is quantum disordered. At low hole doping,
$S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ exhibits nematicity below a transition temperature
$T_{\rm nem} < T^*$, and at larger hole doping in the entire pseudogap regime
below $T^*$.

Conclusion: 光子介导在非平衡条件下是调控量子材料相变的有效手段，不同相变目标要求不同的控制参数。

Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that non-equilibrium effects can play a key
role in cavity-based control of material phases, notably in systems with
charge-density-wave order. Motivated by this, we extend the theory of the
Eliashberg effect, originally developed for superconducting phases, to
charge-density-wave phases. Starting from a minimal electronic model where
superconductivity and charge-density-wave order are equivalent at equilibrium,
we introduce coupling to cavity photons, which are in turn coupled to an
environment at a temperature different from the one of the electronic
environment. This drives the system into a non-thermal steady state, which
breaks the equivalence between superconductivity and charge-density-wave order.
In the superconducting case, we recover the known behavior: a shift from
continuous to discontinuous phase transitions with bistability. In contrast,
the charge-density-wave case displays richer behavior: tuning the cavity
frequency induces both continuous and discontinuous transitions, two distinct
ordered phases, and a bistable regime ending at a critical point. These
findings demonstrate that the scope of cavity-based non-thermal control of
quantum materials is broader than at thermal equilibrium, and strongly depends
on the targeted phases.

TL;DR: Ultratight-binding in UTe$_2$ with hybridization between U 5$f$ and conduction electrons leads to unconventional superconducting states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic structure of UTe$_2$, particularly the role of 5$f$ electrons, is crucial due to its unconventional superconductivity.

Method: DFT+DMFT calculations were employed, incorporating material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter ($\mu_{\text{dc}}$) to analyze the electronic configuration and dynamics.

Result: Lowest energy 5$f^2$ configuration form narrow bands. Charge fluctuation and degeneracy-driven charge dynamics significantly contribute to the complex superconducting properties of UTe$_2$.

Conclusion: The observed unconventional superconductivity likely arises from the interplay of 5$f$-conduction electron hybridization and related electronic instabilities.

Abstract: We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional
odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency,
localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is
achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the
material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm
dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence
of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy.
The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of
the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level
data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with
n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being
most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model
further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge
fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence
dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the
significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational challenges in CDMFT by proposing a more efficient method.

Method: Subbath CDMFT (SB-CDMFT) involves subdividing the discrete bath into smaller subbaths, each with distinct hybridization functions. Only one subbath is active in exact diagonalization (ED) at a time.

Result: The method successfully reproduces key physical properties like particle-hole symmetry and Mott physics.

Conclusion: SB-CDMFT significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining important physical properties, offering an efficient alternative to standard CDMFT-ED.

Abstract: Cluster Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT) with an exact diagonalization
(ED) impurity solver faces exponential scaling limitations from the Hilbert
space dimension. We introduce subbath CDMFT (SB-CDMFT), an alternative to the
conventional CDMFT-ED method in which the discrete bath is subdivided into
separate subbaths, each coupled to the cluster with distinct hybridization
functions. In this approach, only one subbath at a time is actively involved in
ED, dramatically reducing the computational cost by replacing a single large
impurity problem with multiple smaller separate ones. Our method successfully
reproduces key physical properties including particle-hole symmetry and Mott
physics, while allowing for an extended bath representation at a fraction of
the typical computational cost.

Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and
fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles,
which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave
equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework
is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions
made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact
of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then,
the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the
oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework
are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore
the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while
maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in
terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the
present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or
molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and
possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.

### [98] [Stratified Cohomological Quantum Codes via Colimits in Ch(R)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06958)
*William Boone Samuels*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Introduces stratified colimit codes as a family of quantum error-correcting codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a new family of quantum error-correcting codes, which are generated by taking the colimit of a functor from a finite poset into chain complexes.

Method: The construction uses category theory, specifically colimits of functors from a finite poset to chain complexes, to define stabilizer codes that satisfy the CSS condition.

Result: The paper shows that this new family of codes includes well-known codes like surface codes and color codes, as well as new ones like RP^2 torsion codes and fracton models.

Conclusion: This framework provides a unified algebraic approach for designing topological quantum codes without explicitly constructing underlying cell complexes, offering a succinct and generalizable method.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{stratified colimit codes}: stabiliser codes obtained by
taking the degree-wise colimit $\mathcal
C_\bullet(X):=\operatorname*{colim}_{\sigma\in X}F(\sigma)$ of a functor
$F\colon X\to\mathbf{Ch}(R)$ from a finite poset into the category of chain
complexes over a commutative ring~$R$. Axioms requiring only transitivity and
boundary-compatibility of the morphisms in $F$ ensure that $\partial^2=0$, so
the homology $H_\bullet$ and cohomology $H^\bullet$ furnish the usual CSS $Z$-
and $X$-type logical sectors; torsion in $H_\bullet$ classifies qudit charges
via the universal coefficient sequence. Varying $F$ recovers classical surface
and color codes, $\mathbb{RP}^2$ torsion codes, twisted toric families with
rate $k\sim d$, and X-cube style fracton models, all without referencing an
ambient cell complex. Matrix Smith normal form (PID case) and sparse Gaussian
elimination (field case) compute $H_\bullet$ directly, giving LDPC parameters
that inherit the sparsity of $F$. Because the construction is ring agnostic and
functorial, it extends naturally to code surgery (push-outs) and, at the next
categorical level, to bicomplex domain walls. Stratified colimit codes
therefore supply a concise algebraic chassis for designing, classifying, and
decoding topological and fractal quantum codes without ever drawing a lattice.

TL;DR: 该文章提出了No Global Counterfactual Consistency (NGCC)的概念，推广了Circular Interaction-Free Paradox (CIFP)，并证明在任何单世界的量子力学解释中，允许有界干扰的测量情况下，都无法全局一致地解释一系列闭合的反事实推理结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子力学的多世界诠释及单世界诠释近年来受到广泛关注，尤其是在反事实推理和量子纠缠等领域，如何保持一致性是一个关键问题。

Method: 该文章使用了图论方法、半正定规划对偶和多重环路排斥结构等理论工具进行分析，构建了环致性定理和一系列约束条件。

Result: 结果表明，量子力学在满足足够小失真条件时，会违反这些环致性约束，这意味着没有一个单世界、非上下文的隐变量模型（即使允许微小的测量干扰）能够在这些情况下重复量子预测。

Conclusion: 这项研究扩展了反事实推理在量子力学中的应用范围，揭示了单世界诠释在处理复杂量子网络时的局限性，为理解量子纠缠和多世界诠释提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In this article, we introduce No Global Counterfactual Consistency (NGCC), a
new foundational no-go principle generalizing the recently proposed Circular
Interaction-Free Paradox (CIFP). NGCC asserts that in any single-world
interpretation of quantum mechanics that permits bounded-disturbance
(epsilon-counterfactual) measurements, one cannot have a globally consistent
assignment of outcomes for a closed network of counterfactual inferences. In
essence, if multiple observers perform nearly interaction-free measurements
around a closed loop (or any network containing cycles), their locally certain
conclusions cannot all be mutually consistent in a single classical narrative.
We formalize this as a circular consistency theorem and a family of exclusivity
inequalities that any non-contextual, single-world hidden-variable model must
satisfy. These constraints extend the CIFP beyond an n-lab ring to arbitrary
network topologies, enforcing an NGCC bound on joint outcome probabilities.
Quantum mechanics violates these bounds for sufficiently small epsilon,
implying that no single-world, non-contextual model (even one allowing slight
measurement disturbance) can reproduce the quantum predictions in such
scenarios. Rigorous proofs are provided using graph-theoretic methods,
semidefinite duality, and multi-cycle exclusivity structures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers with heterogeneously spaced
junctions are theoretically investigated. We consider unit cells with three
junctions and characterize their interaction by spatially displaced fields
defined by node fluxes. To solve this problem we define the system action and
apply the variational principle to obtain the static action, which determines
the equations of motion. This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be
increased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same
unit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an
optimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth,
while equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this
method does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at
different pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve
gains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase
matching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998
junctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal
sub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can
still be achieved at sub-optimal sizes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a quantum computing approach for simulating quantum transport in nanoscale semiconductor devices. By modifying the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), they address the challenges of solving complex and non-symmetric linear systems, which are common in quantum transport simulations. The proposed method uses new cost functions with faster computing speeds and efficient decomposition methods that reduce quantum circuit complexity and improve noise robustness. Compared to classical methods, their approach scales logarithmically with the grid size, offering a potential solution to the curse of dimensionality in semiconductor simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, there is growing interest in leveraging quantum algorithms for complex simulations in nanotechnology. Specifically, quantum transport in semiconductor devices presents unique mathematical challenges that classical methods alone cannot efficiently address.

Method: The authors propose a modified version of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) to handle complex and non-symmetric coefficient matrices resulting from quantum transport equations. Their method introduces optimized cost functions and efficient decomposition techniques tailored for the non-equilibrium Green's function method, aiming to reduce quantum circuit complexity and enhance noise resilience.

Result: The research demonstrates that the proposed method achieves significant computational efficiency improvements over classical algorithms for quantum transport simulations. Through their approach, the quantum-computing-based method scales logarithmically with the grid size, effectively addressing the exponential growth in computational complexity that classical methods face as the problem size increases.

Conclusion: This work opens a promising avenue for quantum-based simulations in nanoscale semiconductor device research. By addressing the limitations of existing quantum algorithms, their method provides a scalable solution to the computational challenges inherent in quantum transport simulations, marking a step forward in quantum-enhanced device modeling.

Abstract: This work develops simulation methods that enable the application of the
variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) to simulate quantum transport in
nanoscale semiconductor devices. Most previous work on VQLS applications in
semiconductor device simulations focuses on solving the Poisson equation, where
the coefficient matrix of the sparse linear system is real and symmetric.
Solving the quantum transport equation, however, leads to coefficient matrices
that are complex and non-symmetric. This work addresses the challenges of
applying VQLS to quantum transport simulations. We propose new forms of cost
functions to solve complex and non-symmetric linear systems with faster
computing speed. We further develop efficient decomposition methods for cost
function evaluation, which target reducing the quantum circuit complexity and
improving noise robustness when solving the quantum transport equation using
the non-equilibrium Green's function method. While classical computation faces
the challenge of the "curse of dimensionality" as the spatial-energy numerical
grid dimensions grow, the proposed quantum-computing-based method scales
logarithmically with the grid size, which offers a promising opportunity for
addressing the computational challenges of solving quantum transport in
semiconductor devices.

Abstract: Quantum systems coupled to (non-)Markovian environments attract increasing
attention due to their peculiar physical properties. Exciting prospects such as
unconventional non-equilibrium phases beyond the Mermin-Wagner limit, or the
environment-assisted, robust preparation of highly entangled states, demand a
systematic analysis of quantum many-body phases out of equilibrium. Akin to the
equilibrium case, this requires the computation of the low-lying eigenstates of
Lindbladians, a problem challenging conventional approaches for simulating
quantum many-body systems. Here, we undertake a first step to overcome this
limitation and introduce a tensor-network-based framework to compute
systematically not only steady states, but also low-lying excited states with
unprecedented precision for large, driven quantum many-body systems. Our
framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and
we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging
non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the
example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted
hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to
perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and
demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the
capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems,
suitable also for non-Markovian environments.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of superconducting quantum circuits are
fundamentally constrained by non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which induce
microwave losses that limit resonator quality factors and qubit coherence
times. Understanding and mitigating these excitations is therefore central to
advancing scalable quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate on-chip microwave
sensing of quasiparticles in high-Q {\alpha}-tantalum coplanar waveguide
resonators on silicon, operated in the single-photon regime.
Temperature-dependent measurements reveal persistent non-equilibrium
quasiparticles at millikelvin temperatures, producing a measurable suppression
of the internal quality factor (Qi) relative to theoretical expectations. By
benchmarking across materials, we find that the quasiparticle density in
{\alpha}-Ta is approximately one-third that of NbN at equivalent normalised
temperatures (T/Tc), directly correlating with reduced microwave loss. Our
methodology establishes a scalable platform for probing quasiparticle dynamics
and points towards new routes for engineering superconducting circuits with
improved coherence, with impact on qubit readout resonators, kinetic-inductance
detectors, and emerging quantum processors and sensors.

Abstract: The development of noise-resilient quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms
is critical in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this work,
we propose a quantum bagging framework that uses QMeans clustering as the base
learner to reduce prediction variance and enhance robustness to label noise.
Unlike bagging frameworks built on supervised learners, our method leverages
the unsupervised nature of QMeans, combined with quantum bootstrapping via
QRAM-based sampling and bagging aggregation through majority voting. Through
extensive simulations on both noisy classification and regression tasks, we
demonstrate that the proposed quantum bagging algorithm performs comparably to
its classical counterpart using KMeans while exhibiting greater resilience to
label corruption than supervised bagging methods. This highlights the potential
of unsupervised quantum bagging in learning from unreliable data.

Conclusion: 该 work展示了如何通过改进反对称算法来减少量子计算所需的资源，这为量子化学和材料科学中的应用提供了有用工具。

Abstract: We devise a deterministic quantum algorithm to produce antisymmetric states
of single-particle orbitals in the first quantization mapping. Unlike
sorting-based antisymmetrization algorithms, which require ordered input states
and high Clifford-gate overhead, our approach initializes the state of each
particle independently. For a system of $N$ particles and $N_s$ single-particle
states, our algorithm prepares antisymmetrized states of non-trivial localized
(e.g., Hartree-Fock) orbitals using $O(N^2\sqrt{N_s})$ $T$-gates, outperforming
alternative algorithms when $N\lesssim \sqrt{N_s}$. To achieve such scaling, we
require $O(\sqrt{N_s})$ dirty ancilla qubits for intermediate calculations.
Knowledge of the single-particle states to be antisymmetrized can be leveraged
to further improve the efficiency of the circuit, and a measurement-based
variant reduces gate cost by roughly a factor of two. We show example circuits
for two- and three-particle systems and discuss the generalization to an
arbitrary number of particles. For a specific three-particle example, we
decompose the circuit into Clifford$+T$ gates and study the impact of noise on
the prepared state.

Abstract: We investigate optimizing quantum tree search algorithms by employing a

previous Grover-based methods by expanding the tree of partial assignments to a
specific depth and conducting a quantum search within the subset of remaining
assignments. The study explores the implications and constraints of this
approach, providing a foundation for quantum artificial intelligence
applications. Instead of utilizing conventional heuristic functions that are
incompatible with quantum tree search, we introduce the partial candidate
solution, which indicates a node at a specific depth of the tree. By employing
such a function, we define the concatenated oracle, which enables us to
decompose the quantum tree search using Grover algorithm.

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently predicting the equilibrium geometries of large
molecules remains a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, even
with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Two major obstacles hinder progress:
the large number of qubits required and the prohibitive cost of conventional
nested optimization. In this work, we introduce a co-optimization framework
that combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) to address these limitations. This approach substantially
reduces the required quantum resources, enabling the treatment of molecular
systems significantly larger than previously feasible. We first validate our
framework on benchmark systems, such as H4 and H2O2, before demonstrating its
efficacy in determining the equilibrium geometry of glycolic acid C2H4O3, a
molecule of a size previously considered intractable for quantum geometry
optimization. Our results show the method achieves high accuracy while
drastically lowering computational cost. This work thus represents a
significant step toward practical, scalable quantum simulations, moving beyond
the small, proof-of-concept molecules that have historically dominated the
field. More broadly, our framework establishes a tangible path toward
leveraging quantum advantage for the in silico design of complex catalysts and
pharmaceuticals.

Motivation: 量子系统在时间周期下的行为复杂且多样，尤其是在量子工程和控制方面，传统数值方法面临计算资源的限制。FNO提供了一种新的方法来克服这一挑战，通过在傅里叶空间中参数化，FNO能够捕捉时间相关性并独立于时间的离散化，使模拟变得更加高效。

Abstract: Time-periodic quantum systems exhibit a rich variety of far-from-equilibrium
phenomena and serve as ideal platforms for quantum engineering and control.
However, simulating their dynamics with conventional numerical methods remains
challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension and rapid
spreading of entanglement. In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators
(FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium
quantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures
temporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of
time. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary
learning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting
expectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information
spreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while
attaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover,
FNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different
temporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO
can extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling
access to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be
difficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the
computational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size. Our
results establish FNO as a versatile and scalable surrogate for predicting
non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing
data from near-term quantum computers.

Abstract: Entanglement is a central resource in quantum information science, yet its
structure in high dimensions remains notoriously difficult to characterize. One
of the few general results on high-dimensional entanglement is given by
peel-off theorems, which relate the entanglement of a state to that of its
lower-dimensional local projections. We build on this idea by introducing local
extensions, the inverse process to peel-off projections, which provide a
systematic way to construct higher-dimensional entangled states from
lower-dimensional ones. This dual perspective leads to general bounds on how
the Schmidt number can change under projections and extensions, and reveals new
mechanisms for generating bound entangled states of higher dimensionality. As a
concrete application, we construct a positive-partial-transpose state of
Schmidt number three in local dimensions $4\times 5$, the smallest system known
to host such entanglement. We further extend this approach to identify an
elegant family of generalized grid states with increasing Schmidt number,
including explicit examples of a $7\times 7$ state with Schmidt number four and
a $9\times 9$ state with Schmidt number five, suggesting $(d+1)/2$ scaling in
odd local dimensions $d\times d$. Taken together, our results provide a
constructive toolkit for probing the scaling of bound entanglement in high
dimensions.

Abstract: Important nonlinear dynamics, such as those found in plasma and fluid
systems, are typically hard to simulate on classical computers. Thus, if
fault-tolerant quantum computers could efficiently solve such nonlinear
problems, it would be a transformative change for many industries. In a recent
breakthrough [Liu et al., PNAS 2021], the first efficient quantum algorithm for
solving nonlinear differential equations was constructed, based on a single
condition $R<1$, where $R$ characterizes the ratio of nonlinearity to
dissipation. This result, however, is limited to the class of purely
dissipative systems with negative log-norm, which excludes application to many
important problems. In this work, we correct technical issues with this and
other prior analysis, and substantially extend the scope of nonlinear dynamical
systems that can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer in a number of
ways. Firstly, we extend the existing results from purely dissipative systems
to a much broader class of stable systems, and show that every quadratic
Lyapunov function for the linearized system corresponds to an independent
$R$-number criterion for the convergence of the Carlemen scheme. Secondly, we
extend our stable system results to physically relevant settings where
conserved polynomial quantities exist. Finally, we provide extensive results
for the class of non-resonant systems. With this, we are able to show that
efficient quantum algorithms exist for a much wider class of nonlinear systems
than previously known, and prove the BQP-completeness of nonlinear oscillator
problems of exponential size. In our analysis, we also obtain several results
related to the Poincar\'{e}-Dulac theorem and diagonalization of the Carleman
matrix, which could be of independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egorov's theorem is fundamental in quantum mechanics, linking classical and quantum dynamics. Extending it to the Schrödinger picture and using optimal transport metrics could enhance our understanding of quantum-classical correspondence and applications in quantum dynamics.

Method: The authors employed advanced tools from functional analysis and optimal transport theory, specifically focusing on the properties of the p-Wasserstein metric applied to quantum states represented by Husimi functions.

Result: A generalized Egorov's theorem is established, with the strength of the estimates improving as p increases. This result contributes to quantum-classical correspondence theory and validates numerical methods in quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: This study not only extends Egorov's theorem but also ranks among the most concerning works in quantum mechanics literature, introducing novel approaches to analyzing quantum-classical transitions.

Abstract: We prove a new version of Egorov's theorem formulated in the Schr\"{o}dinger
picture of quantum mechanics, using the $p$-Wasserstein metric applied to the
Husimi functions of quantum states. The special case $p=1$ corresponds to a
"low-regularity" Egorov theorem, while larger values $p>1$ yield progressively
stronger estimates. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove an optimal
transport inequality analogous to a result of Golse and Paul in the context of
mean-field many-body quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Modeling open quantum dynamics without full knowledge of the system
Hamiltonian or noise model is a key challenge in quantum control and quantum
state estimation. We introduce an Augmented Quantum Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (AQNODE) framework that learns quantum trajectories and
dissipation parameters directly from partial continuous measurement data. By
embedding the system into a latent space evolved via neural ODEs, AQNODE
captures both observable and hidden non-Markovian dynamics with temporal
smoothness and physical consistency. Our approach integrates weak measurement
data to reconstruct qubit states and time-dependent decoherence rates, enabling
accurate state prediction and parameter inference without explicit physical
equations. Furthermore, we incorporate AQNODE-based feedback control
techniques, including proportional-derivative and time-varying linear-quadratic
regulator (LQR) strategies, to steer the quantum system toward target states in
real time. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate AQNODE's ability to
generalize across system configurations, achieve low prediction errors, and
perform robust quantum filtering and control. These results establish AQNODE as
a scalable, differentiable, and experimentally compatible framework for
real-time modeling and control of dissipative quantum systems.

Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from addressing an NP-hard problem in clinical trial design and experimental scheduling, highlighting the potential of quantum computing in solving such optimization challenges.

Method: The authors employ variational quantum algorithms (QAOA and QWOA) to solve the set balancing problem, mapping it to an Ising model with tailored QUBO formulations. They experiment with different mixer Hamiltonians (X, XY, Full-SWAP, Ring-SWAP, Grover, Warm-Started) and implement scaled-exponential Pauli-string mixer unitaries. A Shannon-entropy-based post-processing technique is introduced to refine solutions.

Result: The study shows that the choice of mixer Hamiltonian and circuit implementation significantly improves QAOA performance. The post-processing technique enhances solution quality by maximizing feature-distribution uniformity across partitions.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that algorithmic choices and circuit optimizations are crucial for effective quantum computing applications in combinatorial optimization problems, with particular emphasis on mixer selection and post-processing methods.

Abstract: We explore the application of variational quantum algorithms to the NP-hard
set balancing problem, a critical challenge in clinical trial design and

Algorithm (QWOA), evaluating them in separate experimental settings. For QAOA,
we perform a comparative analysis of six mixer Hamiltonians (X, XY, Full-SWAP,
Ring-SWAP, Grover, and Warm-Started), employing scaled-exponential Pauli-string
realizations of the mixer unitaries, which yield superior performance over
conventional circuit decompositions. Additionally, we introduce a
Shannon-entropy-based post-processing technique that refines solutions by
maximizing feature-distribution uniformity across partitions. These results
underscore the importance of mixer choice and circuit implementation in
enhancing QAOA performance for combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: Quantum control and optimization, especially for large systems, are crucial for next-generation technology.

Method: Combines MPOs, Magnus expansion, and Chebyshev polynomials to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without time discretization.

Result: Improved efficiency for many-body quantum systems, making large-scale optimization problems feasible.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable solution for quantum optimal control, opening new possibilities in quantum computing and technology.

Abstract: We present a method for describing the time evolution of many-body controlled
quantum systems using matrix product operators (MPOs). Existing techniques for
solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) with an MPO
Hamiltonian often rely on time discretization. In contrast, our approach uses
the Magnus expansion and Chebyshev polynomials to model the time evolution, and
the MPO representation to efficiently encode the system's dynamics. This
results in a scalable method that can be used efficiently for many-body
controlled quantum systems. We apply this technique to quantum optimal control,
specifically for a gate synthesis problem, demonstrating that it can be used
for large-scale optimization problems that are otherwise impractical to
formulate in a dense matrix representation.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in quantum information science is to demonstrate quantum
computations that cannot be feasibly reproduced on a classical computer. Such
demonstrations mark major milestones: they showcase fine control over quantum
systems and are prerequisites for useful quantum computation. To date, quantum
advantage has been demonstrated, for example, through violations of Bell
inequalities and sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments. However, both
forms of advantage come with important caveats: Bell tests are not
computationally difficult tasks, and the classical hardness of sampling
experiments relies on unproven complexity-theoretic assumptions. Here we
demonstrate an unconditional quantum advantage in information resources
required for a computational task, realized on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion
quantum computer operating at a median two-qubit partial-entangler fidelity of
99.941(7)%. We construct a task for which the most space-efficient classical
algorithm provably requires between 62 and 382 bits of memory, and solve it
using only 12 qubits. Our result provides the most direct evidence yet that
currently existing quantum processors can generate and manipulate entangled
states of sufficient complexity to access the exponentiality of Hilbert space.
This form of quantum advantage -- which we call quantum information supremacy
-- represents a new benchmark in quantum computing, one that does not rely on
unproven conjectures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Channel conversion constitutes a pivotal paradigm in information theory and
its applications to quantum physics, providing a unified problem setting that
encompasses celebrated results such as Shannon's noisy-channel coding theorem.
Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a general framework to study such
problems under a prescribed class of operations, such as those for encoding and
decoding. In QRTs, quantum states serve as static resources, while quantum
channels give rise to dynamical resources. A recent major advance in QRTs is
the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which characterizes the optimal error
exponent in hypothesis testing to discriminate resource states from free
states, enabling a reversible QRT framework for static resources where
asymptotic conversion rates are fully determined by the regularized relative
entropy of resource. However, applications of QRTs to channel conversion
require a framework for dynamical resources. The earlier extension of the
reversible framework to a fundamental class of dynamical resources, represented
by classical-quantum (CQ) channels, relied on state-based techniques and
imposed an asymptotic continuity assumption on operations, which prevented its
applicability to conventional channel coding scenarios. To overcome this
problem, we formulate and prove a generalized quantum Stein's lemma directly
for CQ channels, by developing CQ-channel counterparts of the core proof
techniques used in the state setting. Building on this result, we construct a
reversible QRT framework for CQ channel conversion that does not require the
asymptotic continuity assumption, and show that this framework applies to the
analysis of channel coding scenarios. These results establish a fully general
toolkit for CQ channel discrimination and conversion, enabling their broad
application to core conversion problems for this fundamental class of channels.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new way to (non-interactively, verifiably)
demonstrate quantum advantage by solving the average-case $\mathsf{NP}$ search
problem of finding a solution to a system of (underdetermined) constant degree
multivariate equations over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$ drawn from a
specified distribution. In particular, for any $d \geq 2$, we design a
distribution of degree up to $d$ polynomials $\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\}_{i\in
[m]}$ for $m<n$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ for which we show that there is a expected
polynomial-time quantum algorithm that provably simultaneously solves
$\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=y_i\}_{i\in [m]}$ for a random vector
$(y_1,\ldots,y_m)$. On the other hand, while solutions exist with high
probability, we conjecture that for constant $d > 2$, it is classically hard to
find one based on a thorough review of existing classical cryptanalysis. Our
work thus posits that degree three functions are enough to instantiate the
random oracle to obtain non-relativized quantum advantage.
  Our approach begins with the breakthrough Yamakawa-Zhandry (FOCS 2022)
quantum algorithmic framework. In our work, we demonstrate that this quantum
algorithmic framework extends to the setting of multivariate polynomial
systems.
  Our key technical contribution is a new analysis on the Fourier spectra of
distributions induced by a general family of distributions over $\mathbb{F}_2$
multivariate polynomials -- those that satisfy $2$-wise independence and
shift-invariance. This family of distributions includes the distribution of
uniform random degree at most $d$ polynomials for any constant $d \geq 2$. Our
analysis opens up potentially new directions for quantum cryptanalysis of other
multivariate systems.

### [122] [Compressing Syndrome Measurement Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07288)
*Benjamin Anker,Milad Marvian*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for creating fault-tolerant measurement schedules with varying lengths using stabilizer generators, allowing for efficient error correction in quantum codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficient fault-tolerant error correction in quantum codes, particularly for stabilizer codes with a large number of independent generators.

Method: The authors combine stabilizer generators from classical codes to create measurement schedules. The framework is applied specifically to LDPC codes and codes constructed by concatenation.

Result: The proposed schedules require O(d log r) measurements for LDPC codes and O(d log d log r) for concatenated codes, both significantly fewer than the number of stabilizer generators. The schedules maintain low-weight stabilizers and exhibit exponential error suppression as the code distance increases.

Conclusion: This framework provides a practical approach to achieving weak fault tolerance in quantum error correction with improved efficiency in measurement requirements.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze a framework for constructing fault-tolerant
measurement schedules of varying lengths by combining stabilizer generators,
and prove results about the distance of such schedules by combining according
to classical codes. Using this framework, we produce explicit measurement
schedules sufficient for fault-tolerant error correction of quantum codes of
distance $d$ with $r$ independent stabilizer generators using only $O(d
\log{r})$ measurements if the code is LDPC, and $O(d \log d \log r)$
measurements if the code is produced via concatenating a smaller code with
itself $O(\log d)$ times. In both of these cases the number of measurements can
be asymptotically fewer than the number of stabilizer generators which define
the code. Although optimizing our construction to use the fewest measurements
produces high-weight stabilizers, we also show that we can reduce the number of
measurements used for specific examples while maintaining low-weight stabilizer
measurements. We numerically examine the performance of our construction on the
surface code under several noise models and demonstrate the exponential error
suppression with increasing distance which is characteristic of weak fault
tolerance.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the
system of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective
environment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of
quantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms,
superconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common
approach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches
based on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are
indeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread
application of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by
accuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases,
such as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is
structured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes
of the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation
of information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real
problems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as
it is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be
practical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of
techniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the
notion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process
tensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door
to the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a
wide range of open quantum systems.

Abstract: We present a near-optimal quantum algorithm, up to logarithmic factors, for
estimating the Shannon entropy in the quantum probability oracle model. Our
approach combines the singular value separation algorithm with quantum
amplitude amplification, followed by the application of quantum singular value
transformation. On the lower bound side, we construct probability distributions
encoded via Hamming weights in the oracle, establishing a tight query lower
bound up to logarithmic factors. Consequently, our results show that the tight
query complexity for estimating the Shannon entropy within $\epsilon$-additive
error is given by $\tilde{\Theta}\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{n}}{\epsilon}\right)$.

*Jaemin Kim,Karthik Mohan,Sung Won Yun,Joonwoo Bae*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Protocol for entanglement purification using quantum communication and single qubits between parties, which requires only quantum memory and single-qubit transmission. If channels are not entanglement-breaking, purification is possible even with noisy qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entanglement distillation is crucial for quantum networks, but existing methods require complex setups like quantum memory and coherent operations, limiting practicality.

Method: Proposed carrier-assisted entanglement purification protocol utilizing single-qubit transmission and quantum memory for a single-copy entangled state between parties.

Result: The protocol can purify noisy entangled states when single-qubit transmission is noiseless. When noisy, it relies on specific qubit channels. Multi-carrier qubits enable purification through noisy channels, provided they are not entanglement-breaking.

Conclusion: Efficient purification protocol reduces the need for quantum memory and coherent operations, bringing long-distance entanglement closer to practical use.

Abstract: Entanglement distillation, a fundamental building block of quantum networks,
enables the purification of noisy entangled states shared among distant nodes
by local operations and classical communication. Its practical realization
presents several technical challenges, including the storage of quantum states
in quantum memory and the execution of coherent quantum operations on multiple
copies of states within the quantum memory. In this work, we present an
entanglement purification protocol via quantum communication, namely a
carrier-assisted entanglement purification protocol, which utilizes two
elements only: i) quantum memory for a single-copy entangled state shared by
parties and ii) single qubits travelling between parties. We show that the
protocol, when single-qubit transmission is noiseless, can purify a noisy
entangled state shared by parties. When single-qubit transmission is noisy, the
purification relies on types of noisy qubit channels; we characterize qubit
channels such that the protocol works for the purification. We resolve the
limitation by applying multiple qubits over noisy channels, and show that the
purification protocol with multi-carrier qubits works through a noisy qubit
channel in general, provided that the channels are not entanglement-breaking,
i.e., channels that cannot be constructed as measure-and-prepare operations.
Our results significantly reduce the experimental overhead needed for
distilling entanglement, such as quantum memory and coherent operations, making
long-distance pure entanglement closer to a practical realization.

*Will Cavendish,Siddhant Das*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper concludes that the Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC) proposal for addressing the 'screen problem' in quantum mechanics is inconsistent with experimental data and theoretical predictions from scattering theory, making it an empirically inadequate solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'screen problem' in quantum mechanics, which involves predicting the joint distribution of particle arrival times and impact positions, has been a significant challenge. This paper aims to evaluate the ABC proposal by comparing it with established scattering theory results.

Method: The authors conducted a direct consistency check of the ABC proposal against scattering theory predictions using exactly solvable one- and two-dimensional examples.

Result: The ABC proposal's predictions show tension with ST results, specifically with sharp momentum- and screen-orientation-dependent detection probabilities and secondary reflections inconsistent with experimental data.

Conclusion: While the ABC proposal may theoretically describe some future physical detectors, it is empirically inadequate as a general solution to the screen problem due to its inconsistency with standard experimental settings.

Abstract: Any proposed solution to the "screen problem" in quantum mechanics -- the
challenge of predicting the joint distribution of particle arrival times and
impact positions -- must align with the extensive data obtained from scattering
experiments. In this paper, we conduct a direct consistency check of the
Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC) proposal, a prominent approach to address
the screen problem, against the predictions derived from scattering theory
(ST). Through a series of exactly solvable one- and two-dimensional examples,
we demonstrate that the ABC proposal's predictions are in tension with the
well-established results of ST. Specifically, it predicts sharp momentum- and
screen-orientation-dependent detection probabilities, along with secondary
reflections that contradict existing experimental data. We conclude that while
it remains possible that physical detectors described by the ABC proposal could
be found in the future, the proposal is empirically inadequate as a general
solution to the screen problem, as it is inconsistent with the behavior of
detectors in standard experimental settings.

Conclusion: 本文的贡献在于提供了一种系统性的噪声校准框架，结合噪声谱特性，优化了CV-QKD系统的性能。

Abstract: Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) relies on accurate
noise calibration at the receiver to ensure the security of quantum
communication. Traditional calibration methods often oversimplify noise
characteristics, neglecting the impact of local oscillator (LO) noise and the
critical role of noise spectral properties, which can lead to imprecise Shot
Noise Calibration (SNC). Our contributions are threefold: 1) we propose an
operational framework for calibration, relying on the notion of stationarity 2)
in this framework, we give a method allowing us to derive the optimal
calibration duration for a given experiment 3) leveraging our knowledge of
noise spectral properties, we introduce a novel SNC method. This work also
formalizes the calibration procedures, addressing implicit assumptions and
providing a better foundation for the certification of CV-QKD protocols, of
which calibration is a fundamental part. We demonstrate that our improved
calibration technique offers higher performance and higher tolerance to
receiver imperfections, which can enhance the performance and
cost-effectiveness of CV-QKD systems.

Abstract: Input-output theory is a well-known tool in quantum optics and ubiquitous in
the description of quantum systems probed by light. Owing to the generality of
the setup it describes, the theory finds application in a wide variety of
experiments in circuit and cavity QED. We present an approach to input-output
theory using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism that gives us direct
access to the full output field statistics such as the first and second order
coherence functions. By making the rich toolbox of non-equilibrium quantum
field theory accessible, our formalism greatly simplifies the treatment of
nonlinear systems and provides a uniform way of obtaining perturbative results.
We showcase this particular strength by computing the output field statistics
of a Kerr nonlinear oscillator at finite temperatures through the use of
diagrams and diagram summation techniques. We find a reduction in reflection
that is not due to photon leakage but rather associated to the squeezing of the
output light.

Abstract: Understanding the complexity of quantum states and circuits is a central
challenge in quantum information science, with broad implications in many-body
physics, high-energy physics and quantum learning theory. A common way to model
the behaviour of typical states and circuits involves sampling unitary
transformations from the Haar measure on the unitary group. In this work, we
depart from this standard approach and instead study structured unitaries drawn
from other compact connected groups, namely the symplectic and special
orthogonal groups. By leveraging the concentration of measure phenomenon, we
establish two main results. We show that random quantum states generated using
symplectic or orthogonal unitaries typically exhibit an exponentially large
strong state complexity, and are nearly orthogonal to one another. Similar
behavior is observed for designs over these groups. Additionally, we
demonstrate the average-case hardness of learning circuits composed of gates
drawn from such classical groups of unitaries. Taken together, our results
demonstrate that structured subgroups can exhibit a complexity comparable to
that of the full unitary group.

Abstract: We present a framework for simultaneously estimating all four real parameters

show that all parameters attain the 1/N scaling in the precision by using
experimentally feasible Gaussian probes such as two-mode squeezed states or two
single-mode squeezed states. Our results extend multiparameter metrology to its
most general two-mode setting and establish concrete design principles for
experimental implementations of Heisenberg-scaling, multi-parameter optical
interferometry with experimentally feasible resources. It not only sheds light
on the fundamental interface between quantum interference of squeezed light and
quantum metrological advantage in multiparameter estimation, but it also
provides an important stepstone towards the development of a wide range of
quantum technologies based on distributed quantum metrology in arbitrary
optical networks.

that an additional auxiliary qubit suffices to simulate Clifford+T. Our result
settles an open question on the expressiveness of De Vos' gate set based on

Abstract: Quantum policy evaluation (QPE) is a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
which is quadratically more efficient than an analogous classical Monte Carlo
estimation. It makes use of a direct quantum mechanical realization of a finite
Markov decision process, in which the agent and the environment are modeled by
unitary operators and exchange states, actions, and rewards in superposition.
Previously, the quantum environment has been implemented and parametrized
manually for an illustrative benchmark using a quantum simulator. In this
paper, we demonstrate how these environment parameters can be learned from a
batch of classical observational data through quantum machine learning (QML) on
quantum hardware. The learned quantum environment is then applied in QPE to
also compute policy evaluations on quantum hardware. Our experiments reveal
that, despite challenges such as noise and short coherence times, the
integration of QML and QPE shows promising potential for achieving quantum
advantage in RL.

Abstract: Non-Markovian $1/f$ noise consists a dominant source of decoherence in
superconducting qubits, yet its slow nature poses a significant challenge for
accurate simulation. Here we develop a hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)
framework that enables efficient and reliable modeling of qubit dynamics and
gate operations under $1/f$ noise. By using the approach, it is first shown
that perturbative quantum master equations may fail to reproduce the correct
dephasing dynamics of a qubit coupled to slow baths. We then analyze dynamical
decoupling sequences by including effects of finite pulse duration. It is found
that different pulse sequences results in different behavior in error
accumulation: all X-CPMG sequences exhibit linear scaling with parity effects,
Y-CPMG follows quadratic growth, and alternating XY-type sequences can suppress
the error accumulation significantly. Finally, we extend the framework to
two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gates, reconstructing the full Choi matrix and
Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) to identify the incoherent error induced by $1/f$
noise. Together, these results establish HEOM as a robust methodology for
simulating the environmental noise in superconducting circuits and provide new
insights into error mechanisms in both single- and two-qubit gates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper likely aimed to enhance quantum memory efficiency and preserve estimation accuracy, with a focus on resource optimization in quantum computing.

Method: The protocol combines channel concatenation and quantum memory, using a 'weakly-driven quantum walk' mechanism to reduce memory demands while maintaining exponential measurement complexity reduction.

Result: The 'weakly-driven quantum walk' method successfully lowers quantum memory overhead to a constant while preserving the exponential advantage in measurement complexity, paving the way for efficient quantum sensing and algorithm design in resource-limited scenarios.

Conclusion: This breakthrough offers a practical solution for managing quantum memory in resource-constrained environments, contributing to advancements in fault-tolerant quantum computing and quantum sensing of weak signals.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of quantum noise, exemplified by the Pauli channel,
is a cornerstone for building fault-tolerant quantum computers. A recent
protocol (PRX Quantum 6, 020323 (2025)) combining channel concatenation and
quantum memory has achieved an exponential reduction in measurement complexity
for Pauli channel estimation. This efficiency, however, hinges on using
logarithmic quantum memory to suppress hypothesis test errors. In this work, we
introduce a mechanism termed the ``weakly-driven quantum walk'' to mitigate the
demand for high-quality quantum memory. By exploiting the distinct dynamical
properties of quantum walks under biased versus unbiased driving, our algorithm
lowers the quantum memory overhead to a constant order while preserving the
exponential advantage in measurement complexity. By analogy with weak
measurement, our introduced concept of ``weak driving'' preserves pointer
coherence even when driven by classical probabilistic information, a principle
that may inspire new approaches to similar quantum algorithm design and quantum
sensing of weak signals in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: We propose an approach to measure the quantum phase of an electron in a
non-Abelian system using the algorithm of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The
discrete-path systems were previously studied in the context of square or
rectangular rings. Present focus is on measuring the quantum phases. The merit
of the algorithm approach is two-fold. First off, it eliminates the need for an
interferometric set up. Quantum phase is measured by reading off of measurable
qubit states of the QPE modules. Secondly, the QPE works by subjecting the
quantum state to a sequence of quantum computing operations that eventually map
the phase information into measurable qubit states. All the operations are
realizable by standard quantum computer gates and algorithms, placing the new
effort within the reach of standard quantum computational framework.

Central to our method is a novel SDP, for which we establish primal and dual

the one-shot distillable key of a quantum state, this contribution extends
SDP-based techniques in quantum information theory. Thereby it improves the
capabilities to compute or estimate information measures with application to
various quantum information processing tasks.

Abstract: Clustering financial assets based on return correlations is a fundamental
task in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage. However, classical
clustering methods often fall short when dealing with signed correlation
structures, typically requiring lossy transformations and heuristic assumptions
such as a fixed number of clusters. In this work, we apply the Graph-based
Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) to directly cluster signed,
weighted graphs without relying on such transformations. GCS-Q formulates each
partitioning step as a QUBO problem, enabling it to leverage quantum annealing
for efficient exploration of exponentially large solution spaces. We validate
our approach on both synthetic and real-world financial data, benchmarking
against state-of-the-art classical algorithms such as SPONGE and k-Medoids. Our
experiments demonstrate that GCS-Q consistently achieves higher clustering
quality, as measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties,
while dynamically determining the number of clusters. These results highlight
the practical utility of near-term quantum computing for graph-based
unsupervised learning in financial applications.

Abstract: Optimizing the performance of cryogenic quantum amplifiers is a key step
toward achieving high-fidelity and scalable qubit readout. In this work, we
present efficient and accurate modeling of a Josephson traveling-wave
parametric amplifier (JTWPA) based on electromagnetic (EM) and circuit
co-simulation. In contrast to conventional simulation methods where an
equivalent lumped-element circuit model of the JTWPA is required, we directly
perform full EM analysis of the device to faithfully determine the linear
response. The extracted S-parameters are then fed into a nonlinear harmonic
balance simulator with Josephson junctions represented as circuit elements. The
simulated linear and gain properties are compared with experimental results and
show good agreement.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A niobium nitride nanowire kinetic inductance parametric amplifier (KIPA) was modeled using electromagnetic and circuit co-simulation, showing good agreement with experimental results, including temperature-dependent resonance spectra and parametric gain. The simulation accurately reproduced the phase-sensitive behavior of the KIPA operating as a degenerate amplifier. This technique enables the simulation and design of quantum parametric amplifiers and superconducting kinetic inductance devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers (KIPAs) is important for their application in superconducting quantum circuits, which have potential in quantum computing and precision sensing.

Method: The research employed a dual approach combining electromagnetic (EM) simulation and circuit-level co-simulation. The EM analysis focused on the linear part of the kinetic inductance, while the circuit simulation modeled the nanowire as a nonlinear inductor dependent on current.

Result: The co-simulations successfully matched the experimental findings, including temperature-dependent resonance spectra and parametric gain. Additionally, the phase-sensitive behavior of the KIPA was accurately captured when operating as a degenerate amplifier.

Conclusion: This work presents a robust modeling framework for simulating and designing quantum parametric amplifiers and superconducting kinetic inductance devices, leveraging both EM and circuit-level simulations for accurate and reliable results.

Abstract: Kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers (KIPAs) have been widely studied for
small-signal detection in superconducting quantum circuits. In this work, we
demonstrate the modeling of a niobium nitride nanowire based KIPA using
electromagnetic (EM) and circuit co-simulation, and compare the outcomes with
experimental results. EM analysis is first performed on the device layout,
taking into account the linear part of the kinetic inductance. The results are
then integrated into a harmonic balance circuit simulator, in which the
current-dependent inductance is modeled by representing the nanowire as a
nonlinear inductor. Both linear and nonlinear responses of the device,
including temperature-dependent resonance spectra and parametric gain, are
extracted and show good agreement with experiments. We further show that when
the KIPA operates as a degenerate amplifier, its phase-sensitive behavior can
be accurately reproduced by the simulation. Our technique can serve as a
valuable enabler for the simulation and design of quantum parametric amplifiers
and superconducting kinetic inductance devices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The notion of probability plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. It
appears in quantum mechanics as the Born rule. In modern mathematics which
describes quantum mechanics, however, probability theory means nothing other
than measure theory, and therefore any operational characterization of the
notion of probability is still missing in quantum mechanics. In our former
works [K. Tadaki, arXiv:1804.10174], based on the toolkit of algorithmic
randomness, we presented a refinement of the Born rule, called the principle of
typicality, for specifying the property of results of measurements in an
operational way. The Wigner's friend paradox is a Gedankenexperiment regarding
when and where the reduction of the state vector occurs in a chain of the
measurements by several observers where the state of the consciousness of each
observer is measured by the subsequent observer, except for the last observer
in the chain. It is one of the central open questions in the measurement
problem of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we make an analysis of the
Wigner's friend paradox in the framework of quantum mechanics based on the
principle of typicality. We then draw common sense conclusions about the
Wigner's friend paradox. In addition, we make a prediction, which is testable
in principle, about its variant proposed by Deutsch.

### [142] [Existence and nonexistence of commutativity gadgets for entangled CSPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07835)
*Eric Culf,Josse van Dobben de Bruyn,Matthijs Vernooij,Peter Zeman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes an obstruction to the existence of commutativity gadgets for certain constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) with alphabets larger than binary, demonstrating that such gadgets do not exist for k-coloring when k ≥ 4. However, the authors show that commutativity gadgets can exist in an alternative oracular setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research advances the understanding of the limitations and possibilities for commutativity gadgets in CSPs, which has implications for computational complexity theory, particularly in translating NP-hard classical problems to undecidable entangled ones.

Method: The authors define an extended quantum endomorphism monoid of a CSP and prove that a non-classical quantum endomorphism monoid implies the non-existence of a commutativity gadget. They apply this framework to k-coloring problems and extend it to an oracular setting where such gadgets may exist.

Result: The paper's notable result is establishing the first known obstruction to commutativity gadgets for k-coloring (k ≥ 4) but also demonstrating their existence in an oracular framework.

Conclusion: This research provides a significant step in understanding the conditions under which commutativity gadgets exist, highlighting the role of the alternative oracular setting in circumventing some impossibilities.

Abstract: Commutativity gadgets allow NP-hardness proofs for classical constraint
satisfaction problems (CSPs) to be carried over to undecidability proofs for
the corresponding entangled CSPs. This has been done, for instance, for
NP-complete boolean CSPs and 3-colouring in the work of Culf and Mastel. For
many CSPs over larger alphabets, including $k$-colouring when $k \geq 4$, it is
not known whether or not commutativity gadgets exist, or if the entangled CSP
is decidable. In this paper, we study commutativity gadgets and prove the first
known obstruction to their existence. We do this by extending the definition of
the quantum automorphism group of a graph to the quantum endomorphism monoid of
a CSP, and showing that a CSP with non-classical quantum endomorphism monoid
does not admit a commutativity gadget. In particular, this shows that no
commutativity gadget exists for $k$-colouring when $k \geq 4$. However, we
construct a commutativity gadget for an alternate way of presenting
$k$-colouring as a nonlocal game, the oracular setting.
  Furthermore, we prove an easy to check sufficient condition for the quantum
endomorphism monoid to be non-classical, extending a result of Schmidt for the
quantum automorphism group of a graph, and use this to give examples of CSPs
that do not admit a commutativity gadget. We also show that existence of
oracular commutativity gadgets is preserved under categorical powers of graphs;
existence of commutativity gadgets and oracular commutativity gadgets is
equivalent for graphs with no four-cycle; and that the odd cycles and the odd
graphs have a commutative quantum endomorphism monoid, leaving open the
possibility that they might admit a commutativity gadget.

Conclusion: DLOCCNet框架为量子分布式计算提供了实用的支持，特别是在纠缠初期化和态判别方面展现了广泛的应用前景，为理解LOCC局限性并推动协议设计提供了新方法。

Abstract: Due to the limited qubit number of quantum devices, distributed quantum
computing is considered a promising pathway to overcome this constraint. In
this paradigm, multiple quantum processors are interconnected to form a
cohesive computational network, and the most natural set of free operations is
local operations and classical communication (LOCC). However, designing a
practical LOCC protocol for a particular task has been a tough problem. In this
work, we propose a general and flexible framework called dynamic LOCCNet
(DLOCCNet) to simulate and design LOCC protocols. We demonstrate its
effectiveness in two key applications: entanglement distillation and
distributed state discrimination. The protocols designed by DLOCCNet, in
contrast to conventional ones, can solve larger-sized problems with reduced
training time, making the framework a practical and scalable tool for current
quantum devices. This work advances our understanding of the capabilities and
limitations of LOCC while providing a powerful methodology for protocol design.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Simulating computationally hard fermionic systems is a promising application
of quantum computing. However, mapping nonlocal fermionic operators to qubits
often produces deep circuits, rendering such simulations impractical on
near-term hardware. We introduce two Majorana swap network techniques for
variational quantum eigensolvers that reduce circuit depth and two-qubit gate
count, thereby limiting error accumulation. First, we develop a cyclic
compilation algorithm that localizes all two-particle interaction terms in a
general fermionic Hamiltonian that contains $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ such terms,
using only $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ auxiliary Majorana-swap gates, where $n$ is the
number of fermionic modes. This algorithm targets all-to-all qubit connectivity
(e.g., trapped-ion processors) and can be used to compactify UCCGSD circuits.
Second, we design a Majorana swap network for the UpCCGSD variational ansatz,
which is already more compact than UCCGSD. Our network achieves asymptotic
reductions in circuit depth and gate count of approximately 50% and 20%,
respectively, under all-to-all connectivity. For the more restricted $2\times
N$ connectivity, the reductions are even larger -- about 55% (circuit depth)
and 40% (gate count). These improvements translate directly into increased
robustness to hardware noise, as demonstrated by numerical simulations on
representative examples.

### [145] [The Compressed Oracle is a Worthy (Multiplicative) Adversary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07876)
*Stacey Jeffery,Sebastian Zur*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The compressed oracle technique is shown to be a special case of the multiplicative adversary method, simplifying the understanding of quantum query lower bounds and potentially aiding extensions beyond certain distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between various quantum query lower bound methods is crucial for advancing quantum cryptography. Simplifying complex methods like the multiplicative adversary method can make them more accessible for future research.

Method: The authors introduced a simplified version of the multiplicative adversary method, called MLADV, which retains the method's power while being easier to reason about. They demonstrated that the compressed oracle technique is a special case of MLADV.

Result: By establishing that the compressed oracle technique is a special case of MLADV, the authors provide a clearer framework for understanding and applying the compressed oracle technique, particularly in scenarios involving non-product distributions.

Conclusion: This work bridges the compressed oracle technique with the multiplicative adversary method, offering a simpler approach that could be valuable for future research in quantum query complexity and its applications in quantum cryptography.

Abstract: The compressed oracle technique, introduced in the context of quantum
cryptanalysis, is the latest method for proving quantum query lower bounds, and
has had an impressive number of applications since its introduction, due in
part to the ease of importing classical lower bound intuition into the quantum
setting via this method. Previously, the main quantum query lower bound methods
were the polynomial method, the adversary method, and the multiplicative
adversary method, and their relative powers were well understood. In this work,
we situate the compressed oracle technique within this established landscape,
by showing that it is a special case of the multiplicative adversary method. To
accomplish this, we introduce a simplified restriction of the multiplicative
adversary method, the MLADV method, that remains powerful enough to capture the
polynomial method and exhibit a strong direct product theorem, but is much
simpler to reason about. We show that the compressed oracle technique is also
captured by the MLADV method. This might make the MLADV method a promising
direction in the current quest to extend the compressed oracle technique to
non-product distributions.

### [146] [Effective approach to open systems with probability currents and the Grothendieck formalism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07882)
*A. Vourdas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for open systems using a `z-Bargmann` representation. It introduces a Grothendieck quantity ${	Q}$ to quantify system openness via probability currents. The paper explores the relationship between ${\Q}$ and irreversibility mechanisms, showing how unitary transformations in the isolated system reduce to rescaling when projected to the open subsystem. Comparisons are made between ${\Q}$ values in open and isolated systems for various quantum states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a unified approach to studying open systems, which are prevalent in quantum mechanics and other fields, by leveraging mathematical tools like the Grothendieck quantity and semi-unitary matrices.

Method: The authors use z-Bargmann representations and semi-unitary matrices to model the open system as a subsystem of a larger isolated system. They define the Grothendieck quantity ${\Q}$ in terms of probability currents and rescaling transformations, which are linked to irreversible processes. The method involves theoretical analysis and comparison of ${\Q}$ values across different systems.

Result: The authors demonstrate that the Grothendieck quantity ${\Q}$ effectively captures the openness of quantum states. They show that projecting unitary transformations from an isolated system to an open subsystem results in rescaling transformations, which are linked to irreversibility. Quantitative comparisons reveal differences in ${\Q}$ values between open and isolated systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a tool for analyzing open quantum systems and their irreversibility, offering insights into the role of probability currents and rescaling in such systems.

Abstract: An effective approach to open systems and irreversible phenomena is
presented, where an open system $\Sigma(d)$ with $d$-dimensional Hilbert space,
is a subsystem of a larger isolated system $\Sigma(2d)$ (the `full universe')
with $2d$-dimensional Hilbert space. A family of Bargmann-like representations
(called $z$-Bargmann representations) introduces naturally the larger space.
The $z$-Bargmann representations are defined through semi-unitary matrices
(which are a coherent states formalism in disguise). The `openness' of the
system is quantified with the probability current that flows from the system to
the external world. The Grothendieck quantity ${\cal Q}$ is shown to be related
to the probability current, and is used as a figure of merit for the `openness'
of a system. ${\cal Q}$ is expressed in terms of `rescaling transformations'
which change not only the phase but also the absolute value of the
wavefunction, and are intimately linked to irreversible phenomena (e.g.,
damping/amplification). It is shown that unitary transformations in the
isolated system $\Sigma(2d)$ (full universe), reduce to rescaling
transformations when projected to its open subsystem $\Sigma(d)$. The values of
the Grothendieck ${\cal Q}$ for various quantum states in an open system, are
compared with those for their counterpart states in an isolated system.

TL;DR: Using VQC on quantum hardware to detect unseen ransomware fails to outperform classical ML despite theoretical potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting ransomware, a critical issue for cybersecurity, where traditional ML methods fall short. The authors explore Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as a promising alternative, despite the limitations of current quantum hardware.

Method: A hybrid framework combining a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was built to bridge the gap between classical data and quantum hardware.

Result: The study found that even the best 12-qubit VQC achieved only 97.7% recall, significantly underperforming classical baselines. Performance exhibited a non-monotonic trend, degrading from 4 to 8 qubits before improving at 12 qubits.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that more efficient data compression and quantum optimization strategies are needed to fully unlock QML's potential for ransomware detection.

Abstract: Detecting unseen ransomware is a critical cybersecurity challenge where
classical machine learning often fails. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML)
presents a potential alternative, its application is hindered by the
dimensionality gap between classical data and quantum hardware. This paper
empirically investigates a hybrid framework using a Variational Quantum
Classifier (VQC) interfaced with a high-dimensional dataset via Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). Our analysis reveals a dual challenge for practical
QML. A significant information bottleneck was evident, as even the best
performing 12-qubit VQC fell short of the classical baselines 97.7\% recall.
Furthermore, a non-monotonic performance trend, where performance degraded when
scaling from 4 to 8 qubits before improving at 12 qubits suggests a severe
trainability issue. These findings highlight that unlocking QMLs potential
requires co-developing more efficient data compression techniques and robust
quantum optimization strategies.

TL;DR: A scalable fluxonium-transmon-fluxonium (FTF) quantum computing architecture is proposed. The system enables high-fidelity gates without strong non-local interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computers requires avoiding long-range interactions that can introduce errors. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a dual-species architecture.

Method: The research analyzes cross-resonance (CR) CNOT gates between a fluxonium and a transmon qubit, even in the presence of a spectator qubit. They also demonstrate sequential application of these gates for high-fidelity parity checks and logical fluxonium-fluxonium CNOT gates. Additionally, the central transmon facilitates readout of neighboring fluxonium qubits, consolidating multiple functions into a single ancilla.

Result: The FTF architecture shows high coherence with errors at the level of 1e-5. Sequential CNOT gates achieve high-fidelity parity checks and logical fluxonium-fluxonium CNOT gates. The dual-species architecture consolidates critical functions into a single ancilla qubit, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance for quantum computation.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the viability of a dual-species architecture as a promising path toward fault-tolerant quantum computation by introducing a scalable and efficient method to avoid long-range interactions.

Abstract: We propose a scalable fluxonium-transmon-fluxonium (FTF) system that utilizes
a central transmon to mediate high-fidelity gates and parity checks between two
fluxonium qubits without the need for strong non-local interactions. This
approach suppresses unwanted long-range interactions, which is critical for
developing larger quantum processors. First, we analyze the performance of
cross-resonance (CR) CNOT gates between a fluxonium and a transmon. We show
that even in the presence of a spectator qubit, these gates maintain high
fidelity with coherent errors on the order of $10^{-5}$. We then demonstrate
that these gates, when applied sequentially, enable high-fidelity parity checks
and logical fluxonium-fluxonium CNOT gates. In addition, the central transmon
can facilitate the readout of the neighboring fluxoniums, consolidating
multiple critical functions into a single ancilla. Our work establishes the

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning an $M$-sparse Hamiltonian and the related
problem of Hamiltonian sparsity testing. Through a detailed analysis of Bell
sampling, we reduce the total evolution time required by the state-of-the-art
algorithm for $M$-sparse Hamiltonian learning to
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(M/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the
$\ell^{\infty}$ error, achieving an improvement by a factor of $M$ (ignoring
the logarithmic factor) while only requiring access to forward time-evolution.
We then establish a connection between Hamiltonian learning and Hamiltonian
sparsity testing through Bell sampling, which enables us to propose a
Hamiltonian sparsity testing with state-of-the-art total evolution time
scaling.

Abstract: We introduce and analyze a toy model of a quantum physical device capable of
internal, self-referential deliberation, realized through iterative,
branch-dependent unitary evolution tracked by control, memory, and policy
registers. The key idea is to represent ``deliberation'' as a coherent
branching process, in which alternative candidate evolutions are maintained in
superposition across registers, rather than by placing the system itself under
a literal superposition of Hamiltonians. We provide explicit quantum circuit
realizations, carry through detailed step-by-step derivations of the entangled
memory--policy dynamics, and analyze the constraints imposed by the no-cloning
theorem on coherent information flow. We also briefly discuss categorical
reformulations and their conceptual implications. Taken together, this frames
the model as a plausible setting for exploring how such devices may maintain
multiple alternatives in parallel, providing a formal framework for
investigating internally coherent decision processes through coherent
branching, entanglement, and self-modifying unitary dynamics.

Abstract: We provide a detailed geometric and physical interpretation of infinite
distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB
compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds, motivated by the Emergent String
Conjecture. In the framework of semi-stable degenerations, such limits are
characterised by a simple fibration structure of the fastest vanishing
three-cycles. The previously studied Hodge theoretic classification of infinite
distance limits of type II, III, and IV is reflected in the number of
one-cycles of the shrinking fibres. Complementing our recent work on limits of
type II, we focus here on type III and type IV degenerations. Based on
effective field theory considerations, these are expected to be
decompactification limits to 6d and 5d, respectively. However, establishing the
existence of the associated Kaluza-Klein tower(s) of states with both the
appropriate mass scaling and the correct degeneracy requires explicit geometric
input. We show that the aforementioned vanishing three-cycles are special
Lagrangian three-tori, thus giving rise to towers of asymptotically massless
BPS particles from multi-wrapped D3-branes with the degeneracy of a
Kaluza-Klein tower. We furthermore relate the BPS index of these three-cycles
to the Euler characteristic of the threefold. Finally, we systematically
analyse infinite distance trajectories in multi-parameter limits described by
so-called enhancement chains. We find that the primary singularity type encodes
the gravitational duality frame of the limit whereas the secondary singularity
type is related to the rank of the gauge group coupled to gravity. The
specifics of the asymptotic physics depend crucially on whether or not the
trajectory is induced by the backreaction of an EFT string.

### [155] [Impact of quantum gravity on the UV sensitivity of extremal black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07058)
*Francesco Del Porro,Francesco Ferrarin,Alessia Platania*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper investigates how extremal Kerr black holes react to higher-order gravity effects, revealing that their behavior is highly sensitive to these modifications. The sensitivity is linked to Wilson coefficients in low-energy effective field theory, which are determined by the quantum gravity sector at high energies. The study suggests that within the framework of asymptotically safe quantum gravity, if the quantum gravity scale exceeds the Planck scale, this sensitivity at the black hole horizon can be mitigated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of black holes under modified gravity theories is crucial for validating the predictions of quantum gravity. The paper aims to explore how higher-derivative corrections to Einstein's equations affect extremal Kerr black holes and what implications this has for low-energy effective field theory.

Method: The analysis employs effective field theory and the concept of asymptotic safety to model the quantum gravitational corrections. The behavior of the black hole under these corrections is studied, with a focus on the tidal forces near the horizon.

Result: The paper finds that the horizon-scale behavior of extremal Kerr black holes is sensitive to quantum gravitational effects unless the quantum gravity scale is trans-Planckian. This result provides insights into the interplay between quantum gravity and classical black hole physics.

Conclusion: The study concludes that within asymptotically safe quantum gravity, the sensitivity of extremal Kerr black holes to higher-derivative corrections can be avoided if the quantum gravity scale is pushed beyond the Planck scale. This suggests a possible resolution to the 'ultraviolet sensitivity' issue in black hole physics.

Abstract: Recent work has revealed that extremal Kerr black holes may exhibit a
sensitivity to higher-derivative corrections to Einstein's equations,
displaying singularities in the tidal forces at the horizon. However, in a
purely gravitational context, this "ultraviolet sensitivity" translates into a
strong dependence on the Wilson coefficients in the low-energy effective field
theory. These, in turn, are fixed by the underlying theory of quantum gravity
in the ultraviolet. We find a prediction for these coefficients within the
framework of asymptotically safe quantum gravity, and show that, if the quantum
gravity scale is trans-Planckian, this horizon-scale ultraviolet sensitivity is
avoided.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a
$p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector
multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent
truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of
four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector
multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic
supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have
an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate
how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a
$(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to
obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute
thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the
Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of
truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other,
and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.

Abstract: We consider quantum decoherence and entropy increase in early universe
cosmology. We first study decoherence in a discrete bipartite quantum system
for which a single qubit gets entangled with an environment and the entropy
increase is correlated with the decay of the off-diagonal terms of the reduced
density matrix. We compare this system with continuous systems relevant for
cosmology for which there is a natural external intervention, corresponding to
the time-dependent separation between the sub- and super-horizon inflationary
fluctuations. We find, in this case, that the off-diagonal terms of the density
matrix, in a field basis, do not decay as sometimes assumed in cosmological
set-ups. Nevertheless, following a recent treatment in terms of open Effective
Field Theories (EFTs), we compute the entanglement entropy for a Gaussian state
and show that it actually increases monotonically ($\dot S>0$) during the
accelerated phases ($\ddot a>0$ with $a(t)$ the scale factor). We generalise
this result to include non-Gaussian states and briefly discuss the relevance of
computing the von Neumann entropy as compared to the thermodynamic entropy.

coordinate system on the bundle that clarifies the geometric content in
scattering amplitudes, particularly the imprints of field space
non-analyticities. Specializing to the Standard Model Higgs sector, we examine
the geometric consequences of custodial symmetry violation, including
implications for the physical Higgs field as a distinguished scalar axis and
deformations in the fermionic sector. Our results enable a systematic and
realistic geometric interpretation of Higgs sector phenomenology.

Abstract: Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in
numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to
few parameters, which are known only at the leading order in the perturbative
expansions. The major challenges are from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with
three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to
compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point
correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs
generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and it
closely relates to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify
the subgraph expansions of the conserved current 3-point correlators using the
exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that the multi-loop 3-point Feynman
integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions.
Due to the constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep the first
few terms of the subgraphs to completely fix the subleading order corrections.
We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to the current
correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the
Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the
coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle
JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$
vector model. We compare the perturbative result with the bootstrap data and
discuss its application for the conductivity near the quantum critical point.

Abstract: Using functional integral methods, we investigate the non-Abelian Casimir
energy in the Curci-Ferrari model, which offers an effective description of the
infrared regime of Yang-Mills theory. We consider a 3+1D (resp.\ 2+1D) system
of two infinite parallel plates (resp.\ wires) at a fixed distance from each
other, with either perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) or perfect electric
conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. Imposing the boundary conditions directly
in the functional integral by the introduction of suitable auxiliary fields
that act as Lagrange multipliers, we obtain a boundary effective action that
captures the dynamics of this system. The Casimir energy is then computed both
directly from the functional integral and via the energy-momentum tensor,
providing equivalent results. We find that the Casimir energy for PEC and PMC
conditions differs by a constant factor, which can be traced back to a van
Dam--Veltman--Zakharov-like discontinuity (both in 3+1D and 2+1D). Lastly, we
show that our analytical results are compatible with a variety of recent
numerical lattice simulations of the non-perturbative Yang-Mills Casimir
energy, in which a novel non-perturbative mass scale emerges.

*Itzhak Bars*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel explanation for the Higgs boson's role in creating particle masses and its potential role in resolving the black hole information paradox by introducing non-perturbative effects near gravitational singularities that create antigravity regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the desire to understand the fundamental role of the Higgs field and its implications for resolving major paradoxes in theoretical physics such as the black hole information paradox.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis and computations to explore the proposed model, likely involving advanced mathematical frameworks and potentially string theory.

Result: A new framework for understanding the Higgs field and its role in creating alternative space-time regions beyond standard models, including a potential solution to the black hole information paradox.

Conclusion: This research opens doors for exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model, particularly in understanding how quantum mechanics and general relativity might coexist more seamlessly than previously thought.

Abstract: The Higgs boson is often compared to a small ripple on a vast, calm ocean.
This "ocean" is the universal Higgs vacuum expectation value, about 246 GeV,
permeating all space and generating particle masses. Its remarkable uniformity
reflects the large-scale nature of the universe. Here I argue that the Higgs
field plays a far deeper role. In regions of extreme gravity near
singularities, it becomes a non-perturbative, space-time--dependent field that
creates new space-time domains beyond gravitational singularities -- new
regions governed by antigravity. This mechanism produces dramatic dynamics
inside black holes and in the earliest universe, including restoration of the
electroweak symmetry SU(2)xU(1) at singularities. The adjoining gravity and
antigravity regions form a geodesically complete space-time bridged by
traversable singularities -- absent in the Standard Model coupled to general
relativity or its extensions such as string theory. In such a framework, the
black hole information paradox admits a new, manifestly unitary resolution.
Details of computations are developed in the companion paper [1]; here, only a
brief outline is given.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action
of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of
research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, such group actions
do not automatically satisfy associativity. The obstruction is captured by a
cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose presence signals a
failure of group associativity. In these cases, the symmetry structure is no
longer described by an ordinary group, but instead by a $2$-group -- a
group-like structure extended by a $1$-form symmetry. In this short note, we
prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in
abelian bosonic TQFTs.

TL;DR: This paper explains how Chern-Simons theory has unified knot invariants and integrable models in mathematical physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper likely aims to bridge gaps between physics and mathematics by using Chern-Simons theory as a tool to connect complex mathematical concepts.

Method: It uses perturbative analysis of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory to solve long-standing problems in knot theory and integrable models.

Result: A significant result is the novel framework that unifies various aspects of these fields, providing a deeper understanding of their interconnections.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces these developments to non-experts, facilitating cross-disciplinary understanding.

Abstract: While general quantum field theories (QFTs) have yet to be rigorously defined
in mathematics, they have generated new mathematics and have served as a
unifying principle connecting different branches of the subject. In 1989,
Witten made a profound impact on the mathematical community by systematically
constructing knot invariants via the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. One
of the historical roots of knot invariants was integrable models, whose
explanation in terms of QFT remained unsolved for decades. Recently, this
problem was solved by a perturbative analysis of the four-dimensional
Chern-Simons theory, which provides a novel framework for understanding and
unifying many different aspects of integrable models. In this article, we
summarize the basic aspects of these developments for non-experts in both
physics and mathematics.

TL;DR: This paper explores the geometry of a specific type of superconformal symmetry in the context of D-branes and black holes, providing new insights into resolving singularities in related supersymmetric systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of superconformal symmetries and their geometric realizations is fundamental in theoretical physics, particularly in understanding the behavior of black holes and D-branes in string theory.

Method: The research employs a method involving gauged sigma models with specific multiplets to analyze the geometry of quiver theories, utilizing a radial-angular coordinate system tailored to the model's structure.

Result: The authors successfully compute the target space metric for quiver configurations and generalize to symmetric crystal quivers, demonstrating the utility of their approach in resolving geometric singularities.

Conclusion: This collaborative work advances our understanding of supergravity and string theory by offering a novel geometric framework to address long-standing issues in superconformal mechanics.

Abstract: We study the geometry of the gauged quiver quantum mechanics realizing
$D(2,1;0)$ superconformal symmetry. These models arise as effective
descriptions of multi-centered D-brane systems in type II Calabi-Yau
compactifications, in the $AdS_2$ scaling limit, and they describe the
near-horizon microscopics of multi-centered BPS black holes in the four
dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity. We work in the gauged sigma model
formulation with off-shell $(4,4,0)$ multiplets, which allows us to introduce a
coordinate system adapted to the complex structure of the gauged sigma model
target space, that assigns a radial-angular frame to each quiver node in the
physical configuration space. It provides an explicit decomposition of the
sigma model quiver metric into distinct sectors governed by couplings between
each node. We compute the full target space metric for 2-node and 3-node quiver
configurations, and generalize to symmetric $N$-node crystal quivers. Finally
we implement Gaiotto-Simons-Strominger-Yin's $D(2,1;0)$ index for this system
and show that the corresponding gauged superconformal index -- at least in a
rich family of physical examples -- provides a new tool for resolving the
conical singularity complications generically present in the ungauged
superconformal mechanics.

TL;DR: A new SymTFT framework for describing spacetime symmetries, incorporating BF-theory and Chern-Simons couplings for anomalies, with applications to symmetry breaking and conformal symmetry.lates to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity in $d=1$ and a topological limit of 4d gravity in $d=3$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a novel approach to understanding spacetime symmetries through SymTFT, incorporating BF-theory, Chern-Simons couplings, and applications to symmetry breaking. It also explores connections to gravity and holography, with notable correspondences in lower dimensions.

Method: The authors propose a SymTFT by extending BF-theory. They derive boundary conditions, study symmetry breaking, specialize to conformal symmetry to derive a dilaton action, and demonstrate that topological defects realize symmetry transformations. They also explore connections to gravity and holography, showing correspondences in specific dimensions.

Result: The key results include the successful construction of a SymTFT framework, derivation of the dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking, demonstration that topological defects realize symmetry transformations, and establishing correspondences with known gravity theories in specific dimensions. These results provide a new perspective on spacetime symmetries and their relation to gravity.

Conclusion: The paper introduces SymTFT as a promising framework for unifying spacetime symmetries with gravity, demonstrating its applicability through various examples and connections to known theories in lower dimensions. It represents a significant step towards understanding the quantum nature of spacetime symmetries and gravity.

Abstract: We propose a Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous
spacetime symmetries. For a $d$-dimensional theory, it is given by a
$(d+1)$-dimensional BF-theory for the spacetime symmetry group, and whenever
$d$ is even, it can also include Chern-Simons couplings that encode conformal
and gravitational anomalies. We study the boundary conditions for this SymTFT
and describe the general setup to study symmetry breaking of spacetime
symmetries. We then specialize to the conformal symmetry case and derive the
dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking. To further substantiate that
our setup captures spacetime symmetries, we demonstrate that the topological
defects of the SymTFT realize the associated spacetime symmetry
transformations. Finally, we study the relation to gravity and holography. The
proposal classically coincides with two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity
for $d=1$ as well as the topological limit of four-dimensional gravity in the
$d=3$ case.

Abstract: Achieving stable in vivo locomotion is essential for using magnetically
actuated microswimmers for biomedical applications; however, while existing
microswimmers have excellent motion control in vitro, their motion is greatly
hindered inside living organisms. Moreover, previous work had only visually
demonstrated in vivo motion through gradient pulling or rolling, but not
swimming. This study investigated the injection and imaging of the achiral
planar microswimmers (APMs) inside a live zebrafish embryo. The APMs can be
actuated under a rotating magnetic field to generate a forward thrust at low
Reynolds number environment. Combined with a safe injection technique and clear
in vivo imaging at high resolution, it would be possible to control the
swimming motion of APMs inside the zebrafish embryo. This work shows the safe
injection and the clear imaging of an APM in a transparent zebrafish model,
demonstrating the possibility for follow-up in-depth studies of the swimming
motion of microswimmers in vivo.
