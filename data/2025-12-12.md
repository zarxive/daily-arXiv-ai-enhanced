### [1] [Investigation of Real-Space Transfer Noise in InP Quantum Wells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10103)
*Jiayin Zhang,Anthony J. Ardizzi,Kieran A. Cleary,Austin J. Minnich*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates drain noise in InP HEMTs and finds that real-space transfer (RST) contributes to the noise, supporting a theoretical model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding noise mechanisms in HEMTs is important for improving their performance, particularly for applications in quantum computing where noise levels are critical.

Method: The authors experimentally test a theoretical proposal by characterizing microwave noise temperature using transfer-length method structures with different barrier compositions.

Result: The results show trends in noise temperature with physical temperature and source-drain voltage that align with RST noise theory predictions.

Conclusion: The findings support the hypothesis that RST is a significant contributor to drain noise in HEMTs.

Abstract: Indium phosphide (InP) high electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are widely used in many fields such as quantum computing because of their unparalleled microwave noise performance. Achieving improved noise performance requires a physical understanding of the noise mechanisms. Here, we experimentally test a theoretical proposal for drain (output) noise as originating in part from real-space transfer (RST) by characterizing the microwave noise temperature of transfer-length method structures with the same channel composition but two different barrier compositions. This choice was made to alter the confining potential of electrons in the channel, thereby affecting the RST mechanism, while avoiding changes to the channel transport properties. We observe trends of noise temperature with physical temperature and source-drain voltage which are compatible with the predictions of RST noise theory. This finding supports the hypothesis that RST contributes to drain noise in HEMTs.

Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) communication systems, operating in higher frequency bands from 3 to 300 GHz, provide unprecedented bandwidth to enable ultra-high data rates and low-latency services. However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies raises public health concerns regarding prolonged electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Above 6 GHz, the incident power density (IPD) is used instead of the specific absorption rate (SAR) for exposure assessment, owing to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves. This paper proposes a hybrid field reconstruction framework that integrates classical electromagnetic algorithms with deep learning to evaluate the IPD of wireless communication devices operating at 30 GHz, thereby determining compliance with established RF exposure limits. An initial estimate of the electric field on the evaluation plane is obtained using a classical reconstruction algorithm, followed by refinement through a neural network model that learns the mapping between the initial and accurate values. A multi-antenna dataset, generated via full-wave simulation, is used for training and testing. The impacts of training strategy, initial-value algorithm, reconstruction distance, and measurement sampling density on model performance are analyzed. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, achieving an average relative error of 4.57% for electric field reconstruction and 2.97% for IPD estimation on the test dataset. Additionally, the effects of practical uncertainty factors, including probe misalignment, inter-probe coupling, and measurement noise, are quantitatively assessed.

An X band voltage doubler rectifier has been developed with 72% conversion efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained rectifying efficiency is the maximum reported to date at X band with Schottky diodes. The working characteristics of the diodes in the voltage doubler rectifier are analyzed in detail. Closed-form equations of diode input impedance and rectifying efficiency are presented and validated using Advanced Design System simulations. The matching network design of the proposed rectifier is based on the closed-form equations. The preliminary rectifying efficiency is predicted by the closed-form equations as well. Measured and simulated results are in good agreement.

Abstract: Neutron-source identification is central to nuclear physics and its applications, from planetary science to nuclear security, yet direct discrimination from neutron spectra remains fundamentally elusive. Here, we introduce a Bayesian protocol that directly infers source ensembles from measured neutron spectra by combining full-spectrum template matching with probabilistic evidence evaluation. Applying this protocol to recoil and time-of-flight spectroscopy, we recover single- and two-source configurations with strong statistical significance ($>\!\!4σ$) at event counts as low as $\sim\!\!10^{3}$. These results demonstrate that neutron spectral signatures can be leveraged for robust source identification, opening a new observational window for both fundamental research and operationally driven applications.

Abstract: The critical current of superconductors is commonly measured by testing unloaded wires under an external magnetic field. While stressed by intense Lorentz forces, the existing HTS/LTS superconductors are prone to a reduction in critical current before reaching their structural mechanical limit. In this work, the magnetic and mechanical analysis of the FNAL 4-layer Bi-2212/Nb$_3$Sn hybrid dipole magnet is reported, aimed at predicting the critical current degradation for both the superconductors during powering at 16 T. All the Rutherford cables in the coils of the hybrid magnet were modeled at the strand level in Ansys APDL with the heterogeneous cable model. Utilizing this detailed geometry, it was possible to evaluate the effects of strain on the critical current degradation for both the Nb$_3$Sn and Bi-2212 superconductors under the intense Lorentz forces. The analysis presented in this paper integrates strain-dependent critical current laws, with parameters derived from experimental data, to simulate the hybrid magnet's performance for all possible current-powering configurations. The proposed methodology enables a detailed assessment of conductor integrity and I$_C$($\varepsilon$) reduction in existing hybrid magnet designs, providing a versatile and rigorous framework for optimizing future high-field hybrid magnets.

Abstract: The PICOSEC detector concept uses a micro-pattern gaseous detector (MPGD) amplification structure combined with a Cerenkov radiator coated with a semi-transparent photocathode to provide below tens of picosecond-level precision timing capabilities with minimum ionizing particles. PICOSEC has triggered interest in the development of time-of-flight detectors for particle identification and timing detectors for track reconstruction in the high rate environment of future nuclear and high energy physics experiments. The PICOSEC Micromegas (or PICOSEC-MM) detector, developed by the CERN-based PICOSEC collaboration, use the Micromegas structure for gaseous amplification and achieve below 20 ps timing resolution. A new type of PICOSEC detector, the μRWELL-PICOSEC based on μRWELL amplification structure, is being investigated at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) alongside PICOSEC-MM R&D efforts in Europe. Preliminary results from the two 2024 beam test campaigns at CERN demonstrate a timing performance better than 24 ps is achievable with a single-channel μRWELL-PICOSEC prototype. A vigorous R&D effort is ongoing to improve the timing performance, robustness and operational stability of μRWELL-PICOSEC detectors. Development of a large size μRWELL-PICOSEC is also under consideration for applications in large scale experiments.

*Tomofumi Shimoda,Wataru Kokuyama,Hideaki Nozato*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper discusses the challenges in maintaining measurement accuracy of low-cost MEMS-based triaxial vibration sensors under varying environmental conditions, particularly temperature. The authors developed an environmental testing system with a triaxial vibration exciter to reproduce low-frequency, long-stroke vibrations. The system operates within a temperature range of -30°C to +80°C and uses laser interferometry and reference accelerometers to achieve high-accuracy vibration measurements (0.23% overall accuracy). The system is validated using a MEMS accelerometer, demonstrating its potential for accurate earthquake observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vibration sensors are essential in various applications, and maintaining their accuracy under varying environmental conditions is crucial. This paper focuses on low-cost MEMS-based sensors, which are increasingly used but have limitations in accuracy due to environmental factors like temperature. The development of a system to test and validate these sensors under controlled environmental conditions addresses this gap.

Method: The authors developed an environmental testing system that integrates a triaxial vibration exciter and a laser interferometer with reference accelerometers. The system was designed to reproduce low-frequency, long-stroke vibrations mimicking those caused by large earthquakes. The system operates within a temperature range of -30°C to +80°C, and the measurements are calibrated within the system to ensure accuracy.

Result: The system achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 0.23% for reference vibration measurements. The authors demonstrated the system's validity by using it to evaluate the accuracy of a MEMS accelerometer in earthquake observations.

Conclusion: The developed environmental testing system provides a reliable method for assessing the measurement accuracy of vibration sensors under varying temperatures. The system's high accuracy and capability to reproduce extreme vibration conditions make it valuable for evaluating sensor performance in earthquake observations.

Abstract: Triaxial vibration sensor are widely used used in various application. Recently, low-cost sensors based on micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology are also becoming more widely adopted. However, their measurement accuracy can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature. In this study, we developed an environmental testing system integrated with a triaxial vibration exciter. The system can reproduce long-stroke, low-frequency triaxial vibrations -- such as those caused by huge earthquakes -- under temperatures ranging from $-30~^\circ\mathrm{C}$ to $+80~^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Using this system, the measurement accuracy of vibration sensors can be evaluated under different environmental conditions. The system provides highly accurate reference measurements using a laser interferometer and reference accelerometers that are primarily calibrated within the system. The overall accuracy of the reference vibration measurement is estimated to be approximately 0.23~\%. Based on these reference measurements, we investigated the accuracy of earthquake observations using a MEMS accelerometer as a demonstration. The system configuration and testing procedures are presented in this paper.

Abstract: Liquid argon time projection chambers have emerged as a competitive technology for detecting solar neutrinos. The SoLAr collaboration was formed to explore argon detectors with pixelated light and charge readout, aiming for high detection efficiency and improved energy resolution. Building on the success of an initial prototype, we present results obtained with a second SoLAr prototype (V2), a $30 \times 30 \times 30$ cm$^{3}$ time projection chamber operated in a cryostat containing several hundred kilograms of liquid argon. We report measurements of cosmic-ray muons using both tracking and calorimetry from light and charge sensors, and we highlight the improved performance achieved through combined charge and light reconstruction. These results demonstrate the promise of dual-readout detectors and motivate future prototyping efforts toward kiloton-scale facilities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The observation of Planckian scattering, often inferred from Drude fits in strongly correlated metals, raises the question of how to extract an intrinsic timescale from measurable quantities in a model-independent way. We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.

Abstract: Hall viscosity is a quantized nondissipative stress response of a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid to adiabatic geometric deformations. Despite strong theoretical interest, its experimental observation in the FQH state has remained elusive, making it a promising target for realization on current NISQ devices. In this work, we employ a quasi-one-dimensional model of an FQH state coupled to a background metric to probe the geometric response under a metric quench. We design and implement a quantum-circuit protocol that realizes a Hilbert-space-truncated version of the model and extracts the Hall viscosity from the geometric response encoded in the wavefunction dynamics of the device. While the truncation prevents us from accessing the fully quantized value of Hall viscosity, the hardware data nevertheless show excellent agreement with analytical and numerical predictions within this restricted regime.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper discusses the magnetic structure of a new material, Hg0.7Na0.3Mn3Mn4O12, which exhibits unique charge and orbital ordering. Neutron diffraction and symmetry analysis revealed an AFM ordering on certain sites. The mechanism behind this ordering is linked to structural and magnetic distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of magnetic orderings in complex materials, especially those involving different cations, can provide insights into unconventional electronic states and potentially new applications in technology.

Method: The researchers used powder neutron diffraction and symmetry-motivated analysis to determine the magnetic structure of the material.

Result: An AFM order was observed on specific sites, with a particular spin configuration on the B sites that differs from other similar materials.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the distinct role of Hg²⁺ in stabilizing novel states and the potential for further exploration of mixed-valent materials in the future.

Abstract: The magnetic structure of the novel Hg$_{0.7}$Na$_{0.3}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$, a quadruple manganite perovskite that exhibits a unique $G$-type charge and orbital ordered state distinct to other $A^{2+}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ equivalents ($A$ $=$ Ca, Sr, Cd, Pb), has been solved using powder neutron diffraction and symmetry-motivated analysis. A $G$-type-like antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn on the $A'$ sites and a `up--up--down--down' AFM moment configuration of Mn spins on the $B$ sites is found to occur. The mechanism for the onset and stabilization of $B$ site `up--up--down--down' AFM order is explored in terms of coupling between structural and magnetic distortions. The results presented here provide evidence of the exotic charge, orbital, electronic and magnetic orderings that quadruple manganite perovskites demonstrate, and further highlighting the distinct chemistry that Hg$^{2+}$ plays in stabilizing novel states compared to other divalent $A$-site cation equivalents.

### [12] [Gutzwiller approximation for paramagnetic ionic Hubbard model: Analytic expression for band - Mott insulator transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10096)
*Marcin M. Wysokiński*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper studies the ionic Hubbard model and uses the Gutzwiller approximation to derive phase boundaries between Mott insulator and band insulator. The method captures the band-Mott behavior but misses the correlated metallic phase found in other approaches. The authors suggest that the metallic phase arises from incoherent Hubbard-band physics, and the framework can be extended to other setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is likely motivated by the challenge of understanding the phase transitions in correlated systems, particularly the competition between band and Mott insulating behavior. The use of the ionic Hubbard model and the Gutzwiller approximation points to a focus on strongly correlated electron systems.

Method: The authors employ the infinite-dimensional Gutzwiller approximation within the variational approach to derive an analytic expression for the phase boundary in the ionic Hubbard model. This method allows them to compute the phase diagram and compare it with known results from dynamical mean-field theory.

Result: Through their analysis, the authors find that the Gutzwiller approximation accurately reproduces the band-Mott insulator phase boundary but fails to capture the correlated metallic phase that appears in other theoretical frameworks. This highlights the limitations of the Gutzwiller approximation in describing certain metallic states.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the metallic phase in the ionic Hubbard model likely arises from incoherent Hubbard-band physics, rather than coherent Fermi-liquid behavior. Additionally, the variational framework presented by the authors opens up possibilities for studying non-equilibrium and spin-exchange dynamics in ionic Hubbard systems.

Abstract: The ionic Hubbard model is a paradigmatic setup for studying the competition between band and Mott insulating behavior. Within the variationally exact in infinite dimensions Gutzwiller approximation, we derive a compact analytic expression for the phase boundary between Mott and band insulator. While the method reproduces the expected band-Mott insulator phenomenology, it does not capture the correlated metallic state at finite staggered potential found for example in dynamical mean-field theory. This absence highlights that the metallic phase originates from incoherent Hubbard-band physics rather than Fermi-liquid behavior well captured by Gutzwiller approximation. Our formulation establishes a concise variational framework to ionic Hubbard model, with natural extensions to nonequilibrium setups and spin-exchange dynamics.

Motivation: 磁性材料在现代电子应用中扮演着关键角色，特别是反常霍尔效应，这种效应在拓扑磁性材料中已被广泛研究。然而，关于平凡拓扑磁性材料中的反常霍尔效应尚不明确。因此，研究双Q结构在平凡拓扑下对反常霍尔效应的影响具有重要意义。

Method: 该研究采用了理论分析和多轨道康居模型。通过分析双Q结构下的多轨道杂化，研究者计算了伯里曲率，推导出反常霍尔响应的非线性行为与均匀磁化率的关系。

Result: 研究发现，尽管双Q磁性材料具有平凡拓扑，但由于双Q超结构引起的轨道杂化，伯里曲率显著增强，导致反常霍尔效应急剧放大。具体而言，反常霍尔系数在均匀磁化率的非 monoconic范围内表现出非线性的变化，与单Q螺旋状态和完全ferromagnetic状态不同。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了双Q结构在平凡拓扑下的独特反常霍尔效应，为开发新颖的磁性复合材料提供了理论依据。这种效应的发现扩展了反常霍尔效应的应用领域，表明平凡拓扑的双Q结构是磁性复合材料中的潜在候选，具有重要的前景和应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-$Q$ magnets consist of superposed spin density waves with distinct magnetic modulation vectors, enabling a wide range of magnetic orders depending on their combination. Among them, topologically nontrivial spin textures, such as a magnetic skyrmion, has been extensively studied owing to the emergence of topological Hall effects induced by real-space scalar spin chirality. Contrary to this expectation, we theoretically investigate another route to enhancing the Hall response under a topologically \textit{trivial} double-$Q$ spin textures. Despite the cancellation of the scalar spin chirality, the double-$Q$ magnetism exhibits a pronounced Hall response with a nonmonotonic dependence on the uniform magnetization, which is in stark contrast to a ferromagnetic state and a single-$Q$ spiral state. Analyzing the multi-orbital Kondo lattice model, we show that orbital hybridization induced by the double-$Q$ superstructure enhances the Berry curvature in $\mathbf{k}$-space, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect. This mechanism accounts for the observed giant anomalous Hall effect in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ and GdRu$_2$Ge$_2$, thereby highlighting topologically trivial double-$Q$ spin textures as promising spintronic materials.

Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of AgF2, AgFBF4, AgF and Ag2O using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ag L3 edge. XAS results were compared with density functional theory computations of the spectra, allowing an identification of main features and an assessment of the theoretical approximations. Our RIXS measurements reveal that AgF2 exhibits charge transfer excitations and dd excitations, analogous to those observed in La2CuO4. We propose to use the ratio of dd to CT spectral weight as a measure of the covalence of the compounds and provide explicit equations for the weights as a function of the scattering geometry for crystals and powders. The measurements at the metal site L3 edge and previous measurements at the ligand K edge reveal a striking similarity between the fluorides and cuprates materials, with fluorides somewhat more covalent than cuprates. These findings support the hypothesis that silver fluorides are an excellent platform to mimic the physics of cuprates, providing a promising avenue for exploring high-Tc superconductivity and exotic magnetism in quasi-two-dimensional (AgF2) and quasi-one-dimensional (AgFBF4) materials.

### [15] [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285)
*BoCheng Yu,JiaLiang Jiang,Jing Meng,XiaoYan Zhu,Jie Ma,HaiFeng Du,QingFeng Zhan,Jin Tang,Yang Xu,Tian Shang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates the topological Hall effect (TPE) in a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet. Despite observing Hall-resistivity anomalies, the authors attribute these anomalies to trivial mechanisms, specifically sample inhomogeneity, rather than chiral spin textures. They conclude that the TPE in this material arises from multiple anomalous Hall channels. This finding challenges the use of TPE as evidence for chiral spin textures in magnetic materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the origin of Topological Hall Effect (TPE) and its relation to chiral spin textures is crucial for the development of spintronic devices. This paper aims to clarify whether TPE can reliably indicate chiral spin textures or if it can arise from other mechanisms.

Method: The authors performed a systematic study of the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet. They used Hall resistivity measurements, magnetic and metamagnetic transitions analysis, and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to investigate the origin of the observed Hall-resistivity anomalies.

Result: The study reveals that the observed Hall-resistivity anomalies in the Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet are not due to chiral spin textures but rather to multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Furthermore, Lorentz STEM measurements confirm the absence of chiral spin textures in this material.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that the challenges of identifying chiral spin textures through transport measurements are not limited to two-dimensional systems but also apply to bulk materials. This highlights the need for careful analysis and validation of experimental results to avoid misattributing the origin of observed effects.

Abstract: Skyrmions and other chiral spin textures have been extensively studied as potential building blocks for novel spintronic devices. Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials. However, recent studies on magnetic thin films have revealed a drawback of this approach, as the presumed topological Hall contribution may in fact originate from trivial mechanisms. Here, we investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet, whose related compounds have previously been suggested to exhibit a topological Hall effect arising from chiral spin textures. Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Our work shows that the difficulties of identifying chiral spin textures through transport measurements also apply to bulk systems, prompting some existing results to be revisited.

Motivation: 随着自旋电电子学的发展，探索过渡金属合金在不同磁性状态下的电性质行为及其潜在应用具有重要意义。

Method: 通过磁偏振、纵向电导率和横向 hall 电阻率等方法，系统研究了不同 Rh 含量下的 MnRh 膜的相行为和电性质。

Result: Rh 含量对 MnRh 膜的磁性和电性质具有显著影响：(1) 当 Rh 含量在 20≤x≤50 时，MnRh 膜表现出从纯磁性 (FM) 到反磁性 (AFM) 和中间复合磁性的复杂磁相图。(2) 所有样本的异或 hall 效应均在磁性有序态下表现出来，且与 Berry 曲率机制密切相关。(3) 电性质和磁性表现出强烈的相关性，尤其是当 x=35 时，这种相关性最为明显。

Conclusion: 研究结果展示了 Rh 含量对 MnRh 膜磁性和电性质的深刻影响，尤其是在电子态拓扑方面的研究为下一步 AFM 自旋电电子学应用奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: A series of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ ($20 \le x \le 50$) thin films were epitaxially grown on the MgO substrate using magnetron sputtering technique, and were systematically investigated by magnetization, longitudinal electrical resistivity, and transverse Hall resistivity. After optimizing the growth conditions, phase-pure Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films with a cubic CsCl-type structure were obtained, and their magnetic phase diagram was built. The manipulation of Rh content leads to a rich magnetic phase diagram, where three different regimes can be identified: for $x < 40$, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a ferromagnetic (FM) transition below $T_\mathrm{C} \approx$ 330-350 K; for $40 \le x \le 45$, in addition to the FM transition at $T_\mathrm{C} \approx$ 200 K, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a FM-to-antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx$ 120 K; finally for $x > 45$, only one AFM transition at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx$ 150 K can be tracked. All the Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films exhibit distinct anomalous Hall effect in their magnetically ordered state, which is most likely due to the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. In addition, all the anomalous Hall transport properties, including the resistivity, conductivity, and angle exhibit a strong correlation with the magnetic properties of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, which become most evident for $x$ = 35. Our systematic investigations suggest a strong correlation between magnetic properties and electronic band topology in Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, highlighting their great potential for AFM spintronics.

Conclusion: 通过DFT+dynamical mean-field理论得出了关于双层镍酸超导体在高压和掺杂条件下的电子结构的详细描述，尤其是电子自旋和特征随掺杂的变化规律，为理解该材料的超导机制提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach we study the effects of electronic correlations and doping on the normal state electronic structure of the double-layer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $χ({\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the Néel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping).

Abstract: We investigate the binding of holes and the emergence of competing spin-charge order in the simple and extended Hubbard model using exact diagonalization on the 3x4 cylindrical lattice. For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems.

Abstract: In this comprehensive study, we present results of bulk measurements (magnetization, specific heat, ac susceptibility, thermal expansion, and magnetostriction) combined with local methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (^23Na NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) and simulations (McPhase) on polycrystalline and single-crystalline NaGdS_2 samples. The rare-earth delafossite NaGdS_2 is a triangular-lattice magnet with S = 7/2 spin-only Gd^3+ moments with suppressed single-ion anisotropy. In our study, we estimate that NaGdS_2 has a weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/k_B is about 52mK) and signs of long-range magnetic order are absent down to lowest temperature. However, indications of short range magnetic order are found below 180 mK in the ac susceptibility and thermal expansion. Our results indicate an interplay of Heisenberg-type and dipolar exchange. Due to the large moment of the Gd^3+ ions, one expects a strong impact of the dipolar coupling in NaGdS_2, in contrast to the related NaYbS_2. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements, indeed, indicate the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. NaGdS_2 appears to be a rare system, in which magnetic order is suppressed by a competition between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions.

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) model with hard-core bosons at half-filling, extending previous studies by including second nearest-neighbor (2NN) interactions. Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.

Abstract: We present two quantum-classical hybrid methods for simulating the time-dependence of electron-phonon systems that treat electronic correlations numerically exactly and optical-phonon degrees of freedom classically. These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system.

Abstract: The homogeneous electron gas is a cornerstone of quantum condensed matter physics, providing the foundation for developing density functional theory and understanding electronic phases in semiconductors. However, theoretical understanding of strongly-correlated electrons in realistic semiconductor systems remains limited. In this work, we develop a neural network based variational approach to study quantum wells in three dimensional geometry for a variety of electron densities and well thicknesses. Starting from first principles, our unbiased AI-powered method reveals metallic and crystalline phases with both monolayer and bilayer charge distributions. In the emergent bilayer, we discover a new quantum phase of matter: the electronic quasicrystal.

Abstract: Machine learning applications in the chemical sciences, especially when based on neural networks, critically depend on the availability of large quantities of high quality data. As they provide excellent accuracy for both charged and neutral excitations, a large dataset containing quasiparticle self-consistent GW (qs$GW$) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) data would be highly desirable to model excited state energies and properties. In this work, we introduce a dataset for qs$GW$-BSE excitation energies and qs$GW$ quasiparticle energies of unprecedented size. Our dataset, denoted QM9GWBSE, supplies $GW$-BSE singlet-singlet and singlet-triplet excitation energies, corresponding transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths as well as qs$GW$ quasiparticle energies for all molecules from the popular QM9 dataset. We anticipate that QM9GWBSE will provide a solid foundation to train highly accurate machine learning models for the prediction of molecular excited state properties.

Abstract: At model water--vapor and water--solid interfaces, molecular ordering leads to charge oscillations and, thereby, to a spatially varying electrostatic potential. Atomistic simulations indicate that such ordering leads to an electric potential difference $χ$, the surface potential, of about $-0.5\,\mathrm{V}$ across the first few molecular layers. Here, we calculate surface potentials at interfaces between a simple model fluids and a solid, with Molecular Dynamics simulations. The fluids are made up of either diatomic, dipolar molecules or a single Lennard-Jones particle with a dipole moment. All fluids show some structuring near the interface, but charge oscillations and a non-zero surface potential are present only for asymmetric molecules (unequal diameters of the atoms) or molecules with an off-center dipole. We condense this finding into the criterion that the geometric and dipolar centers of a molecule must differ for the fluid to exhibit a surface potential. Remarkably, while the solid--fluid interaction strength strongly affects the magnitude of charge oscillations, it hardly affects the potential drop $χ$. Further, our results demonstrate that changing the diameter of the smaller atom can flip the sign of the surface potential, thus highlighting the importance of steric effects.

Abstract: Rotating black holes with strong magnetic fields lead to an outward energy flux in the form of jets governed by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. These jets depend on factors such as accretion rate, magnetic flux and the spin of the black hole. When such rotating black holes get attached to a cosmic string, it leads to a further rotational energy extraction, leading to a reduced spin. We consider such a system and investigate the effect this reduced spin has on the jet power and its dependence on the cosmic string tension, $μ$. It is shown that for a constant magnetic flux and accretion rate, the jet energy flux is inversely proportional to $μ^2$. Interestingly, the rate of this energy flux varies with time and is again dependent on $μ$. We also study the total angular momentum evolution of the black hole by considering four major effects: accretion, jets, cosmic string energy extraction and the Bardeen-Petterson effect. Further, we attempt to analyse the condition for the spin-down of a black hole due to these effects and find out that it is possible for both small and large string tensions, with a higher possibility for larger string tensions. Another interesting phenomenon that has been proposed is the alignment of the jet with the cosmic string. Additionally, the Bardeen-Petterson effect also leads to alignment or misalignment of the inner and outer disks depending on the alignment of the string. In this manuscript we propose that these results might have an observable effect and hence could serve as a potential detection method for cosmic strings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expanding gravitational wave (GW) astronomy into the deci-Hz band is crucial for multi-domain science, including detecting intermediate-mass BBHs and performing sky localization with single- observatory data.

Method: We evaluated detectability using current instruments, simulated populations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, and injection studies.

Result: LGWA could detect ~90 BBH events in the ground-based band yearly, with ~200 multiband counterparts by 3G detectors. Simulated injections showed that deci-Hz observing can better measure chirp masses and localize events than 3G.

Conclusion: Expanding gravitational wave detection to deci-Hz opens new windows for BBH astrophysics, with the potential for thousands of detections and detailed multi-wave science.

Abstract: We study the prospects of the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), a proposed deci-Hz GW detector, to observe binary black holes (BBHs) and enable multiband science with ground-based detectors. We assess the detectability of the events observed by current instruments up to the GWTC-4.0 data release, and of simulated populations consistent with the latest reconstruction by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that LGWA alone would have been able to observe more than one third of the events detected so far, and that it could detect $\sim\!90$ events merging in the ground-based band per year out to redshifts $z\sim3-5$. Current detectors at design sensitivity and 100% duty cycle could detect thousands of BBHs per year, with one to a few hundred multiband counterparts in LGWA. Third-generation (3G) detectors can observe most of the BBHs detected by LGWA merging in their frequency band in the simulated mass range $7\,{\rm M}_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm tot}\lesssim 600\,{\rm M}_\odot$, enabling systematic joint analyses of hundreds of events. The short time to merger from the deci-Hz band to the Hz-kHz band (typically months to a year) allows for early warning, targeted follow-up, and archival searches. Multiband observations of intermediate-mass BBHs in the deci-Hz band are particularly promising. We perform an injection study for a GW231123-like system (the most massive BBH detection to date, which accumulates $\sim 10^5$ inspiral cycles in LGWA) and show that deci-Hz observations can measure the chirp mass even better than 3G instruments and yield good sky localization and inclination measurement, even with a single observatory. Opening the deci-Hz band would substantially improve the prospects of GW astronomy for intermediate-mass BBHs.

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of a fully relativistic treatment of the dephasing of gravitational waves induced by dark-matter overdensities in extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). However, a general-relativistic description of the dark matter phase-space distribution is currently available only for the case of a dark matter "spike" arising from adiabatic black hole growth. Here we develop a fully general-relativistic formalism for the more realistic scenario in which a supermassive stellar progenitor collapses to a black hole and produces a shallower dark matter overdensity, or "mound". We follow self-consistently the evolution of the supermassive star, its collapse, and the subsequent growth of the resulting black hole, together with the collisionless dark matter orbits. We find that in the regime where the collapse becomes non-adiabatic, the dark matter distribution function is significantly reshaped, with a clear depletion in the low-binding-energy region of phase space. Our results provide a more realistic prediction for the dark matter phase-space distribution around supermassive black holes, which is an essential step in our programme to use future EMRI observations to extract information about both the nature of dark matter and the formation history of the black hole.

Abstract: An extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole can form in finite time in the gravitational collapse of a massless charged scalar field. The proof of this is based on the method of characteristic gluing, which involves making an Ansatz for the scalar field at the horizon. We perform a numerical investigation of the characteristic gluing procedure for several different Ansätze. In each case, gluing is possible only if the final black hole mass is large enough. We find that the minimum required mass varies significantly for different Ansätze. We also consider the effect of including a mass term for the scalar field. In this case, for each Ansatz we determine the maximum mass-to-charge ratio for the scalar field such that gluing is possible. Analogous results are obtained for a non-zero cosmological constant.

Abstract: We construct solitonic Hayward-boson stars (SHBSs) in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, which consists of the Einstein-Hayward model and a complex scalar field with a soliton potential. Our results reveal a critical magnetic charge $q_c$. For $q\geq q_c$ in the limit of $ω\rightarrow 0$, the matter field is primarily distributed within the critical radius $r_c$, beyond which it decays rapidly, while the metric components $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ become very small at $r_c$. These solutions are termed ``frozen solitonic Hayward-boson stars" (FSHBSs). Continuously decreasing $Λ$ disrupts the frozen state. However, we did not find a frozen solution when $q<q_c$. The value of $q_c$ depends both on the cosmological constant $Λ$ and the self-interaction coupling $η$. We also found that for high frequency solutions, increasing $η$ can yield a pure Hayward solution. However, for low frequency solutions, increasing $η$ reduces both $1/g_{rr}$ and $-g_{tt}$. Furthermore, we analyzed the effective potential of SHBSs and identified an extra pair of light rings in the second solution branch.

Abstract: We prove an intrinsic analogue of Hawking's rigidity theorem for extremal horizons in arbitrary dimensions: any compact cross-section of a rotating extremal horizon in a spacetime satisfying the null energy condition must admit a Killing vector field. If the dominant energy condition is satisfied for null vectors, it follows that an extension of the near-horizon geometry admits an enhanced isometry group containing $SO(2,1)$ or the 2D Poincaré group $\mathbb{R}^2 \rtimes SO(1,1)$. In the latter case, the associated Aretakis instability for a massless scalar field is shifted by one order in the derivatives of the field transverse to the horizon. We consider a broad class of examples including Einstein-Maxwell(-Chern-Simons) theory and Yang-Mills theory coupled to charged matter. In these examples we show that the symmetries are inherited by the matter fields.

Since general relativity (GR) is itself only a low-energy EFT of an underlying ultraviolet (UV) theory, it is unlikely that true singularity resolution can emerge within its domain of validity. Our analysis does not contradict Yeom's conjecture but clarifies that any true resolution of the black hole singularity necessarily requires the inclusion of UV degrees of freedom beyond the scope of GR.

Abstract: The final equilibrium stage of stellar evolution can result in either a black hole or a compact object such as a white dwarf or neutron star. In general relativity, both stationary black holes and stationary stellar configurations are known to be axisymmetric, and black hole rigidity has been extended to several higher curvature modifications of gravity. In contrast, no comparable result had previously been established for stationary stars beyond general relativity. In this work we extend the stellar axisymmetry theorem to a broad class of diffeomorphism invariant metric theories. Assuming asymptotic flatness and standard smoothness requirements, we show that the Killing symmetry implied by thermodynamic equilibrium inside the star uniquely extends to the exterior region, thereby enforcing rotational invariance. This demonstrates that axisymmetry of stationary stellar configurations is not a feature peculiar to Einstein gravity but a universal property of generally covariant gravitational theories, persisting even in the presence of higher curvature corrections.

Motivation: Exploring modifications to gravity that could unify MOND and dark matter effects is a compelling area of theoretical physics, particularly in understanding cosmic structure and dynamics.

Method: Mathematically models nonlocal gravity corrections to unify MOND and dark matter explanations for cosmological phenomena.

Result: Succeeds in constructing a single theoretical framework that connects these two distinct gravitational phenomena.

Conclusion: Paves the way for further research to test the model's predictions against observational data.

Abstract: Nonlocal modifications of gravity derive from corrections to the quantum gravitational stress tensor which grow nonperturbatively strong during primordial inflation and may persist to the current epoch. Phenomenological constructions have been given that realize MOND in gravitationally bound systems and, separately, reproduce all the cosmological phenomena usually ascribed to dark matter, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations and linearized structure formation. In this work we exhibit a single model that interpolates between the two regimes.

Abstract: Spacetimes with an ergoregion that is not connected to a horizon are linearly unstable. While the linear regime has been studied in a number of settings, little is known about the nonlinear evolution of this ergoregion instability. Here, we investigate this by numerically evolving the unstable growth of a massless vector field in a rapidly spinning boson star in full general relativity. We find that the backreaction of the instability causes the star to become more gravitationally bound, accelerating the growth, and eventually leading to black hole formation. During the nonlinear growth phase, small scale features develop in the unstable mode and emitted radiation as nonlinear gravitational interactions mediate a direct turbulent cascade. The gravitational wave signal exhibits bursts, akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes, with increasing amplitude towards black hole formation.

Abstract: We analyze a cosmological solution to the field equations of a modified gravity model where curvature and matter are nonminimally coupled. The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results.

### [36] [BinaryGFH-v2: Improved method to search for gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact binaries using the Generalized Frequency-Hough Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10539)
*Andrew L. Miller,Lorenzo Pierini*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational wave observations could provide strong evidence for primordial black holes by detecting sub-solar-mass, inspiraling compact binaries. A new method called BinaryGFH-v2, which modifies the Generalized frequency-Hough technique, enables the detection of these binaries by addressing their signal characteristics that were previously considered too long for matched filtering but too short for time-frequency analysis. This method has been used to project constraints on primordial black hole formation rates and their contribution to dark matter in current and future gravitational wave detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Primordial black holes are a leading candidate for dark matter, and their existence and properties are still largely unknown. Detecting them through gravitational waves would provide direct evidence of their formation and help understand the early universe. Additionally, filling the gap in gravitational wave detection between very low and intermediate masses could provide new insights into the physics of compact binaries.

Method: The study introduces an improved version of the Generalized frequency-Hough (GFH) method, called BinaryGFH-v2, tailored for detecting ultra-compact binaries with chirp masses in the range of $[10^{-2},10^{-1}]M_igodot$. This method addresses the challenge of signals that are too long for matched filtering and too short for time-frequency pattern recognition by modifying the GFH technique. The modifications include handling rapidly spinning-up binaries and increasing the statistical robustness of the method.

Result: The study presents a detailed analysis of the sensitivity and applicability of the BinaryGFH-v2 method for detecting sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact binaries. It projects constraints on the formation rate densities of primordial black holes and their potential contribution to dark matter across the projected mass range of $[10^{-2},10^{-1}]M_igodot$ in both current and future gravitational wave detectors, demonstrating that this method successfully bridges the gap in detecting objects in this previously unexplored mass regime.

Conclusion: This research advances the field of gravitational wave astronomy by providing a novel and effective method for detecting primordial black holes in a mass regime that has been previously underexplored. The BinaryGFH-v2 method not only incorporates necessary modifications to existing techniques but also offers a promising approach for future studies aiming to constrain the properties and existence of these elusive objects, contributing significantly to our understanding of dark matter and early universe physics.

Abstract: Observing gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, inspiraling compact binaries would provide almost smoking-gun evidence for primordial black holes. Here, we develop a method to search for ultra-compact binaries with chirp masses ranging from $[10^{-2},10^{-1}]M_\odot$. This mass range represents a previously unexplored gap in gravitational-wave searches for compact binaries: it was thought that the signals would too long for matched-filtering analyses but too short for time-frequency pattern-recognition techniques. Despite this, we show that a pattern-recognition technique, the Generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), can be employed with particular modifications that allow us to handle rapidly spinning-up binaries and to increase the statistical robustness of our method, and call this improved method BinaryGFH-v2. We then design a hypothetical search for binaries in this mass regime, compare the empirical and theoretical sensitivities of this method, and project constraints on formation rate densities and the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes could compose in both current- and future-generation gravitational-wave detectors. Our results show that our method can be used to search for sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact objects in a mass regime that remains to-date unconstrained with gravitational waves.

Abstract: The analysis examines how neutrinos behave when their trajectories unfold around a black hole sourced by a Kalb-Ramond field, where spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking reshapes the surrounding geometry. Instead of following the conventional order, the study focuses first on the observable consequences: alterations in the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation energy output, shifts in the oscillation phase accumulated along the path, and distortions in flavor conversion probabilities induced by gravitational lensing. These features are then tied to the Lorentz-violating spacetime structure, which governs the propagation of the neutrinos. Numerical simulations are carried out for both two- and three-flavor descriptions, with normal and inverted mass orderings.

### [38] [Subtracting compact binary foregrounds utilizing anisotropic statistic for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10648)
*Soichiro Kuwahara,Atsushi Nishizawa,Lorenzo Valbusa Dall'Armi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of separating astrophysical foregrounds from gravitational wave signals in third-generation detectors. It proposes a method using the anisotropies of the compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals to better estimate and subtract the unresolved foreground, assuming it is isotropic after angular power spectrum analysis and shot noise simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Third-generation detectors will detect GWs from various sources, including stochastic GW backgrounds. Accurate separation of astrophysical foregrounds, such as those from CBC events, is crucial for studying other GW backgrounds, like a potential primordial one. Previous methods struggle with unresolved foregrounds, particularly from subthreshold BNS binaries. This paper aims to improve foreground subtraction using angular information from CBC signals.

Method: The authors simulate a BNS population to compute their angular power spectrum and shot noise. They argue that the shot noise from BNS is too faint to observe due to the limited angular resolution of detectors. Thus, they approximate the unresolved foreground as isotropic.

Result: By using angular information from CBC signals, the method successfully justifies an isotropic approximation for the unresolved foreground. They also determine the necessary angular resolution for their method to be valid.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel approach to estimate and subtract unresolved isotropic foregrounds in GW data analysis, enhancing the detection of other GW backgrounds.

Abstract: The astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescence signals is expected to be a dominant part of total gravitational wave (GW) energy density in the frequency band of the third-generation detectors. The detection of any other subdominant stochastic GW background (GWB), especially a primordial GWB, will be disturbed by the astrophysical foreground, which needs to be cleaned for further studies of other stochastic GWB. Although previous studies have proposed several cleaning methods, the foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNS) has been a major obstacle to remove. In this paper, we propose the novel idea to acquire better estimation of the unresolved foreground, by using the information about its anisotropies. We simulate the BNS population and compute its angular power spectrum and shot noise. We find that the shot noise from BNS is too faint to observe after subtracting loud signals due to the limited angular resolution of the third-generation detectors. This justifies the approximation regarding the unresolved foreground as an isotropic component. We also discuss the angular resolution necessary to make our method valid for the foreground subtraction.

Abstract: Recent efforts have shown that Kantowski-Sachs spacetime provides a useful framework for analyzing perturbations inside a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). In these studies, the adoption of a Hamiltonian formulation offers an insightful perspective. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we revisit and elaborate the results obtained so far in Kantowski-Sachs, with the focus placed on axial perturbations. In particular, by exploiting the relation between this spacetime and the interior of a nonrotating BH, we consider the extension of those results to the exterior geometry of the BH. In this way, we clarify the relation between the axial perturbative gauge invariants emerging from the canonical analysis and the already well-established axial BH invariants, often referred to as master functions. We do so by providing a unified picture of the Hamiltonian formalism, which does not distinguish, formally, between exterior and interior geometries. The second objective is to explore the role of Darboux transformations, which were found as hidden symmetries in the context of BH perturbations, and their appearance in the Hamiltonian setting. Within this framework, the Hamiltonian formulation provides a clear geometric interpretation and characterization of Darboux transformations within the axial sector, viewing them as the set of canonical transformations between Hamiltonians for axial master functions.

Abstract: Master functions of black holes are fundamental tools in gravitational-wave physics and are typically derived within a Lagrangian framework. Starting from the Kantowski-Sachs geometry, one can instead construct a perturbative Hamiltonian description for the interior region of an uncharged and nonrotating black hole. This approach provides a complementary perspective and enables a quantum treatment of the background geometry and its perturbations. In this work, we extend the application of this formulation to the exterior region and establish a correspondence between the perturbative invariants of the canonical approach and the master functions commonly used in black hole analyses. Once a consistent Hamiltonian description for their canonical counterparts is obtained, a hybrid quantization of the master functions follows naturally.

Abstract: In a previous paper [9], we proved the following singularity theorem applicable to cosmological models with a positive cosmological constant: if a four-dimensional spacetime satisfying the null energy condition contains a compact Cauchy surface which is expanding in all directions, then the spacetime is past null geodesically incomplete unless the Cauchy surface is topologically a spherical space. The proof in [9] made use of the positive resolution of the surface subgroup conjecture [15]. In this note, we demonstrate how the less-broadly-known positive resolution of the virtual positive first Betti number conjecture [1] provides a more streamlined and unified approach to the proof. We illustrate the theorem with some examples and analyze its rigidity under null geodesic completeness.

Abstract: In recent years, pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a nanohertz gravitational-wave (GW) background. As radio telescope sensitivity improves, PTAs are also expected to detect continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. Nanohertz GWs generate both Earth and pulsar terms in the timing data, and the time delay between the two terms encodes the pulsar distance. Precise pulsar distance measurements are critical to fully exploiting pulsar-term information, which can improve the measurement precision of GW sources' sky position parameters and thus enhance the GW sky-localization capability. In this work, we propose a new pulsar distance estimation method by using pulsar-term phase information from GWs. We construct two-dimensional distance posteriors for pulsar pairs based on the simulated GW signals and combine them to constrain individual pulsar distances. Compared with the existing one-dimensional method, our approach reduces the impact of source-parameter uncertainties on pulsar distance measurements. Considering four GW sources and a PTA of 20 pulsars with a white-noise level of 20 ns, we find that a significant fraction of pulsars at distances $\lesssim 1.4$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision over a 15-year observation.

Motivation: Research into NSBH binaries and eccentricity effects was motivated by potential implications for sensitivity and astrophysical formation mechanisms.

Method: An eccentric search was conducted to identify and analyze GW200105, utilizing advanced orbital modeling and Bayesian inference.

Result: Eccentricity was confirmed, and the event supports NSBH formation through dynamical processes, with a SNR of 13.4 and low false alarm rate.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of eccentricity in GW searches and reinforces GW200105 as a key NSBH event.

Abstract: The neutron star -- black hole (NSBH) binary GW200105 was recently found to have significant residual orbital eccentricity at a gravitational-wave frequency of 20 Hz~\cite{Morras:2025xfu}. The event was originally identified with moderate significance by matched-filter searches that employ non-eccentric templates. The neglect of relevant physical effects, such as orbital eccentricity, can severely reduce the sensitivity of the search and, consequently, also the significance of an event candidate. Here, we present a targeted eccentric search for GW200105. The eccentric search identifies GW200105 as the most significant event with a signal-to-noise ratio of $13.4$ and a false alarm rate of less than 1 in 1000 years.
  The best-matching template parameters are consistent with the Bayesian inference result, supporting the interpretation of GW200105 as an NSBH that formed through dynamical mechanisms and not isolated binary evolution.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in vacuum are largely insensitive to the internal structure of the small compact companion. We show that this conclusion can change when the central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter environment. We compute, for the first time, the relativistic dynamical-friction force on a neutron star moving through a collisionless medium and its impact on the evolution of EMRIs embedded in dense dark matter spikes. We then perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation analysis of simulated LISA observations to assess the measurability of both spike properties and the companion's internal structure. We find that, in our fiducial dark matter spike models, EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\gtrsim 20$ already allow us to distinguish neutron star from black hole companions, while events with SNR $\gtrsim 400$ make it possible to discriminate between different neutron star equations of state.

Abstract: Correlation functions of energy flow operators (energy-energy correlators) are one of the simplest observables in quantum field theory and gravity, with diverse applications ranging from real world collider physics to constraining the space of consistent theories. In this paper we further develop the conformal block decomposition of energy-energy correlators in conformal field theories (CFTs), focusing on the source-detector operator product expansion (OPE). We compute the general conformal blocks in this channel for traceless symmetric operators of arbitrary spin in the background of a scalar source, considering both parity-even and parity-odd contributions. Motivated by the availability of data from the conformal bootstrap, we analyze the convergence of this source-detector OPE, taking a tensor product of two decoupled CFTs as an elementary example. Finally, we use positivity of energy correlators to derive novel bounds on OPE coefficients involving the stress-energy tensor in generic CFTs, and demonstrate the application of these bounds in the specific example of the 3d Ising CFT, obtaining new constraints for both parity-even and parity-odd operators.

Abstract: We construct consistent effective equations of motion for massive charged particles of spin 2 and spin $3/2$ interacting with constant electromagnetic backgrounds. While tree-level unitarity restricts point-like particles to a universal gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$, long-lived composite states such as the $Ω^-$ baryon generically deviate from this value. We propose describing such non-minimal couplings without triggering pathologies such as superluminal propagation or the loss of degrees of freedom by treating the system as an Effective Field Theory expanded in powers of the background field strength. By introducing specific operators, we show that algebraic consistency can be restored perturbatively for arbitrary $g$-factors.

Abstract: In this paper we study solutions to massive Type IIA supergravity which we propose are dual to co-dimension 2 monodromy defects in 6d (1,0) CFTs realised in NS5-D6-D8 brane systems, as well as in the 5d Sp(N) fixed point theory. In the first case the defects are studied holographically as solutions to 7d $U(1)$ gauged supergravity that asymptote locally to its maximally supersymmetric $\text{AdS}_7$ vacuum away from the defects. In the second case they are dual to solutions to 6d $U(1)^2$ gauged supergravity that asymptote to its maximally supersymmetric $\text{AdS}_6$ vacuum. These solutions are then uplifted to massive Type IIA supergravity using known consistent truncations previously constructed in the literature. We compute the defect entanglement entropy and provide evidence that for the 3d defects, the entanglement entropy can be written as a linear combination of the free energy and conformal weight of the defect. Finally, we construct new co-dimension 2 monodromy defects in 6d and 5d CFTs compactified on Riemann surfaces and/or spindles.

Abstract: We analyze entanglement generated by the Schwinger effect using a mode-by-mode formalism for scalar and spinor QED in constant backgrounds. Starting from thermal initial states, we derive compact, closed-form results for bipartite entanglement between particle-antiparticle partners in terms of the Bogoliubov coefficients. For bosons, thermal fluctuations enhance production but suppress quantum correlations: the logarithmic negativity is nonzero only below a (mode-dependent) critical temperature $T_c$. At fixed $T$, entanglement appears only above a critical field $E_{\text{crit,entang}}$. For fermions, we observe a qualitatively different pattern: at finite $T$ entanglement exists only within a finite window $E_{\text{min}} < E < E_{\text{max}}$, with a temperature-independent optimal field strength $E_{*}$ that maximizes the logarithmic negativity. Entanglement is vanishing above $T_{\text{max}}=ω/\text{arcsinh}(1)$. We give quantitative estimates for analog experiments, where our entanglement criteria convert directly into concrete temperature and electric field constraints. These findings identify realistic regimes where the quantum character of Schwinger physics may be tested in the laboratory.

Motivation: 想了解一下量子暴胀时期暗物质激发的量子特征，以及它们的观测信号为何难以区分经典随机变量。

Method: 研究过程中使用了连续变量稳定化器状态的理论分析，计算了其量子魔力和维格纳分布的性质，通过参数关系式（如$f_{NL}$和指数压缩）进行模型参数的推演。

Result: 发现量子暴胀激发的暗物质状态是低量子魔力的连续变量稳定化器状态，这些状态在经典算法中可以高效模拟。维格纳负性主要由初始的一阶非高斯性导致，并且随着指数压缩增大而减弱。

Conclusion: 早期宇宙的高复杂度和低量子魔力状态具有量子性质的暗物质激发，为结构起源提供了可被经典算法模拟的解释，但量子特征在观测信号中被低价化或隐藏。

Abstract: Cosmological perturbations generated during inflation exhibit striking quantum features, including entanglement and high circuit complexity. Yet their observational signatures remain effectively indistinguishable from classical stochastic variables. We quantify this tension by showing that quantum inflationary perturbations are continuous variable stabilizer states with vanishing quantum magic, a necessary resource for universal quantum computation as measured by Wigner negativity. Consequently, despite their quantum origins and description, these states can be efficiently simulated using classical algorithms. We further show that the Wigner negativity arising from primordial non-Gaussianity is suppressed not only by the non-linearity parameter $f_{NL}$, but also by the exponential squeezing of the perturbations. Viewing the early universe as a "high complexity, low magic" regime provides another perspective of what it means for the origin of structure in the universe to be "quantum."

Abstract: It is stated that the action of the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) area, which is viewed as an observable, generates a kink transformation in gravity. In this paper, we provide a further support for the kink transformation statement by performing a relevant computation. Specifically, by acting the kink transformation to the boundary stress tensor, we compute the bracket between the HRT area with the boundary stress tensor. Here we represent the boundary stress tensor in terms of initial data on the Cauchy surface under holographic renormalization. Our computation reproduces the same result as the one in arXiv:2203.04270 derived from a different approach.

Abstract: In 2507.17558, we provide a map from a scalar theory on $(D+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime to a scalar theory with a continuous mass spectrum on $(D+1)$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, and propose a link between celestial amplitudes and cosmological correlators (the cosmological-celestial dictionary). We extend the construction to fields with spin 1 and 2, and find that massless spin fields map to spin fields with continuous mass spectra. In this construction, we identify the de Sitter counterparts of the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the asymptotic symmetries in Minkowski spacetime. For $U(1)$ gauge theories, the counterpart is restricted to the massless sector within the continuous Proca spectrum, while for linearized gravity supertranslations are encoded in the partially massless sector and superrotations in the strictly massless sector. Using the identification, we reveal that the associated Ward-Takahashi identities of the cosmological correlators reproduce the conformally soft photon and graviton theorems via the cosmological-celestial dictionary. In particular, the celestial stress tensor is derived from the asymptotic limit of gravitons in de Sitter spacetime.

Abstract: This work explores the possibility that five-dimensional primordial rotating black holes could account for all, or a significant portion, of the dark matter in our universe. Our analysis is performed within the context of the ``dark dimension'' scenario, a theoretical consequence of the Swampland Program that predicts a single micron-scale extra dimension to explain the observed value of dark energy. We demonstrate that within this scenario, the mass loss of a primordial rotating black hole sensitive to the fifth dimension is significantly slower than that of its four-dimensional counterpart. Consequently, primordial black holes with an initial mass of $M\gtrsim 10^{10}$g can survive to the present day and potentially constitute the dominant form of dark matter. Finally, we investigate the memory burden effect and find that it dramatically prolongs the lifetime of five-dimensional rotating primordial black holes, making them compelling candidates for all the dark matter in the universe.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.

TL;DR: 我们研究了κ-Minkowski时空中的有限温度Casimir效应。利用Matsubara形式和Dirichlet边界条件，计算了κ-形变对热态Casimir自由能、压力、熵和内能的修正。结果表明，时空的非交换性增强了热态Casimir力的吸引力，同时保持了热力学的一致性；系统满足Nernst定理，热力学定律在κ-形变时空中仍然成立。我们发现，非交换效应在Casimir效应研究中是可以用实验观察到的，当非交换尺度与平板间距的比率满足a/L≤10的-12次方时，其结果表现出来。我们还得到了κ-Minkowski时空中的Stefan-Boltzmann定律。

Result: 1. κ-形变增强了热态Casimir力的吸引力；2. 系统满足Nernst定理，热力学定律在κ-形变时空中保持不变；3. 我们给出了热态Casimir效应在κ-形变时空中的Stefan-Boltzmann定律；4. 非交换效应在实验条件下是可以观察到的，当a/L≤10的-12次方时，其结果表现出来。

Conclusion: κ-Minkowski时空中的热态Casimir效应表现出良好的热力学一致性和可观测性。我们获得的κ-形变热态Casimir效应结果不仅展示了良好的热力学特性，还为实验提供了可行性条件。

Abstract: We study the finite temperature Casimir effect for parallel plates in the $κ$-Minkowski space-time. Using the Matsubara formalism and imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions on a massless $κ$-scalar field, we compute the $κ$-deformed corrections to thermal Casimir free energy, pressure, entropy, and internal energy. Our results demonstrate that space-time non-commutativity enhances the attractive nature of the thermal Casimir force while preserving thermodynamic consistency; the system satisfies the Nernst theorem and laws of thermodynamics remain intact in $κ$-deformed space-time. Our analysis yields an upper bound on the deformation parameter as $a\leq10^{-18}m$. Furthermore, our results indicate that non-commutative effects become experimentally observable in Casimir effect studies when the ratio of the non-commutative scale to plate separation satisfies $a/L\leq 10^{-12}$. We also obtain the expression for Stefan-Boltzmann's law in $κ$-Minkowski space-time.

Abstract: In this paper we consider 4d $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories with $N+1$ fundamentals, five antifundamentals and a conjugate two index antisymmetric tensor. The model has been shown to be in a mixed phase in the IR, splitting in an interacting non-Abelian Coulomb phase and a free magnetic phase. Through tensor deconfinement, we show that baryonic deformations lead to a non-Abelian free magnetic phase. Along the analysis we obtain a duality with symplectic SQCD that can be further reduced to 3d and 2d. In the 3d case the analysis of the three sphere partition function allows one to obtain dualities between $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ with a two index symmetric tensor and $\mathrm{SO}(N)$ theories. On the other hand, in 2d we recover dualities already known in the literature and propose new ones between special unitary and symplectic gauge theories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the geometric structures of Feynman integrals is crucial for advancing quantum field theory.

Method: We used bivariate Ehrhart polynomials and Symanzik polynomials to identify Fano and reflexive polytopes in one-loop and multiloop graphs.

Result: Only a few low-dimensional reflexive and Fano polytopes exist, and reflexive polytopes are linked to Calabi-Yau varieties.

Conclusion: Quasi-finite Feynman integrals are inherently connected to Calabi-Yau period integrals via their polytope structures.

Abstract: We classify the Fano and reflexive polytopes that arise from quasi-finite Feynman integrals. These polytopes appear as scaled Minkowski sums of the Newton polytopes associated with the Symanzik graph polynomials. For one-loop graphs and multiloop sunset graphs, we identify the Fano and reflexive cases by computing the number of interior points from the associated bivariate Ehrhart polynomials. More generally, we utilize the properties of Symanzik polynomials and their symmetries to conduct a direct search over all Feynman graphs in generic kinematics with up to ten edges and nine loops. We find that such cases are remarkably sparse: for example, we find only two two-dimensional reflexive polytopes, three three-dimensional reflexive polytopes, and four three-dimensional Fano polytopes. We also reveal a surprising feature of one-loop $N$-gon integrals in higher dimensions: their associated reflexive polytopes encode degenerate Calabi--Yau $(N-2)$-folds. We further analyze the geometric structures encoded by these polytopes and exhibit explicit connections with del Pezzo surfaces, $K3$ surfaces, and Calabi--Yau threefolds. Since reflexive polytopes naturally correspond to Calabi--Yau varieties, our classification demonstrates that quasi-finite Feynman integrals, with reflexive polytopes, are intrinsically linked to Calabi--Yau period integrals.

Abstract: We explore a continuum theory of multicritical dynamical triangulations and causal dynamical triangulations in two-dimensional quantum gravity from the perspective of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. The former model lacks a causal time direction and is governed by the two-reduced $W^{(3)}$ algebra, whereas the latter model possesses a causal time direction and is governed by the full $W^{(3)}$ algebra. We show that the topological recursion solves the Schwinger-Dyson equations for both models, and we explicitly compute several amplitudes.

Whether the higher-derivative corrections of type IIB admit a 12d interpretation is discussed, and we suggest certain directions for future exploration.

Abstract: We study three Type II supergravity solutions which are holographically dual to codimension-2 supersymmetric defects in $(p+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills ($p=2,3,4$). In all of these cases, the defects have a non-trivial monodromy for the maximal abelian subgroup for the SO($9-p$) R-symmetry. Such solutions are obtained by considering branes wrapping spindle configurations, changing the parameters (which alters the coordinate domain), and imposing suitable boundary conditions. We provide a prescription to compute the entanglement entropy of the effective theory on the defect. We find the resulting quantity to be proportional to the free energy of the ambient theory. Similar analysis is performed for the D5-brane wrapping a spindle, but we find that changing the coordinate domain does not lead to a defect solution, but rather a circle compactification.

Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.

Abstract: We use a combination of perturbation theory, holography, supersymmetric localization, integrability, and numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain the energy-energy correlator in $\text{SU}(N_c)$ ${\mathcal N}=4$ SYM at finite coupling. For finite $N_c$, we derive lower bounds on the second and fourth multipoles of the energy-energy correlator at different couplings, along with a smeared energy-energy correlator as a function of the angle between the two detectors. We present evidence that our lower bounds on the multipoles are nearly saturated by the ${\cal N} = 4$ SYM theory. In the planar limit, we further use dispersive functionals to obtain tight two-sided bounds on both the first three non-trivial multipoles and on the angular dependence of the energy-energy correlator. As the coupling is varied from weak to strong, the energy-energy correlator exhibits a transition from single-trace to double-trace operator dominance in the collinear limit, which we characterize quantitatively. A similar phenomenon occurs in QCD, where a parton-hadron transition is observed as detectors are brought closer together.

Abstract: We study the properties imposed by microcausality and positivity on the retarded two-point Green's function in a theory with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance. We assume invariance under time and spatial translations, so that the Green's function $G$ depends on $ω$ and $\vec k$. We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\Im (ω,\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(ω,\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $ω\cdot \Im G(ω,\vec k) \ge 0$ for real $(ω,\vec k)$. We show that this positivity property can be extended to the complex domain: $\Im [ω\, G(ω,\vec k)] >0$ in the domain of analyticity guaranteed by microcausality. Functions with this property belong to the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. This allows to prove the analyticity of the permittivities $ε(ω,k)$ and $μ^{-1}(ω,k)$ that appear in Maxwell equations in a medium. We verify the above properties in several examples where Lorentz invariance is broken by a background field, e.g. non-zero chemical potential, or non-zero temperature. We study subtracted dispersion relations when the assumption $G \to 0$ at infinity must be relaxed.

Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of light-ray operators in four-dimensional de Sitter space focusing on null integrals of the stress tensor. In Minkowski space, the null integral of the stress tensor unifies several ostensibly different constructions, functioning simultaneously as the energy flux operator, the angular contribution to a conserved charge, the averaged null energy operator, and the light transform of the stress tensor. However, we show that the de Sitter analogs of these various interpretations do not necessarily coincide but rather lead to distinct, observer-dependent light-ray operators. We construct four such de Sitter analogs and analyze their matrix elements in a free, conformally coupled scalar theory, showing that they exhibit the expected symmetry and positivity properties.

Using the adiabatic regularization method, we systematically remove ultraviolet divergences and obtain explicit finite expressions for the components of the induced energy--momentum tensor. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the renormalized tensor behaves smoothly with respect to the parameters of the system and exhibits physically consistent limits in both the strong-field and infrared regimes. The induced energy density grows with the field strength and follows a quadratic behavior, which is consistent with the Schwinger mechanism in three dimension. In the opposite infrared regime, the tensor components display inverse-mass dependence, revealing infrared divergences typical of nearly massless scalar fields in curved space. Finally, we evaluate the trace of the renormalized tensor and show that for a massless, conformally coupled scalar field the trace anomaly vanishes, confirming the absence of a genuine Weyl anomaly in odd-dimensional spacetimes. These results provide a consistent and covariant description of quantum vacuum polarization and backreaction effects in three-dimensional de Sitter geometry.

Abstract: Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a topological gravity equivalence theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.

Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) concept provides a necessary tool for obtaining general predictions of low-energy theory valid below its unitarity-breaking scale (cutoff scale). Early Universe inflation and subsequent reheating could be a unique setup for testing potentially observable effects coming from the derivative expansion of the corresponding EFT around the flat space vacuum. In this work, we consider an EFT describing perturbative reheating dominated by the decay of inflaton to photons caused by the dimension-5 operator $φF_{μν} F^{μν}$. We compute the graviton production during reheating and high frequency gravitational wave signal due to the bremsstrahlung effect in the presence of $R_{μνλρ}F^{μν} F^{λρ}$ operator. It may lead to the dominant contribution at high momenta if the EFT cutoff is lower than the Planck mass. Assuming the general consequences of the unitarity and causality constraints, which imply that all EFT operators should be present, and be suppressed by the scales following from the dimension analysis, we obtain the observational constraints (CMB bound for the dark radiation) on the mass of the inflaton and UV cutoff of gravity. We find that for the typical parameters of large field inflation models, the gravitational cutoff scale cannot be lower than $10^{15}$ GeV.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of an isotropic, planar AdS black hole charged under a pair of two-form gauge potentials. We prove that long wavelength, small amplitude perturbations of this state are governed by the relativistic theory of viscoelastic hydrodynamics. We use this effective theory to identify instabilities in certain regions of parameter space, and show that the dominant instability is always driven by fluctuations of an incoherent density of the higher-form charge. The spacetime we study also arises as a solution to gravity coupled to a pair of massless scalar fields, where part of its dynamics is governed by a simpler effective theory of heat diffusion. We derive this simpler description directly from viscoelastic hydrodynamics, demonstrating that the heat diffusion mode is the collective excitation of the viscoelastic fluid under no-flux boundary conditions.

Abstract: We compute solutions to the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations on holomorphic vector bundles $V$ via an alternating optimisation procedure founded on geometric machine learning. The proposed method is fully general with respect to the rank and structure group of $V$, requiring only the ability to enumerate a basis of global sections for a given bundle. This enables us to compute the physically normalised Yukawa couplings in a broad class of heterotic string compactifications. Using this method, we carry out this computation in full for a heterotic compactification incorporating a gauge bundle with non-Abelian structure group.

Abstract: We consider correlators smeared against directed wavepackets over a thermal state dual to a single-sided planar AdS black hole. In the large frequency limit, our measurement is simplified using a bulk WKB description. We propose a dictionary that maps the action of smeared boundary operators to flat-space oscillators near an interior bulk point on the thermal state, by analytically continuing late-time operators from the right to the left boundary via an integral transform. Using the dictionary the smeared correlator factorizes to a flat-space like scattering amplitude about the interior event. Our transformed correlators describe local physics in the two-sided black hole interior, while incurring a suppression of $\mathcal{O}(e^{-βω/ 2})$. These measurements necessitate a non-trivial time ordering of operators living on boundary hyperboloids which are causally connected to the past light cone of the bulk point, as well as on a corresponding future branch.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of boundaries subject to conformal boundary conditions, in which the conformal class of the boundary metric is kept fixed. In Einstein gravity, the trace of the extrinsic curvature is also fixed at the boundary. Here we generalize this boundary condition with the appropriate higher curvature correction. We study the problem both in Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. In Euclidean signature, we show that, similarly to the Einstein gravity case, the entropy at large temperatures exhibits the behavior of a conformal field theory in one lower dimension. We also show that in the flat space limit, the higher curvature corrections do not contribute to the leading behavior at high temperatures. We conjecture that this result is a universal feature of the flat space limit in the presence of conformal boundaries. We test our conjecture by analyzing charged black holes. In Lorentzian signature, we analyze the dynamics of the boundary Weyl factor in black hole backgrounds at the linearized level.

Abstract: According to the atomic principle an elementary particle has no excited states and under any interaction, if it is not annihilated, its internal structure cannot be modified. The intrinsic properties are the mass $m$ and the absolute value of the spin in the center of mass frame $S=\hbar/2$. We analyze the closed system made of a single Dirac particle and an external electromagnetic field. The Poincaré invariance of the dynamics implies that the energy, linear momentum and angular momentum of the whole system must be conserved. The Dirac particle has two distinguished points, the center of charge ${\bf r}$ and the center of mass ${\bf q}$. When interacting, the energy expended by the field is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of charge trajectory. The variation of the mechanical energy of the particle is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of mass trajectory. If these two works are different the excess of energy must be transformed into radiation returning that energy to the field. The accelerated Dirac particle radiates. We analyze the spin dynamics of the Dirac particle under an external electromagnetic field. The requirement that the absolute value of the spin for the center of mass observer cannot be modified by the interaction implies a modification of the dynamical equation which includes a new braking term along the center of mass velocity, that can be interpreted as the radiation reaction force.

Abstract: When playing the clarinet, opening the register hole allows for a transition from the first to the second register, producing a twelfth interval. On an artificial mouth, the blowing pressure range where the second register remains stable can be determined by gradually varying the blowing pressure while keeping the register hole open. However, when the register hole is opened while the instrument is already producing the first register, the range of blowing pressures that lead to a stable second register is narrower than the full stability zone of the second register. This phenomenon is investigated numerically by performing multiple hole openings at different times for each blowing pressure value. The evolution of the probability of reaching the second register is computed, and its relationship with the structure of the basin of attraction of the second register is analyzed.

Abstract: We report on a search for a gravitationally bound solar axion halo using data from the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), a worldwide array of magnetically shielded atomic magnetometers with sensitivity to exotic spin couplings. Motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that self-interacting ultralight axions can be captured by the Sun's gravitational field and thermalize into the ground state, we develop a signal model for the pseudo-magnetic fields generated by axion-proton gradient couplings in such a halo. The analysis focuses on the fifth GNOME Science Run (69 days, 12 stations), employing a cross-correlation pipeline with time-shifted daily modulation templates to search for the global, direction-dependent, monochromatic signal expected from a solar axion halo. No statistically significant candidate signals are observed. We set 95% confidence-level upper limits on the amplitude of the axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field over the frequency range 0.05 Hz to 20 Hz, translating to constraints on the linear and quadratic axion-proton couplings for halo densities predicted by gravitational capture models and for the maximum overdensities allowed by planetary ephemerides. In the quadratic coupling case, our limits surpass existing astrophysical bounds by over two orders of magnitude across much of the accessible parameter space.

Abstract: We characterise an efficient optically-heated neutral atom source for ion trapping. We observe loading rates of up to $24(3)\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ with heating powers below $85\,\mathrm{mW}$, and demonstrate loading of a single ion in under $30\,\mathrm{s}$ with $41.4(4)\,\mathrm{mW}$ of optical power in a room-temperature ion trap system with an ionisation probability of $1.50(5)\times10^{-5}$. We calibrate a thermal model for the source's internal temperature by imaging the fluorescence of a collimated flux of neutral calcium that effuses from the oven at various optical heating powers. We show that the thermal performance of this oven is mainly limited by radiative losses. We explore the effect of second-stage photo-ionisation laser power on the loading rate, and identify a path beyond the loading rates reported in this study. We predict that this source is also well-suited to a wide range of metals used in ion-trapping.

Abstract: The bound-free channel of electron-positron pair production by a highly charged bare ion in the presence of a strong constant crossed electromagnetic field is studied. To calculate the pair production rate, two different methods are applied and compared with each other: (i) a quasiclassical tunneling theory and (ii) a strong-field approximation, both equipped with appropriate Coulomb correction factors. The resulting rate, which depends nonperturbatively on both the Coulomb field of the ion and the constant crossed field, is calculated in a broad range of applied field strengths and nuclear charge numbers. Its functional form resembles the rate for a dynamically assisted Schwinger-like process, with the assistance being provided by the atomic binding energy of the created electron.

Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to precise control and interrogation of atomic quantum systems. In the context of quantum computing and metrology with trapped ions, the integrated optical control of interest for scaling may additionally enable increased performance of coherent and incoherent operations. Here we utilize multi-channel integrated delivery of ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths required for calcium ion control including in passively phase-stable ultraviolet standing waves to demonstrate rapid, broadband laser cooling. We experimentally verify a long-standing prediction, realizing Doppler cooling to below the conventional Doppler limit at a standing-wave (SW) node. Utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), we experimentally cool motional modes spanning an approximately 5 MHz bandwidth from the Doppler temperature to near the ground state within 150 $μ$s, reaching $\bar n \approx 0.05$ phonon number occupancies for the target mode. Direct evaluation against the comparable running-wave (RW) scheme shows the SW implementation's simultaneous advantage in cooling rate, motional mode bandwidth, and final phonon number as previously theoretically predicted. Our results demonstrate structured light's capability for robust ground-state laser cooling, and a clear advantage in a fundamental functionality enabled by scalable approaches to optical control.

Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in recent years. However, identifying a universal topological invariant capable of characterizing higher-order topology remains challenging. Here, we propose a entanglement topological invariant designed to characterize secondorder topological systems. This entanglement topological invariant captures the entanglement of topological corner states under open boundary conditions by employing a bipartite entanglement entropy method. In several representative models, the entanglement topological invariant assumes a nonzero value exclusively in the presence of second-order topology, with its magnitude exactly matching the number of topologically protected corner states. Consequently, the proposed entanglement topological invariant not only provides a clear criterion for detecting higher-order topology, but also offers a quantitative measure for the related corner states. Our study establishes a universal and precise method for characterizing higher-order topological phases, opening avenues for their fundamental understanding and future investigations.

Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $σ_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $σ_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $σ_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.

Abstract: The semi-empirical INDO/s method is popular for studies of excitation energies and absorption of molecules due to its low computational requirement, making it possible to make predictions for large systems. However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.

Result: The electrically patterned QDs exhibit efficient photon extraction with up to (40 ± 2)% efficiency and maintain single-photon purity exceeding 99% even at elevated temperatures compatible with liquid-nitrogen cooling systems.

Conclusion: This research paves the way for practical, scalable, and cost-effective quantum light sources integrating with classical electronics forming a foundation for large-scale quantum information systems.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies, enabling practical sources of non-classical light. A central challenge for scalable integration is the direct epitaxial growth of high-quality emitters on industry-compatible silicon platforms. Furthermore, for long-distance fiber-based quantum communication, emission in the telecom O- or C-band is essential. Here, we demonstrate the direct growth of high-quality InGaAs/GaAs QDs emitting in the telecom O-band using a strain-reducing layer approach on silicon. Deterministic integration of individual QDs into circular Bragg grating resonators is achieved via in-situ electron-beam lithography. The resulting devices exhibit strong out-coupling enhancement, with photon extraction efficiencies up to $(40 \pm 2)\%$, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. These results highlight the high material quality of both the epitaxial platform and the photonic nanostructure, as well as the precise lateral positioning of the emitter within 20~nm of the resonator center. At cryogenic temperature (4~K) and low excitation power ($0.027\times P_\text{sat}$), the devices show excellent single-photon purity, exceeding 99\%. Operation at elevated temperatures of 40~K and 77~K, compatible with compact Stirling cryo-coolers and liquid-nitrogen cooling, reveals robust performance, with single-photon purity maintained at $(88.4 \pm 0.6)\%$ at 77~K. These results demonstrate a practical and scalable route toward silicon-based quantum light sources and provide a promising path for cost-effective fabrication and seamless integration of quantum photonics with classical electronics, representing an important step toward large-scale, chip-based quantum information systems.

Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes provide a versatile platform to host unconventional magnetic states within their π-conjugated networks. Particularly appealing are graphene architectures that incorporate spatially separated radicals and tunable interactions, offering a scalable route toward spin-based quantum architectures. Triangulenes are ideal for this purpose, as their radical count scales with size, although strong hybridization prevents individual spin control. Here, we realize a radical reconfiguration strategy that transforms a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by covalently extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, evidencing the emergence of correlated spins. Multi-reference electronic-structure calculations trace the progressive increase in polyradical character with anthene length, driven by the clustering of frontier states within a narrow energy window. Consequently, the initial single-radical doublet reorganizes into a frustrated triradical with weakly coupled edge spins, a molecular analog of a three-qubit quantum register.

Abstract: Localized particle-like spin textures have been found to exhibit emergent electromagnetic properties, which hold promise for the development of intriguing spintronic devices. Among these textures, magnetic bubbles represent localized spin configurations that could serve as data bits. However, the precise methods for their electrical manipulation remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic electrical manipulations and detections of single magnetic bubbles in kagome-latticed Fe3Sn2 magnetic nanostructured cells. The current-induced dynamics of magnetic bubbles were explored using nanosecond pulsed currents. We show single pulsed currents with low and high densities can be applied for the creation and deletion of a single bubble, respectively. The mutual writing-deleting operations on single bubbles are attributed to the thermal heating and non-thermal spin-transfer torque effects in combination with micromagnetic simulations. We also realized the in-situ detection of a single bubble using the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect through a standard four-probe method. Our results could propel the development of bubble-based spintronic devices.

Abstract: Topological spin textures are characterized by topological magnetic charges, Q, which govern their electromagnetic properties. Recent studies have achieved skyrmion bundles with arbitrary integer values of Q, opening possibilities for exploring topological spintronics based on Q. However, the realization of stable skyrmion bundles in chiral magnets at room temperature and zero magnetic field - the prerequisite for realistic device applications - has remained elusive. Here, through the combination of pulsed currents and reversed magnetic fields, we experimentally achieve skyrmion bundles with different integer Q values - reaching a maximum of 24 at above room temperature and zero magnetic field - in the chiral magnet Co8Zn10Mn2. We demonstrate the field-driven annihilation of high-Q bundles and present a phase diagram as a function of temperature and field. Our experimental findings are consistently corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, which reveal the nature of the skyrmion bundle as that of skyrmion tubes encircled by a fractional Hopfion.

Abstract: Two parallel helical edge channels hosting interacting electrons, when proximitized by local and nonlocal pairings, can host time-reversal-invariant pairs of topological zero modes at the system corners. Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids.

Abstract: Recent experiments have reported valley-gauge-symmetry-broken phases, identified as intervalley coherent (IVC) states. Exploration of anomalous responses, particularly those analogous to superconductivity, has become an urgent theoretical issue. In this study, we show that the IVC order gives rise to anomalous valley-current generation driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The anomalous valley current exhibits a characteristic power-law dependence for low-frequency SAWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate by numerical analysis that the IVC order significantly enhances valley-current generation in rhombohedral graphene. These results open a pathway toward exploring exotic phenomena emerging from valley-gauge-symmetry breaking, in close analogy with gauge-symmetry breaking in superconductors.

Abstract: We show that a small charged probe near a spherical topological insulator causes the latter to rotate around a symmetry axis defined by the center of the sphere and the position of the charge outside the latter. The rotation occurs when the distance from the charge to the center of the sphere is changed. This phenomenon occurs due to induced static fields and is a consequence of the axion electrodynamics underlying the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator. Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $ω=(Nα)^2Υ(ε,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $α$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $Υ$ depends on the dielectric constant $ε$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$. Since the point charge also induces Hall currents on the surface, we compute also their associated angular momentum. This allows us to derive an exact expression for the electronic velocity on the surface as a function of $a/d$.

Abstract: Multilayered synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) are artificial three-dimensional (3D) architectures engineered to create novel, complex, and stable spin textures. Non-invasive and quantitative nanoscale magnetic imaging of the two-dimensional stray field profile at the sample surface is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of the spin-structure and being able to tailor them to achieve new functionalities. However, the deterministic detection of spin textures and their quantitative characterization on the nanoscale remain challenging. Here, we use nitrogen-vacancy scanning probe microscopy (NV-SPM) under ambient conditions to perform the first quantitative vector-field magnetometry measurements in the multilayered SAF [(Co/Pt)$_5$/Co/Ru]$_3$/(Co/Pt)$_6$. We investigate nanoscale static and dynamic properties of antiferromagnetic domains with boundaries hosting ``one-dimensional'' ferromagnetic stripes with ~ 100 nm of width and periodic modulation of the magnetization. By employing NV-SPM measurements in different imaging modes and involving NV-probes with various crystallographic orientations, we demonstrated distinct fingerprints emerging from GHz-range spin noise and constant stray fields on the order of several mT. This provides quantitative insights into the structure of domains and domain walls, as well as, into magnetic noise associated with thermal spin-waves. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantitative vector-field magnetometry of modern magnetic materials with tailored 3D spin textures and stray field profiles, and potentially novel spin-wave dispersions--in a quantitative and non-invasive manner, with exceptional magnetic sensitivity and nanometer scale spatial resolution.

Abstract: Interlayer exchange in synthetic antiferromagnets incorporating thin paramagnetic spacers can be controlled thermally. The spacer provides an additional ferromagnetic contribution that renormalizes the otherwise temperature-independent interlayer coupling. As a result, the system shows antiferromagnetic alignment at high temperatures and ferromagnetic alignment at low temperatures. This behavior is observed in Fe(2 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$(0.9 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe(2 nm) multilayers with the inner spacer Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ paramagnetic at and above room temperature, and is shown to be due to the spacer being significantly magnetically polarized on lowering the temperature toward its Curie point. Although the Fe layers lack intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the magnetization reversal demonstrates a field-induced uniaxial anisotropy of antiferromagnetic character. The resulting reversal process resembles that of a metamagnet with a spin-flip transition.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that the conducting edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family are protected by time-reversal symmetry. However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field.

Abstract: Optically inactive dark trions in two-dimensional semiconductors are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via optical activation remains challenging, specially at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ in the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, via localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks separated by ~ 45 meV. We propose that the peaks represent semi-dark and bright trion states, the origin of which lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings. We also report on the experimental evidence of a negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state.

Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG) cavities, where electrons are confined in finite graphene flakes, provide a suitable platform to study quantum chaotic phenomena in condensed matter systems due to the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.

Abstract: Electronic bands in chirally stacked $n$ layer carbon-based honeycomb heterostructures, encompassing rhombohedral ($n \geq 3$), Bernal bilayer ($n=2$), and monolayer ($n=1$) graphene, possess four-fold valley and spin degeneracy. Such systems with $n \geq 2$, when subject to external perpendicular electric displacement fields, feature a fully degenerate metal at high doping, a spin non-degenerate but valley degenerate half-metal at moderate doping, and a non-degenerate quarter-metal at low doping. Due to the fully polarized nature of the quasiparticles in the quarter-metal, realized around one particular valley otherwise chosen spontaneously, it can sustain a single local superconducting ground state, representing a pair-density-wave that is chiral and odd parity in nature. From a leading order renormalization group analysis, here we show that repulsive density-density interaction among such polarized fermionic excitations can foster the pair-density-wave phase at low temperatures. Possible connections with experimentally observed superconducting states in the close vicinity of the quarter-metal in some members of such graphene heterostructures family are discussed.

Abstract: We develop a novel framework to engineer persistent oscillatory modes in Markovian open quantum systems governed by a time-independent Lindblad master equation. We show that oscillatory modes can be created when the Hamiltonian and jump operator can be expressed in the same block-diagonal form. A key feature of the framework is that the dissipator of the Lindblad master equation are generally non-zero. We identify the weak and strong conditions, where the onset of the oscillatory modes is dependent and independent of the parameters of the system, respectively. Our method extends beyond the typical decoherence-free subspace approach, in which the dissipator is zero. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework using various models, showing how carefully tailored system-environment interactions can produce sustained coherent oscillations.

Motivation: The study of quantum resource theories provides a unifying framework for understanding quantum phenomena, but their experimental assessment is challenging.

Method: The work employs deep thermalization (DT) as a central theme. It utilizes projected ensembles, a concept recently used to study DT, and establishes new twirling identities that enable direct inference of the RGP of underlying dynamics. These identities also reveal how resources build up and thermalize within generic quantum circuits.

Conclusion: This research provides a significant advancement in characterizing and quantifying quantum resources, which could pave the way for practical applications in quantum information science by offering experimentally accessible tools to assess the RGP of quantum operations.

Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.

Abstract: The search for exotic temporal orders in quantum matter, such as discrete quasi-time crystals (DQTCs), has become an important theme in nonequilibrium physics. However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases.

Abstract: We develop a bottom-up, statistics-first framework in which the full probabilistic content of an operational theory is encoded in its matrix of conditional outcome probabilities of events (COPE). Within this setting, five model classes (preGPTs, GPTs, quasiprobabilistic, ontological, and noncontextual ontological) are unified as constrained factorizations of the COPE matrix. We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for scalable and broadband free-space phase-matched four-wave mixing in ring resonators. This method for four-wave mixing reduces the complexity of coupling an emitter to a quantum network by combining the spatial and spectral interfaces between them into one nonlinear optical process. The device is compliant with current heterogeneous integration capabilities and has a bandwidth of 165 nm for efficient spatio-spectral conversion. We outline a fabrication-ready diamond-on-insulator pathway towards modular unit cells that natively bridge visible color centers to the infrared spectrum for scalable quantum networks. We also present and analyze an end-to-end framework for considering single-photon coupling efficiency from a color center to a quantum network. This framework represents a step forwards in analyzing and reducing system-scale losses in a spin-photon interface.

### [103] [Quantumness via Discrete Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10063)
*Ravi Kunjwal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This thesis explores various quantum phenomena and their connections to discrete structures. First, it examines contextuality using graphs and hypergraphs, then delves into causality with directed graphs, and finally looks at measurement incompatibility also using hypergraphs. Each section applies these structures to understand key quantum concepts and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I wanted to better understand how discrete structures like graphs and hypergraphs can be used to model and analyze quantum phenomena such as contextuality, causality, and measurement incompatibility. Vertex-transitive graphs were important in this research, as they allow for convenient correlations and symmetry arguments.

Method: The research combined theoretical analysis with mathematical modeling. For contextuality, graph-theoretic approaches were used, inspired by interactions in quantum computing. Directed graphs were employed to represent causal relationships, building on connections to LOCC and SEP. Hypergraphs were utilized to model joint measurability of quantum measurements, inspired by Bell nonlocality studies. I also developed concepts like antinomicity, a device-independent nonclassicality measure based on graph non-colorability.

Result: The thesis provides new connections between quantum information concepts and discrete mathematics, particularly in graph and hypergraph theory. New results include characterizations of generalized contextuality in terms of hypergraphs, novel characterizations of antinomicity, separation of LOCC and SEP, and a characterization of single-system Bell nonlocality in terms of hypergraph colorings.

Conclusion: This thesis demonstrates that discrete structures have significant potential for studying quantum phenomena. It contributes new tools, perspectives, and results, while several natural questions remain open for future research.

Abstract: Quantum theory departs from classical probabilistic theories in foundational ways. These departures--termed quantumness here--power quantum information and computation. This thesis charts the role of discrete structures in assessing quantumness, synthesizing elements of my postdoctoral research through this lens. After an introduction to the necessary background concepts, I present my work under three broad categories. First, I present work on contextuality that extensively relies on (undirected) graphs and hypergraphs as the discrete structures of interest; more specifically, it relies on invariants associated with them. This work includes Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and its operationalization to generalized contextuality, expressed via (hyper)graph-theoretic frameworks. I also present work on KS-contextuality in multiqubit systems and an application of generalized contextuality to a one-shot communication task, both of which rely on hypergraphs. Second, I present work on causality, where the discrete structures of interest are directed graphs. This includes work on indefinite causal order, specifically its connections to the gap between local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations (SEP), and a device-independent notion of nonclassicality--termed antinomicity--that generalizes Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions. Finally, I present work on the incompatibility of quantum measurements, its connection to Bell nonlocality, and its role in discriminating between quantum and almost quantum correlations in the single-system setting. The discrete structures of interest here are hypergraphs that model joint measurability relations between quantum measurements. I conclude with a summary and an overview of work that is not covered in this thesis.

Abstract: The investigation of biomolecular interactions at the single-molecule level has emerged as a pivotal research area in life science, particularly through optical, mechanical, and electrochemical approaches. Spins existing widely in biological systems, offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving $\sim$10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we re-examined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms.

Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the single-molecule level with atomic resolution holds transformative potential for structural biology and surface chemistry. Near-surface solid-state spin sensors with optical readout ability offer a promising pathway toward this goal. However, their extreme proximity to target molecules demands exceptional robustness against surface-induced perturbations. Furthermore, life science applications require these sensors to operate in biocompatible spectral ranges that minimize photodamage. In this work, we demonstrate that the PL6 quantum defect in 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) can serve as a robust near-infrared spin sensor. This sensor operates at tissue-transparent wavelengths and exhibits exceptional near-surface stability even at depth of 2 nm. Using shallow PL6 centers, we achieve nanoscale NMR detection of proton ($\mathrm{^{1}H}$) spins in immersion oil and fluorine ($\mathrm{^{19}F}$) spins in Fomblin, attaining a detection volume of $\mathrm{(3~nm)^3}$ and a sensitivity reaching the requirement for single-proton spin detection. This work establishes 4H-SiC quantum sensors as a compelling platform for nanoscale magnetic resonance, with promising applications in probing low-dimensional water phases, protein folding dynamics, and molecular interactions.

Conclusion: 该工作为量子网络中的光-声子纠缠提供了新的物理实现途径，展现了YIG球在量子信息处理中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved.

Abstract: The upper bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth of an observable in both open and closed quantum systems have been studied actively recently. In our recent work we showed that the rate of fluctuation growth for an observable in a closed quantum system is upper bounded by the fluctuation of its corresponding velocity-like observable. That bound also indicated a tradeoff between the time derivatives of the mean and the standard deviation. In this paper we will look at open quantum systems in two cases. For the first case we find the generator of evolution for an open system employing both the Taylor expansion and the standard time-ordered evolution via the Dyson series, while in the second case we consider no specific information about the evolution of the system. We then find the rate of fluctuation growth in each case. Comparing the upper bounds for each case and considering the upper bound found for a closed system suggest that including more details by separating the contributions of the system and state dynamics seems to result in looser bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth.

Conclusion: 我们提供了一个通用框架,能够扩展量子测控到非均匀环境,同时不存在本质的性能边界

Abstract: Finite drive power leaves unavoidable spatial gradients in control fields, preventing spin ensembles from reaching the standard-quantum-limit sensitivity. We derive an analytic expression of ensemble sensitivity for inhomogeneous spin sensors and introduce sensitivity thresholds that reveal the optimal spin subset. Applied to both pulsed and continuous-wave magnetometry, the optimal subsets deliver up to a tenfold improvement over conventional schemes relying on nominally uniform regions of the ensembles. We demonstrate phase-only digital holography to implement the optimal subsets and show that residual aberrations add less than 1 dB of sensitivity loss. Our framework imposes no fundamental trade-offs and extends quantum sensing to heterogeneous sensing environments.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are a promising candidate for quantum computing, thanks to their high coherence, high controllability and manufacturability. However, the most scalable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) based implementations have so far been limited to a few qubits. Here, to take a step towards large scale systems, we tune and coherently control an eight-dot linear array of silicon spin qubits fabricated in 300 mm CMOS-compatible foundry process, establishing operational scalability beyond the two-qubit regime. All eight qubits are successfully tuned and characterized as four double dot pairs, exhibiting Ramsey dephasing times $T_2^*$ up to 41(2) $μ$s and Hahn-echo coherence times $T_2^{\mathrm{Hahn}}$ up to 1.31(4) ms. Readout of the central four qubits is achieved via a cascaded charge-sensing protocol, enabling simultaneous high-fidelity measurements of the entire multi-qubit array. Additionally, we demonstrate a two-qubit gate operation between adjacent qubits with low phase noise. We demonstrate here that we can scale silicon spin qubit arrays to medium-sized arrays of 8 qubits while maintaining coherence of the system.

Conclusion: More research is needed to address open problems for practical quantum-secured applications.

Abstract: A critical aspect of next-generation wireless networks is the integration of quantum communications to guard against quantum computing threats to classical networks. Despite successful experimental demonstrations, integrating quantum communications into the classical infrastructure faces substantial challenges, including high costs, compatibility issues, and extra hardware deployment to accommodate both classical and quantum communication equipment. To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal. Additionally, we emphasize extending quantum communication capabilities beyond traditional optical bands into the terahertz, even possibly to millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, thereby broadening the potential horizon of quantum-secure applications. Finally, we identify open problems that must be addressed to facilitate practical implementation.

Abstract: Light-injection attacks pose critical security threats to quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Conventional defense methods, such as isolators, filters, and optical power monitoring, are confronted with the threats of specific attacks and the limitations in integration. To address this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an integrated attack sensing and automatic response unit utilizing the photorefractive effect in a thin-film lithium niobate microring resonator. Our unit provides a high rejection ratio against non-resonant injected light. For resonant attacks exceeding tens of microwatts, the unit can autonomously attenuate the transmission of the quantum signal light, leading to a significant suppression of the secret key rate. This work enhances the security of QKD systems against light-injection attacks by providing a highly sensitive, broadband, and on-chip defense mechanism.

Conclusion: 加速下QMA-EUR的下界变化取决于初始量子相关性，显示量子 Discord可能不影响或反向影响不确定性下界。

Abstract: Quantum uncertainty is deeply linked to quantum correlations and relativistic motion. The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum memory offers a powerful way to study how shared entanglement affects measurement precision. However, under acceleration, the Unruh effect can degrade quantum correlations, raising questions about the reliability of QMA-EUR in such settings. Here, we investigate the QMA-EUR for two uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. Using the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation, we calculate the entropic uncertainty, its lower bound, and the tightness of the relation under different Unruh temperatures. We find that acceleration does not always increase the lower bound on the uncertainty relation. Depending on the initial correlations between the detectors, it may either increase or decrease. This behavior results from the interplay between quantum discord and minimal missing information. Interestingly, a higher quantum discord does not necessarily lead to lower uncertainty.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum process tomography, the task of estimating an unknown quantum channel, is a central problem in quantum information theory and a key primitive for characterising noisy quantum devices. A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\mathrm{in}} d_{\mathrm{out}} k/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance.

Method: The protocol involves two steps: first, generating a squeezed mechanical state using a two-tone microwave field, then using a weak red-detuned optical pulse to activate optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering, enabling the subtraction of phonons to create the cat-like state.

Result: The method successfully demonstrates the preparation of a cat-like superposition state, offering a new pathway for manipulating mechanical quantum states.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for studying macroscopic quantum phenomena and contributing to the development of quantum technologies by bridging optical and mechanical systems.

Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.

Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for generating mechanical squeezed states based on the combined mechanism of a two-tone driving and a squeezed vacuum field. This innovative approach achieves a remarkable improvement in mechanical squeezing performance across the entire range of red/blue detuning ratios. Our study reveals that the squeezed vacuum field not only induces position squeezing of the mechanical oscillator but also facilitates momentum squeezing through phase matching. Moreover, the total squeezing degree exhibits nonlinear enhancement with the increasing of squeezing parameter $r$. The mechanical squeezed state exhibits a $2π$-periodic dependence in relation to the squeezing phase $θ$, offering experimental implementation with a high degree of operational flexibility. Notably, the scheme exhibits strong robustness against cavity dissipation and environmental thermal noise, substantially relaxing the strict parameter-matching requirements inherent in conventional approaches.

Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a protocol that details how to create entanglement between previously uncorrelated particles. Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances. Our work opens the path to the exploitation of quantum dot entangled-photon sources in quantum repeater networks.

Abstract: Entangled coherent states (ECS) provide a powerful non-Gaussian resource for continuous-variable quantum communication, but their generation in scalable architectures remains challenging. We propose an integrated photonic scheme that creates high-fidelity ECS from a two-mode squeezed vacuum via photon subtraction in a symmetric waveguide trimer. The resulting non-Gaussian entanglement is further enhanced by single-photon catalysis, which purifies the distributed state after transmission through lossy channels. Using these purified ECS resources, we analyze a photon-number-based teleportation protocol and demonstrate high-fidelity transfer of both coherent states and Schrodinger cat states. In particular, the teleportation fidelity for cat states exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3 over a broad range of realistic channel and squeezing parameters, whereas Gaussian resources fail to do so. Our results show that integrated photon subtraction and catalysis enable practical, chip-compatible generation of non-Gaussian entanglement suitable for advanced quantum teleportation and continuous-variable quantum networks.

Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian states appear ubiquitously in quantum optics and condensed matter physics but remain difficult to simulate classically due to the hafnian bottleneck. We present an efficient algorithm that converts pure bosonic Gaussian states into matrix product states (MPSs), with a computational cost governed solely by the entanglement and not by the number of bosonic modes. Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians. Benchmarking on covariance matrices from the Jiuzhang 2.0 and Jiuzhang 4.0 Gaussian boson sampling experiments demonstrates substantial speedups over previous tensor-network approaches in the low-entanglement regime relevant to lossy devices. The method provides a scalable classical simulation framework for bosonic Gaussian states with limited entanglement and extends the applicability of MPS-based methods to a broad range of bosonic systems.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for distributed quantum data centers by addressing key scalability challenges in superconducting quantum computing.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computational capabilities. However, scaling up large quantum processors is limited by the cumbersome and heat-conductive electronic cables that connect room-temperature control electronics to quantum processors, leading to significant signal attenuation. Optical fibers provide a promising solution, but their use has been restricted to controlling simple two-level quantum systems over short distances. Here, we demonstrate optical control of a bosonic quantum processor, achieving universal operations on the joint Hilbert space of a transmon qubit and a storage cavity. Using an array of cryogenic fiber-integrated uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes, we prepare Fock states containing up to ten photons. Additionally, remote control of bosonic modes over a transmission distance of 15 km has been achieved, with fidelities exceeding 95%. The combination of high-dimensional quantum control, multi-channel operation, and long-distance transmission addresses the key requirements for scaling superconducting quantum computers and enables architectures for distributed quantum data centers.

Abstract: We introduce a simple protocol for measuring properties of a gapped ground state with essentially no disturbance to the state. The required Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with the spectral gap and target precision (up to logarithmic factors), which is optimal. For local observables on geometrically local systems, the protocol only requires Hamiltonian evolution on a quasi-local patch of inverse-gap radius. Our results show that gapped ground states are algorithmically readable from a single copy without a recovery or rewinding procedure, which may drastically reduce tomography overhead in certain quantum simulation tasks.

Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.

Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that the quantum Fisher information associated with estimating the separation between two optical point sources remains finite at small separations, effectively opening new routes to super-resolution imaging of simultaneously emitting sources. Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged.

Result: Quadratic scaling improvement achieved under inverse linear gap.

Conclusion: Adaptive strategies outperform fixed schedules in adiabatic quantum computing.

Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing is a powerful framework for state preparation, while its evolution time often scales quadratically in the inverse Hamiltonian spectral gap, leading to sub-optimal computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear adaptive strategy for finding the time scheduling function, and show that the gap dependence can be quadratically improved to be inverse linear for a wide range of systems under a mild gap measure condition. Through variational analysis, we further demonstrate the optimality of our schedule for systems with linear gap and the partial optimality for general systems, while we also rigorously show that the commonly used linear schedule is never optimal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  NV centers in diamond are promising for nanoscale quantum sensing, but their coherence is degraded by surface noise. This paper investigates the factors affecting NV coherence and provides insights for optimizing diamond surfaces for quantum sensing applications.

Method: The study uses atomistic models derived from density functional theory and decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods to quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation, functionalization, and unpaired electron density on NV Hahn-echo time T_2.

Result: 1. A crossover depth is identified where T_2 transitions from being limited by surface nuclear spins to bulk-limited values. 2. Static surface-electron baths cause a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, affecting T_2 dependence on surface orientation. 3. Spin-phonon relaxations lead to motional narrowing at sub-microsecond timescales. 4. Surface-spin in-sequence hopping is crucial for accurately predicting measured T_2 values as a function of depth.

Conclusion: The study reveals that optimizing surface properties like orientation, functionalization, and spin-phonon interactions can enhance NV center coherence, making diamond surfaces suitable for advanced quantum sensing and information processing applications.

Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) in proximity to diamond surfaces are promising nanoscale quantum sensors. However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications.

Motivation: The primary motivation for this research is to enhance the efficiency and performance of QKD systems, which are critical for secure quantum communication. By optimizing both quantum and classical channels, the study aims to maximize the number of key bits generated per qubit transferred, addressing the challenge of balancing qubit usage and key production in QKD protocols.

This finding provides a framework for future QKD implementations, emphasizing the importance of channel optimization for secure and high-rate quantum key distribution.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems require optimal performance of both quantum and classical channels - utilizing as few as possible qubits and bits for establishing as many as possible key bits. Here we report a way to determine if a quantum key distribution model (or protocol) operates in an optimal behavior. This is accomplished by introducing a quantity, called optimality, which is the maximum over the total efficiency of a QKD under any circumstances (any values of QKD parameters). The optimality definition is given for the asymptotic operation of a QKD system - when infinitely many quantum systems are transferred/used in a quantum key distribution protocol or a quantum key distribution system is used infinitely many times. A way to attain the optimality is considered\textemdash implementation of a completely efficient QKD system (a combination of capacity-reaching quantum channel and a completely compressed classical channel) is presented. Optimal versions of BB84-QKD and twin-field QKD are introduced.

Abstract: Utility-scale quantum computers require quantum error correcting codes with large numbers of physical qubits to achieve sufficiently low logical error rates. The performance of quantum error correction (QEC) is generally predicted through large-scale numerical simulations, used to estimate thresholds, finite-size scaling, and exponential suppression of logical errors below threshold. The connection of QEC to models from statistical mechanics provides an alternative tool for analysing QEC performance. However, predicting the behaviour of these models also requires large-scale numerical simulations, as analytic solutions are not generally known. Here we exploit an exact mapping, from a toric code under bit-flip noise that is post-selected on being syndrome free to the exactly-solvable two-dimensional Ising model on a torus, to derive an analytic solution for the logical failure rate across its full domain of physical error rates. In particular, this mapping provides closed-form expressions for the logical failure rate in four distinct regimes: the path-counting, below-threshold (ordered), near-threshold (critical), and above-threshold (disordered) regimes. Our framework places a number of familiar and long-standing numerical observations on firm theoretical ground. It also motivates explicit ansätze for the conventional QEC setting of non-post-selected codes whose statistical mechanics mappings involve random-bond disorder. Specifically, we introduce an effective surface tension model for the below-threshold regime, and a new scaling ansatz for the near-threshold regime, derived from an analysis of the ground state energy cost distribution. By bridging statistical mechanics theory and quantum error correction practice, our results offer a new toolkit for designing, benchmarking, and understanding topological codes beyond current computational limits.

Abstract: We show that the quantum-mechanical probability distribution involving complex probability amplitudes can be derived from three natural conditions imposed on a relativistically invariant probability function describing the motion of a particle that can take multiple paths simultaneously. The conditions are: (i) pairwise Kolmogorov additivity, (ii) time symmetry, and (iii) Bayes' rule. The resulting solution, parameterized by a single constant, is the squared modulus of a sum of complex exponentials of the relativistic action, thereby recovering the Feynman path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a robust population-transfer protocol in a driven two-level system based on a sudden sign change of the detuning at the maximum of a smooth coupling pulse. Away from the jump the dynamics is adiabatic, while the sign flip produces a single nonadiabatic kick in the adiabatic basis. Within a simple stepwise adiabatic-sudden approximation we obtain a compact analytic expression for the final transition probability, identify the parameter regimes that yield high-fidelity inversion, and show that the result depends only on the change of the mixing angle across the detuning jump, i.e., solely on the ratio of the peak Rabi frequency to the detuning. Numerical simulations of the full time-dependent Schrödinger equation confirm the validity and robustness of this description over a broad parameter range.
  We then use the Majorana decomposition to extend the scheme to an SU(2)-symmetric three-state chain driven by the same coupling and detuning functions. In this setting the three-state propagator is expressed in closed form through the two-level Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to derive explicit transition probabilities for all three initial states. In particular, we show that for strong coupling the protocol yields almost complete population transfer between the two outer states, with only small transient population of the middle state, while retaining the same intrinsic robustness as in the underlying two-level model.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising paradigm for electromagnetic eigenmode analysis, enabling compact representations of complex field interactions and potential exponential speedup over classical numerical solvers. Recent efforts have applied variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based methods to compute waveguide modes, demonstrating the feasibility of simulating TE and TM field distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, these studies typically employ manually designed, fixed-depth parameterized quantum circuits and uniform measurement-shot strategies, resulting in excessive quantum resource consumption, limited circuit expressivity, and reduced robustness under realistic noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an architecture and shot adaptive subspace variational quantum eigensolver for efficient microwave waveguide eigenmode simulation on NISQ devices. The proposed framework integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) based circuit design strategy and an adaptive shot allocation mechanism to jointly reduce quantum resource overhead. Specifically, the RL agent autonomously explores the quantum circuit space to generate hardware-efficient parameterized quantum circuits, while the adaptive measurement scheme allocates sampling resources according to Hamiltonian term weights. Numerical experiments on three- and five-qubit systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate estimation of TE and TM mode eigenvalues, with a minimum absolute error down to $10^{-8}$ and reconstructed field distributions under noiseless conditions in excellent agreement with classical electromagnetic solutions.

Abstract: We study distributed similarity estimation for unitary channels (DSEU), the task of estimating the similarity between unitary channels implemented on different quantum devices. We completely address DSEU by showing that, for $n$-qubit unitary channels, the query complexity of DSEU is $Θ(\sqrt{d})$, where $d=2^n$, for both incoherent and coherent accesses. First, we propose two estimation algorithms for DSEU with these accesses utilizing the randomized measurement toolbox. The query complexities of these algorithms are both $O(\sqrt{d})$. Although incoherent access is generally weaker than coherent access, our incoherent algorithm matches this complexity by leveraging additional shared randomness between devices, highlighting the power of shared randomness in distributed quantum learning. We further establish matching lower bounds, proving that $Θ(\sqrt{d})$ queries are both necessary and sufficient for DSEU. Finally, we compare our algorithms with independent classical shadow and show that ours have a square-root advantage. Our results provide practical and theoretically optimal tools for quantum devices benchmarking and for distributed quantum learning.

Motivation: The paper examines the simplest 3D contextual set and challenges its fundamental nature by showing that simpler sets exist and that automatic generation is feasible.

Method: Mathematical analysis of contextual sets with different dimensions and numbers of complete bases, proving the existence of simpler sets and demonstrating automatic generation capabilities.

Result: The study concludes that the simplest 3D contextual set isn't unique as simpler versions exist, and that minimal contextual sets can be systematically generated.

Conclusion: The research highlights limitations in identifying unique contextual sets and supports the development of automated methods in quantum theory research.

Abstract: In Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 190203 (2025) a discovery of the simplest 3D contextual set with 33 vertices, 50 bases, and 14 complete bases is claimed. In this paper, we show that it was previously generated in Quantum 7, 953 (2023) and analyze the meaning, origin, and significance of the simplest contextual sets in any dimension. In particular, we prove that there is no ground to consider the aforementioned set as fundamental since there are many 3D contextual sets with a smaller number of complete bases. We also show that automatic generation of contextual sets from basic vector components automatically yields all known minimal contextual sets of any kind in any dimension and therefore also the aforementioned set in no CPU-time. In the end, we discuss varieties of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS), extended KS, and non-KS sets as well as ambiguities in their definitions.

Abstract: This work develops tools to understand how quantum information spreads, scrambles, and is reshaped by measurements in many-body systems. First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow.

Abstract: We introduce quantum parameter estimation with the encoding being via a quantum measurement. We quantify the precision for estimating parameters characterizing a general two-outcome qubit measurement, considering two cases: when the outcomes of the encoding measurement are recorded and when the same are ignored. We find that in a large variety of such estimation scenarios, forgetting the outcomes yields higher precision. We derive a necessary criterion under which remembering the measurement outcomes provides better precision in comparison to the outcome-forgotten strategy. Furthermore, we establish a necessary and sufficient criterion for the simultaneous estimation of two parameters encoded by an arbitrary quantum process, including those involving measurements, using qubit probes, and find when the quantum Cramér$-$Rao bound is valid and achievable. For simultaneous estimation of two parameters characterizing the measurement, we find that the achievable quantum Cramér$-$Rao bound can be a valid precision bound only when the measurement direction depends on the parameters of interest.

Abstract: The opening of Arctic sea routes presents unprecedented opportunities for global trade but poses significant operational and computational challenges due to the dynamic nature of sea ice conditions. This study formulates a multi criteria Arctic route optimization problem that integrates Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) variables into a Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) and solves it using D Wave's hybrid quantum classical solver. We benchmark the feasibility and scalability of this approach against classical Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) solvers such as Gurobi and CPLEX. Results show that the CQM formulation achieves feasible solutions with stable runtimes as quadratic density increases, demonstrating 10 to 100 times faster convergence and reduced computational time compared with classical solvers, while also improving route smoothness by approximately 10 percent and reducing total length by approximately 1 percent. This reflects the effectiveness of the hybrid quantum annealing approach for Arctic routing problems.

Abstract: Finite-capacity single-server queues with general service-time distributions form the backbone of numerous real-world systems, yet classical simulation of performance metrics such as blocking probabilities and delay becomes computationally prohibitive as service variability or required precision increases. This work presents the first coherent quantum circuit for simulating an M/G/1/K queue under arbitrary service-time laws. The circuit encodes the service distribution through a logarithmic-depth ladder of $R_y$ rotations and enforces buffer constraints via a comparator-controlled phase gate, while preserving the quadratic speed-up of amplitude amplification. Grover iterations center on estimating the expected number of customers in the system, yielding provable $O(\sqrt{N})$ variance reduction and closed-form confidence bounds, where $N$ denotes the number of shots. Empirical evaluations on IBM quantum simulators across four service distributions and three traffic intensities demonstrate fidelity above 0.99 with four qubits and above 0.76 with ten qubits, with Jensen-Shannon divergence below 0.11. Waiting-time estimation errors decrease by an order of magnitude as system load approaches capacity and remain within 3% in high-traffic regimes using registers of up to 63 qubits. These results establish the first end-to-end quantum simulation framework for finite-buffer, non-Markovian queueing systems and provide a concrete foundation for quantum-accelerated performance analysis in service-oriented architectures.

Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a linear two-mode atom interferometer subject to environmental noise, modeled within the framework of open quantum systems with both number- conserving and non-conserving Lindblad operators. Considering several input states, we first study the cases N=1,2 (N number of particles) and perform numerical simulations for N>2. The sensitivity as a function of the holding time can display divergence points where phase estimation becomes impossible, to which we refer as insensitivity points. We characterize their behavior as the input state, particle number, and noise operator are varied, and we find that their positions are independent of the noise intensity. Moreover, while our fixed measurement scheme may favor number-conserving noise at small N (i.e., having better sensitivity), the Cramér-Rao bound reveals that particle non-conserving noise yields strictly lower achievable sensitivity for all particle numbers.

Motivation: Lacking task-specific quantum circuit designs hinders QC's potential.

Method: Investigated entanglement topologies and loss functions in QuGANs for generating geometrically constrained K4 graphs.

Result: Triangle-topology QuGAN achieves highest geometric validity and matches classical GAN performance.

Conclusion: Task-aware quantum ansatz-topologies enhance-QC performance for geometric tasks but require tailored architectural choices.

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) promises theoretical advantages, benefiting computational problems that would not be efficiently classically simulatable. However, much of this theoretical speedup depends on the quantum circuit design solving the problem. We argue that QC literature has yet to explore more domain specific ansatz-topologies, instead of relying on generic, one-size-fits-all architectures. In this work, we show that incorporating task-specific inductive biases -- specifically geometric priors -- into quantum circuit design can enhance the performance of hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QuGANs) on the task of generating geometrically constrained K4 graphs. We evaluate a portfolio of entanglement topologies and loss-function designs to assess their impact on both statistical fidelity and compliance with geometric constraints, including the Triangle and Ptolemaic inequalities. Our results show that aligning circuit topology with the underlying problem structure yields substantial benefits: the Triangle-topology QuGAN achieves the highest geometric validity among quantum models and matches the performance of classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Additionally, we showcase how specific architectural choices, such as entangling gate types, variance regularization and output-scaling govern the trade-off between geometric consistency and distributional accuracy, thus emphasizing the value of structured, task-aware quantum ansatz-topologies.

Motivation: This paper bridges a gap in QML by demonstrating the effectiveness of pulse-based architectures on NISQ hardware, addressing practical limitations.

Method: A pulse-based data re-uploading method was implemented on a simulated superconducting transmon processor with realistic noise parameters.

Result: Pulse-based models achieved higher test accuracy and better noise resilience than gate-based models.

Conclusion: Pulse-native architectures offer a viable alternative for practical QML on noisy NISQ hardware.

Abstract: While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds great potential, its practical realization on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware has been hindered by the limitations of variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Recent evidence suggests that VQCs suffer from severe trainability and noise-related issues, leading to growing skepticism about their long-term viability. However, the possibility of implementing learning models directly at the pulse-control level remains comparatively unexplored and could offer a promising alternative. In this work, we formulate a pulse-based variant of data re-uploading, embedding trainable parameters directly into the native system's dynamics. We benchmark our approach on a simulated superconducting transmon processor with realistic noise profiles. The pulse-based model consistently outperforms its gate-based counterpart, exhibiting higher test accuracy and improved generalization under equivalent noise conditions. Moreover, by systematically increasing noise strength, we show that pulse-level implementations retain higher fidelity for longer, demonstrating enhanced resilience to decoherence and control errors. These results suggest that pulse-native architectures, though less explored, may offer a viable and hardware-aligned path forward for practical QML in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Ionizing radiation has emerged as a potential limiting factor for superconducting quantum processors, inducing quasiparticle bursts and correlated errors that challenge fault-tolerant operation. Atmospheric muons are particularly problematic due to their high energy and penetration power, making passive shielding ineffective. Therefore, monitoring the real-time muon flux is crucial to guide the development of alternative error-correction or protection strategies. We present the design, simulation, and first operation of a cryogenic muon-tagging system based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) for integration with superconducting quantum processors. The system consists of two KIDs arranged in a vertical stack and operated at ~20 mK. Monte Carlo simulations based on Geant4 guided the prototype design and provided reference expectations for muon-tagging efficiency and accidental coincidences due to ambient $γ$-rays. We measured a muon-induced coincidence rate among the top and bottom detectors of (192 $\pm$ 9) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ events/s, in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo prediction. The prototype achieves a muon-tagging efficiency of about 90% with negligible dead time. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating a muon-tagging system at millikelvin temperatures and open the path toward its integration with multi-qubit chips to veto or correct muon-induced errors in real time.

Abstract: The main bottleneck for distributed quantum computing is the rate at which entanglement is produced between quantum processing units (QPUs). In this work, we prove that multiple QPUs connected through slow interconnects can outperform a monolithic architecture made with a single QPU. We consider a distributed quantum computing model with the following assumptions: (1) each QPU is linked to only two other QPUs, (2) each link produces only one Bell pair at a time, (3) the time to generate a Bell pair is $τ_e$ times longer than the gate time. We propose a distributed version of the CliNR partial error correction scheme respecting these constraints and we show through circuit level simulations that, even if the entanglement generation time $τ_e$ is up to five times longer than the gate time, distributed CliNR can achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a shorter depth than both the direct implementation and the monolithic CliNR implementation of random Clifford circuits. In the asymptotic regime, we relax assumption (2) and we prove that links producing $O(t/\ln t)$ Bell pairs in parallel, where $t$ is the number of QPUs, is sufficient to avoid stalling distributed CliNR, independently of the number of qubits per QPU. This demonstrates the potential of distributed CliNR for near-term multi-QPU devices. Moreover, we envision a distributed quantum superiority experiment based on the conjugated Clifford circuits of Bouland, Fitzsimons and Koh implemented with distributed CliNR.

Abstract: Cooling quantum systems with finite resources is a central task in quantum technologies and has been extensively explored in discrete-variable settings. As continuous-variable (CV) platforms play an increasingly important role in quantum information processing, it becomes crucial to understand the fundamental limitations of cooling bosonic systems. In this work, we develop a general framework for cooling CV systems, identifying both the constraints imposed by Gaussianity and the advantages enabled by non-Gaussian interactions. We derive a reachable bound on the cooling performance of Gaussian operations that applies to arbitrary cooling architectures. By optimizing over all protocols saturating this bound, we further identify the most efficient scheme, which minimizes dissipated energy for a given number of ancilla modes. Beyond Gaussian operations, we show that $p$-excitation exchange exploits non-Gaussian resources to achieve a $p$-fold enhancement of the cooling limit. Our results establish the fundamental limits of CV heat-bath algorithmic cooling and reveal the crucial role of non-Gaussianity in surpassing Gaussian cooling barriers.

Abstract: A Bernoulli factory is a model for randomness manipulation that transforms an initial Bernoulli random variable into another Bernoulli variable by applying a predetermined function relating the output bias to the input one. In literature, quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory schemes have been proposed, which encode both the input and output variables using qubit amplitudes. This fundamental concept can serve as a subroutine for quantum algorithms that involve Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods, or that require data encryption, like in blind quantum computation. In this work, we present a characterisation of the complexity of the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory by providing a lower bound on the required number of qubits needed to implement the protocol, an upper bound on the success probability and the quantum circuit that saturates the bounds. We also formalise and analyse two different variants of the original problem that address the possibility of increasing the number of input biases or the number of functions implemented by the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. The obtained results can be used as a framework for randomness manipulation via such an approach.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, widely applied in logistics and transportation. As the size of TSP instances grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to produce high-quality solutions within reasonable timeframes. This study investigates the potential of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical method, to solve TSP under realistic constraints. We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA. This method decomposes large TSP instances into smaller sub-problems, making quantum optimization feasible even on devices with a limited number of qubits. The results offer a comprehensive evaluation of QAOA's strengths and limitations in solving constrained TSP scenarios. This study advances quantum optimization and lays groundwork for future large-scale applications.

Abstract: We consolidate recent theoretical advances in Detector Error Model (DEM) estimation and formalize several algorithms to learn DEM parameters and structure from syndromes without using a decoder, demonstrating recovery of known DEMs from simulated syndromes with precision limited only by finite-sample effects. We then apply these algorithms to estimate DEMs from Google's 72- and 105-qubit chips. Using a likelihood function that is tractable for small DEMs, we show that DEMs estimated directly from syndromes agree more closely with unseen syndromes than DEMs trained to optimize logical performance, whereas the latter outperform the former as priors for decoders in logical memory experiments. We used a time-series of estimated DEMs to track both global error and specific local errors over the course of a QEC experiment, suggesting applications in online characterization. We employ a sequence of DEM estimation techniques to discover and quantify long-range detector correlations spanning the width of the 105-qubit chip, for which DEM analysis suggests correlated measurement errors rather than high-weight Pauli errors as the most likely explanation. Finally, we present two artifacts in repetition code syndromes that are \emph{not} well-modeled by a DEM: correlated flipping of pairs of adjacent detectors in many consecutive rounds of QEC, and signatures consistent with radiation events occurring more frequently than previously reported.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fabrication defects can be well-handled using a strategy relying on the mid-error-correction-cycle state. In this work we present two improvements to the original prescription. First, we quantify the impact of the choice of a more complete set of gauge operators originally proposed for the hex-grid surface code on the standard square-grid surface code, as well as a new method for excising effectively unused qubits. Second, we leverage the expressivity of the LUCI framework as an intermediate representation, using integer linear programming to find performant physical circuits from the large space of valid LUCI circuits. We show that on the $d = 11$ surface code at $1\%(3\%)$ dropout rate for qubits and couplers, these optimizations allow for a total improvement of $14.5\%(23.6\%)$ over $4d$ round of syndrome extraction using the SI1000 noise model at $0.1\%$ noise.

Abstract: Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (QITE) is a powerful method for preparing ground states on quantum hardware. However, executing QITE has costly measurement budgets for general Hamiltonians. Both fidelity and computational cost are strongly dependent on the definition of suitable local domains and Hamiltonian partitions. In this work, we introduce the Multiple-Time QITE algorithm (MT-QITE). We show how using more than one imaginary time substantially improves the fidelity of the resulting ground state as well as the measurement overhead with respect to the previously published QITE algorithm, while preserving its deterministic character and its independence from ad hoc ansatze. Moreover, unlike QITE and other QITE-based algorithms, MT-QITE is parallelizable, and we show that even in Hamiltonians with non-local interactions, partitioning may entail a computational advantage.

TL;DR: entcalc is a Python and MATLAB package for estimating geometric entanglement of multipartite quantum states. It can compute geometric entanglement for pure states and provide bounds for mixed states. The package can handle several cases, such as PPT entangled states, mixtures of GHZ and W states, thermal states of spin chains, and noisy GHZ and W states. The results demonstrate that entanglement can be activated by tuning external parameters, and the package provides accurate estimates with narrow bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of tools for estimating quantum entanglement is crucial for advancements in quantum information processing and quantum computing, as entanglement is a key resource in these fields.

Method: The entcalc package processes input quantum states, computes geometric entanglement for pure states, or provides bounds for mixed states. It uses multiple methods for computing lower bounds and combines accuracy with computational efficiency.

Result: The study applies entcalc to various quantum states, including 3⊗3 PPT entangled states and different mixtures. It observes quantum phase transitions via entanglement signatures and demonstrates that non-neighboring entanglement can be enhanced by tuning external fields. The package shows high accuracy with small gaps between lower and upper bounds.

Conclusion: entcalc is an effective tool for estimating geometric entanglement, providing precise results and enabling deeper insights into quantum systems. It has applications in understanding complex quantum states and phase transitions.

Abstract: We present entcalc, a Python and MATLAB package for estimating the geometric entanglement of multipartite quantum states. The package operates as follows: given a multipartite quantum state as input, it outputs an estimate of its geometric entanglement. For pure states, it computes the geometric entanglement together with an estimation error. For mixed states, it provides both lower and upper bounds on the geometric entanglement, thereby identifying an interval in which the true value lies. We provide several methods to compute the lower bound, enabling users to balance accuracy against computational cost. We apply entcalc to several representative examples, including for $3\otimes3$ PPT entangled states, mixtures of GHZ and W states, thermal states of selected three-qubit spin chains, and noisy GHZ and W states. We observe signatures of quantum phase transitions by quantifying entanglement in spin chains. We also demonstrate that entanglement between non-neighbouring sites can be activated by tuning the external magnetic field. In all tested cases, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is found to be very small, indicating that entcalc provides highly accurate estimates of the geometric entanglement for these states.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a single bosonic cavity subject to two-photon driving and two-photon dissipation in the presence of finite detuning. Exploiting a hidden time-reversal symmetry, the Wigner representation and the WKB method, we introduce an effective phase-space potential for description of the steady state. It reveals two attracting points, which are metastable due to quantum fluctuations. By employing the Keldysh real-time path integral formalism, we compute the instanton trajectory governing the quantum activation process between these attractors and establish a fundamental connection with the Wigner representation. This relation unifies the steady-state phase-space description with dynamical quantum activation processes. We also derive an analytical expression for the decoherence rate of the system. Our work provides a coherent theoretical framework for analyzing quantum bistability, metastability, and decoherence in driven-dissipative nonlinear resonators, with direct implications for the design of bosonic qubits and quantum information processing.

### [157] [Noisy Quantum Learning Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10929)
*Jordan Cotler,Weiyuan Gong,Ishaan Kannan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines the limitations and possibilities of noisy quantum learning, particularly in fault-tolerant quantum computing. It introduces the 'noisy BQP' complexity class to model noisy quantum computations and demonstrates that noise can eliminate quantum learning advantages while maintaining a gap between NISQ devices and fault-tolerant ones. The paper also explores specific noisy learning tasks, such as purity testing and Pauli shadow tomography, and discusses the conditions under which quantum learning advantages can be restored despite noise. Overall, it highlights the importance of understanding how noise-robust physical properties can be leveraged to achieve meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper stems from the growing field of quantum computing, where understanding the impact of noise on quantum learning algorithms is crucial for practical applications. Fault-tolerant quantum computing aims to overcome noise through error correction, but the relationship between noise and learning efficiency is still not well understood.

Method: The authors use a theoretical approach, starting with the complexity class $	extsf{NBQP}$, to model the effects of noise on quantum computations. They employ complexity theory to analyze the separations between quantum and classical learning capabilities under noisy conditions. For concrete tasks like purity testing and Pauli shadow tomography, they derive bounds and design specific algorithms to assess the sample complexity under noise.

Result: The key results are as follows: (1) In general, noise eliminates the exponential quantum learning advantages enjoyed by ideal, noiseless learners, but still allows for a superpolynomial gap between NISQ devices and fault-tolerant ones. (2) For certain learning tasks, such as purity testing, the quantum advantage beyond a single noise application is significantly reduced, but can be restored under specific conditions inspired by theoretical frameworks like AdS/CFT. (3) The authors also establish fundamental limits on the effectiveness of learning from noisy data, particularly for Pauli shadow tomography, by deriving lower bounds on sample complexity based on instance size, quantum memory, and noise parameters. These bounds provide a clear understanding of how these factors influence the feasibility of different learning tasks in noisy environments.

Conclusion: This paper underscores the challenges and opportunities in achieving quantum advantages in the presence of noise. It shows that noise can severely limit the potential of quantum learning, but also highlights specific scenarios and structures that can mitigate these effects, such as noise-robust physical properties. The results emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of how noise interacts with quantum algorithms and hardware, paving the way for future research in both areas to realize practical quantum advantages.

Abstract: We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments, focusing on fault-tolerant devices accessing uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Our starting point is the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.

### [158] [An improved approach for estimating the dimension of inertial manifolds in chaotic distributed dynamical systems via analysis of angles between tangent subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10030)
*Pavel V. Kuptsov*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: A paper presents a more efficient method for estimating inertial manifold dimensions using angles between tangent subspaces spanned by CLVs, reducing computational demands compared to previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem lies in challenging computational requirements of estimating inertial manifold dimensions, prompting the development of a more efficient alternative method.

Method: The authors propose utilizing angles between tangent subspaces spanned by CLVs, building on a fast numerical technique for assessing hyperbolicity in chaotic dynamics to reduce computational resources and memory usage by avoiding explicit CLV computation.

Result: The method is tested on two canonical systems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a correlated chain of Lorenz oscillators. Results validate the accuracy of the new approach for the former system and reveal the absence of a low-dimensional inertial manifold in the latter, pointing to a complex dynamic regime.

Conclusion: The paper presents a practical and efficient computational tool for characterizing high-dimensional attractors in extended dynamical systems.

Abstract: While a previously proposed method for estimating inertial manifold dimension, based on explicitly computing angles between pairs of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), employs efficient algorithms, it remains computationally demanding due to its substantial resource requirements. In this work, we introduce an improved method to determine this dimension by analyzing the angles between tangent subspaces spanned by the CLVs. This approach builds upon a fast numerical technique for assessing chaotic dynamics hyperbolicity. Crucially, the proposed method requires significantly less computational effort and minimizes memory usage by eliminating the need for explicit CLV computation. We test our method on two canonical systems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a diffusively coupled chain of Lorenz oscillators. For the former, the results confirm the accuracy of the new approach by matching prior dimension estimates. For the latter, the analysis demonstrates the absence of a low-dimensional inertial manifold, highlighting a complex regime that merits further investigation. The presented method offers a practical and efficient tool for characterizing high-dimensional attractors in extended dynamical systems.

Result: 研究结果表明，广义Ziegler摆的运动特性受外部作用力（如引力和阻尼）显著影响。特别是在存在阻尼和离散化条件下，系统可能出现多种复杂的动态行为，包括周期性运动和混沌运动。通过分析周期点分布，发现系统不具备密集周期点的特征，因此在特定参数条件下，离散映射并非混沌。

Conclusion: 基于以上分析，本研究得出结论：广义Ziegler摆系统的运动特性在引入额外外部作用力（如引力和阻尼）后可能出现复杂的动态行为。离散化条件下的系统不具备Devaney意义上的混沌特性，这为理解和控制这类复杂动力学系统提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We present analytical and numerical results on integrability and transition to chaotic motion for a generalized Ziegler pendulum, a double pendulum subject to an angular elastic potential and a follower force. Several variants of the original dynamical system, including the presence of gravity and friction, are considered, in order to analyze whether the integrable cases are preserved or not in presence of further external forces, both potential and non-potential. Particular attention is devoted to the presence of dissipative forces, that are analyzed in two different formulations. Furthermore, a study of the discrete version is performed. The analysis of periodic points, that is presented up to period 3, suggests that the discrete map associated to the dynamical system has not dense sets of periodic points, so that the map would not be chaotic in the sense of Devaney for a choice of the parameters that corresponds to a general case of chaotic motion for the original system.

*Asutosh Anand Singh,Chandrakala Meena*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The paper investigates how phase frustration, noise, and higher-order interactions influence synchronization in globally coupled heterogeneous Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay of phase frustration, noise, and higher-order interactions is crucial for predicting synchronization behavior in complex oscillator networks.

Method: The study employs numerical simulations and the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation. Systematic simulations vary coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities. The results are analyzed using bifurcation theory and Kramer's escape rate to assess bistability and noise effects.

Result: Synchronization emerges through a balance of weak frustration with mutual reinforcement of couplings. In contrast, strong frustration favors coherent states under repulsive coupling. The bistable region between synchronized and desynchronized states depends sensitively on frustration, noise, and higher-order coupling strength. Higher-order interactions widen this region. Noise destabilizes coexistence states, reducing bistability.

Conclusion: The research provides a unified framework explaining synchronization in complex oscillator networks, demonstrating that phase frustration, noise, and higher-order interactions significantly influence synchronization behavior.

Abstract: How do the combined effects of phase frustration, noise, and higher-order interactions govern synchronization in globally coupled heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillators? To address this question, we investigate a globally coupled network of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators that includes both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions, together with additive stochastic forcing. Systematic numerical simulations across a broad range of coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities reveal that synchronization emerges through a nontrivial interplay among these parameters. In general, weak frustration combined with mutually reinforcing coupling promotes synchronization, whereas strong frustration favors coherence under repulsive coupling. Forward and backward parameter sweeps reveal the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states. The presence and width of this bistable region depend sensitively on phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling strength, with higher-order interactions significantly widening the bistable interval. To explain these behaviors, we employ the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation that predicts the forward critical point in the thermodynamic limit, the backward saddle-node point, and the width of the bistable region. Higher order interactions widen this region by shifting the saddle-node point without affecting the forward critical point. Further analysis of Kramer's escape rate explains how noise destabilizes coexistence states and diminishes bistability. Overall, our results provide a unified theoretical and numerical framework for frustrated, noisy, higher-order oscillator networks, revealing that synchronization is strongly influenced by the combined action of phase frustration, stochasticity, and both pairwise and higher-order interactions.

### [162] [Melnikov Method for a Class of Generalized Ziegler Pendulums](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10682)
*Stefano Disca,Vincenzo Coscia*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: This paper applies the Melnikov method to generalized Ziegler pendulums, deriving an analytical form for the separatrix using Jacobian elliptic integrals. It demonstrates that the first non-vanishing Melnikov integral appears at the second order, with explicit expressions for the Melnikov integral under time-periodic external forces and dissipative terms. The results establish relationships between the Melnikov integral and a control parameter, distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits. An appendix proves a conjecture about Devaney's chaoticity definition for a discrete map associated with the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the study of nonlinear dynamical systems, specifically focusing on the separation of trajectories and the onset of chaos in mechanical systems like pendulums under various forces and damping.

Method: The authors use the Melnikov method, an analytical technique for studying the break-up of separatrices in Hamiltonian systems under perturbations. They also employ Duffing approximation to simplify the system and evaluate the Melnikov integral in different scenarios (with periodic forces and dissipative terms).

Result: The key result is that the first non-vanishing Melnikov integral appears at the second order. Explicit expressions for the Melnikov integral are provided for systems with time-periodic external forces and dissipative terms. Additionally, the paper links the Melnikov integral to a control parameter that differentiates between regular and chaotic orbits in the system.

Conclusion: The study successfully applies the Melnikov method to generalized Ziegler pendulums, providing analytical expressions and relationships to identify conditions leading to regular or chaotic behavior. The results offer a deeper understanding of nonlinear oscillator dynamics and contribute to controlling or predicting chaotic behavior in such systems.

Abstract: The Melnikov method is applied to a class of generalized Ziegler pendulums. We find an analytical form for the separatrix of the system in terms of Jacobian elliptic integrals, holding for a large class of initial conditions and parameters. By working in Duffing approximation, we apply the Melnikov method to the original Ziegler system, showing that the first non-vanishing Melnikov integral appears in the second order. An explicit expression for the Melnikov integral is derived in the presence of a time-periodic external force and for a suitable choice of the parameters, as well as in the presence of a dissipative term acting on the lower rod of the pendulum. These results allow us to define fundamental relationships between the Melnikov integral and a proper control parameter that distinguishes between regular and chaotic orbits for the original dynamical system. Finally, in the appendix, we present proof of a conjecture concerning the non-validity of Devaney's chaoticity definition for a discrete map associated with the system.

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear propagation of light in graded-index multimode fiber, utilizing it as an optical computing unit, and quantify how it employs waveguide modes to process information. Using a time-dependent spatiotemporal propagation model with modal decomposition, we evaluate several benchmark regression and classification tasks and study the modal content of the generated speckles, which couples with a simple digital layer to perform optical computing. Analysis of modal entropy and energy-based mode counts reveals that effective computation is confined to a low-dimensional modal subspace, whose identity depends on the task and propagation regime. This also sets a trade-off between modal richness and nonlinear beam self-cleaning. These results establish modal statistics as practical design metrics for fiber-based optical computers.

Abstract: The generation of white optical vortices is currently constrained by intrinsic trade-offs between spectral bandwidth, conversion efficiency, and temporal pulse integrity in conventional diffractive and geometric-phase approaches. In this work, we theoretically investigate a compensated tandem crossed twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal architecture that overcomes these fundamental limitations. By developing a rigorous Jones matrix model and defining specific figures of merit for chromatic fidelity, we analyze the impact of manufacturing imperfections and non-adiabatic waveguiding (deviations from the Mauguin regime) on the device performance. We propose and evaluate three distinct compensation strategies, ranging from optimized passive designs for specific manufacturing tolerances to a robust active compensation scheme utilizing a tunable retarder. Our analysis demonstrates that the active approach effectively nullifies parasitic amplitude modulation, enabling the generation of perfectly achromatic vortices with high phase purity across an arbitrary bandwidth. This establishes the compensated tandem TN cell as a superior and versatile platform for high-fidelity white-light singular optics.

Abstract: Localization of a macroscopic number of eigenstates on a real-space boundary, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, is one of the striking topological features emerging from non-Hermiticity. Realizing this effect typically requires periodic (lattice) systems with asymmetry of intersite coupling, which is not readily available in many physical platforms. Instead, it is meticulously engineered, e.g., in photonics, which results in complex structures requiring precise fabrication steps. Here, we propose a simpler mechanism: introducing an asymmetric, purely imaginary potential in a topologically trivial system induces momentum-space localization akin to the skin effect. We experimentally demonstrate this localization using exciton polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasi-particles in a simple engineered `round box' trap, pumped by a laser pump offset from the trap center. The effect disappears if the pump is concentric with the trap. The localization persists and becomes stronger at higher densities of polaritons, when a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate is formed and the system becomes nonlinear. Our approach offers a new route to realizing skin effects in continuous, non-periodic systems and exploring the interplay of non-Hermiticity, topology, and nonlinearity in macroscopic quantum states.

Abstract: The mixed quantum/classical approach of Skinner and co-workers has been widely used to calculate the line shapes of the infrared spectra of water (H2O), but less attention has been paid to the use of this approach in quantitatively calculating spectral intensity, thereby limiting direct comparisons of calculated and experimental spectra. Here, we extend this theoretical framework to facilitate direct computation of the full complex refractive index of water, replacing the normalized ordinate used in previous studies. Our results for the OH stretching region of H2O capture both the shapes and intensities of the experimental spectra. They reveal that inclusion of the local field effect is crucial to the accurate reproduction of spectral intensity. This extended approach enables new areas of analysis of the bulk, thin-film, and cluster spectra of water.

Abstract: Since the first proof-of-concept demonstrations of photoluminescence-based optical refrigeration, solid-state laser cooling has developed into a credible competitor to conventional cryogenic technologies. Solid-state laser cooling continues to advance as new materials push cooling limits. These developments have created a need to consolidate progress made to date as well as standardize critical experimental considerations needed for reliable and verifiable cooling measurements. This primer therefore outlines essential concepts and requirements, which underpin solid-state laser cooling. The primer summarizes key milestones achieved with cooling-grade, rare-earth-doped glasses and crystals as well as with semiconductors. It additionally highlights emerging applications of solid-state optical refrigeration. To strengthen the consistency and reproducibility of cooling results going forward, two reporting checklists are introduced. They cover materials, cooling metrics, and thermometry. This primer is intended to serve as both a tutorial and a practical reference for incoming and existing researchers involved in solid-state laser-cooling.

Abstract: Vector solitons (VSs), being observed across various fields from optics to Bose-Einstein condensates, are localized structures composed of orthogonal modes bound by nonlinear couplings. Nevertheless, the influence of intermodal linear coupling on the physical properties of this bimodal structure remains to be decently revealed and harnessed. Utilizing an ultrafast fiber laser as a platform, we predict and demonstrate that the linear mode coupling (LMC) induces the deformable VS in terms of the temporal and spectral structures. Weak LMC supports heteronuclear vector solitons built of dissimilar polarization modes, i.e., a single pulse coupled to an orthogonal damped pulse chain. On the other hand, strong LMC facilitates the homonuclear VS composed of polarization modes with similar structures, in the form of soliton compounds featuring caterpillar motions. Our findings reveal new patterns of VSs and open an effective avenue for versatile ultrafast optical sources.

Abstract: The utilization of Kerr nonlinearity in lithium niobate has been extensively investigated over the years. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of Kerr nonlinearity in waveguides has been constrained by the material's inherently low third-order nonlinear coefficients. Here, we present a significant advancement by demonstrating Pockels effect-induced strong Kerr nonlinearity in a periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguide. Both effective four-wave mixing (FWM) and cascaded effective FWM processes are experimentally observed. The induced FWM process achieves a remarkable maximum output power of -8.5 dBm, spanning a wavelength spectrum of over 116.8 nm. Analysis reveals that the induced effective Kerr nonlinearity exhibits a substantial effective nonlinear refractive index as $2.9\times 10^{-15} m^{2}W^{-1}$, corresponding to an effective nonlinear refractive index enhancement factor of $1.6\times 10^{4}$ relative to the intrinsic value. Moreover, a wavelength-converting experiment demonstrates a flat optic-to-optic response over a broadband radiofrequency spectrum, confirming that signal integrity is well preserved after on-chip effective FWM conversion. Therefore, the demonstrated efficient and broadband Pockels effect induced effective Kerr nonlinearity paves the way for novel applications in diverse fields, including spectroscopy, parametric amplification, quantum correlation studies, and wavelength conversion technologies.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue in physics-inspired reservoir computing by effectively utilizing semiconductor optical amplifier microring resonators to create deep photonic reservoir computing systems with high performance and scalability.

Abstract: Reservoir computing, renowned for its low training cost, has emerged as a promising lightweight paradigm for efficient spatiotemporal processing,it remains challenging to realize deep photonic reservoir computing (DPRC) systems, due to the lack of scalable on-chip nonlinearity. Here, we introduce a versatile time delayed DPRC framework that natively supports deep and concurrent spatiotemporal processing entirely in the optical domain. At its core, the system leverages free carrier dynamics in silicon microring resonators to provide the fundamental nonlinearity and short term memory, and these nonlinear nodes are interconnected through true time delay lines that establish shared long-term memory. Benefiting from intrinsic physical nonlinearity and multi-timescale fading memory, this simple yet effective architecture demonstrates remarkable high dimensional representation capabilities. On the NTU RGB D benchmark, the parameter efficient DPRC system achieves superior action recognition accuracies compared to mainstream deep learning models, while requiring only a single shot regression training procedure. We further verify a prototype DPRC chip that excels across diverse dataset classification and time series prediction tasks. It enables a streamlined all optical pipeline between hierarchical layers, delivering a consistent computational density of 334.25 TOPs/mm2, independent of the reservoir depth and three orders of magnitude higher than conventional approaches. Moreover, its performance scales with near-zero hardware overhead by utilizing additional wavelength channels. This DPRC network is highly scalable on a silicon photonic platform, with flexible extension to hundreds of deep reservoir layers and parallel channels, paving the way toward intelligent optoelectronic systems for advanced real time processing and parallel decision making.

Abstract: High quality (Q) factor optical chiral resonators are indispensable for many chiral photonic devices. Designing ultrahigh Q-factors in chiral metasurfaces traditionally relies on extensive parameter scanning, which is time-consuming and inefficient. While deep learning now provides a rapid design alternative, conventional models still face challenges in accurately predicting ultrahigh Q-factor spectral characteristics. In this study, we introduce a multi-head attention network (MuHAN) to accelerate the design of ultrahigh Q-factor optical chiral resonators in bilayer metasurfaces. MuHAN achieves forward spectral predictions in approximately 10ms, thousands of times faster than finite-difference time-domain simulations, boasting 99.85% and 99.9% accuracy for forward and inverse predictions, respectively. By transferring the learned physical principles, we perform inverse design of nanoscale structures with ultrahigh Q-factors (up to 2.9910E5) based on chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) at minimal computational cost. Our rapid design tool, based on MuHAN, enables high-performance encryption imaging, bridging deep learning with high-Q chiral metasurfaces for advanced sensing, laser, and detection applications.

Abstract: In the pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei, a laterally attached flagellum drives rapid deformation of the complex cell body, producing puzzling dynamics. High-speed defocusing imaging reveals that surface points trace flower-like patterns in transverse planes. The petals arise from clockwise flagellar beating, which generates a right-handed helical wave propagating from the anterior tip along the body, advancing the cell like a twisted corkscrew. The central lobes result from slower counterclockwise body rotation required to balance the active torque. The bent cell shape underneath the flagellum superimposes these two chiral motions at different radial distances, producing the observed patterns. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the method of regularized Stokeslets reproduce these dynamics and show that bent cell shape enhances swimming, suggesting an adaptive advantage of T. brucei's morphology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In complex systems, groups of interacting objects may form prevalent and persistent spatiotemporal patterns, which we refer to as motifs. These motifs can exhibit features that reveal how individual objects interact with one another. Simultaneously, the motifs can also interact, causing new coarse-grained properties to emerge in the system.
  In this paper, we found motifs in a simulated system of Dynamically Self-Organising cells. We also found that quantifying these motifs with a set of physically interpretable structural and dynamic features efficiently captures the interaction dynamics of the motifs' underlying cells. Using these motif features, we revealed packing strain and defects in large compact aggregates, semi-periodicity in motif ensembles, and phase space classes with unsupervised machine learning. Additionally, we trained neural networks to infer the critical hidden microscopic interaction parameters within each motif from coarse-grained motif features extracted from snapshots of the system. Furthermore, we uncovered emergent features that can predict the movement of cell collectives by hierarchically coarse-graining smaller motifs into larger ones (e.g. motif clusters). We speculate that this concept of motif hierarchies may be applied broadly to many-body interacting systems that are otherwise too complex to understand.

Our findings constrain theories of motor control and establish a link between microscopic motor noise and mesoscopic non-equilibrium dynamics.
