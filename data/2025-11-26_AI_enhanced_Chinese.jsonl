This unified functionality moves well beyond reciprocity-breaking mechanisms, marking a fundamental transition from static media to polychromatic, energy-efficient wave processors. This article establishes dispersion engineering as the core design paradigm for these dynamic systems. We show that the dispersion relation, linking frequency and wavenumber, serves as a master blueprint governing exotic wave phenomena such as nonreciprocity, beam splitting, asymmetric frequency conversion, amplification, spatial decomposition, and momentum bandgaps. By analyzing analytical dispersion surfaces and isofrequency contours in subluminal, luminal, and superluminal modulation regimes, we reveal how tailored spatiotemporal modulation orchestrates controlled energy flow among harmonic modes. We further demonstrate how this framework directly informs practical device operation, highlighting advanced implementations including angular-frequency beam multiplexing in superconducting Josephson junction arrays.

The positional stability of the trapped particle is pivotal to system performance, directly setting the measurement noise floor and operational precision. In this work, we observe bistability and hysteresis in the axial equilibrium position of a 10-um diameter SiO2 microsphere. This bistability arises from optical interference between the fiber ends and the microsphere, creating multiple potential wells. Experimental results demonstrate that the microsphere's transition rate can be effectively modulated through precise control of the trapping laser power. Furthermore, the incorporation of transverse misalignment has effectively eradicated bistability, thereby substantially improving positional stability throughout the entire optical trapping region. This suppression successfully reduced the system's residual positional uncertainty to the thermal noise limit.

The scheme works in the frequency domain (using phasors) and couples the oscillatory Stokes equation with rigid or flexible structures, modeled by viscoelastic networks of immersed boundary kernels. The fluid-structure coupling can be solved by two routes. One route calculates the hydrodynamic mobility matrix required to solve the equation for the structure deformation rate in matrix form. The second route iteratively solves the coupled fluid-structure equations: fluid-induced forces on the structures create a tension field which is then transferred to the fluid, until convergence. The resulting fixed-point problem is solved iteratively using the Anderson acceleration method. The mobility route is optimal when dealing with one or few structures, while the iterative scheme is preferred for denser dispersions. In any case, the flow resulting from the body forces is solved by a recently developed scheme [J. Fluid. Mech. 1010 A57, 2025] which is spectral in space and time and deals with doubly periodic open domains (either free-space or wall-bounded) where meshing is restricted to the region of interest around the structures.

ANSYS Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate the clamping design to minimize the deflection of the core post welding of the tie bars. The water-cooled, single turn coil, which shapes the magnetic field by acting as the pole tips, is critical for the integrated field homogeneity. The coil manufacturing tolerances and fabrication techniques were evaluated to ensure the magnetic properties of the magnet could be obtained.

In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Achieving reliable fabrication of pristine, high-quality two-dimensional layers suitable for atomic-scale spectroscopy remains a central experimental challenge in uncovering their emergent quantum states and realizing device-relevant functionalities. Atomically resolved scanning probe microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy reveal a strong correlation between Raman intensity and film thickness, enabling rapid identification of (Bi\\textsubscript{0.1}Sb\\textsubscript{0.9})\\textsubscript{2}Te\\textsubscript{3} flakes with desired thickness. High resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy on exfoliated flakes with atomically flat terraces reveals QWS, driven by quantum confinement of Dirac electrons. This effect is rarely observed due to the electrons resistance to electrostatic confinement caused by Klein tunneling. The standard phase accumulation model accurately captures the characteristics of QWS and extracts the electronic band dispersion, showing excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations. Band structure calculation reveals that with increasing quantum-layer thickness, the interlayer coupling enhances the electronic dispersion, progressively reducing subband splitting and giving rise to bulk-like continuous bands. Spatially resolved spectroscopy around surface defects further confirms that QWS of Dirac electrons in topological insulators remains robust against defect scattering. This work paves the way for exploring diverse quantum phenomena and device applications through quantum confinement, surface-state engineering, and tunable topological phases.", "AI": {"tldr":

Numerical simulations show that a single periodic row of inclined long-slits near a free surface enables high-efficiency broadband conversion, where the conversion rate exceeds 0.8 across a normalized-frequency range of 0.27 to 0.74, corresponding to a 93.1% relative bandwidth.

Theoretical studies have shown that ratchet-based ion pumps (RBIPs) can separate ions with the same charge and valance by driving them in opposite directions according to their diffusion coefficients. This process relies on frequency dependent current reversal, a unique feature of ratchets in which the particle current direction is inverted with the input signal frequency. Previous experimental demonstrations of RBIPs achieved ion pumping against electrostatic forces and water deionization, but lacked frequency-dependent current reversal and control of the asymmetry of the device. Here, we report the first experimental realization of these key functionalities by driving RBIPs with a bipotentiostat. Complementary input signals applied to RBIP contacts unlock a flashing ratchet-like behavior, and enhances the device performance by an order of magnitude compared to the prior floating-drive approach. The enhanced control of the electrostatic potential at the RBIP surfaces leads to frequency dependent current reversals, and the addition of a potential offset to the input signal enables tuning the amplitude asymmetry of the device. This flashing ratchet functionality provides a significant step towards the realization of ratchet driven selective ion separation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e flashing ratchet \u7684\u540c\u7535\u8377\u79bb\u5b50\u5206\u9009\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u52bf\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u5b50\u5206\u9009\u5728\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u56de\u6536\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u56de\u6536\u548c\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u5904\u7406\u7b49Field\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u7535\u8377\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u9009\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76ratchet\u57faApparatus\uff08RBIPs\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7528\u4e86bipotentiostat\u9a71\u52a8\u7684ratchet\u57fa\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u4e92\u8865\u7535\u4f4d\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86flashing ratchet\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u9009\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6d6e\u70b9\u7535Apparatus\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u88c5\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5341\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7535\u6d41\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u7535\u4f4d\u504f\u7f6e\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u540c\u7535\u8377\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u9009\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c pave\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8be5\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u7535\u8377\u79bb\u5b50\u5206\u9009\u3002"}}

We don't understand its quantum origin but we associate it with the actual acceleration of the universe because it is the simplest description we had until recently of the present cosmological observations. However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $\u039b$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $\u039b$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explains the concept of explaining the cosmological constant's nature through the holographic principle.

The baseline implementation of the X-Arapuca concept for the FD-HD PDS module is close to the DUNE requirements as demonstrated in the collaborations laboratory testing. However, an increased performance would provide a safety margin for a detector planned to be operated for 30 years, without possibility of performing maintenance.

The already proven Milano-Bicocca setup has been utilized to test different PDS module configurations comparing them to the original baseline.

By measuring the $D_1$ transition energies in Na- and Mg-like charge states of Lu and Yb confined in the Tokyo electron-beam ion trap, we extract meV-level energy shifts that are directly sensitive to nuclear-size effects. Transition-energy differences obtained from these spectra are compared with state-of-the-art relativistic many-body perturbation theory, including a new treatment of Mg-like ions. We develop a generalized framework to propagate uncertainties arising from nuclear deformation and surface diffuseness and evaluate corresponding nuclear-sensitivity coefficients. Combining Na- and Mg-like results yields mutually consistent radius differences, demonstrating the robustness of both the experimental calibration and the theoretical predictions. To determine absolute isotopic radii, we perform a generalized least-squares optimization incorporating our HCI constraints together with optical-isotope-shift data and muonic-atom results. This analysis establishes that the $^{175}$Lu charge radius is smaller than that of $^{174}$Yb, restoring the expected odd-even staggering across the $N=94$ isotonic chain. Our recommended value, $R(^{175}\\text{Lu}) = 5.291(11)$ fm, reduces the uncertainty of the Lu radius by a factor of three compared with the previous electron-scattering result and resolves a long-standing anomaly in rare-earth nuclear systematics.

This work introduces an ASAL-inspired agent-based framework that simulates bioelectric state transitions in glial cells as a function of mitochondrial efficiency (Meff), ion-channel conductances, gap-junction coupling, and ROS dynamics. Using a 64x64 multicellular grid over 60,000 simulation steps, we show that reducing Meff below a critical threshold (~0.6) drives sustained depolarization, ATP collapse, and elevated ROS, reproducing key electrophysiological signatures associated with GBM. We further apply evolutionary optimization (genetic algorithms and MAP-Elites) to explore resilience, parameter sensitivity, and the emergence of tumor-like attractors. Early evolutionary runs converge toward depolarized, ROS-dominated regimes characterized by weakened electrical coupling and altered ionic transport.

Here we consider the localizable class CI in 3D, and numerically investigate the stability of surface states. We demonstrate that surface states of a bulk class-CI topological lattice model are fragile in that they can be Anderson localized by the combination of weak quenched randomness and hybridization with an additional trivial 2D band (a trivializing proximity effect, TPE). With the TPE, stronger disorder is more destructive to the surface states of the bulk lattice model. By contrast, without additional bands the surface states remain extended, exhibiting robust spectrum-wide quantum criticality. We also investigate the fragility of surface states in effective 2D class-CI continuum Dirac theories, including the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene. Although the continuum models exhibit signs of Anderson localization near gap edges for weak disorder, stronger disorder instead appears to heal the surface, restoring criticality whilst filling in spectral energy gaps.

Lorentz violation modifies the oscillation and damping rates in a unified manner across all perturbative sectors: the real part of the QNM frequency increases monotonically with the Lorentz-violating parameter $\\ell$, while the imaginary part becomes more negative. Axial gravitational modes exhibit the strongest response, revealing an intrinsic theoretical bound $\\ell< 0.5$, beyond which the spectrum approaches an extremal behavior. Our results highlight the potential of gravitational-wave spectroscopy to probe Lorentz-violating signatures in KR gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u5f00\u5c14\u6587-ralston\uff08KR\uff09\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\u6807\u91cf\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u548c\u8f74\u5f15\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u62df\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u53cd\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u632f\u8361\u548c\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8f74\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6781\u7aef\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8c31scopy\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u9488\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u53cd\u6807\u5fd7\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u53cd\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u5206\u5f0f\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u62df\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u8c31\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u53cd\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u4f7f\u5b9e\u9891\u504f\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u865a\u9891\u66f4\u8d1f\uff1b\u8f74\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53cd\u5e94\u6700\u5f3a\u70c8\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u754c\u2113<0.5\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u884c\u4e3a\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8fdd\u53cd\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4KR\u91cd\u529b\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Using 855, 600, and 300~MeV electron beams at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI), we explored orientational coherent effects and particle dynamics in a 15~$\u03bc$m-thick crystal bent along the (111) planes. Combined experimental and simulation analyses enabled the classification and quantitative assessment of the contributions from channeling, dechanneling, rechanneling, and volume capture to both beam deflection and radiation emission. Crystal steering remained effective even at 300~MeV, with measured channeling efficiencies exceeding 50\\%, a record at such low energy. Channeling and volume reflection enhanced radiation emission by up to a factor of six compared to the misaligned orientation, highlighting strong orientational coherence effects in the sub-GeV regime. These findings confirm the feasibility of using bent crystals for efficient beam manipulation and high-intensity photon generation at low energies, supporting the development of novel light sources and beam control strategies at accelerator facilities operating in this energy range.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f4e\u80fd\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u5f2f\u66f2\u7845\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u675f\u6d41\u504f\u8f6c\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728300~MeV\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\uff0c\u5f2f\u66f2\u6676\u4f53\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u504f\u8f6c\u675f\u6d41\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u675f\u6d41\u504f\u8f6c\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u675f\u6d41\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5176\u7279\u6027\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5149\u5728\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5229\u7528855\u3001600\u548c300~500MeV\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u5728MAMI\u4e3b\u5b50\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u4f5c15\u03bcm\u539a\u7684\u6676\u4f53\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f2f\u6298\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u4f4d\u673a\u7406\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u80fd\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u3001\u675f\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728300~MeV\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u6676\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u675f\u6d41\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u501f\u52a9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u52a8\u80fd\u53d1\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5982\u80fd\u5c42\u3001\u6269\u6563\u3001\u91cd\u53e0\u7b49\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5f2f\u66f2\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6210\u80fd\u7387\u662f\u65e0\u5f2f\u6676\u4f53\u768450%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5782\u76f4\u53cd\u5c04\u5728\u5149\u8f90\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e00\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5f2f\u66f2\u6676\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u675f\u6d41\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u5149\u5b50\u6295\u5c04\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u5149\u5b50\u6e90\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Comparing the experimental results with simulations from finite-difference time-domain and rigorous coupled-wave analysis, we highlight the limitations of these theoretical predictions and underscore the utility of an experimentally established library of building blocks.

Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${\\cal Z}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In CrX$_3$ systems, the nonlinear coefficients dominate, while the linear responses vanish due to time-reversal symmetry.

While model hubs and categorisation efforts have emerged in recent years, it remains difficult to consistently discover, compare, and apply these models across diverse scenarios. The field still lacks a standardised and comprehensive framework for evaluating MLIP performance. We introduce MLIPAudit, an open, curated and modular benchmarking suite designed to assess the accuracy of MLIP models across a variety of application tasks. MLIPAudit offers a diverse collection of benchmark systems, including small organic compounds, molecular liquids, proteins and flexible peptides, along with pre-computed results for a range of pre-trained and published models. MLIPAudit also provides tools for users to evaluate their models using the same standardised pipeline. A continuously updated leaderboard tracks performance across benchmarks, enabling direct comparison on downstream tasks. By providing a unified, transparent reference framework for model validation and comparison, MLIPAudit aims to foster reproducibility, transparency, and community-driven progress in the development of MLIPs for complex molecular systems. In order to illustrate the use of the library, we present some benchmarks run on a series of internal models, along with publicly available ones (UMA-Small, MACE-OFF, MACE-MP). The library is available on GitHub at https://github.com/instadeepai/mlipaudit, on PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/mlipaudit/ under the Apache License 2.0, and the leaderboard can be accessed on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/spaces/InstaDeepAI/mlipaudit-leaderboard.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLIP\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u53ca\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86MLIPAudit\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30MLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002MLIPAudit\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6392\u884c\u699c\u968f\u66f4\u65b0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dMLIP\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u8be5\u5e93\u5728GitHub\u548cPyPI\u4e0a\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u6392\u884c\u699c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u52bf\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5584\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u540d\u4e3aMLIPAudit\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u673a\u5316\u5408\u7269\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u53ca\u53ef\u7f29\u6298\u80bd\uff1b2) \u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53d1\u8868\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b3) \u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff1b4) \u5728\u7ebf\u6392\u884c\u699c\u4ee5\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982UMA-Small\u3001MACE-OFF\u548cMACE-MP\uff09\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cMLIPAudit\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u5e93\u53ca\u5176\u6392\u884c\u699c\u5747\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86MLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "MLIPAudit\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86MLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, performing absorption spectroscopy on individual molecules is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we report on a nondestructive absorption spectroscopy on a mid-infrared vibrational transition in a single molecular ion that is co-trapped with an atomic ion. The absorption of a single photon is detected via the momentum transfer from the absorbed photon onto the molecule. This recoil signal is amplified using a non-classical state of motion of the two-ion crystal and subsequently read out via the atomic ion. We characterize the recoil detection method and use it to investigate the interaction between femtosecond laser pulses and the O-H stretching vibration in individual CaOH+ molecular ions. Furthermore, we present the single-photon absorption spectrum obtained for the vibrational transition. This method represents a milestone towards quantum non-demolition measurements of complex polyatomic molecules, providing high-fidelity methods for preparation and measurement of the quantum state of a wide range of molecular species.", "AI": {"tldr": "Single-molecule absorption spectroscopy revisited using a non-classical state of motion to amplify the recoil signal caused by photon absorption.", "motivation": "Understanding single-molecule spectroscopy techniques could provide deeper insights into molecular structures and dynamics in fields like quantum mechanics and molecular physics.", "method": "The researchers employ a non-classical state of motion of a two-ion crystal to amplify the recoil signal from photon absorption, enabling single-molecule detection.", "result": "They successfully observed the absorption spectrum of the O-H stretch vibration in individual CaOH+ molecular ions, opening new avenues for Quantum Non-Demolition measurements.", "conclusion": "This work signifies a substantial step forward in quantum measurement techniques, offering high-fidelity spectroscopy for complex molecules with potential applications in quantum information science."}}

Although the model applies to NV centre in diamond, it can be applied with small modifications to other semiconducting solid state qubits. In our model, we include the drift and collection of charge carriers as well as the presence of other defects via generation and recombination dynamics. Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated. On this basis, we determine an optimal parameter space for qubit operations, including the highest spin contrast and especially relate those to NS presence.

In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\\lesssim r\\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered.

Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration.

Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,\u03c9)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,\u03c4)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,\u03c9)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=\u03c0$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation.

We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state.

Building on the effective-one-body model TEOBResumS-Dal\u00ed, we introduce parametrized deviations from GR both in the inspiral and the merger-ringdown regimes. We validate the model via parameter estimation of synthetic signals, including from numerical relativity simulations of BBHs and a boson star binary.

We find no significant statistical evidence in favor of deviations from GR. Consistent with previous works, we infer a mild preference for longer remnant quasi-normal mode damping times than expected in GR, though the limited sample and potential systematics reduce its significance. In addition, when weighting by signal strength, joint posteriors combining the individual events are still compatible with GR.

The Kitaev model has become a cornerstone of quantum magnetism due to its quantum spin liquid ground state and rich phase diagram. The Kitaev model has also been treated in the monitored circuit setting, giving rise to topological area-law and critical-law entanglement entropy phases. In this article, we study the evolution of its phase diagram under the addition of new terms, motivated by their effects in the Kitaev model. We find that a single-qubit term, analogous to a magnetic field, leads to a trivial state in the high field limit, but with an additional intermediate volume-law phase. A three-qubit operator that commutes with the flux operators has the opposite effect: it stabilizes the critical-law phase against the short ranged area-law entanglement. We also employ a four-qubit plaquette commuting operator that simultaneously measures two opposite identical-type bonds on a plaquette. This generates a distinct volume-law phase and preserves the plaquette fluxes and associated topological order, yielding extensive entanglement while coexisting with the topological memory characteristic of the area-law phase. We quantitatively locate phase boundaries using stabilizer (Clifford) simulations together with tripartite mutual information and entanglement entropy measures.

This phenomenon, most significant for Wd less than 400 um, directly influences the onset of magnetic field required for quantization. Fermi velocity measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) analysis indicate that band structure modifications and electron-electron interactions underlie this size dependence.

Using channel-state duality, we show that the steady state of a $d$-dimensional quantum channel is holographically mapped to the boundary reduced density matrix of a $(d+1)$-dimensional wavefunction generated by a sequential unitary circuit. From this perspective, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in the steady state arises from the anyon condensation on the boundary of a topological order in one higher dimension. The conditional mutual information (CMI) associated with SWSSB is then inherited from the bulk topological entanglement entropy. We make this duality explicit using isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) by identifying the channel's time evolution with the transfer matrix of a higher-dimensional isoTNS.

Current PTA analyses generally assume circular binaries; however, dynamical interactions with the surrounding environment can prevent complete circularisation, allowing SMBHBs to retain appreciable eccentricities. In this work, we present a gravitational waveform model for eccentric binaries based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, designed for continuous GW searches in PTA data. The model is accurate up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order for the conservative dynamics and up to post-leading order for the radiation-reaction terms. We provide both a numerically precise and a computationally efficient approximate implementation and evaluate the latter's accuracy against the full model over a broad range of eccentricities and initial orbital frequencies. Our results show that a substantial region of the parameter space exhibits pronounced orbital evolution, much stronger than in the circular case. We demonstrate the rich harmonic structure of timing residuals induced by eccentric GWs. Properly characterising eccentric binaries is an essential step toward detecting GWs in PTA data and interpreting the results, ultimately improving our understanding of the supermassive black hole population in the local Universe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5fc3\u7684\u53cc\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08SMBHB\uff09\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u4e00\u9636\u4f53\uff08EOB\uff09 formalism\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8ePTA\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8c\u9636\u540e\u725b\u987f\uff082PN\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u5ea6\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u8f68\u9053\u9891\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u504f\u5fc3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5bf9\u8ba1\u65f6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8c10\u6ce2\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6b63\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5fc3\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u662f\u63a2\u6d4bPTA\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e76\u89e3\u8bfb\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u5b87\u5b99\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e00\u9636\u4f53\uff08EOB\uff09 formalism\uff0c\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u540e\u725b\u987f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u504f\u5fc3\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u5728PTA\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f85\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u504f\u5fc3\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u662f\u672a\u6765\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8be5\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u603b\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this context, equation-of-state-insensitive or ``quasi-universal'' relations between key observables, such as the compactness, dimensionless static tidal deformability, and moment of inertia, play a crucial role in connecting different measurable observables while minimizing uncertainties due to the yet unknown equation of state. In this work, we identify new quasi-universal relations between the static, dimensionless tidal deformability ($\u039b^{(0)}$) and its leading-order dynamical correction ($\u039b^{(2)}$), as well as a combination of these parameters ($\\sqrt{\u039b^{(0)}/\u039b^{(2)}} \\equiv M\u03c9_*$), obtained from the small-frequency expansion of the relativistic tidal response. We test these relations across a representative set of 63 equations of state, finding that the equation-of-state dependence does not exceed $\\sim 5\\%$ for the $\u039b^{(0)}$-$\u039b^{(2)}$ relation and $\\sim 2.5\\%$ for the $\u039b^{(0)}$-$M\u03c9_*$ relation. This indicates a high degree of universality and offers a simplified framework for incorporating dynamical tidal effects into gravitational-wave modeling. Furthermore, we compare the fully dynamical tidal response against different recent strategies (a Taylor expansion and an effective-one-mode approximation) to model the dynamical tide. We find that both models are capable of capturing the frequency-dependent behavior of the fully dynamical tidal deformability, with the Taylor expansion outperforming the effective-one-mode approximation in most of the parameter space.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper describes quasi-universal relations between tidal deformability parameters from neutron star equations of state, with evidence of reduced dependence on the equation of state.

The $\textit{\u039b}^{(0)}$-$\textit{\u039b}^{(2)}$ relation has a dependence on the equation of state below ~5%, while the $\textit{\u039b}^{(0)}$-$\textit{M\u03c9}_\textit{*}$ relation has a dependence below ~2.5%.

Our results are markedly different from the spacelike case. On a spacelike surface, electric and magnetic fluxes each form a commuting subalgebra. This implies that the holonomies commute. On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state.

The success of octave-spanning optical frequency combs in down-converting ultrastable optical frequency references has motivated the development of compact, robust and highly manufacturable optical systems that maintain the ultralow microwave phase noise of their tabletop counterparts. Two-point optical frequency division using chip-scale components and ~1 THz-spanning microcombs has been quite successful, but with stringent requirements on the comb source's free-running noise and feedback control dynamics. Here we introduce a major simplification of this architecture that replaces feedback control of the frequency comb in favor of electronic feedforward noise cancelation that significantly relaxes the comb requirements. Demonstrated with both a high repetition rate solid-state mode-locked laser and a microcomb, feedforward on a 10 GHz carrier results in more robust operation with phase noise as low as -153 dBc/Hz at offsets >10 kHz, femtosecond timing jitter, and elimination of the large \"servo bump\" noise increase at high offset frequency.

Implementing solid-state qubits in bilayer graphene requires a fundamental understanding of such confined electronic systems.

Here we report on the spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots, using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques that offer substantially improved energy resolution compared to standard transport techniques. Measurements using a superconducting high-impedance resonator capacitively coupled to the double quantum dot reveal dispersive features of two and three electron states, enabling the detection of Pauli spin and valley blockade and the characterization of the spin-orbit gap at zero magnetic field. The results deepen our understanding of few-carrier spin and valley states in bilayer graphene quantum dots and demonstrate that cQED techniques are a powerful state-selective probe for semiconductor nanostructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u8def\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08cQED\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5728\u53cc\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5c11\u6570\u8f7d\u8d39\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u548c\u4e09\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u8272\u6563\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4e86\u5e15uli\u81ea\u65cb blockade\u548c\u96f6\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u80fd\u9699\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50 dots\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8c03\u63a7\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u6676\u683c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u638c\u63e1\u5c11\u6570\u8f7d\u8d39\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7535\u8def\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u5bfc\u9ad8\u963b\u6297\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u4e0e\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7535\u5bb9\u6027\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c11\u6570\u8f7d\u8d39\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u8272\u6563\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u6676\u683c\u9501\u5b9a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u78c1\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53cc\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u4e2d\u4e24\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684Self-Kerr\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e09\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51faNoKerr\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5e15uli\u81ea\u65cb blockade\u88ab\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u6d4b\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u80fd\u9699\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u4e2d\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u8f7d\u8d39\u5b50\u6001\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86cQED\u6280\u672f\u5728\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5c11\u6570\u8f7d\u8d39\u5b50\u6001\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86cQED\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u7814\u7a76\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Persistent microseisms in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band couple into the instruments, degrade lock stability, and contribute substantially to detector downtime during observing runs. The multi-stage seismic isolation system has achieved remarkable success in mitigating such disturbances through active feedback control, yet residual platform motion remains a key factor limiting low-frequency sensitivity and duty cycle. Further reduction of this residual motion is therefore critical for improving the long-term stability and overall astrophysical reach of the observatories.\n  In this work, we develop a data-driven approach that uses machine learning to model and suppress residual seismic motion within the isolation system. Ground and platform sensor data from the detectors are used to train a neural network that predicts platform motion driven by microseismic activity. When incorporated into the control scheme, the network's predictions yield up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in residual motion compared to conventional linear filtering methods, revealing that nonlinear couplings play a significant role in limiting current isolation performance. These results demonstrate that machine-learning-based control can provide a powerful new pathway for enhancing active seismic isolation, improving lock robustness, and extending the low-frequency observational capabilities of gravitational-wave detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u4eea\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u5730\u9762\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6291\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5ef6\u957f\u63a2\u6d4b\u4eea\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c2\u5bdf\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e5f\u5728\u9891\u8c31\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u4e0d\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u5730\u9707\u9694\u632f\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u632f\u6d4b\u4eea\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6291\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u6b8b\u4f59\u8fd0\u52a8\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u7ebf\u6027\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5341\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u9694\u632f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 active \u9694\u632f\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u89c2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A popular transformation step in this pipeline involves the quadratization of higher-order binary optimization problems, translating them into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations through the introduction of auxiliary variables. Conventional algorithms for the selection of auxiliary variables often aim to minimize the total number of required variables without taking the constraints of the underlying quantum computer-in particular, the connectivity of its qubits-into consideration. This quickly results in interaction graphs that are incompatible with the target device, resulting in a substantial compilation overhead even with highly optimized compilers. To address this issue, this work presents a novel approach for the selection of auxiliary variables tailored for architectures with limited connectivity. By specifically constructing an interaction graph with a regular structure and a limited maximal degree of vertices, we find a way to construct QAOA circuits that can be mapped efficiently to a variety of architectures. We show that, compared to circuits constructed from a QUBO formulation using conventional auxiliary selection methods, the proposed approach reduces the circuit depth by almost 40%.

Of special interest are photonic circuits employing microwave capacitors, which instantaneously modulate photonic waveguides with frequency $\u03c9_p \\ll \u03c9_0$. While the amplification of light is negligible in such circuits, ideally, frequency conversion can be completed with the conservation of the light amplitude. Therefore, similar to the elastically transparent photonic structures (i.e., structures conserving both the light amplitude and frequency), we can say that a photonic circuit parametrically modulated in time exhibits complete inelastic transparency if a wave enters the structure with frequency $\u03c9_0$ and exits it with a different frequency and the same amplitude. Here, we develop an approach that allows us to introduce and investigate a broad class of time-modulated photonic circuits exhibiting complete inelastic transparency.

In particular, we study quantum geometry-driven second and third order non-linear responses in a time-reversal symmetric Dirac semimetal that can host single, double and line nodes depending on the model parameters. We find that the second-order Hall response (SOHE), which originates from the Berry curvature dipole, is enhanced in the single-node semimetallic phase as compared to the double node case when inversion symmetry is broken. In contrast, the SOHE vanishes in the nodal line semimetal as the inversion symmetry retains. Notably, the third-order Hall response due to Berry connection polarizabilty becomes much larger in the line-node Dirac semimetal, especially when the Fermi energy lies near the band edge, than in the single- and double-node Dirac semimetals.

Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges. Our findings identify external unitary control as a universal resource for precision metrology and pave the way for future implementations in quantum sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5e7a\u6b63\u64cd\u4f5c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 regimen\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6e29\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u6216\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9a71\u52a8\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u65bd\u52a0\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5e7a\u6b63\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u5947\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8c\u6b21\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65bd\u52a0\u5916\u90e8\u7684\u5e7a\u6b63\u63a7\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6 metrology \u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We present several concrete counter-examples of bi-scalar correlators given by sums of Feynman graphs and of bi-scalar graphs with octagon-shaped loops.

Several distinct chain architectures have been developed for this purpose. Here, we report a zigzag superlattice, containing two staggered sub-lattices, that supports multiple edge states, including higher-order modes. In such lattices, the intra- and intercell coupling is imbalanced by the tunneling effect of the eigenstates or deformation of the higher-order modes. We demonstrate that by arranging the zigzag superlattice into a curved shape, some of the edge states transition into bulk states as the curvature of the lattice increases, while some bulk states become more localized towards edge states. The reason is that a curved superlattice strengthens the intra-lattice coupling of the inner sub-lattice due to the separation reduction of the potential wells. %which, on the one hand, hinders the tunneling of the eigenstate to the outer sub-lattice and hence weakens the edge states formed in the inner sub-lattice. On the other hand, it can isolate more edge states formed in the outer sub-lattice, because of the induced more intensive deformation of the higher-order modes in the inner sub-lattice. We also show that some bulk states at larger curvatures can be transformed into edge states by a repulsive nonlinearity, which also enables the coexistence of different edge states. As a specific and ideal platform for realizing such topological superlattices we explore exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities with their strong nonlinearity and possibility for optical excitation and control.

Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic \"exceptional-point fan\" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing.

Using the Einstein's field equations in metric $f(R)$ gravity we model solutions for both wormhole as well as $f(R)$ gravity. We obtain four different wormhole models, two wormholes are characterised by solid angle deficit, three are not asymptotically extendible, while one is asymptotically flat with zero tidal force. These are supported by four different power law $f(R)$ models. The parameter space of the models can support both null energy conditions (NEC) satisfying as well as violating wormhole. In case of NEC satisfying matter, the associated $f(R)$ is ghost. The $f(R)$ models obtained have been independently substantiated for cosmological feasibility and valid parameter space was obtained corresponding to cosmologically viable $f(R)$. Suitable scalar-tensor representation of the corresponding $f(R)$ models have been presented using the correspondence of $f(R)$ gravity with Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of gravity. The robustness of the wormhole solutions were further analysed with the BD scalar fields in the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which showed excellent results. Lastly as an independent astrophysical probe for the wormhole we have obtained the location of their photon spheres and have connected them with the Herrera Complexity factor in $f(R).$ Our results show that the relation between the complexity factor and existence of photon spheres remains fundamentally unaltered in $f(R)$ as compared to Einstein's gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u7684$ f(R) $\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5747\u8d28\u83ab\u91cc- sincerely, my apologies, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this.

In this context, the relative entropy admits a closed expression in terms of the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution, whose analytic structure is sensitive to both the mass and the spacetime dimensionality. Prior studies in $(1+1)$ dimensions have shown a monotonic decay of the relative entropy with increasing mass. We extend that analysis to higher dimensions using numerical techniques and elucidate how the interplay between dimensionality and mass controls the behavior of the relative entropy.

Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u5c55\u5f00\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u94fe\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u8f90\u5c04\u6d88\u6563\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u5219\u65e0\u7528\u4e14\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u94fe\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u8f90\u5c04\u6d88\u6563\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728\u539f\u5b50\u94fe\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u8f90\u5c04\u6d88\u6563\u4e2d\uff0c\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u826f\u597d\u30022) \u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65e0\u7528\u4e14\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u5c55\u5f00\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8eab\u3002"}}

Here, we investigate the spin current symmetries produced by GdFeCo ferrimagnet at a fixed concentration and across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point. Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations.

Finally, we discuss the implications of the Noether mass charge for constraining spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking within the framework of Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u5361\u5c14\u6bd4-\u62c9\u83ab\u5c14\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u97e6\u5c14\u5fb7\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u548cNoether\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Noether\u8d28\u91cf\u7535\u8377\u5bf9 spontaneous \u8d39\u7c73\u6d1b\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u7f3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u53ca\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u81ea\u53d1\u7834\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u5361\u5c14\u6bd4-\u62c9\u83ab\u5c14\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u97e6\u5c14\u5fb7\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u7684Noether\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u71b5\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86Noether\u8d28\u91cf\u7535\u8377\u5bf9\u81ea\u53d1\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u7f3a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u7ef4\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14Noether\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u81ea\u53d1\u7834\u7f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u5361\u5c14\u6bd4-\u62c9\u83ab\u5c14\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our findings indicate that while detuning is ineffective in Markovian environments, it emerges as a powerful control parameter in the non-Markovian regime, where environmental memory facilitates long-lived phase coherence. It is shown that adding more auxiliary qubits amplifies this effect by strengthening the collective coupling and enhancing memory, resulting in robust phase locking within the system. Analysis using the Husimi Q-function, synchronization measures, and Arnold tongue structures reveals a detuning-induced enhancement of phase locking, which significantly improves stability compared to the resonance case. These results establish a cooperative control strategy where detuning actively engineers phases, while auxiliary qubits provide the necessary memory for sustained synchronization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cdetuning\u5728Markovian\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975eMarkovian\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u96c6\u4f53\u8026\u5408\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4f7f\u5f97\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\u5b9a\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5728Markovian\u548c\u975eMarkovian\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u503c\u5f97\u63a2\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8026\u5408\u7684\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u96c6\u4f53\u8026\u5408\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "detuning\u5728\u975eMarkovian\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\u5b9a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u96c6\u4f53\u8026\u5408\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7detuning\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u975eMarkovian\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u540c\u6b65\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

From trajectory-eigenstate overlaps, we construct a quasiprobability distribution that characterizes the degree of localization of the trajectories in the Liouvillian eigenbasis. Contrary to the common wisdom that late-time dynamics are governed solely by the steady state and the slowest-decaying modes, we show that trajectories can remain well spread over transient eigenstates deep within the bulk of the Liouvillian spectrum even at late times. We demonstrate this explicitly using numerical simulations of interacting spin chains and bosonic systems. Moreover, we find that the delocalization of the trajectory strongly correlates with the purity of the trajectory-averaged steady state, establishing a further link between the trajectory and ensemble pictures of open quantum dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u6211\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u8d85\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u5176\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u4e0e\u666e\u904d\u89c2\u5ff5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u6001\u548c\u7f13\u6162\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u652f\u914d\uff0c\u4f46\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u5176\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u754c\u5b9a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4ecd\u7136\u5206\u5e03\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u548c\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u6563\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u5747\u6001\u7684\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5408\u7cfb picture of open quantum dynamics\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u4ee3\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u5230\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u8fc7\u6e21\u7279\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5176\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u8d85\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f68\u8ff9-\u7279\u5f81\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6765\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u5176\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u548c\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u754c\u5b9a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ecd\u80fd\u5728\u5176\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u826f\u597d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u6563\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u5747\u6001\u7684\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5408\u7cfb picture\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u5176\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u53d1\u6563\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u754c\u5b9a\u4e3b\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5206\u6563\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magnetic control of the NHSE along line boundaries in two-dimensional single-band lattices. Using a non-Hermitian extension of the anisotropic Harper--Hofstadter model as a representative example, we show that magnetic fields suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal models, whereas skin localization can persist in nonreciprocal systems. The analysis disentangles the interplay of flux, nonreciprocity, and boundary geometry, revealing that magnetic fields mitigate or suppress the NHSE through distinct physical mechanisms -- such as bulk localization via Landau or Anderson physics, or the restoration of effective reciprocity. In particular, the geometry-dependent skin effect in reciprocal systems is found to be fragile against even weak magnetic fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is sensitive to magnetic fields, which can suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal systems while maintaining localization in nonreciprocal systems.", "motivation": "Understanding the influence of gauge fields on NHSE is crucial for applications in transport, sensing, and topological classification.", "method": "A theoretical framework based on the anisotropic Harper-Hofstadter model is developed to study how magnetic fields control NHSE in different systems.", "result": "Magnetic fields can suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal systems and preserve skin localization in nonreciprocal systems by distinct mechanisms such as bulk localization or effective reciprocity restoration.", "conclusion": "The research reveals that magnetic fields have specific mechanisms to control NHSE, which is vital for the design of magnetic-sensing devices and topological states."}}

Here, we explore how shift current (SC) and magnetic ballistic current (MBC) evolve and emerge in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response.", "AI": {"tldr": "Magnetic fields have a profound impact on the bulk photovoltaic effect in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene, with specific responses on the shift current and magnetic ballistic current.", "motivation": "Understanding the effects of magnetic fields on photovoltaic properties is essential for advancing materials in energy conversion and spintronic applications.", "method": "AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene was studied under various magnetic fields to measure shifts in photovoltaic response, focusing on both weak and strong field conditions.", "result": "The shift current (SC) shows a mild field dependence, reaching maximum at mid-level fields, while the magnetic ballistic current (MBC) grows linearly with field strength, particularly at specific photon energies.", "conclusion": "These findings highlight the dual roles of edge states under weak and strong fields, offering a pathway for tuning photovoltaic responses through magnetic control, which is crucial for optimizing energy conversion in bilayer graphene systems."}}

The ringdown of BBH merger, consisting of a series of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), is of particular interest for both the black hole (BH) spectroscopy and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency check. Unlike the QNM frequencies that only depend on the properties of the remnant BH, the excitation amplitudes and phases of QNMs depend on the progenitor system, and calculating them is beyond the perturbative approach. In this paper, by performing self-consistent fully non-linear simulations of BBH merger in shift-symmetric scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity as well as in sGB gravity allowing for scalarization, and extracting the QNM excitation, we explore the possible deviations from GR at the ringdown stage. We numerically verify that the mode frequencies are consistent with the theory prediction, and provide the fitting results of mode amplitudes and phases. We find relatively small changes in the mode excitation, considering that the largest coupling we used in the simulations is close to the limit of loss of hyperbolicity.

In this work, we propose a distinct, intrinsic mechanism for the magnetoelectric effect in quasi-2D magnetic systems that lack spatial inversion symmetry. We demonstrate that in such parity-violating magnets, the stacking order, which id coupled with Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, generates a stacking Berry curvature dipole (SBCD) and a stacking orbital magnetic moment dipole (SOMD). The SBCD and SOMD act as fundamental ingredients of the ME response. As concrete examples, we apply our framework to antiferromagnets such as monolayer Ca(CoN)$_2$ and multilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with stacking magnetic orders. Our results reveal the microscopic orbital origin of the ME effect in antiferromagnetic systems with vanishing net Berry curvature and orbital magnetization, governed by the interplay between layer stacking, Berry curvature, and magnetic order. The SBCD is also identified as the origin of electric-field-induced Hall effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The modification is principally grounded on a multiscalar-metric concept of spacetime endowed with two dynamical structures: a basic metric and a set of the reversible multiscalar fields. The latter ones serve geometrically as exceptional dynamical coordinates among arbitrary kinematical/observer's ones and physically as a kind of gravitational Higgs fields producing possible spontaneous breaking of the symmetry (SSB) of relativity. The effective field theory (EFT) of the extended gravity based on the multiscalar-metric spacetime -- the metagravity -- is discussed and some of its particular realizations beyond GR as SBR are explicated. Physically, SBR results in appearance of massive tensor and scalar gravitons. Some of the emerging consequences, problems and prospects for SBR for future deeper unification of gravity with matter in the context of the relativity and internal symmetries breaking are shortly discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Shrinkage is interpreted as a completely positive trace-preserving process, so attenuation of coefficients is carried out through controlled decoherence rather than nonlinear thresholding. Phase damping and ancilla-driven constructions realize this behavior coherently and show that statistical adaptivity and quantum unitarity can be combined within a single circuit model. The same physical mechanisms that reduce quantum coherence, such as dephasing and amplitude damping, are repurposed as programmable resources for noise suppression. Practical demonstrations implemented with Qiskit illustrate how circuits and channels emulate coefficientwise attenuation, and all examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks in the companion GitHub repository. Encoding schemes for amplitude, phase, and hybrid representations are examined in relation to transform coherence and measurement feasibility, and realizations suited to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are discussed. The work provides a conceptual and experimental link between wavelet-based statistical inference and quantum information processing, and shows how engineered decoherence can act as an operational surrogate for classical shrinkage.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the spacetime overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum computating remains prohibitively large. A critical challenge arises in many quantum algorithms with Clifford + $\\varphi$ compiling, where logical rotation gates $R_{Z_L}(\\varphi)$ serve as essential components. The Eastin-Knill theorem prevents their transversal implementation in quantum error correction codes and necessitating resource-intensive workarounds through T-gate compilation combined with magic state distillation and injection. In this work, we consider error-structure-tailored fault tolerance, where fault-tolerance conditions are analyzed by combining perturbative analysis of realistic dissipative noise processes with the structural properties of stabilizer codes. Based on this framework, we design 1-fault-tolerant continuous-angle rotation gates in stabilizer codes, implemented via dispersive-coupling Hamiltonians. Our approach could circumvent the need for T-gate compilation and distillation, offering a hardware-efficient solution that maintains simplicity, minimizes physical footprint, and requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. Integrating with recent small-angle-state preparation techniques, we can suppress the gate error to $91|\\varphi| p^2$ for small rotation angle (where p denotes the physical error rate). For current achievable hardware parameters ($p=10^{-3}$), this enables reliable execution of over $10^7$ small-angle rotations when $|\\varphi|\\approx 10^{-3}$, meeting the requirements of many near-term quantum applications.

We show that imposing phase-covariance, flip covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency fully determines the structure of the broadcasting map. Within this family, we identify the unique map that minimizes the simulation cost, and we prove that both the simulation cost and the distance to the closest CPTP map are strictly smaller than in the unitary covariant setting.

In contrast, the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) based methods (especially in the Fourier space) are favorable for mid-term/far-term quantum devices. Besides, we apply the methods for benchmark solutions in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and demonstrate great improvements compared to the conventional sampling method for large grid numbers. Equipped with efficient readout methods, we further show that a 2D Burgers' equation can be solved efficiently without using the expensive strategy of linearization. It suggests the potential quantum advantages for some practical applications on mid-term quantum devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses quantum computing's application in solving partial differential equations and introduces efficient readout methods for quantum states.

While an adiabatic transport of atomic qubits guarantees a high fidelity of the state preparation, it requires a long timescale that defies efficient quantum operations. Here, we propose an adaptable and fast bang-bang-bang (BBB) protocol, utilizing a combination of forwardand backward-moving trap potentials, to expedite the coherent state transport. This protocol approaches the quantum speed limit under a harmonic trap potential, surpassing the performance by the forward-moving-only potential protocols. We further showcase the advantage of applying squeezed coherent state evolution under a deeper potential followed by a weaker one, where a design of symmetric squeezing potential transports promotes an even shorter timescale for genuine state preparation.

We numerically construct solutions describing a collapsing distribution of charged matter that either forms a charged black hole or eventually disperses.

These solutions terminate at a critical point, with their charge-to-mass ratio approaching unity from below, and the instability timescale diverging.

We measure the scaling of the dynamical time period of the near threshold solutions and discuss how they are connected in the two regimes.

Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss.

The proposed encoding method leverages the relative phases of three consecutive time bins to encode two bits per signal. The Sagnac loop configuration enables self-compensation for both phase and polarisation drifts, eliminating the need for active stabilisation. However, field deployments are subject to rapid phase fluctuations caused by external vibrations, which can degrade interference visibility.

In contrast, a direct unitary implementation of the ${T}$ gate using the cubic phase gate has been shown to have logical error floor unless the GKP codestate has a biased noise profile [1]. In this work, we propose a method for on-demand noise biasing based on a standard GKP error correction circuit. This on-demand biasing circuit can be used to bias the GKP codestate before a $T$ gate and return it to a non-biased state afterwards. With the on-demand biasing circuit, we prove that the logical error rate of the $T$ gate can be made arbitrarily small as the quality of the GKP codestates increases. We complement our proof with a numerical investigation of the cubic phase gate subject to a phenomenological noise model, showing that the ${T}$ gate can achieve average gate fidelities above $99\\%$ with 12 dB of GKP squeezing without the use of postselection. Moreover, we develop a formalism for finding optimal unitary representations of logical diagonal gates in higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy that is based on a framework of ``polynomial phase stabilizers'' whose exponents are polynomial functions of one of the quadrature operators. This formalism naturally extends to multi-qubit logical gates and even to number-phase bosonic codes, providing a powerful algebraic tool for analyzing non-Clifford gates in bosonic quantum codes.\n  [1] J.

Although widely studied in optical and quantum systems, using them for energy storage in quantum systems has been difficult because existing approaches rely on gain, precise balanced loss, or explicitly non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a quantum energy-storage mechanism that realizes exceptional-point physics in a fully passive, physically consistent open quantum system. Instead of amplification, we use trace-preserving reservoir engineering to create an effective complex interaction between a charging mode and a storage mode through a dissipative mediator, generating an exceptional point directly in the drift matrix of the Heisenberg-Langevin equations while preserving complete positivity. The resulting dynamics exhibit two regimes: a stable phase where the stored energy saturates, and a broken phase where energy grows exponentially under a bounded coherent drive. This rapid charging arises from dissipative interference that greatly boosts energy flow between the modes without gain media or nonlinear amplification. The mechanism is compatible with optomechanical devices, superconducting circuits, and magnonic systems, offering a practical route to fast, robust, and scalable quantum energy-storage technologies and new directions in quantum thermodynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8017\u6563\u4ecb\u8d28\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u6e90\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u653e\u5927\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5e73\u8861\u635f\u8017\u6216\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fian\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8bb8\u591a\u969c\u788d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u9700\u653e\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u8017\u6563\u4ecb\u8d28\uff0c\u5229\u7528 trace-preserving \u7684\u963b\u5c3c\u5668\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7Heisenberg-Langevin\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u590d\u6570\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u9a71\u52a8\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f1a\u9971\u548c\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u4f1a\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53d7\u63a7coh\u00e9rent\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8017\u6563\u5e72\u6d89\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5145\u7535\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f34\u968f\u5149\u653e\u5927\u5668\u6216\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u653e\u5927\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u7535\u8def\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Single-shot error correction aims to suppress errors using only one round of syndrome extraction. However, for most codes, it requires high-weight checks, which significantly degrade, and often eliminate, single-shot performance at the circuit level. In this work, we introduce local single-shot checks, where we impose constraints on check weights. Using a dynamic measurement scheme, we show that the number of required measurement rounds can be reduced by a factor determined by this constraint. As an example, we show through numerical simulation that our scheme can improve decoding performance compared to conventional checks when using sliding-window decoding with a reduced window size under circuit-level noise models for toric codes.

Yet, the challenge of transforming these idealized security models into practical, resilient systems remains a pressing issue, especially as quantum computing evolves. In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature.

Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial $1+x^{\\lceil{m/2}\\rceil}$, a key component of Van Hoof's construction. This asymptotic reduction translates to a factor of 100+ improvement of the $\\cnotgate$ gate counts in the implementation of the multiplication by the constant for parameters $m$ of practical importance. For the GF division, we reduce gate count complexity from $O(m^2 \\log(m))$ to $O(m^2 \\log \\log(m)/\\log(m))$ by selecting irreducible polynomials that enable efficient implementation of both the constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. We demonstrate practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of $m$.

Most previous work on routing in quantum networks assumes utility functions that are isotonic, meaning that the ordering of two paths does not change when extending both with the same edge. However, we show that utility functions that take into account both the rate and quality of the entanglement generation (e.g., the secret-key rate) are often non-isotonic. This makes pathfinding difficult as classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's become unsuitable, with the state of the art for quantum networks being an exhaustive search over all possible paths. In this work we present improved algorithms. First, we present two best-first-search algorithms that use destination-aware merit functions for faster convergence. One of these provably finds the best path, while the other uses heuristics to achieve an effectively sublinear scaling of the query count in the network size while in practice always finding a close-to-optimal path. Second, we present metaheuristic algorithms (simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm) that enable tuning a tradeoff between path quality and computational overhead. While we focus on swap-ASAP quantum repeaters for concreteness, our algorithms are readily generalized to different repeater schemes and models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
