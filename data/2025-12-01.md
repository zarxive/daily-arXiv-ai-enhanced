Motivation: 奇数环游戏的研究旨在通过量子策略提升游戏性能，其平行重复与 foam 问题相关，可能帮助解决更广泛应用的面积最小化问题。

Method: 研究组合了量子策略与平行重复定理，引入了奇数块、误差界、珍珠、一致区域等新概念，形成一种系统化的分析框架来优化 win 概率。

Abstract: We characterize optimality of Quantum strategies for the Odd-Cycle game. Separate from other game-theoretic settings, parallel repetition for the Odd-Cycle game is related to the foam problem, which can be formulated through a minimization of the surface area. In comparison to previous works on minimizing the surface area, we quantify how properties of the marked giant connected component can be related to the maximum winning probability using Quantum strategies. Objects that we introduce to formulate such connections include the topological odd-blocker, previous examples of error bounds for other Quantum games that have been formulated by the author, pearls, consistent regions, and the cycle elimination problem.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that any nonclassicality criterion based on factorial moments, including several higher-order parameters such as the Mandel $Q^{(\ell)}$ parameter, the Lee antibunching function $d^{(\ell-1)}_h$, and the Agarwal--Tara parameter $A_3$, can be computed straightforwardly for photon-subtracted and photon-added states by performing operator reordering of the factorial moments. Within this approach, all relevant quantities depend solely on the normalization constant of the given state.

### [3] [Testing Single Photon Entanglement using Self-Referential Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21819)
*Daniel Kun,Teodor Strömberg,Borivoje Dakić,Philip Walther,Lee A. Rozema*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows a method to demonstrate single-photon nonlocality via joint measurements on two copies of a single-photon entangled state, achieving Bell inequality violation without the need for homodyne measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to avoid potential complexities and loopholes in homodyne measurements to demonstrate nonlocality in quantum systems.

Method: The method involves using joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state where one photon serves as a phase reference for the other, allowing self-referential measurement and avoiding homodyne issues.

Result: The experiment successfully violates Bell inequalities with CHSH parameters of $2.71	ext{±}0.09$ and $2.23	ext{±}0.07$.

Conclusion: This approach provides a novel and more accessible way to prove single-photon nonlocality, which could be extended to various quantum systems and platforms.

Abstract: Entanglement does not always require one particle per party. It was predicted some thirty years ago that a single photon traversing a beam splitter could violate a Bell inequality. Although initially debated, single-photon nonlocality was eventually demonstrated via homodyne measurements. Here, we present an alternate realisation that avoids the complexity of homodyne measurements and potential loopholes in their implementation. We violate a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other, making it self-referential. We observe CHSH parameters of $2.71\pm 0.09$ and $2.23\pm 0.07$, depending on the joint measurements implemented. This offers a new perspective on single-photon nonlocality and a more accessible experimental route, potentially applicable to general mode-entangled states in diverse platforms.

### [4] [No need to calibrate: characterization and compilation for high-fidelity circuit execution using imperfect gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21831)
*Ashish Kakkar,Samuel Marsh,Yulun Wang,Pranav Mundada,Paul Coote,Gavin Hartnett,Michael J. Biercuk,Yuval Baum*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  paper introduces a method for fabricating high-fidelity two-qubit gates on quantum hardware by characterizing and compensating gate parameters in software. This approach allows for improved gate fidelity and reduces the need for extensive fine-tuning of low-level control waveforms. The method enables scaling of expressive gate sets on quantum computing architectures while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  hardware limitations and the need for scalable and high-fidelity quantum computing operations drive the development of this method. Current approaches involve iterative calibration, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and there is a pressing need for more efficient methods that can handle increasing numbers of qubits and gates.

Method:  the method involves characterizing a small number of gate parameters using coherent pulse sequences and compensating for their effects in software through single-qubit rotations. This approach avoids traditional iterative calibration and enables real-time tracking and correction of gate variations during compilation.

Result:  when implemented on IBM's 127-qubit quantum processor, the method significantly improves the success probabilities of quantum Fourier transform circuits and reduces mean-square error in Trotter simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model by factors of up to 7X and 9X, respectively.

Conclusion:  this novel characterization and compilation methodology represents a practical advancement in quantum computing, offering a scalable and efficient solution for generating expressive gate sets with minimal fine-tuning required for low-level control waveforms.

Abstract: We propose and validate on real quantum computing hardware a new method for extended two-qubit gate set design, replacing iterative, fine calibration with fast characterization of a small number of gate parameters which are then tracked and corrected in circuit compilation. Coherent contributions to the pulse unitary that would traditionally be considered sources of error are treated as part of the gate definition, and compensated in software via single-qubit rotations. This approach enables rapid device-wide generation of high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates, which are combined with standard calibrated gates to produce an expanded gate set. We show how these gates are directly usable as part of a quantum compiler, synthesizing generic two-qubit circuit blocks into minimal-duration sequences of the characterized gates interleaved with compensating single-qubit rotations. Benchmarking against circuits compiled using the default $CX$ gate alone on 127-qubit IBM hardware shows up to 7X improvement in success probability for Quantum Fourier Transform circuits up to 26 qubits, and up to 9X lower mean-square error in Trotter simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. Our hardware-agnostic characterization and compilation methodology makes it practical to scale up expressive gate sets on quantum computing architectures while minimizing the need for onerous fine-tuning of low-level control waveforms.

### [5] [Measure and Forget Dynamics in Random Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21866)

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: "Forgetful" measurements-physically similar to dephasing-are of interest both for applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing and fundamentally, in studying how entanglement and entropy spread. This paper investigates measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in random Clifford circuits when measurement outcomes are partially forgotten. Our findings reveal a local thermalization rate that remains constant regardless of system size. We also numerically calculate the decay behavior at the turning points in the entropy diagram. We observe a counterintuitive phenomenon where the entropy reaches a threshold and stops evolving, even as the system size increases. This challenges an intuition, drawn from previous studies of noisy random circuits, that noise will cause the thermalization of the whole system. Additionally, we identify the disappearance of the purification transition and discuss the implications of these entanglement dynamics for quantum error-correction codes.

### [6] [Accuracy and resource advantages of quantum eigenvalue estimation with non-Hermitian transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21867)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In electronic structure calculations, the transcorrelated method enables a reduction of the basis set size by incorporating the electron-electron correlations directly into the Hamiltonian. However, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, which makes many common quantum algorithms inapplicable. Recently, a quantum eigenvalue estimation algorithm was proposed for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra [FOCS 65, 1051 (2024)]. Here we investigate the cost of this algorithm applied to transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonians of second-row atoms and compare it to the cost of applying standard qubitization to non-transcorrelated Hamiltonians. We find that the ground state energy of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian in the STO-6G basis is more accurate than that of a standard Hamiltonian in the cc-pVQZ basis. The T gate counts of the two methods are comparable, while the qubit count of the transcorrelated method is 2.5 times smaller.

Abstract: Quantum computing platforms are evolving to a point where placing high numbers of qubits into a single core comes with certain difficulties such as fidelity, crosstalk, and high power consumption of dense classical electronics. Utilizing distributed cores, each hosting logical data qubits and logical ancillas connected via classical and quantum communication channels, offers a promising alternative. However, building such a system for logical qubits requires additional optimizations, such as minimizing the amount of state transfer between cores for inter-core two-qubit gates and optimizing the routing of magic states distilled in a magic state factory. In this work, we investigate such a system and its statistics in terms of classical and quantum resources. First, we restrict our quantum gate set to a universal gate set consisting of CNOT, H, T, S, and Pauli gates. We then developed a framework that can take any quantum circuit, transpile it to our gate set using Qiskit, and then partition the qubits using the KaHIP graph partitioner to balanced partitions. Afterwards, we built an algorithm to map these graphs onto the 2D mesh of quantum cores by converting the problem into a Quadratic Assignment Problem with Fixed Assignment (QAPFA) to minimize the routing of leftover two-qubit gates between cores and the total travel of magic states from the magic state factory. Following this stage, the gates are scheduled using an algorithm that takes care of the timing of the gate set. As a final stage, our framework reports detailed statistics such as the number of classical communications, the number of EPR pairs and magic states consumed, and timing overheads for pre- and post- processing for inter-core state transfers. These results help to quantify both classical and quantum resources that are used in distributed logical quantum computing architectures.

TL;DR: Active manipulation of topologically protected states can improve quantum technologies by combining topological robustness and precise quantum control. A protocol for adiabatic pumping is proposed for transferring topological corner states in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using a modular lattice architecture consisting of four topologically distinct subblocks. The protocol enabling modulation of a topological dark state through precise tuning of lattice couplings is based on coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage among topological corner and interface states. Multi-level modeling supports the protocol, demonstrating superior performance in transfer fidelity and efficiency compared to a sequential stages Thiouless pumping.

Conclusion: This work opens up new avenues for enhancing quantum transport processes usingAdaptive pumping techniques in topologically protected state systems.

Abstract: The active manipulation of topologically protected states represents a pivotal frontier for quantum technologies, offering a unique confluence of topological robustness and precise quantum control. We propose an adiabatic pumping scheme for the long-range transfer of topological corner states in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The protocol utilizes a modular lattice architecture composed of four topologically distinct subblocks, enabling the modulation of a topological dark state by precise tuning of lattice couplings. This approach is based on coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage among topological corner and interface states. We establish a multi-level model for the adiabatic pumping that provides an accurate description of the underlying mechanism. In comparison with a sequential two-stage Thouless pumping, our protocol offers superior performance in both transfer fidelity and efficiency.

Abstract: Photons are promising candidates for quantum information technology due to their high robustness and long coherence time at room temperature. Inspired by the prosperous development of photonic computing techniques, recent research has turned attention to performing quantum machine learning on photonic platforms. Although photons possess a high-dimensional quantum feature space suitable for computation, a general understanding of how to harness it for learning tasks remains blank. Here, we establish both theoretically and experimentally a scalable advantage in quantum machine learning with multi-photon states. Firstly, we prove that the learning capacity of linear optical circuits scales polynomially with the photon number, enabling generalization from smaller training datasets and yielding lower test loss values. Moreover, we experimentally corroborate these findings through unitary learning and metric learning tasks, by performing online training on a fully programmable photonic integrated platform. Our work highlights the potential of photonic quantum machine learning and paves the way for achieving quantum enhancement in practical machine learning applications.

Abstract: An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.

Abstract: We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires ancilla qubits to extract error syndromes from data qubits which store quantum information. However, ancilla errors can propagate back to the data qubits, introducing additional errors and limiting fault-tolerance. In superconducting quantum circuits, Kerr-cat qubits (KCQs), which exhibit strongly biased noise, have been proposed as ancillas to suppress this back-action and enhance QEC performance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a beamsplitter interaction between a KCQ and a transmon, realizing an effective $σ_zσ_x$ coupling that can be employed for parity measurements in QEC protocols. We characterize the interaction across a range of cat sizes and drive amplitudes, confirming the expected scaling of the interaction rate. These results establish a step towards hybrid architectures that combine transmons as data qubits with noise-biased bosonic ancillas, enabling hardware-efficient syndrome extraction and advancing the development of fault-tolerant quantum processors.

Abstract: We present a quantum sensing protocol for coupled qubit-oscillator systems that surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) by exploiting a geometrical phase. The signal is encoded in the geometrical phase that is proportional to the area enclosed in oscillator phase space. This area is amplified through squeezing, enabling sensitivities beyond the SQL. Our method is independent of oscillator's initial state, amenable to sensing with high-temperature or logical error-corrected states. The protocol shows robustness to qubit Markovian noise and preserves its state-independence, underscoring its practicality for next-generation quantum metrology. We demonstrate application to force sensing beyond the SQL in longitudinally coupled systems, and to high-precision measurements of couplings and pulse calibration surpassing SQL in dispersively coupled circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is to explore how nonlinear optical phenomena in perovskite structures can be applied for next-generation quantum communication, potentially improving information security and data transmission efficiency.

Method: The methodology involves using four-wave-mixing experiments to observe changes in signal photons' ellipticities, which are then used to encode quantum information. Single-photon detection is employed to implement the BB84 protocol, mapping polarization states to binary data.

Result: They successfully transmitted an ASCII message of 56 bits using polarization states from the quantum wells, demonstrating the efficiency of this method which depends heavily on biexciton contributions.

Conclusion: The study concludes that using 2D-OIHP for quantum communication through polarization states is feasible and highlights the role of spin-dependent processes in enhancing information transmission efficiency.

Abstract: Two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D-OIHP) quantum wells are emerging as promising light sources for quantum communication technologies, owing to their ability to generate polarization-encoded optical signals. In this work, we explore how nonlinear optical phenomena can be exploited for quantum information applications, demonstrating the versatility that arises from resonant coupling among excited states. By tracking changes in the ellipticities of signal photons on femtosecond timescales in four-wave-mixing experiments, we first establish a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Using single-photon detection, we then implement the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol by mapping these polarization states onto binary sequences. While the polarizations of weak coherent pulses are typically manipulated with optical elements in traditional quantum key distribution approaches, the intrinsic electronic structure and spin relaxation processes within the 2D-OIHP system determine the characteristics of the signal photons in our method. As a demonstration, an ASCII message consisting of 56 bits is transmitted through the polarization states of photons emitted by 2D-OIHP quantum wells. These results show that the information transmission efficiency depends strongly on contributions from biexciton states, highlighting the potential of spin-dependent nonlinear optical processes for quantum communication.

Abstract: Magnonic systems present a compelling platform for quantum technology, owing to their strong capacity to form hybrid quantum systems via diverse couplings. To unlock the full potential of these systems, the engineering of flexible coupling between multiple magnon modes is essential. Here, we propose a method to realize switchable dissipative Ising coupling in magnon systems, leveraging the three-body coupling among photon, phonon, and magnon. This type of dissipative coupling is a critical component for constructing Ising machines designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. By dynamically tuning the phase of a nonlinear mechanical pump, we demonstrate the realization of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dissipative interactions. The validity of the scheme is confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrate its robustness against a strong uncontrollable part of dissipation. Our work provides a versatile tool that can facilitate the implementation of magnon-based quantum computing and the exploration of many-body magnon physics.

TL;DR: We derived closed-form analog quantum-speed-limit (QSL) bounds for highly nonlocal optical beams by mapping their paraxial propagation to a reversed harmonic-oscillator generator, analyzing propagation-distance limits for mode distinguishability, and proposing compact self-defocusing beam shapers for strong transverse-mode conversions with practical metrology applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore the fundamental limits of optical beam propagation and their applications in quantum metrology, particularly in achieving high sensitivity for sensing refractive index and temperature.

Method: The method involves deriving mathematical expressions for QSL bounds by analyzing the beam propagation dynamics, specifically mapping the paraxial propagation to a reversed harmonic oscillator, calculating the Bures distance, and determining analytic Mandelstam--Tamm and Margolus--Levitin bounds. Experimental validation is also performed using compact self-defocusing beam shapers.

Result: The key results include the derivation of analytic QSL bounds, the design of a compact beam shaper capable of strong transverse-mode conversion within millimeter scales, and the demonstration of metrology applications with index sensitivities of $10^{-7}$ RIU and temperature resolutions of order 1 mK.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between theoretical distance-domain quantum speed limits and practical photonic applications, providing a foundation for advancing quantum metrology and optical sensing technologies.

Abstract: We derive closed-form analog quantum-speed-limit (QSL) bounds for highly nonlocal optical beams whose paraxial propagation is mapped to a reversed (inverted) harmonic-oscillator generator. Treating the longitudinal coordinate $z$ as an evolution parameter (propagation distance), we construct the propagator, evaluate the Bures distance, and obtain analytic Mandelstam--Tamm and Margolus--Levitin bounds that fix a propagation-distance limit $z_{\mathrm{PDL}}$ to reach a prescribed mode distinguishability. This distance-domain constraint is the classical optical analogue of the minimal orthogonality time in quantum mechanics. We then propose a compact self-defocusing PDL beam shaper that achieves strong transverse-mode conversion within millimeter scales. We further show that small variations in refractive index, beam power, or temperature shift $z_{\mathrm{SL}}$ with high leverage, enabling speed-limit-based metrology with index sensitivities down to $10^{-7}$ RIU and temperature resolutions of order $1$ mK. The results bridge distance-domain QSL geometry and practical photonic applications.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) combines quantum computing and federated learning to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy. QFL can improve computational efficiency and scalability by taking advantage of quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement. However, existing QFL frameworks largely focus on homogeneity among quantum \textcolor{black}{clients, and they do not account} for real-world variances in quantum data distributions, encoding techniques, hardware noise levels, and computational capacity. These differences can create instability during training, slow convergence, and reduce overall model performance. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth examination of heterogeneity in QFL, classifying it into two categories: data or system heterogeneity. Then we investigate the influence of heterogeneity on training convergence and model aggregation. We critically evaluate existing mitigation solutions, highlight their limitations, and give a case study that demonstrates the viability of tackling quantum heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss potential future research areas for constructing robust and scalable heterogeneous QFL frameworks.

Abstract: The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to transform simulations of quantum many-body problems at the heart of electronic structure theory. Efficient quantum algorithms to compute the eigenstates of fermionic Hamiltonians, such as quantum phase estimation, rely critically on high-accuracy initial state preparation. While several state preparation algorithms have been proposed for fermionic ground states, the preparation of excited states remains a major challenge, limiting the applicability of quantum algorithms to photochemistry and photophysics. In this contribution, we describe a physically motivated adiabatic state preparation technique for low-lying excited states using the explicit coupling between electrons and photons. Our approach systematically converges to the first optically accessible excited state and can target different symmetry sectors by changing the photon polarization. We demonstrate the preparation of high-fidelity excited states for the Hubbard model and methylene molecule across a range of correlation regimes, and perform a successful hardware implementation for a model Hamiltonian.

Abstract: This study proposes a time-symmetric framework for quantum measurement that restores microscopic reversibility at the level of the dynamical description while remaining compatible with causality and thermodynamic consistency. Instead of invoking a stochastic wavefunction collapse, the measurement process is modeled as a bidirectional informational update between a forward-evolving state and a backward-propagating effect, governed by a completely positive generator and its adjoint. Within this operator-based formalism, pre- and post-selected statistics are treated on an equal footing, yielding a unified description of both. The proposed scheme rigorously preserves complete positivity, normalization, and the no-signalling principle, and it is shown to satisfy Spohn's inequality for the associated quantum Markov semigroup, thereby ensuring non-negative entropy production within this setting. The framework admits a direct experimental interpretation across a range of scenarios, including weak measurements, EPR-Bell tests, homodyne detection, and photon counting. Furthermore, in the classical limit, the bidirectional update is demonstrated to reduce to the well-established Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother used in classical estimation theory. These results support the view that the apparent temporal asymmetry of quantum measurement arises not from fundamental dynamical irreversibility, but from informational conditioning, specifically, the one-sided way in which measurement outcomes are incorporated into our description. In this sense, the arrow of time in measurement theory may be understood as an arrow of information.

Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms can be decomposed into a universal set of elementary one- and two-qubit gates. Different physical implementations of quantum computing, however, employ interactions that permit direct conditional dynamics on multiple qubits in a single step. In this work, we leverage quantum optimal control techniques to design single continuous laser pulses that implement multi-qubit controlled-phase, -NOT and -swap (Fredkin) gates on Rydberg atom quantum processors. The identification of robust multi-qubit operations leads to reduced operation time and less decoherence, and the control field provides continuous protection of the atoms from environmental noise. Notably, we find that the controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate, implemented using this approach achieves 99.74\% fidelity while accounting for imperfections such as spontaneous emission, laser fluctuations, and Doppler dephasing.

Motivation: The authors seek to enhance quantum processor capabilities by designing effective multiqubit gates despite limitations in gate set.

Method: By excitation of Rydberg atoms, the authors exploit transition pathway interactions to achieve controlled-SWAP operations, with specific mechanisms addressing decoherence and noise.

Result: The protocol achieves high fidelity (over 99/%) and significantly reduces circuit depth, making it more efficient and less prone to errors.

Conclusion: This technique overcomes limitations in neutral-atom systems, paving the way for advanced quantum operations like state verification and routing in optical lattices.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum processors employ Rydberg blockade for multiqubit phase operations but lack similar native exchange and conditional exchange gates, which are essential primitives for state verification, fermionic and XY-model simulation, and efficient routing in large qubit arrays. We demonstrate that by lifting the degeneracy between interfering transition pathways, a single Rydberg-excited atom can control state exchange between pairs of atoms. Using this mechanism, we realize a direct controlled-SWAP (Fredkin) operation with more than 99\% fidelity and an order-of-magnitude reduction in circuit depth and reduced exposure to decay and decoherence of Rydberg state components compared with decomposed implementations. The mechanism operates robustly under Doppler broadening at ~150 $μ$K and realistic laser-intensity noise and extends naturally to an entire family of useful gates, including multi-control conditional exchanges (C$_k$-SWAP) and conditional multiplexed SWAP gates. By incorporating controlled exchange operations as native physical operations on neutral atoms, our work provides multiqubit gates that enable higher-order state-verification protocols, occupation-dependent simulations, and conditional routing across optical lattices.

Abstract: Continuous monitoring of open quantum-optical systems offers a promising route towards quantum-enhanced estimation precision. In such continuous-measurement-based sensing protocols, the ultimate precision limit is dictated, through the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, by the global quantum Fisher information associated with the joint system-environment state. Reaching this limit with established continuous measurement techniques in quantum optics remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present a sensing protocol tailored for open quantum-optical sensors that exhibit dissipative criticality, enabling them to significantly narrow the gap to the ultimate precision limit. Our protocol leverages a previously unexplored interplay between the quantum criticality and the quantum measurement backaction inherent in continuous general-dyne detection. We identify a performance sweet spot, near which the ultimate precision limit can be efficiently approached. Our protocol establishes a new pathway towards quantum-enhanced precision in open quantum-optical setups and can be extended to other sensor designs featuring similar dissipative criticality.

Abstract: Graph states form a large family of quantum states that are in one-to-one correspondence with mathematical graphs. Graph states are used in many applications, such as measurement-based quantum computation, as multipartite entangled resources. It is thus crucial to understand when two such states have the same entanglement, i.e. when they can be transformed into each other using only local operations. In this case, we say that the graph states are LU-equivalent (local unitary). If the local operations are restricted to the so-called Clifford group, we say that the graph states are LC-equivalent (local Clifford). Interestingly, a simple graph rule called local complementation fully captures LC-equivalence, in the sense that two graph states are LC-equivalent if and only if the underlying graphs are related by a sequence of local complementations. While it was once conjectured that two LU-equivalent graph states are always LC-equivalent, counterexamples do exist and local complementation fails to fully capture the entanglement of graph states. We introduce in this thesis a generalization of local complementation that does fully capture LU-equivalence. Using this characterization, we prove the existence of an infinite strict hierarchy of local equivalences between LC- and LU-equivalence. This also leads to the design of a quasi-polynomial algorithm for deciding whether two graph states are LU-equivalent, and to a proof that two LU-equivalent graph states are LC-equivalent if they are defined on at most 19 qubits. Furthermore, we study graph states that are universal in the sense that any smaller graph state, defined on any small enough set of qubits, can be induced using only local operations. We provide bounds and an optimal, probabilistic construction.

Abstract: A central challenge in quantum metrology is to effectively harness quantum resources to surpass classical precision bounds. Although recent studies suggest that the indefinite causal order may enable sensitivities to attain the super-Heisenberg scaling, the physical origins of such enhancements remain elusive. Here, we introduce the nilpotency index $\mathcal{K}$, which quantifies the depth of non-commutativity between operators during the encoding process, can act as a fundamental parameter governing quantum-enhanced sensing. We show that a finite $\mathcal{K}$ yields an enhanced scaling of root-mean-square error as $N^{-(1+\mathcal{K})}$. Meanwhile, the requirement for indefinite causal order arises only when the nested commutators become constant. Remarkably, in the limit $\mathcal{K} \to \infty$, exponential precision scaling $N^{-1}e^{-N}$ is achievable. We propose experimentally feasible protocols implementing these mechanisms, providing a systematic pathway towards practical quantum-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: Harmonic oscillators are promising continuous-variable (CV) quantum resources because their infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces allow for resource-efficient quantum computing and simulation. To reach their full potential, CV platforms need to be able to efficiently implement non-Gaussian operations. However, schemes for generating arbitrary non-Gaussian operations are restricted to single modes, i.e., the implementation of anharmonic potentials. Here, we introduce a method for implementing arbitrary non-Gaussian operations applicable to both single- and multi-mode systems, allowing the generation of both anharmonicities and nonlinear multi-mode couplings. Our method synthesizes a target Hamiltonian by decomposing it into a Fourier series whose terms are implemented via bosonic quantum signal processing, which uses a discrete-variable (DV) system to induce a nonlinearity in the CV system. Our hybrid CV-DV protocol allows for the direct simulation of a broad range of CV phenomena (such as those in lattice gauge theory, chemical dynamics, and quantum chaos) and provides a richer toolbox for CV circuit compilation.

Abstract: We present a systematic method for translating fault-tolerant quantum circuits between their braiding and lattice surgery (LS) representations within the surface code.

We show that both braiding and LS operations can be uniformly expressed as compositions of multibody measurements and demonstrate that the Raussendorf compression rule encompasses all known braid and bridge optimizations. We also introduce a novel CNOT circuit with LS. Our framework provides a foundation for the automated verification, compilation, and benchmarking of large-scale surface code computations, advancing toward a unified formal language for topological quantum computation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RELiQ, a reinforcement learning-based entanglement routing approach in quantum networks powered by graph neural networks, which outperforms existing methods despite relying only on local information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing entanglement routing in quantum networks presents challenges due to dynamic and probabilistic elements, making traditional heuristic-based solutions less effective. There is a need for a more adaptive and efficient approach that can handle these complexities.

Method: The proposed RELiQ method employs reinforcement learning integrated with graph neural networks to model and solve the routing problem. It focuses on local information exchange and iterative message passing, enabling it to learn from environment interactions without requiring global topology knowledge.

Result: The study demonstrates that RELiQ surpasses existing local information-based heuristics and learning-based methods in performance, particularly when evaluated against various topologies including real-world ones. It also matches or exceeds the performance of global information-based approaches, thanks to its ability to respond swiftly to changes in network topology.

Conclusion: RELiQ presents a promising alternative for entanglement routing in quantum networks, offering a scalable, efficient, and responsive solution that addresses the limitations of conventional routing strategies. It suggests that machine learning techniques, especially those that minimize reliance on global information, could be valuable in advancing quantum network technologies.

Abstract: Quantum networks are becoming increasingly important because of advancements in quantum computing and quantum sensing, such as recent developments in distributed quantum computing and federated quantum machine learning. Routing entanglement in quantum networks poses several fundamental as well as technical challenges, including the high dynamicity of quantum network links and the probabilistic nature of quantum operations. Consequently, designing hand-crafted heuristics is difficult and often leads to suboptimal performance, especially if global network topology information is unavailable.
  In this paper, we propose RELiQ, a reinforcement learning-based approach to entanglement routing that only relies on local information and iterative message exchange. Utilizing a graph neural network, RELiQ learns graph representations and avoids overfitting to specific network topologies - a prevalent issue for learning-based approaches. Our approach, trained on random graphs, consistently outperforms existing local information heuristics and learning-based approaches when applied to random and real-world topologies. When compared to global information heuristics, our method achieves similar or superior performance because of its rapid response to topology changes.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of understanding and controlling collective effects across different quantum technologies and processes.

Method: A Dicke-type framework is used to analyze and generalize collective effects for spin and harmonic oscillator systems.

Result: A unified framework is developed, enabling the generalization of collective effects and engineering them to be robust against noise and disorder.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances quantum technologies by providing a comprehensive understanding and design tool for collective effects.

Abstract: Collective effects, such as superradiance and subradiance are central to emerging quantum technologies -- from sensing to energy storage -- and play an important role in light-harvesting. These effects enhance or suppress rates of dynamic processes (absorption, emission, and transfer) due to the formation of symmetric or antisymmetric collective states. However, collective effects in different contexts -- absorption, emission, and transfer -- have often been defined disparately, especially across different communities, leading to results that are not immediately transferable between different contexts. Here, we describe all three types of collective effects using a common Dicke framework that resolves the apparent discrepancies between different approaches. It allows us to generalise previously known collective effects involving spins into new ones involving aggregates of harmonic oscillators or other degrees of freedom. It also explains how collective effects can be engineered to be robust against both disorder and noise, paving the way for more resilient quantum devices.

Abstract: Most quantum batteries studied so far with notable exception of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) batteries are based on integrable models, where superlinear scaling of charging power and hence a quantum advantage can be achieved, but at the cost of unstable stored energy due to integrability. Here, by considering the sunburst quantum Ising battery driven by periodic delta-kicks, we show that in the quantum chaotic regime a quantum advantage is achieved for number of batteries $n_b\leq 4$, together with excellent stability of energy storage. In the integrable regime optimal energy storage and extraction are possible irrespective of the initial state of the charger. Finally, we show that the observed advantage does not originate from multipartite entanglement within the battery subsystem and is therefore classical in nature.

Abstract: In quantum resource theories, traditional scalar measures often fail to capture the evolution of the quality of a resource under free operations. To address this limitation, we propose a quantum resource degradation theory based on the decomposition of observational entropy. We demonstrate that the total inconsistency measure, $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{C}}$, can be decomposed into two independent components: inter-block coherence, $\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$, and intra-block noise, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$. This decomposition reveals a significant degradation mechanism: under specific free operations, quantum coherence degrades into classical noise. Consequently, even when the total resource quantity is conserved, its quality decreases. This is quantified by the resource purity metric, $η$. Our theory provides greater detail than conventional approaches that rely solely on monotonicity. It also establishes a new framework for understanding quantum resource dynamics. We validate the theory through numerical experiments on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), demonstrating its utility in diagnosing and explaining the barren plateau phenomenon (BPP). The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for managing resource quality, complementing traditional resource quantification. This contributes to the optimization of quantum technologies on current and near-term noisy quantum devices.

Abstract: One of the main enablers in quantum computing is having qubit control that is precise and fast. However, qubits typically have multilevel structures making them prone to unwanted transitions from fast gates. This leakage out of the computational subspace is especially detrimental to algorithms as it has been observed to cause long-lived errors, such as in quantum error correction. This forces a choice between either achieving fast gates or having low leakage. Previous works focus on suppressing leakage by mitigating the first to second excited state transition, overlooking multi-photon transitions, and achieving faster gates with further reductions in leakage has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate single qubit gates with a total leakage error consistently below $2.0\times10^{-5}$, and obtain fidelities above $99.98\%$ for pulse durations down to 6.8 ns for both $X$ and $X/2$ gates. This is achieved by removing direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels using a double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which we name the R2D method. Moreover, we find that at such short gate durations and strong driving strengths the main error source is from these higher order transitions. This is all shown in the widely-used superconducting transmon qubit, which has a weakly anharmonic level structure and suffers from higher order transitions significantly. We also introduce an approach for amplifying leakage error that can precisely quantify leakage rates below $10^{-6}$. The presented approach can be readily applied to other qubit types as well.

Abstract: Pure states are usually used to observe quantum phenomena. In this study, we show that a quantum superposition of spatially displaced mixed cat states can be generated within an optical waveguide via nonparaxial unitary evolution of the initial low coherence (low purity) light beam. It is shown that highly mixed Schrodinger cat states can be observed at a well-defined propagation distance. The importance of the long-term decoherence and recoherence of the original wave packet in observing the mixed cat states is demonstrated. The Heisenberg and Schrodinger-Robertson uncertainty relations for mixed cat states are evaluated. We have demonstrated the feasibility of our method using accurate numerical simulations for the parameters of the source and optical waveguide available in practice.

Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays offer a powerful platform for engineering cooperative light-matter interactions and enabling quantum metasurfaces. We demonstrate that a two-dimensional array of three-level atoms operating under electromagnetically induced transparency can function as a tunable dual-band atomic mirror, where two independently controllable reflection bands emerge from the collective optical responses mediated by dipole-dipole interactions. These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure. This scheme provides a fully tunable dual-band atomic mirror operating across broad frequency and angular ranges, offering a practical and experimentally accessible pathway toward reconfigurable photonic elements in atomic-array platforms at low energy levels.

Abstract: Catalysis refers to the possibility of performing an otherwise impossible local state transformation by sharing an additional state, i.e. a catalyst, which is returned at the end of the protocol. There is a stronger version, known as supercatalysis, in which the borrowed catalyst is returned in an enhanced form, i.e. more entangled. However, this phenomenon has remained little explored. In this work we introduce the supercatalytic entanglement gain as a figure of merit taking values in [0,1] that quantifies the performance of the protocol (with 0 corresponding to the standard case of catalysis and 1 representing the maximal possible gain) and we study in which cases it can be greater than zero and which strategies can maximize it. While it turns out that every catalytic transformation can be implemented in a supercatalytic fashion with entanglement gain equal to 1 if the state that is borrowed is chosen appropriately, other choices can make the gain strictly less than 1 and even 0. In fact, we prove that a large class of catalytic transformations are not fully supercatalyzable, i.e. there is at least one choice of catalyst for which the entanglement gain vanishes. On the other hand, the construction that shows that supercatalysis is always possible with maximal gain uses artificially highly entangled catalysts. For this reason, we also study minimal supercatalysis, where the entanglement content of the borrowed state is constrained in a precise and natural way. While we consider a scenario where we prove it is impossible to have entanglement gain equal to 1 in this case, we show that there exist minimal supercatalytic transformations with gain as close to 1 as desired. We also explore several examples and observe that, although choosing a catalyst with the least possible entanglement is often an optimal strategy for minimal supercatalysis, this is not necessarily always the case.

Abstract: White Rabbit (WR) technology provides a commercially-available off-the-shelf solution for time synchronisation with sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond-level precision over optical fibre links typically spanning tens of kilometres. Such high-performance time dissemination can support a variety of applications, including position, navigation and timing (PNT), financial transactions, metrology, as well as entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD). Demonstrations of WR over significantly longer distances remain few and far between, particularly in scenarios where intermediate amplification is unavailable, such as stretches of long-haul underwater fibre. In this work, we report the longest unrepeated deployment of WR to date, achieving time synchronisation over a 300 km (51.34 dB) single-span optical fibre link, even in highly asymmetrical configurations, with 99.86% uptime, whilst maintaining picosecond-level precision and sub-nanosecond accuracy. This was achieved through careful selection and optimisation of the components deployed at the link's end points. By leveraging standard telecom fibre and off-the-shelf hardware, our results pave the way for a scalable and standardised timing backbone for large-scale quantum networks, offering a practical route toward time distribution in future heterogeneous quantum communication systems.

Abstract: Studying the performance of a quantum interferometer coupled to an external environment is a problem of conceptual and practical importance. If we consider a quantum interferometer featuring Heisenberg-limited sensitivity, then a typical result is that introducing coupling with the environment degrades the sensitivity to the shot-noise limit. Here we argue that this result crucially depends on whether the interferometer-environment coupling term is subject (or not) to the so-called Kac rescaling that restores extensivity, i.e., whether the coupling Hamiltonian is extensive or not. We present results of the Lindblad equation in the presence and absence of Kac rescaling of the coupling constant. Our results show that for a linear coupling and a harmonic model of the environment, often used in modeling of a quantum interferometer coupled with an environment, the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity may be restored after the Kac rescaling. This result points out the need and the importance to characterize the (model of the) environment of the interferometer at hand.

Motivation: Understanding collective emission phenomena in cold-atom systems is important for advancing quantum physics research.

Abstract: In a recent work [B. J. P. Jones and J. A. Formaggio, Phys. Rev.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We examine the complementarity among coherence (visibility), predictability, and entanglement for qubit and qutrit systems subjected to noisy quantum channels. Using the system-path entanglement framework, analytical expressions for all three quantities are derived for two- and three-slit interferometric setups. The study first establishes the validity of the triality relation in ideal conditions and then investigates its behavior under amplitude and phase damping. We find that amplitude damping redistributes coherence and population imbalance without violating complementarity, while phase damping reduces coherence but leaves predictability unchanged. These results demonstrate that the complementarity relation remains preserved even in open quantum systems, highlighting its robustness against decoherence and providing a unified analytical understanding of noisy quantum interferometry in low-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We establish a connection between quantum mechanics and computation, revealing fundamental limitations for algorithms computing spectra, especially in non-Hermitian settings. Introducing the concept of locally trivial pseudospectra (LTP), we show such assumptions are necessary for spectral computation. LTP adapts dynamically to system energies, enabling spectral analysis across a broad class of challenging non-Hermitian problems. Exploiting this framework, we overcome a longstanding obstacle by computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the imaginary cubic oscillator $H_{\mathrm{B}} = p^2 + i x^3$ with error bounds and no spurious modes -- yielding, to our knowledge, the first such error-controlled result. We confirm, for instance, the 100th eigenvalue as $627.6947122484365113526737029011536\ldots$. Here, truncation-induced $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking causes spurious eigenvalues -- a pitfall our method avoids, highlighting the link between truncation and physics. Finally, we illustrate the approach's generality via spectral computations for a range of physically relevant operators. This letter provides a rigorous framework linking computational theory to quantum mechanics and offers a precise tool for spectral calculations with error bounds.

Conclusion: 因此，这些改进的方法为QC 变分算法提供了更可靠的初始化机制，有助于提升计算化学中的量子模拟精度。

Abstract: The unitary cluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz and its variant known as local UCJ (LUCJ) are promising choices for variational quantum algorithms for chemistry due to their combination of physical motivation and hardware efficiency. The parameters of these ansatzes can be initialized from the output of a coupled cluster, singles and doubles (CCSD) calculation performed on a classical computer. However, truncating the number of repetitions of the ansatz, as well as discarding interactions to accommodate the connectivity constraints of near-term quantum processors, degrade the approximation to CCSD and the resulting energy accuracy. In this work, we propose two methods to improve the parameter initialization. The first method, which is applicable to both expectation value- and sample-based algorithms, uses compressed double factorization of the CCSD amplitudes to improve or recover the CCSD approximation. The second method, which is applicable to sample-based algorithms, uses approximate tensor network simulation to improve the quality of samples produced by the ansatz circuit. We validate our methods using exact state vector simulation on systems of up to 52 qubits, as well as experiments on superconducting quantum processors using up to 65 qubits. Our results indicate that our methods can significantly improve the output of both expectation value- and sample-based quantum algorithms.

Abstract: We report an experimental demonstration of room-temperature Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference at a radio-wave frequency of 120 MHz using conditional build-up of quantum states from classical phase-averaged coherent states. This approach enables observation of quantum effects in spectral regimes where conventional single-photon sources and detectors are unavailable or require cryogenic conditions. By constructing a high-fidelity approximation of a single-photon state with phase-averaged coherent states, we observe the normalized second-order intensity correlation dips significantly below the classical limit of 0.5. The method allows for tunable noise suppression via optimization of the state representation. Our results establish the feasibility of using conditionally prepared classical states to simulate quantum interference phenomena in the radio-frequency domain. This technique opens the door to realizing other quantum protocols, such as Bell inequality tests, in frequency ranges where standard quantum technologies are currently infeasible.

Abstract: Fidelity is the standard measure for quantifying the similarity between two quantum states. It is equal to the square of the minimum Bhattacharyya coefficient between the probability distributions induced by quantum measurements on the two states. Though established for over thirty years, the structure of fidelity-optimal quantum measurements remains unclear when the two density operators are singular (not invertible). Here we address this gap, with a focus on minimal optimal measurements, which admit no nontrivial coarse graining that is still optimal. We show that there exists either a unique minimal optimal measurement or infinitely many inequivalent choices. Moreover, the first case holds if and only if the two density operators satisfy a weak commutativity condition. In addition, we provide a complete characterization of all minimal optimal measurements when one state is pure, leveraging geometric insights from the Bloch-sphere representation. The connections with quantum incompatibility, operator pencils, and geometric means are highlighted.

Abstract: A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are twofold: Entanglement and Classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) (Minimal Representation group, double covering of the Symplectic group). Some of the results of this paper involves the computation and analysis of the entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: Entanglement Probabilities P++, P--, P+-, (eg in the same or in the different subspaces), and the Total sum of them, and more. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.

Abstract: In this work we derive the replica field theory for monitored quantum many-body systems evolving under the quantum jumps protocol, corresponding to a non-Hermitian evolution interspersed with random quantum jumps whose distribution is state-dependent. We show that the density matrix of $R$ replicas evolves according to a master equation where the non-Hermitian term is replica-diagonal while coupling among replicas are due to quantum jumps. We write down the associated Keldysh action and study its behavior for the specific case of the Ising Chain with monitoring of particle density and tunable anisotropy, interpolating between free fermions with strong U(1) symmetry and the Ising chain with Z$_2$ symmetry. We derive the effective field theory in terms of slowly varying fields and obtain the replica-diagonal saddle point, which we show to describe the average state. We then go beyond saddle point and derive the effective field theory describing the replica off-diagonal sector, which takes the form of a Non-Linear Sigma Model. The symmetry class is either DIII or D, depending on the parameters of the Ising chain, except at a special symmetric point, where we recover the results for free fermions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the entangling phase observed numerically for the monitored Ising chain.

Motivation: Understanding quantum scrambling and Hamiltonian structure is crucial for quantum computing and material science.

Method: The method involves analyzing higher-order OTOCs using QSP and understanding their connection to quantum signal processing.

Result: Higher-order OTOCs measure higher-order Fourier components of the phase distribution associated with the singular values of a spatially resolved truncated propagator.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified framework for understanding and interpreting OTOCs and their generalizations, opening the door to new applications in quantum many-body dynamics and Hamiltonian learning.

Abstract: Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) are central probes of quantum scrambling, and their generalizations have recently become key primitives for both benchmarking quantum advantage and learning the structure of Hamiltonians. Yet their behavior has lacked a unified algorithmic interpretation. We show that higher-order OTOCs naturally fit within the framework of quantum signal processing (QSP): each $\mathrm{OTOC}^{(k)}$ measures the $2k$-th Fourier component of the phase distribution associated with the singular values of a spatially resolved truncated propagator. This explains the contrasting sensitivities of time-ordered correlators (TOCs) and higher-order OTOCs to causal-cone structure and to chaotic, integrable, or localized dynamics. Based on this understanding, we further generalize higher-order OTOCs by polynomial transformation of the singular values of the spatially resolved truncated propagator. The resultant signal allows us to construct frequency-selective filters, which we call \emph{OTOC spectroscopy}. This extends conventional OTOCs into a mode-resolved tool for probing scrambling and spectral structure of quantum many-body dynamics.

Abstract: Efficient fidelity estimation of multiqubit quantum states is crucial to many applications in quantum information processing. However, to estimate the infidelity $ε$ with multiplicative precision, conventional estimation protocols require (order) $1/ε^2$ different circuits in addition to $1/ε^2$ samples, which is quite resource-intensive for high-precision fidelity estimation. Here we introduce an efficient estimation protocol by virtue of common randomized measurements (CRM) integrated with shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, which only requires $1/ε$ circuits. Moreover, in many scenarios of practical interest, in the presence of depolarizing or Pauli noise for example, our protocol only requires a constant number of circuits, irrespective of the infidelity $ε$ and the qubit number. For large and intermediate quantum systems, quite often one circuit is already sufficient. In the course of study, we clarify the performance of CRM shadow estimation based on the Clifford group and 4-designs and highlight its advantages over standard and thrifty shadow estimation.

### [51] [Quantum Circuit Equivalence Checking: A Tractable Bridge From Unitary to Hybrid Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22523)
*Jérome Ricciardi,Sébastien Bardin,Christophe Chareton,Benoît Valiron*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Hybrid quantum circuit equivalence checking is important because quantum circuit transformations are common in quantum compilers. While some methods exist for this, most focus on unitary circuits, not hybrid ones with measurement. We introduce a new approach called deferred measurement to handle hybrid circuits, which significantly improves upon existing methods. We also developed techniques called separation and projection to handle even larger classes of problems. We tested our method on standard circuit transformations and found promising results. Additionally, we discovered some unexpected behaviors in the Qiskit compiler.

Motivation: Hybrid quantum circuits are becoming more important, especially with the increasing use of measurement in quantum computing. Ensuring the equivalence of such circuits is a significant challenge, as quantum compilers often involve complex transformations. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a new method and techniques that improve upon existing solutions.

Method: Our approach involves two main steps: the deferred measurement transformation and the use of unitary-level techniques, specifically separation and projection. We applied this method to standard circuit transformations like teleportation, one-way measurement, and the IBM Qiskit compiler, demonstrating significant improvements in handling hybrid circuit equivalence.

Result: Our method, which combines deferred measurement with separation and projection, significantly outperforms prior work in handling hybrid quantum circuit equivalence. We tested it on several standard transformations, including teleportation, one-way measurement, and IBM Qiskit, and found it effective in verifying the equivalence of larger classes of hybrid circuits. Additionally, we identified and reported some unexpected behaviors in the IBM Qiskit compiler.

Conclusion: We have developed a novel approach for verifying the equivalence of hybrid quantum circuits by extending the deferred measurement method and incorporating advanced unitary-level techniques. Our method not only improves the efficiency of equivalence checking but also expands the range of problems it can handle. This is particularly beneficial given the growing relevance of hybrid quantum circuits in practical applications. Our findings are supported by experimental results using standard quantum compiler transformations, and we have also uncovered new insights into the behavior of quantum circuit compilers.

Abstract: Equivalence checking of hybrid quantum circuits is of primary importance, given that quantum circuit transformations are omnipresent along the quantum compiler chain. While some approaches exist for automating this task, most focus on the simple case of unitary circuits. At the same time, real quantum computing requires hybrid circuits equipped with measurement operators. Moreover, the few approaches targeting the hybrid case are limited to a restricted class of problems. We propose tackling the Quantum Hybrid Circuit Equivalence Checking problem through lifting unitary circuit verification using a transformation known as deferred measurement. We show that this approach alone significantly outperforms prior work, and that, with the addition of specific unitary-level techniques we call separation and projection, it can handle much larger classes of hybrid circuit equivalence problems. We have implemented and evaluated our method over standard circuit transformations such as teleportation, one-way measurement, or the IBM Qiskit compiler, demonstrating its promises. As a side finding, we have identified and reported several unexpected behaviours with the Qiskit compiler.

TL;DR: 贝尔不等式限制了不通信双方的可能观测。我们提出了适用于任意数量通信双方的类贝尔不等式，分别在静态因果顺序、确定型因果顺序和双因果顺序下。所有推导出的不等式都很简单。它们对应于图游戏的获胜概率上限：给定一个特定的有向图，参与方需要根据随机选择的弧进行通信。在确定型因果顺序下，我们发现的每个游戏都由一种叫做 'kefalopoda' 有向图指定。基于此，我们定义了弱因果相关性，这些相关性满足所有 'kefalopoda' 不等式。我们证明了确定某些相关性是否为弱因果性的决定问题可以在参与方数量的多项式时间内解决。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了贝尔不等式的应用范围，提出新的不等式和判定方法，为量子信息和纠缠态理论提供新工具。

Abstract: Bell inequalities limit the possible observations of non-communicating parties. Here, we present analogous inequalities for any number of communicating parties under the causal constraints of static causal order, definite causal order, and bi-causal order. All derived inequalities are remarkably simple. They correspond to upper bounds on the winning chance in graphical games: Given a specific directed graph over the parties, the parties are challenged to communicate along a randomly chosen arc. In the case of definite causal order, every game that we find is specified by a kefalopoda digraph. Based on this we define weakly causal correlations as those that satisfy all kefalopoda inequalities. We show that the problem of deciding whether some correlations are weakly causal is solvable in polynomial time in the number of parties.

Abstract: Photon-pressure circuits are the circuit implementation of the cavity optomechanical Hamiltonian and discussed for qubit readout, low-frequency quantum photonics and dark matter axion detection. Due to the enormous design flexibility of superconducting circuits, photon-pressure systems provide fascinating possibilities to explore unusual parameter regimes of the optomechanical Hamiltonian. Here, we report the realization of a photon-pressure platform, in which a GHz circuit interacts with a MHz circuit via a magnetic-flux-tunable combination of dispersive and dissipative photon-pressure. In addition, both coupling rates are considerably enhanced by nonlinearities of the GHz-mode, which leads to the multi-photon coupling rates scaling stronger with the pump photon number $n_\mathrm{c}$ than the usual $\sqrt{n_\mathrm{c}}$ dependence. We demonstrate that interference of the two interaction paths leads to a Fano-like response in photon-pressure induced transparency, and that the dynamical backaction is considerably modified compared to the dispersive case, including a parametric instability caused by a red-detuned pump tone.

Abstract: State-of-the-art single-qubit gates on superconducting transmon qubits can achieve the fidelities required for error-corrected computations. However, parameter fluctuations due to qubit instabilities, environmental changes, and control inaccuracies make it difficult to maintain this performance. To mitigate the effects of these parameter variations, we numerically derive gates robust to amplitude and frequency errors using gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE). We analyze how fluctuations in qubit frequency, drive amplitude, and coherence affect gate performance over time. The robust pulses suppress coherent errors from drive amplitude drifts over 15 times more than a Gaussian pulse with derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) corrections. Furthermore, the robust gates, originally designed to compensate for quasi-static errors, also demonstrate resilience to stochastic, time-dependent noise, which is reflected in the dephasing time. They suppress added errors during increases in dephasing by up to 1.7 times more than DRAG.

### [55] [An Optimal Framework for Constructing Lie-Algebra Generator Pools: Application to Variational Quantum Eigensolvers for Chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22593)
*Yaromir Viswanathan,Olivier Adjoua,César Feniou,Siwar Badreddine,Jean-Philip Piquemal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for constructing Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs) for Lie Algebras, which are essential in quantum chemistry and other fields. The existing methods are too slow, but this method is faster and more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constructing MCPs is crucial for optimizing quantum chemistry calculations, like the VQE method. Existing methods are computationally expensive, so there's a need for a more efficient approach.

Method: The method uses Lie-algebraic properties, which are inherent to these structures, to avoid the brute-force search that previous methods used. This makes the process polynomially scalable instead of exponential.

Result: The new method can find MCPs more efficiently and quickly scales to larger problems. It's applicable to a wide range of fields, beyond just quantum chemistry.

Conclusion: This paper provides a faster, more efficient way to construct MCPs, leading to significant improvements in quantum chemistry calculations and other areas that rely on Lie Algebras.

Abstract: Lie Algebras are powerful mathematical structures used in physics to describe sets of operators and associated combinations. A central task is to identify a minimal set of generators from which the algebra can be constructed. The classical search for such generators has so far relied on greedy construction steps applied to an exponentially growing number of candidate operators, making it rapidly computationally intractable. We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits. The presented mathematical framework is general and applicable well beyond chemistry in fields including quantum error correction, quantum control, quantum machine learning, and more universally wherever compact Pauli basis are required.

Abstract: Modified divacancies in the 4H polytype of silicon carbide (SiC) exhibit enhanced charge stability and spin addressability at room temperature, making them highly attractive for quantum applications. However, their low formation yield, both at the single-defect and ensemble levels, has limited further progress. Here, we demonstrate a controllable and efficient method for generating modified divacancy color centers in 4H-SiC via oxygen-ion implantation. Based on their distinct optical signatures and spin-resonance characteristics, we experimentally resolve four types of modified divacancies. Remarkably, single modified divacancies constitute above 90% of the total defect population and exhibit superior optical properties and spin coherence compared with defects created through conventional carbon- or nitrogen-ion implantation. We characterize the zero-phonon lines of these modified divacancies and reveal a distinct temperature-dependent behavior in the spin-readout contrast. By systematically optimizing the implantation dose and annealing temperature, we further achieve high-density ensembles and observe clear Rabi-oscillation beating patterns associated with different orientations of basal-type defects. These results establish oxygen-ion implantation as a powerful and versatile approach to engineering high-quality spin-active defects in SiC, representing a significant advance toward scalable solid-state quantum technologies. Furthermore, our findings provide key insights into the atomic configurations of modified divacancies in 4H-SiC.

TL;DR: The paper presents a recursive version of Clifford noise reduction (CliNR) that efficiently reduces logical error rates in large Clifford circuits with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error correction in quantum computing is crucial for reliable operation, especially as quantum systems scale up. Reducing overhead for error correction is a significant motivation in this field.

Method: The authors propose a recursive approach to CliNR, increasing circuit depth incrementally while applying CliNR at each step. The overhead grows only logarithmically with the number of qubits and gates as a small multiple of the circuit size.

Result: Recursive CliNR can achieve vanishing logical error rates under different conditions, with the overhead remaining manageable even for large circuits.

Conclusion: This recursive method offers a promising advancement for practical quantum computing applications, especially in the near-term for large-scale Clifford circuits.

Abstract: Clifford noise reduction (CliNR) is a partial error correction scheme that reduces the logical error rate of Clifford circuits at the cost of a modest qubit and gate overhead. The CliNR implementation of an $n$-qubit Clifford circuit of size $s$ achieves a vanishing logical error rate if $snp^2\rightarrow 0$ where $p$ is the physical error rate. Here, we propose a recursive version of CliNR that can reduce errors on larger circuits with a relatively small gate overhead. When $np \rightarrow 0$, the logical error rate can be vanishingly small. This implementation requires $\left(2\left\lceil \log(sp)\right\rceil+3\right)n+1$ qubits and at most $24 s \left\lceil(sp)^4\right\rceil $ gates. Using numerical simulations, we show that the recursive method can offer an advantage in a realistic near-term parameter regime. When circuit sizes are large enough, recursive CliNR can reach a lower logical error rate than the original CliNR with the same gate overhead. The results offer promise for reducing logical errors in large Clifford circuits with relatively small overheads.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了两个光子从基态正电子对湮灭中释放并在正交极化方向形成极大纠缠态的情况。当这两个光子经历康普顿散射时，由于纠缠态的存在，其色相相关性会显著增强，这与经典解释中两个独立散射事件不符。普赖斯-沃德散射截面取决于两个散射光子角度差的色相对位，而单个光子的散射截面由 Klein-Nishina 截面描述。由于正交极化态在旋转上是不变的，它不携带关于单个湮灭光子极化的任何信息。在这种二元态中，Klein-Nishina 截面的角度原点是未定义的，因此普赖斯-沃德和 Klein-Nishina 描述不可调和。但通过半经典模拟，可以计算两个独立光子的散射情况（使用普赖斯-沃德截面），从而将普赖斯-沃德相关性和单个光子的 Klein-Nishina 统计学相统一。

Abstract: Two photons from the ground state para-positronium annihilation are emitted in a maximally entangled singlet state of orthogonal polarizations. In case of the Compton scattering of both photons the phenomenon of quantum entanglement leads to a measurable increase in the azimuthal correlations of scattered photons, as opposed to a classical description treating the two scattering events as independent. The probability of the scattering of the system of the entangled photons is described by the Pryce-Ward cross section dependent on a difference of the azimuthal scattering angles in the fixed coordinate frame, while the independent scattering of single photons is described by the Klein-Nishina cross section dependent on the azimuthal angle relative to each photon's initial polarization. Since the singlet state of orthogonal polarizations is rotationally invariant, it does not carry any physical information on the initial polarizations of the single annihilation photons. In such bipartite state the angular origin for the Klein-Nishina cross section is undefined, making the Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina descriptions mutually exclusive. However, semi-classical simulations of the joint Compton scattering of entangled photons - implementing the Pryce-Ward cross section, but still treating the two photons as separate entities - can reconcile the Pryce-Ward correlations with the Klein-Nishina statistics for single photons by implementing a modified version of a scattering cross section presented in this work.

Abstract: This paper develops the foundations of Quantum Granular Computing (QGC), extending classical granular computing including fuzzy, rough, and shadowed granules to the quantum regime. Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems.

Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates the design of parameterized quantum circuits for variational quantum algorithms. The framework finds a well-suited problem-specific structure of a variational ansatz. Among possible implementations of QAS the reinforcement learning (RL) stands out as one of the most promising. Current RL approaches are single-agent-based and show poor scalability with a number of qubits due to the increase of the action space dimension and the computational cost. We propose a novel multi-agent RL algorithm for QAS with each agent acting separately on its own block of a quantum circuit. This procedure allows to significantly accelerate the convergence of the RL-based QAS and reduce its computational cost. We benchmark the proposed algorithm on MaxCut problem on 3-regular graphs and on ground energy estimation for the Schwinger Hamiltonian. In addition, the proposed multi-agent approach naturally fits into the set-up of distributed quantum computing, favoring its implementation on modern intermediate scale quantum devices.

Abstract: Qubit reuse offers a promising way to reduce the hardware demands of quantum circuits, but current approaches are largely restricted to reordering measurements and applying qubit resets. In this work, we present an approach to further optimize quantum circuits by fully utilizing the potential of dynamic quantum circuits-more precisely by moving measurements and introducing dynamic circuit primitives such as classically controlled gates in a way that forges entirely new pathways for qubit reuse. This significantly reduces the number of required qubits for a variety of circuits, creating new opportunities for running complex circuits on near-term devices with limited qubit counts. We show that the proposed approach drastically outperforms existing methods, reducing qubit requirements where previous approaches are unable to do so for popular quantum circuits such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Fourier Transform~(QFT), and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) ansätze, as well as leading to improvements of up to 95% for sparse random circuits.

Abstract: The basic element of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is a cavity resonator strongly coupled to a superconducting qubit. Since the inception of the field, the choice of the cavity frequency was, with a few exceptions, been limited to a narrow range around 7 GHz due to a variety of fundamental and practical considerations. Here we report the first cQED implementation, where the qubit remains a regular transmon at about 5 GHz frequency, but the cavity's fundamental mode raises to 21 GHz. We demonstrate that (i) the dispersive shift remains in the conventional MHz range despite the large qubit-cavity detuning, (ii) the quantum efficiency of the qubit readout reaches 8%, (iii) the qubit's energy relaxation quality factor exceeds $10^7$, (iv) the qubit coherence time reproducibly exceeds $100~μ\rm{s}$ and can reach above $300~μ\rm{s}$ with a single echoing $π$-pulse correction. The readout error is currently limited by an accidental resonant excitation of a non-computational state, the elimination of which requires minor adjustments to the device parameters. Nevertheless, we were able to initialize the qubit in a repeated measurement by post-selection with $2\times 10^{-3}$ error and achieve $4\times 10^{-3}$ state assignment error. These results encourage in-depth explorations of potentially transformative advantages of high-frequency cavities without compromising existing qubit functionality.

By utilizing Bell inequalities, we can certify the randomness of outputs from untrusted devices, ensuring robust security in quantum communication and information processing. This study aims to provide a systematic method for analyzing Bell expressions, thereby enhancing the reliability and efficiency of quantum RNG systems. Additionally, exploring self-testing for quantum boxes offers a deeper understanding of quantum correlations, contributing to the broader field of quantum information theory.

Method: The method involves analyzing over 500,000 Bell expressions with configurations of four measurement settings for one party and three for the other.

Abstract: We propose an operationally well-defined delayed-choice quantum-erasure experiment that realizes, for the first time, a genuine delayed choice within presently available quantum-optical technology. A multimode quantum memory supplies a controlled and verifiable delay, ensuring that the choice operation is applied strictly after the observation event. Electronic single-photon interference detection measurements then furnish a direct statistical discriminator between the causal and informational coherence hypotheses, based solely on marginal detection statistics and without any post-selection. The Poissonian structure of the detection statistics allows accumulation of statistics across repeated operational units, rendering the proposal practical and experimentally feasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The demand for high-efficiency, compact, and tunable optical nonreciprocal devices continues to drive research in this field, particularly due to their potential applications in optical communication and sensing.

Method: The research employed a cavity-magnon system comprising two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The Sagnac effect was utilized to induce nonreciprocal frequency shifts, enabling unidirectional transmission and optical isolation. Squeezing was applied to further enhance isolation performance.

Result: Through this setup, the researchers successfully achieved an optical isolation ratio exceeding 40 dB, setting a new benchmark for the highest isolation ratio reported in such systems. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation could be reversed by adjusting the rotation of the WGM cavity.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in achieving record-high isolation ratios through the use of the Sagnac effect and squeezing opens new possibilities for the design of compact and efficient optical nonreciprocal devices, significantly advancing the field of integrated optical systems.

Abstract: Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了多模式光导的多工具量子光控制，为宽谱带双频滤波和多模式光谱仪的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Precise control of photon transport in waveguide quantum electrodynamics is fundamental to advancing quantum information processing. We investigate the manipulation of single-photon scattering via a driven $Λ$-type emitter coupled to a rectangular waveguide, examining both single- and multi-mode regimes. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism, we derive the scattering matrix and identify two distinct control mechanisms: Fano resonances induce complete reflection, and electromagnetically induce transparency (EIT) induce perfect transmission. In the single-mode regime, the external drive parameters-the detuning and Rabi frequency-precisely tune the positions and number of reflection peaks, allowing dynamic spectral engineering. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference between modes governs the scattering dynamics. When the input photon is prepared in a specific coherent superposition, multi-mode effects restore single-mode-like behavior, enabling Fano-mediated complete reflection. Conversely, a single-mode input prevents complete reflection even at the Fano resonance, while EIT-driven transmission persists. These results demonstrate a versatile toolbox for photonic quantum control in multi-mode waveguides, paving the way for applications such as broadband dual-frequency filters and multi-mode spectrometers.

Abstract: Cloud-based quantum computing, coupled with the rapid progress in quantum algorithms, brings to the forefront the question of verifiability in delegated quantum computations.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are becoming the primary computational primitive for next-generation quantum computers, particularly those embedded as resource-constrained accelerators in the emerging Quantum Internet of Things (QIoT). However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models.

Abstract: We establish a direct operational interpretation of wave-particle complementarity in induced-coherence interferometry by linking interference visibility to the optimal performance of unambiguous quantum-state discrimination. In the low-gain Zou-Wang-Mandel interferometer, the idler modes of the two SPDC crystals act as nonorthogonal which-crystal marker states, and we show that the single-photon visibility equals the minimal inconclusive probability of the optimal Ivanovic-Dieks-Peres (IDP) strategy, V = P_I^{opt}, so that the complementarity relation D^{2} + V^{2} = 1 expresses a measurement-optimality boundary rather than a geometric constraint. Our results reveal that wave-particle duality in induced coherence is not limited by interferometer geometry but by measurement optimality in zero-error discrimination on the idler, with experimentally testable consequences predicting distinguishability beyond that inferred from visibility alone. In the presence of thermal noise we derive the hierarchy V <= F(rho_A, rho_B) <= P_I^{opt}, linking visibility, fidelity, and optimal discrimination. These results identify distinguishability as fundamentally measurement-limited and motivate discrimination-enhanced induced-coherence imaging and sensing.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum phases-of-matter at finite-temperature is essential for understanding complex materials and large-scale thermodynamic phenomena. Here, we develop algorithmic protocols for simulating quantum thermodynamics on quantum hardware through quantum kernel function expansion (QKFE), producing the free energy as an analytic function of temperature with uniform convergence.

Abstract: Cryogenic systems necessitate extensive data transmission between room-temperature and cryogenic environments, as well as within the cryogenic temperature domain. High-speed, low-power data transmission is pivotal to enabling the deployment of larger-scale cryogenic systems, including the scalable quantum computing systems and the high-performance cryogenic computing systems fully immersed in liquid nitrogen. In contrast to wireline and microwave links, optical communication links are emerging as a solution characterized by high data rates, high energy efficiency, low signal attenuation, absence of thermal conduction, and superior scalability. In this work, a 4K heat-insulated high-speed (56Gbps) low-power (1.6pJ/b) transceiver (TRX) that achieves a complete link between 4K systems and room temperature (RT) equipment is presented. Copackaged with a PIN photodiode (PD), the RX uses an inverter-based analog front-end and an analog half-rate clock data recovery loop. Connecting to a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), the TX contains a voltage-mode driver with current-mode injection for low-power output-swing-boosting and 3-tap feed-forward equalization (FFE).

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) in superconducting qubits (SCQs) is a significant concern in fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing (QC). While physics models predict elevated QPG rates when qubits are driven at levels far below the superconducting gap frequency, experiments conducted using intense microwave drives (up to 300 GHz) through readout resonators indicate that QPG rates are much lower than expected. This suggests that existing models overestimate QPG rates, possibly due to unaccounted factors like high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs). These findings are crucial for optimizing SCQ operations and mitigating QPG effects in future quantum processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address a critical issue in quantum computing: understanding and mitigating drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) in superconducting qubits. QPG can lead to significant errors in quantum operations, reducing the fidelity and reliability of quantum computations. By investigating the actual QPG rates under various driving conditions, this work aims to provide accurate modeling and design guidelines for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum processors.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments using microwave drives at effective amplitudes up to 300 GHz, applying them through readout resonators. They measured the energy dissipation in superconducting qubits and analyzed the nonlinear response of the resonators to quantify energy loss. Calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance were used to model and explain the experimental results.

Result: The experimental results reveal that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are significantly lower than those predicted by ideal QPG models. By conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected. The incorporation of high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) in calculations explains the experimental data, showing that QPG rates are orders of magnitude smaller when HFCs are considered. This demonstrates that existing models overestimate QPG rates.

Conclusion: The conclusion of this study is that drive-induced QPG rates in superconducting qubits are lower than previously predicted, and the discrepancy can be attributed to factors such as high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) in the QPG conductance. These findings are essential for improving the accuracy of QPG modeling and optimizing the operation of superconducting quantum processors. They also open new avenues for further research into the microscopic origins of QPG to develop strategies for mitigating its effects in future quantum systems.

Abstract: Microwave drives applied to superconducting qubits (SCQs) are central to high-fidelity control and fast readout. However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG.

Abstract: In recent years, neutral atom-based quantum computation has been established as a competing alternative for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, as with other quantum technologies, various sources of noise limit their performance. With processors continuing to scale up, new techniques are needed to characterize and compare them in order to track their progress. In this work, we present two systematic benchmarks that evaluate these quantum processors at scale. We use the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to solve maximal independent set (MIS) instances of random unit-disk graphs. These benchmarks are scalable, relying not on prior knowledge of the system's evolution but on the quality of the MIS solutions obtained. We benchmark quera_aquila and pasqal_fresnel on problem sizes up to 102 and 85 qubits, respectively. Overall, quera_aquila performs better on QAOA and QAA instances. Finally, we generate MIS instances of up to 1000 qubits, providing scalable benchmarks for evaluating future, larger processors as they become available.

Abstract: This work explores connections between the quantum relative entropy of two faithful states $ρ,σ$ (i.e. full-rank density matrices) and the Kullback-Leibler divergences of classical measures $μ,ν$. Here, $μ$ and $ν$ are measures on the space of pure states, realizing $ρ$ and $σ$ respectively. The motivation for this result is to establish a notion of quantum relative entropy in the space of pure state distributions, which are the resulting objects of unravelings of the Lindblad equation, such as the stochastic Schrödinger equation. Our results show that the measures that achieve the minimal KL divergence are those supported on a (possibly non-orthogonal) common basis between $ρ$ and $σ$. Using the classical and quantum data-processing inequalities, our notion of quantum relative entropy is shown to be equivalent to the Belavkin-Staszewski entropy on states, revealing new insights on this quantity. Furthermore, the common basis is used to provide a novel proof of contraction of the relative entropy under Lindblad flow and offers insights into results from large deviation theory.

Abstract: Can a secret be hidden not in which quantum state is prepared, but in the way that state \emph{moves} through its space of possibilities? Motivated by this question, we propose an essential geometric perspective on quantum cryptography in which projective Hilbert space and its entanglement foliations play a central role. The basic ingredients are: (a) the Fubini-Study metric on the manifold of pure states, (b) a family of entanglement measures viewed as scalar functions on this manifold, and (c) controlled trajectories generated by unitary operations.
  The geometric structure -- state manifold, metric, and allowed moves -- is fully public, as is the functional form of the entanglement family. What remains secret is the choice of parameter $θ$ that selects a specific entanglement functional $E_θ$ and the corresponding foliation into constant-entanglement hypersurfaces. In this setting, classical messages are encoded not only in the sequence of states but also in the pattern of upward, downward, or tangential steps with respect to the hidden foliation. We formalize this idea in terms of geometric entanglement codes and illustrate it with two toy constructions in which incompatible foliations play the role of mutually unbiased bases.

Motivation: The paper explores the need for practical methods to characterize quantum states, particularly those that cannot be easily sampled or simulated.

Method: The authors introduce a convex resource-theoretic framework that directly measures quantumness using norms of linear functionals, bypassing optimization.

Result: They demonstrate a no-go theorem proving that a universal measure without optimization is unattainable, and provide examples using both Gaussian and non-Gaussian states to validate their findings.

Conclusion: This framework offers a more practical approach to assessing quantumness, making it suitable for larger systems where optimization would be infeasible.

Abstract: Despite several approaches proposed to operationally characterize quantum states of light-those that cannot be sampled with a positive distribution over classical states-most existing formulations suffer from limited practicality or rely on convex optimization procedures that are computationally demanding. In this work, we develop a general convex resource-theoretic framework to quantify optical quantumness directly from the norms of linear functionals of quantum states, thereby avoiding any optimization. We further establish a no-go theorem demonstrating that no universal measure of quantumness can exist in the absence of optimization. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical result through explicit examples involving both Gaussian and non-Gaussian states.

Abstract: Bosonic modes provide a promising platform for quantum batteries as a result of their unbounded energy spectrum. However, the energy that can be stored during a coherent charging process is limited due to coherent oscillations between the charger and battery. In this Letter, we show that by introducing a slow quench in the interaction between a coherently driven quadratic oscillator battery and a charger system, the maximum battery power ($P_{B,m}$) scales algebraically with the quench duration ($τ_Q$), i.e., $P_{B,m} \propto τ_Q^α$, where $0<α\leq2$ is a function of the quench ramp exponent. This finding implies that, counterintuitively, slower quenches lead to faster charging. Such a quench suppresses coherent energy oscillations between the battery and the charger, allowing an unbounded increase in power. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of charger dissipation, which imposes a finite limit on the maximum power. We also show that the temporal extensive scaling occurs in a broader context by mapping the system to a coherently driven Tavis-Cummings battery.

Abstract: The computational cost of simulating quantum many-body systems can often be reduced by taking advantage of physical symmetries. While methods exist for specific symmetry classes, a general algorithm to find the full permutation symmetry group of an arbitrary Pauli Hamiltonian is notably lacking. This paper introduces a new method that identifies this symmetry group by establishing an isomorphism between the Hamiltonian's permutation symmetry group and the automorphism group of a coloured bipartite graph constructed from the Hamiltonian. We formally prove this isomorphism and show that for physical Hamiltonians with bounded locality and interaction degree, the resulting graph has a bounded degree, reducing the computational problem of finding the automorphism group to polynomial time. The algorithm's validity is empirically confirmed on various physical models with known symmetries. We further show that the problem of deciding whether two Hamiltonians are permutation-equivalent is polynomial-time reducible to the graph isomorphism problem using our graph representation. This work provides a general, structurally exact tool for algorithmic symmetry finding, enabling the scalable application of these symmetries to Hamiltonian simulation problems.

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) characterizes complex dynamics through global invariants, but classical computation becomes prohibitive for high-dimensional data. We reinterpret time-domain dynamics as the eigenvalue spectrum of a supersymmetric (SUSY) Hamiltonian and thereby estimate topological descriptors through quantum spectroscopy. While zero modes correspond to Betti numbers, we show that low-lying excited states quantify the stability of topological features. Using a Takens embedding of the Lorenz system together with a resource-efficient quantum phase estimation implemented on IBM quantum hardware, we observe that the spectral gap of the SUSY Laplacian tracks the persistence of homological structures. Notably, the minimum of this spectral gap coincides with the onset of chaos, whereas its reopening reflects the geometric maturation of the attractor. Validated on small complexes yet offering an exponential advantage over classical diagonalization (from $O(N^3)$ to $\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$), this framework suggests that quantum hardware can function as a spectrometer for data topologies beyond classical reach.

Abstract: This article proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to estimate nonstabilizerness in quantum circuits, measured by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.

*Ole Sönnerborn*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We characterize all finite-dimensional quantum states that achieve the maximum speed limit in quantum evolution at given fidelity, establishing structural conditions for saturated states in both pure and mixed cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the conditions under which quantum systems reach their maximum evolution speed is crucial for optimizing quantum technologies and computations.

Method: We use a purification-based approach, analyzing the state's support, eigenvectors, and subspace structures to determine the saturation conditions, incorporating insights from previous work by Giovannetti et al.

Result: The saturation of the Margolus-Levitin speed limit requires the state's support to be within specific energy eigenspaces, eigenvectors to form fixed superpositions, and mutual orthogonality of the involved subspaces. These conditions are stricter for mixed states than pure states.

Conclusion: Our results provide a comprehensive framework for identifying saturated quantum states, which has implications for quantum computing, information theory, and fundamental studies of quantum dynamics.

Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of all finite-dimensional quantum states that saturate the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit at arbitrary Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity. Employing a purification-based approach, we prove that mixed-state saturation occurs precisely when three structural criteria are fulfilled: the state's support is confined to the sum of two energy eigenspaces (the ground level and a single excited level); each eigenvector of the state with nonzero weight is a fixed superposition of one ground- and one excited-state energy eigenvector (determined by the minimizer of the objective function identified by Giovannetti et al.) and all such eigenvectors evolve in mutually orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces. These requirements impose a strict rank bound, ruling out saturation by any faithful state. For qubit systems, we derive a purity-resolved and tight Margolus-Levitin bound that reduces to the pure-state result in the limit of unit purity. Through a time-reversal argument, we further extend the dual Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit to mixed states and establish the corresponding saturation conditions.

Abstract: Genuine entanglement identification of large scale systems is crucial for quantum computation, quantum communication and quantum learning advantage. In contrast to experiments, where noisy intermediate-scale programmable photonic quantum processors have been developed, theoretically very limited results have been achieved for detecting genuine entanglement of continuous variable multipartite systems. We propose a quite general and efficient entanglement detection framework for all kinds of multipartite entanglement of continuous variable systems based on uncertainty relations and the sign matrix technique. Matrix criteria are demonstrated and can be applied to various entanglement depth and k-separability problems of multimode systems. We illustrate the genuine entanglement conditions of continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of more than a hundred million modes in a photon loss and noise environment.

TL;DR: Efficient spin-photon interfaces in quantum networks are essential for up-scaling quantum computing. A new method involving photonic bandgap engineering in silicon waveguides suppresses non-target emissions, enabling high-fidelity coherent spinreadout with tens of emitters in significant spatial separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing scalable quantum computing relies on efficient qubit-photon interfaces. Current methods face limitations due to mode volume and depopulation. Experience shows that optimizing photonic structures can overcome these challenges.

Method: The method involves designing a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide with tailored photonic bandgap to suppress non-target emissions. The approach uses material loss engineering in refractory dopants to preserve emitter lifetimes.

Result: The method achieves efficient emission channeling to desired transitions, reducing unwanted dipole emission. It demonstrates 358pm T1lifetime enhancement, significant spatial separation allowing 100+ emitters, while retaining nearly 100% excitation efficiency.

Conclusion: This method provides a new route to scalable quantum computing, overcoming mode volume limitations and enabling high-fidelity storage and manipulation of qubits via co-design of photonic and electronic components.

Abstract: Quantum networks and the modular scaling of quantum computers require efficient spin-photon interfaces. This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms. It thus opens intriguing perspectives for photonic quantum technologies.

Abstract: Bosonic codes utilize the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information, offering a hardware-efficient approach to quantum error correction. Designing these codes requires precise geometric arrangements of quantum states in the phase space. Here, we introduce Quantum Cubature Codes (QCCs), a powerful and generalized framework for constructing bosonic codes based on superpositions of coherent states. This formalism utilizes cubature formulas from multivariate approximation theory, which connect the continuous geometry of the phase space to discrete, weighted point sets, ensuring the conditions for error correction are met. We demonstrate that this framework provides a unifying perspective, revealing that well-established codes, such as cat codes and the recently proposed quantum spherical codes (QSCs), are specific instances of QCCs corresponding to uniform weights on a single energy shell. The QCC formalism unlocks a vast new design space, encompassing non-uniform superpositions and multi-shell configurations. We leverage this framework to discover several new families of codes derived from Euclidean designs, allowing for greater geometric separation between logical states, which correlates with improved performance under photon loss. Numerical simulations under a pure-loss channel show that our multi-shell QCCs can outperform their single-shell counterparts by maximizing geometric separation with optimal energy at fixed pure-loss rate.

Abstract: Analog Quantum Simulators offer a route to exploring strongly correlated many-body dynamics beyond classical computation, but their predictive power remains limited by the absence of quantitative error estimation. Establishing rigorous uncertainty bounds is essential for elevating such devices from qualitative demonstrations to quantitative scientific tools. Here we introduce a general framework for bounded-error quantum simulation, which provides predictions for many-body observables with experimentally quantifiable uncertainties. The approach combines Hamiltonian and Lindbladian Learning--a statistically rigorous inference of the coherent and dissipative generators governing the dynamics--with the propagation of their uncertainties into the simulated observables, yielding confidence bounds directly derived from experimental data. We demonstrate this framework on trapped-ion quantum simulators implementing long-range Ising interactions with up to 51 ions, and validate it where classical comparison is possible. We analyze error bounds on two levels. First, we learn an open-system model from experimental data collected in an initial time window of quench dynamics, simulate the corresponding master equation, and quantitatively verify consistency between theoretical predictions and measured dynamics at long times. Second, we establish error bounds directly from experimental measurements alone, without relying on classical simulation--crucial for entering regimes of quantum advantage. The learned models reproduce the experimental evolution within the predicted bounds, demonstrating quantitative reliability and internal consistency. Bounded-error quantum simulation provides a scalable foundation for trusted analog quantum computation, bridging the gap between experimental platforms and predictive many-body physics. The techniques presented here directly extend to digital quantum simulation.

Abstract: Modern precision measurements, such as interferometry for detecting gravitational waves, rely on the estimation of optical phases encoded in light fields. Here, we propose to exploit the collectively enhanced output field of a driven-dissipative many-body open quantum system as a light source in order to improve the precision of estimating optical phases. Pronounced temporal correlations of such output fields benefit the sensitivity of measurement protocols, which we show theoretically by employing a boundary time crystal as a light source. The fundamental bound on the precision of such estimation shows scaling with system size that surpasses the Heisenberg limit and obeys the standard quantum limit in the measurement time. This scaling can be partially harnessed by a protocol, in which the phase shifted light field is guided into an auxiliary replica system, which serves as a detector that is sensitive to non-trivial temporal correlations of the light.

Abstract: The limited number of qubits per chip remains a critical bottleneck in quantum computing, motivating the use of distributed architectures that interconnect multiple quantum processing units (QPUs). However, executing quantum algorithms across distributed systems requires careful co-design of algorithmic primitives and hardware architectures to manage circuit depth and entanglement overhead. We identify multivariate trace estimation as a key subroutine that is naturally suited for distribution, and broadly useful in tasks such as estimating Rényi entropies, virtual cooling and distillation, and certain applications of quantum signal processing. In this work, we introduce COMPAS, an architecture that realizes multivariate trace estimation across a multi-party network of interconnected modular and distributed QPUs by leveraging pre-shared entangled Bell pairs as resources. COMPAS adds only a constant depth overhead and consumes Bell pairs at a rate linear in circuit width, making it suitable for near-term hardware. Unlike other schemes, which must choose between asymptotic optimality in circuit depth or GHZ width, COMPAS achieves both at once. Additionally, we analyze network-level errors and simulate the effects of circuit-level noise on the architecture.

Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of non-integrable Hamiltonian many-body quantum systems are characterized by highly entangled wave functions. Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resources. However, typical computations aim to estimate expectation values of local operators and correlation functions to some expected precision. For thermalizing systems at sufficiently high energy densities, such computations do not require storing the full wave function. Nonetheless, constructing classical algorithms for intermediate energy densities has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to accelerate the convergence of Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of expectation values applicable in a broad range of energy densities. We estimate the desired observables by rescaling the MPS results at low bond dimensions with a factor that depends only on the fidelity of the MPS wave function. Using this technique, we simulated the dynamics of the two-dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a $7\times8$ grid with periodic boundary conditions, using a maximum bond dimension of $χ= 4096$ on a single A100 GPU. We compared our results to similar TFIM simulations on a digital quantum processor.

Furthermore, we establish a quantum version of Galois connection for entangled CSPs in the case of non-oracular quantum homomorphisms.

Motivation: The paper addresses gaps in the understanding of random purification channels and provides clearer explanations of their properties.

Method: A simple construction method is introduced, and its applications are systematically analyzed.

Result: The channel is shown to purify non-i.i.d. states and to be effective in proving refined quantum divergence theorems.

Conclusion: Simplifies the study of quantum purification techniques and expands their applicability.

Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding Hamiltonian parameters is crucial for modeling and controlling quantum systems, especially in open environments with dissipation. This work aims to develop a method that can accurately infer these parameters without requiring detailed prior knowledge of the system dynamics.

Method: The method involves using the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator, retrieved through the multichannel Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm. This approach connects system parameters with observable dynamics, leveraging data from first-moment dynamics to infer Hamiltonian parameters.

Result: The method successfully recovers key parameters such as oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, qubit-photon coupling strengths, and modulated frequencies with high accuracy (within 5% of true values), outperforming traditional Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators in dynamics with strong dissipation.

Conclusion: The application of Koopman operator theory provides a robust and practical framework for studying and controlling quantum dynamical systems, particularly in scenarios involving significant dissipation.

Abstract: An accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and control of open quantum systems. In this work, a novel data-driven method for inferring such parameters from first-moment dynamics is presented using an open 2D quantum harmonic oscillator as an example. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain such parameters, which is obtained using the multichannel Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm; a theoretical connection of such affirmation is presented. The method is tested on the expected value of noiseless quadratures, retrieving oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, qubit-photon coupling strengths of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and a modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5% of their true values. When compared to Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.

Abstract: We study the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice using several numerical approaches, focusing on the numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE), which exhibits an unconventional convergence extending to low and even zero temperatures. We evaluate thermodynamic properties as well as spin-spin correlations through the equal-time structure factor. Within NLCE the specific heat capacity reveals a two-peak structure at $T_1 \approx 0.479\,J$ and $T_2 \approx 0.131\,J$, reminiscent of the corresponding result for the triangular lattice. At intermediate temperatures, the spin-spin structure factor develops features that reflect the absence of reflection symmetry in the lattice. The zero-temperature convergence of NLCE enables reliable estimates of the ground-state energy and points to a short-range correlated paramagnetic ground state composed of resonating hexagonal motifs. The NLCE results are benchmarked against Pseudo-Majorana Functional Renormalization Group, finite-temperature Lanczos, and classical Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: We argue that the presence of \emph{any} exact $U(1)$ higher-form symmetry, under mild assumptions, presents a fundamental obstruction to ergodicity under unitary dynamics in lattice systems with local interactions and finite on-site Hilbert space dimension. Focusing on the two-dimensional case, we show that such systems necessarily exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation and explicitly construct Krylov sectors whose number scales exponentially with system size. While these sectors cannot be distinguished by symmetry quantum numbers, we identify the emergent integrals of motion which characterize them. Our symmetry-based approach is insensitive to details of the Hamiltonian and the lattice, providing a systematic explanation for ergodicity-breaking in a range of systems, including quantum link models.

Abstract: Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.

TL;DR: 研究集中在 Kagome 格点上的掺杂量子自旋液体，通过密度矩阵 renormalization group（DMRG）模拟研究了从δ=0.027到δ=0.36的掺杂程度范围。发现随着掺杂程度δ的增加，系统从一个雪emerEmergent Fermi-liquid-like相经历了相变。在δ≈0.15时，系统出现了一个类似费米流体的状态，表现为电荷密度振荡被抑制和各种相关函数呈幂律衰减。在L_y=4的圆柱体上进行研究时，这种费米流体状态似乎更为稳定。特别是在δ接近1/3的窄的掺杂范围内，观察到电荷单粒子相关函数呈指数衰减，但其他相关函数仍保留费米流体状态的特征，这可能为超导状态的出现预示了一个前驱状态。但随着圆柱体长度的增加，这种现象可能消失，这可能意味着圆柱体尺寸对结果有影响。综上，研究揭示了从雪emerWigner晶体到费米流体状态的量子熔化过程，并为探索超导状态的掺杂范围提供了线索。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了Kagome格点上掺杂量子自旋液体中费米流体和超导状态之间的量子熔化过程。通过DMRG模拟，不仅确认了一种费米流体状态的稳定存在，还发现了可能的超导前驱状态，这些结果为探索掺杂条件下自旋液体与超导体的转变提供了数值支持。研究还表明，系统的行为可能会受到圆柱体尺寸的显著影响，这对于未来实验设计具有重要参考价值。这些发现对于理解量子自旋液体中的量子相变以及探索新超导态的形成机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: The doped quantum spin liquid on the kagome lattice provides a fascinating platform to explore exotic quantum states, such as the reported holon Wigner crystal at low doping. By extending the doping range to $δ= 0.027$ - $0.36$, we study the kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model using the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation. On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $δ\approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $δ= 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $δ= 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence. Our results reveal a quantum melting from a holon Wigner crystal to a Fermi-liquid-like state with increasing hole density, and suggest a doping regime to explore superconductivity for future study.

Result: 在所有研究情况下，均得Néel 式所状态；对于双子格贴面晶体中的 Néel 态，若两子晶格间存在倒影对称性，态为反铁磁（AFM）；因其存在其它点群操作对称性，则为交替磁性（AM）；若无任何点群对称操作，则为铁磁（FM）态；中心对称性的QC结构更易支持AM；实例为人存在的结果表明 Penrose QC支农磁性较强。

Abstract: Magnetism is a fundamental research area in which the recently proposed altermagnetism (AM) has become an emergent frontier. Very recently, the quasicrystal (QC) was proposed as a possible platform to realize AM. However, the existence of AM in QCs still lacks vigorous evidence. In this work, we adopt the sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithm to investigate the magnetic phases in the half-filled Hubbard models in various 2D bipartite QCs, and always obtain Néel ordered states. While the Néel states in bipartite crystals are usually antiferromagnetism (AFM), we find it common that those in bipartite QCs can also be AM or ferromagnetism (FM). Based on symmetry analysis, combined with our comprehensive PQMC results, we propose a general criterion for determining the magnetism classes of the Néel states in a bipartite QC: According to whether the two sublattices are related by the inversion, the other point-group operation, or no operation about the unique symmetry center in the QC, the corresponding Néel state is AFM, AM or FM, respectively. For example, our results yield AM for the two $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QCs and FM for the $D_5$-symmetric Penrose QC at half-filling. Our results provide a solid foundation for experimental investigations and potential applications of different classes of magnetism in QCs.

TL;DR: 研究了Nd₂Zr₂O₇和Pr₂Zr₂O₇在 pulse磁场下的磁性特性，利用磁化率和磁力偶联效应（MCE）测量。MCE数据呈现明显的反常环形磁滞图，样本温度随磁场上升和下降时均上升。在Nd₂Zr₂O₇中，MCE显示出时间上的平展且磁性子系统温度与直接测量的样本温度有显著差异。Pt磁化率测量揭示了磁性子系统的温度变化与直接测量不同，呈现反向磁滞：上升时温度高于下降时。这些观察表明，脉冲时间内磁性和晶格自由度之间存在失衡（~10⁻¹秒）。我们使用两个热耦合子系统和一个热环境的模型来解释结果，但Pr₂Zr₂O₇的实验数据无法完全解释Nd₂Zr₂O₇的平展现象。通过允许磁性和晶格子系统之间的热耦合随时间变化（HdH/dt）而调整模型，我们显著改善了对Nd₂Zr₂O₇数据的匹配程度。实验结果表明，磁性子系统和晶格自由度之间传输热量的速度异常缓慢，这可能为Nd₂Zr₂O₇的动态热流控制提供了一种新的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the thermal coupling between magnetic and lattice subsystems in high-dimensional magnetic materials like Nd₂Zr₂O₇ is critical for advancing the field of magnetocaloric materials with potential applications in data storage and spintronics.

Method: Magnetization and magnetocaloric-effect (MCE) measurements were carried out on Nd₂Zr₂O₇ and Pr₂Zr₂O₇ single crystals under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T, with initial temperatures ranging from 2 to 31 K.

Result: The MCE data from Nd₂Zr₂O₇ exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, with sample temperatures rising during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. A striking plateau in the MCE data followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field was observed in Nd₂Zr₂O₇, while in Pr₂Zr₂O₇, the plateau phenomenon was not observed. The magnetization measurements reveal a significant difference between the temperature of the magnetic subsystem and the directly measured sample temperature, with the magnetic subsystem temperature exhibiting opposite hysteresis compared to the direct measurements. This suggests that there is a significant divergence of magnetic subsystems and the lattice subsystems on short timescales (~10⁻¹ s).

Conclusion: Our findings indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between the magnetic and lattice subsystems on the scale of the pulse. This breakdown is evident in both the magnetization and MCE data, and affects the interpretation of the results. We propose that the time-dependent coupling between the magnetic and lattice subsystems can help explain the observed behaviors. In particular, the experimentally observed plateaus in magnetic data in Nd₂Zr₂O₇ may be explained by a temperature-dependent thermal coupling coefficient that modulates the rate of magnetic field variation. Moreover, the slow heat transfer between magnetic and lattice subsystems in Nd₂Zr₂O₇ suggests a novel mechanism for dynamically controlling the heat flow within these materials.

Abstract: We explore the magnetic properties of Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ single crystals subjected to pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T using magnetization and magnetocaloric-effect (MCE) measurements, with initial temperatures ranging from 2 to 31K. The MCE data exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, in which the sample temperature increases during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. In Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the MCE further displays a striking plateau as a function of time, followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field, across pulses with differing peak-field strengths. Our magnetization measurements reveal an inferred temperature of the magnetic subsystem that differs significantly from the directly measured sample temperature and exhibits opposite hysteresis: the temperature is higher on the up-sweep than the down-sweep, unlike the direct measurements. These observations indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom on the timescale of the pulse ($\sim 10^{-1}$s). We interpret the results using a phenomenological model involving two thermally coupled subsystems - the magnetic ions and phonons, and a thermal reservoir, which accounts well for the behavior of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. However, it fails to reproduce the plateau seen in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. Agreement with Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ data is improved substantially if we allow the thermal coupling between the magnetic and the lattice subsystems to depend on the product $\frac{HdH}{dt}$. Our results reveal anomalously slow heat transfer between magnetic and lattice subsystems and point toward a novel mechanism for dynamically controlling the heat flow in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ via the rate of magnetic field variation.

Abstract: Recent progress in generalized symmetry and topological holography has shown that, in conformal field theory (CFT), topological data from one dimensional higher can play a key role in determining local dynamics. Based on this insight, a fixed-point (FP) tensor complex (TC) for CFT has recently been constructed. In this work, we develop a TC renormalization (TCR) algorithm adapted to this CFT-based structure, forming a renormalization-group (RG) framework with generalized symmetry. We show that the full FP tensor can emerge from the RG flow starting with only the three-point function of the primary fields. Remarkably, even when starting solely from topological data, the RG process can still reconstruct the full FP tensor--a method we call as topological bootstrap. This approach deepens the connection between the topological and dynamical aspects of CFT and suggests pathways toward a fully algebraic description of gapless quantum states, with potential extensions to higher dimensions.

Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tensor network ansatz for two-dimensional quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\langle \langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle \rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example.

Abstract: We reveal the emergence of a robust tetrahedral magnetic ground state in monolayer graphene doped to the van Hove singularity (vHS). This noncoplanar, gapped spin configuration -- featuring four orthogonal moments -- has been previously identified as a candidate instability. Here, not only do we confirm its stability across all finite interactions using fully self-consistent, real-space-resolved calculations, but we also go beyond earlier work by charting the full surrounding phase diagram. In doing so, we unravel a cascade of symmetry-broken magnetic states -- pseudo-tetrahedral, planar, collinear, and modulated textures -- which we classify using spin structure factors and vector order parameters. These results stem from unrestricted Hartree-Fock simulations on large supercells with dense k-point sampling, enabling us to resolve interaction-driven magnetic and charge inhomogeneities. Our findings connect directly with recent ARPES and doping experiments near the vHS in graphene, and establish the tetrahedral state as the central correlated instability in this regime, offering predictive insight into emergent magnetism in correlated Dirac materials.

<details>

Motivation: Understanding topological phases in α-Sn is crucial for advancing materials science and could lead to novel electronic devices.

Method: We employ a relativistic GW (scGW) method within a fully self-consistent framework to model the electronic structure of α-Sn.

Result: scGW successfully predicts both topological and trivial phases in α-Sn, including a strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal, which were experimentally observed.

Conclusion: The scGW method provides a robust framework for studying correlated topological phases in α-Sn and similar materials.

Abstract: Non-trivial topological phases often emerge in narrow-gap semiconductors with a delicate blend of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. The diamond-lattice allotrope of Sn ($α$-Sn) exemplifies this behavior, hosting multiple topological phases that can be tuned by small distortions in the lattice. Despite rapid experimental progress, theoretical descriptions of $α$-Sn lack predictive power and rely mainly on tight-binding models and density functional theory with uncontrolled approximations. We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $α$-Sn for band engineering. Additionally, we propose a robust diagnostic of topological behavior based on a combined analysis of band and orbital-occupation dispersions, tailored for correlated methods where standard mean-field-based topological invariants fall short. Our findings pave the way for studying a broad class of topological materials using accurate first-principles methods beyond density functional theory.

Abstract: Beyond conventional electric and magnetic monopoles, electric and magnetic toroidal monopoles, which are rank-0 multipoles distinguished by opposite parities under spatial inversion and time reversal, can exist in nature. The recent observation of electric-field-induced directional dichroism in antiferromagnetic olivine Co$_2$SiO$_4$ has provided the first concrete example of a magnetic toroidal monopole; however, its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here, we propose a minimal spin model that incorporates magnetoelectric coupling via the $d$-$p$ hybridization mechanism and analyze it within the mean-field approximation. The model qualitatively reproduces the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and its pronounced sensitivity to the direction of the applied electric field. Furthermore, it elucidates the temperature evolution of the magnetic toroidal monopole and the strong electric-field-direction dependence of the magnetic toroidal moment. Our calculations also predict a second-order nonlinear magnetoelectric response, consistent with the symmetry classification of Co$_2$SiO$_4$ as an altermagnet. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same framework is applicable to other antiferromagnetic olivines with analogous magnetic order, indicating the robustness and generality of the toroidal-type magnetoelectric response in this material family.

Abstract: Soft X-ray angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) is one of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques to visualize the three-dimensional bulk electronic structure in reciprocal lattice space. Compared with ARPES employing low-energy photon sources, the time burden imposed by a lower photoelectron yield, stemming from the photoionization cross-section, has been a persistent technical challenge. To address this challenge, we have developed a noise removal system by using the deep prior-based method and integrated it into the micro focused SX-ARPES (μSX-ARPES) system at BL25SU in SPring-8. Our implemented system effectively eliminates the grid and spike noise typically present in ARPES data acquired using the voltage Fixed-mode, within about 30 seconds. We demonstrate, through the μSX-ARPES measurements on a single crystal of CeRu2Si2, that data with sufficient statistical accuracy can be obtained in approximately 40 seconds. In addition, we present the potential of high signal-to-noise ratio ARPES measurement, achieving an energy resolution of 51.6 meV at an excitation energy of 708 eV in μSX-ARPES measurements on polycrystalline gold. Our developed system successfully reduces the time burden in SX-ARPES and paves the way for advancements in lower photoelectron yield measurements, such as those requiring higher energy resolution and three-dimensional nonequilibrium measurements.

Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo.

Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.

Motivation: The paper explores novel trion physics in 2D VB materials, building on recent progress in topological materials and correlated systems. It is driven by the desire to understand and control collective excitations in low-dimensional systems.

Method: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is used to detect In-gap features, revealing quasi-1D negative trions stabilized by surface band bending.

Result: The key finding is the emergence of a stable trion gas at the surface of Ta2NiS5. Negative trions form due to surface-induced band bending and quasi-1D geometry, allowing trions to exist without optical pumping and at equilibrium. This marks a rare example of an interaction-driven surface state in a conventional semiconductor.

Conclusion: Ta2NiS5 provides a new platform for studying surface physics and collective excitations. The discovery of trions in a 2D VB opens opportunities for exploring more exotic states and controlling many-body physics at surface interfaces.

Abstract: Trions, three-body bound states composed of an exciton and an additional charge, are typically fragile and require external excitation to form. Here, we report the spontaneous emergence of a stable trion gas at the surface of the layered semiconductor Ta2NiS5, revealed through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a sharp, highly localized in-gap feature that cannot be explained by conventional band-theory. Instead, we argue that it arises from the formation of negative trions, stabilized by surface-induced band bending and the material's quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Unlike excitons, these trions form without optical pumping and persist at equilibrium, marking a rare example of an interaction-driven surface state in a nominally conventional semiconductor. Our findings establish Ta2NiS5 as a unique platform for exploring many-body physics at surfaces and open new avenues for studying and controlling collective excitations in low-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We study the electronic structure and dynamical correlations in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, a prototypical room-temperature multiferroic, using a variety of static and dynamical first-principles methods. Conventional static Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$, DFT+$U$+$V$) incorrectly predict a deep-valence Fe $3d$ peak (around $-7\,\text{eV}$) in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, in contradiction with hard-X-ray photoemission. We resolve this failure by using a recent generalization of DFT+$U$ to include a frequency-dependent screening -- DFT+$U(ω)$ -- or using a dynamical Hubbard functional (dynH). The screened Coulomb interaction $U(ω)$, computed with spin-polarized RPA and projected onto maximally localized Fe $3d$ Wannier orbitals, is expressed as a sum-over-poles, yielding a self-energy that augments the Kohn--Sham Hamiltonian. This DFT+$U(ω)$ approach predicts a fundamental band gap of $1.53\,\text{eV}$, consistent with experiments, and completely eliminates the unphysical deep-valence peak. The resulting simulated HAXPES spectrum reproduces the experimental lineshape with an accuracy matching or exceeding that of far more demanding DFT+DMFT calculations. Our work demonstrates the critical nature of dynamical screening in complex oxides and establishes DFT+$U(ω)$ as a predictive, computationally efficient method for correlated materials.

Abstract: We study the properties of a generalized Dicke-Ising model realized with an array of Rydberg atoms, driven by microwave electric fields and coupled to an optical cavity. As this platform allows for a precisely tunable anisotropy parameter, the model exhibits a rich landscape of phase transitions and critical phenomena, induced by the interplay of rotating-wave, counter-rotating-wave, and Ising interactions. We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number. We also demonstrate the vanishing of parity symmetry in finite-size simulations and show that the Rydberg blockade leads to a significant suppression of cavity occupation. Notably, stronger quantum fluctuations induced by the counter-rotating wave terms slightly favor the superradiant solid (SRS) phase over the Solid-1/2 state. Finally, we confirm that the SR phase transition and the transition from the Solid-1/2 to the SRS are second-order. In contrast, the transitions from the Solid-1/2 or SRS to the SR phase are both first-order for any value of the normalized anisotropy parameter.

Abstract: We report the existence of quasi-stable ring-shaped (necklace-shaped) clusters built, in the free space, of 3D quantum droplets (QDs) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, modeled by the Gross-Pitaevskii equations with the Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. The QD clusters exhibit diverse dynamical behaviors, including contraction, oscillations, and expansion, depending on the cluster's initial radius. A phase shift between adjacent QDs imparts net angular momentum to the cluster, inducing its permanent rotation. Through the energy-minimization analysis, we predict equilibrium values of the necklace radius that support persistent rotation with negligible radial pulsations. In this regime, the clusters evolve as robust entities, maintaining the azimuthal symmetry in the course of the evolution, even in the presence of considerable perturbations. Necklace "supervortex" clusters, composed of QDs with inner vorticity 1 and global vorticity M, imprinted onto the cluster, may also persist for a long time. The reported findings may facilitate the experimental realization of complex self-sustained quantum states in the 3D free space.

Abstract: Pauli's exclusion principle forces fermions to occupy distinct quantum states, creating a filled region of momentum space at low temperature, the Fermi sea, whose topology governs the system's response to perturbations and the nature of its correlation functions. Recent theory predicts that for non-interacting fermions, the Euler characteristic of a $D$-dimensional Fermi sea -- the topological invariant that describes its shape -- is encoded in its ($D$+1)-point density correlations. Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic. Our results are in remarkable agreement with ideal-gas predictions, despite the presence of sizeable interactions, and establish a new pathway for probing many-body topology through correlation measurements.

Abstract: We study the tree-level scattering of massless scalars followed by an emission of a soft graviton in the small compact region inside the static patch in de Sitter space. We derive in the small cosmological constant limit the perturbative corrections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem. Exploiting the remarkable relationship between asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems in flat space, we derive perturbative corrections to the supertranslation Ward identity. We further show that the derived supertranslation Ward identity reduces to the perturbative soft graviton theorem for the same choice of the supertranslation parameter as in flat space.

We develop an efficient GPU-based algorithm for the numerical evaluation of the twistor rules. As an application, we extract the five-loop non-planar anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator.

Conclusion: 结果为AdS空间中WGC扩展提供了依据，支持AdS中的typeof猜想也成立。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the extension of our recent proposal for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in AdS space to more general effective field theories. We first extend the conjecture to set-ups where moduli are present and we demand that a particle, produced during the decay of an extremal black hole via the Schwinger effect, is repelled close to the horizon of the black hole. We interpret this condition as the universal criterion imposed by the WGC for any background. Interestingly, the constraint imposed by the WGC on the particle spectrum, before the stabilization of the moduli, is independent of the background, resulting in the same bound both in Minkowski and in AdS space. For the case of AdS space, after the stabilization of the moduli, the WGC in AdS space is reproduced due to the formation of a non-singular horizon of the extremal black hole. In that case, the particle spectrum must satisfy the stronger of the two WGC conditions obtained before and after moduli stabilization. Finally, we use these results to argue that a similar version of the tower WGC should also apply to an AdS background.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) reconstruction theorem shows that standard ($0$-form) internal symmetries are associated to groups in relativistic quantum field theory in spacetime dimension $D>2$. In particular, non-invertible symmetry structures in $D>2$ correspond to the choice of a subtheory of a unique parent one, where the symmetry is a compact group. We present a theorem that generalizes this result to higher form symmetries. We first re-formulate the DHR theorem in terms of Haag duality violations (HDV) for regions with non-trivial homotopy group $π_0$ in the finite index case. In this light, the theorem states that the category associated with such HDV is the dual of a group, and it can be extended to spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios. Then, after eliminating $π_0$ sectors via DHR reconstruction, we show that the HDV corresponding to regions with non-trivial $π_i$, $0<i<D-2$, are associated with abelian groups. Physically, the result shows that generalized order/disorder parameters in $D>2$ are labeled by such groups, in agreement with the case of confinement order parameters in Yang-Mills theories (Wilson and 't Hooft loops). For the special case of $D=4n$ and loops of dimension $k=2 n-1$, the group is further required to have a Hermitian character table. This does not rule out the possibility of an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2$ factor that is not achievable by Lagrangian gauge models. In the way we find a new proof of the group-like origin of internal symmetries, and analyze the sectors for more general regions, e.g., direct sums, knots, and links. In particular, we find that generalized knot order parameters are classified by the unknot order parameters, and the commutator of knot non-local operators is determined by the linking number.

Abstract: We revisit ADE minimal string theories, focusing on the D- and E-series minimal models coupled to Liouville theory. Unlike the A-series, whose duals are solvable two-matrix models, these theories are conjectured to correspond to unsolvable four-matrix integrals. We compute sphere four-point and torus one-point amplitudes in the AMS, DMS, and EMS via direct numerical integration over moduli space, confirming/disproving some known results and providing new data where matrix-model predictions are unavailable. From amplitudes with conformal boundaries, we find evidence for multi-matrix structure in the D-series, including scaled ramp behavior in cylinder diagrams and deviations from the ZZ-instanton sector of two-matrix models. We also perform a preliminary positivity bootstrap to constrain critical points of the multi-matrix models relevant to the DMS string.

Abstract: In asymptotically AdS spacetimes, the mathematical structure of the set of entanglement wedges reflects the algebraic structure of the underlying holographic description. For more general spacetimes, Bousso and Penington (BP) have recently proposed a generalization of entanglement wedges sharing many of the same properties as usual entanglement wedges. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that each generalized entanglement wedge can be associated with an algebra in the (generally unknown) fundamental description (in a semiclassical limit). We postulate features of the map from entanglement wedges to algebras that provide a natural algebraic interpretation for some of the basic mathematical properties of the set of entanglement wedges. Quantitatively, we suggest a possible generalization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula that associates the gravitational entropy of a generalized entanglement wedge with an entropic quantity for the associated algebra. Through this assignment, inclusion monotonicity and strong-subadditivity properties shown by BP for generalized entanglement wedges would follow from various inequalities satisfied by algebraic entropies. We include a detailed appendix reviewing relevant algebraic background, including a discussion of algebraic entropies and their inequalities.

Abstract: We study information-theoretic inequalities for holographic correlation measures $J_W$ and $D_W$, establishing rigorous topological frameworks that prove monotonicity, monogamy, and strong superadditivity. While earlier work proposed bulk duals of classical correlation and quantum discord, their information-theoretic properties were unclear. We derive multiple inequalities involving entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and show that monotonicity holds for both measured and unmeasured parties in $J_W$ and for the unmeasured party in $D_W$. Unlike their original counterparts, we find that $J_W$ is monogamous for both parties and obeys one-way strong superadditivity, whereas $D_W$ is polygamous for the unmeasured party in pure tripartite states. These results highlight distinctive features of holographic states and support a conjectured duality between $J_W$ and distillable entanglement. Motivated by the relation between EWCS and reflected entropy, we introduce boundary analogues $J_R$ and $D_R$, which serve as computable proxies for classical and quantum correlations without optimization. We analyze their inequalities, proving several and presenting counterexamples. Overall, we provide a systematic "zoo" of correlation inequalities in and beyond holography, clarifying connections among bulk geometry, discord-type correlations, and distillable entanglement.

Abstract: The non-perturbative constraints imposed by intrinsic fermionic non-invertible symmetries in 1+1 dimensional gapped systems remain largely unexplored. In this letter, we propose the superstrip algebra as a unified framework to catalog the categorical symmetry data in a massive fermionic model. The algebra and its representations explicitly encode the vacuum structure, soliton degeneracies, and their quantum numbers. As a demonstration, we apply this framework to the $\mathcal N=2$ minimal models with their least relevant deformation. We show that this specific deformation alone preserves a non-invertible superfusion category, a fermionic variant of $\text{SU}(2)_k$ known to underlie the $ADE$ classification of critical theories. Its superstrip algebra then accounts for the origin of the resulting $ADE$-type soliton spectrum and their fractional fermion number. Although our primary examples are supersymmetric and integrable, our framework itself relies on neither property, providing a new powerful tool for studying a broad class of strongly-coupled fermionic systems.

Abstract: We study how to recover timelike worldlines in AdS from CFT data as a toy model for holographically reconstructing realistic observers. We give a bulk extremization procedure that determines composite timelike-spacelike geodesics that connect timelike-separated boundary points. The total geodesic length matches the length extracted from CFT correlators at the timelike-separated points. We show agreement in Poincaré AdS, for generic boundary points in global AdS, and also for the BTZ solution, in which the timelike segment probes behind the horizon. We refine related methods to compute timelike entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and recover known results.

Conclusion: 对于$V-A$算符的情况，量子效应恢复了单元性。与类似有中间玻色子的理论的结果进行对比，发现它们具有相似的特性。

Abstract: We consider the 4-fermion scattering amplitude in massless Fermi theory. Based on the Bogolyubov-Parasyuk theorem, which guarantees locality of the counter terms, we derive the recurrence relations for ultraviolet divergences of diagrams that establish a connection between successive orders of perturbation theory. We check their validity up to three loops comparing them with explicit calculation made earlier. Then we construct the corresponding RG equation that sums up the leading logarithmic contributions in all orders of perturbation theory. Numerical analysis of these equations in the asymptotic regime $s\sim t\sim u \sim E^2 \to \infty$ is performed for two cases: the unit and the V-A operator in the fermion current. We found out that for the unit operator the high energy behaviour of the theory in the leading order is characterized by the presence of the Landau pole, while for the V-A operator the theory is asymptotically free. Therefore, in the latter case, radiative corrections restores unitarity, which is violated at the tree level. We compare the obtained behaviour of the amplitude with one in the theory with the intermediate gauge bosons and found an overlap between them.

Abstract: We explore new infrared dualities in $(2+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories involving Majorana fermions. Building on the recently proposed operator-deformation approach to bosonization dualities, we incorporate the bosonization of neutral fermions into the established web of Dirac dualities. Starting from the decomposition of a Dirac fermion into two Majorana components, we derive a hierarchy of dual bosonic descriptions based on orthogonal Chern-Simons-matter theories. This construction leads to novel boson-boson dualities, including an explicit correspondence between an $SO(N)$ theory with two real scalars and a $U(1)$ theory with one complex scalar, and their generalizations to arbitrary numbers of Majorana flavours. We analyze boundary conditions preserving chirality and demonstrate their role in matching gravitational anomalies and chiral central charges. Additional deformations yield orthogonal analogues of Ising-Gross-Neveu and pairing transitions. The resulting framework provides a unified Majorana-based extension of the three-dimensional duality web and clarifies the infrared structure of non-Abelian bosonization.

Abstract: $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS surface operator viewed as a conformal defect in rank $N$ 6d (2,0) theory is expected to have a holographic description in terms of a probe M2 brane wrapped on AdS$_3$ in the AdS$_7\times S^4$ M-theory background. The M2 brane has an effective tension T$_2= \frac{2}{ π} N$ so that the large tension expansion corresponds to the $1/N$ expansion. The value of the defect conformal anomaly coefficient in $SU(N)$ (2,0) theory was previously argued to be b$=12N- 9 - 3N^{-1}$. Semiclassically quantizing M2 brane it was found in arXiv:2004.04562 that the first two terms in b are indeed reproduced by the classical and 1-loop corrections to the M2 free energy. Here we address the question if the 2-loop term in the M2 brane free energy reproduces the $N^{-1}$ term in b. Despite the general non-renormalizability of the standard BST supermembrane brane action we find that, remarkably, the 2-loop correction to the free energy of the AdS$_3$ M2 brane in AdS$_7\times S^4$ is UV finite (modulo power divergences that can be removed by an analytic regularization). Moreover, the 2-loop correction vanishes in the dimensional and $ζ$-function regularizations. This result appears to be in disagreement with the non-vanishing of the coefficient of the $N^{-1}$ term in the expected expression for the anomaly coefficient b. We discuss possible resolutions of this puzzle, including the one that the M2 brane probe computation may be capturing the surface defect anomaly in the $U(N)$ rather than the $SU(N)$ boundary 6d CFT.

Abstract: There is an apparent contradiction in the current literature about the effect of rotation in the quark gluon plasma (QGP). While results from lattice QCD predict an increase in the confinement/deconfinement critical temperature, approximated calculations and effective models, including holographic ones, lead to the opposite result. Non central heavy ion collisions form QGPs with relativistic rotational velocities. Thereby, a great interest was drawn into the effect of rotation in strongly interacting matter. In this work, we show that the apparent contradiction is associated with the choices of observer considered in each case. We consider a holographic description of a rotating plasma using a Myers-Perry black hole. For a static observer, the result is that the confinement/deconfinement temperature decreases with the angular velocity, while for an observer co-rotating with the plasma the opposite behavior is found, in agreement with lattice calculations.

Abstract: We apply physics-informed machine learning (PIML) to solve inverse problems in holography and classical mechanics, focusing on neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving non-linear differential equations of motion. First, we introduce holographic inverse problems and demonstrate how PIML can reconstruct bulk spacetime and effective potentials from boundary quantum data. To illustrate this, two case studies are explored: the QCD equation of state in holographic QCD and $T$-linear resistivity in holographic strange metals. Additionally, we explicitly show how such holographic problems can be analogized to inverse problems in classical mechanics, modeling frictional forces with neural networks. We also explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional neural networks, offering more efficient solutions in certain cases. This manuscript aim to provide a systematic framework for using neural networks in inverse problems, serving as a comprehensive reference for researchers in machine learning for high-energy physics, with methodologies that also have broader applications in mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences.

*Kiril Hristov,Saurish Khandelwal,Yi Pang,Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We develop a consistent framework for evaluating higher-derivative actions of five-dimensional N=1 gauged supergravity with abelian vector multiplets on AdS5 using the superconformal formalism. The resulting holographic expression reproduces the trial a-anomaly coefficient of the dual conformal field theory, identifies the supergravity equations of motion with a-maximization, and establishes an exact correspondence between Chern-Simons couplings and the anomaly polynomial of the boundary theory. We apply our proposal to all known two- and four-derivative actions, including the 'off-diagonal' invariants, and argue that beyond four-derivative, all invariants yield no genuinely new contributions to asymptotically AdS5 BPS backgrounds but instead reduce to linear combinations of the established two- and four-derivative actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdS/CFT correspondence has been a powerful tool in understanding the relationship between gravity in higher dimensions and conformal field theories in lower dimensions. This paper contributes to this correspondence by providing a framework for evaluating higher-derivative actions in five-dimensional gauged supergravity on AdS5, which could lead to a better understanding of the dual conformal field theories and their anomalies.

Method: The paper uses the superconformal formalism to develop the framework. It shows that the resulting holographic expression reproduces the trial a-anomaly coefficient, suggests a relationship between Chern-Simons couplings and the anomaly polynomial, and applies the proposal to known invariants, including new 'off-diagonal' ones.

Result: The holographic expression reproduces the trial a-anomaly coefficient, identifies the supergravity equations of motion with a-maximization, and establishes an exact correspondence between Chern-Simons couplings and the anomaly polynomial. The proposal is successfully applied to all known two- and four-derivative actions, including the 'off-diagonal' invariants, and it is argued that beyond four-derivative, invariants do not contribute new information but instead reduce to combinations of the established actions.

Conclusion: The paper provides a significant advancement in understanding the relationship between five-dimensional gauged supergravity and its dual conformal field theories by developing a comprehensive framework for evaluating higher-derivative actions on AdS5. It also establishes a direct connection between Chern-Simons couplings and the anomaly polynomial, which is crucial for further studies in this area.

Abstract: We develop a consistent partially off-shell framework for evaluating higher-derivative actions of five-dimensional $\cal{N}=1$ gauged supergravity with abelian vector multiplets on AdS$_5$. Using the superconformal formalism, we show that the resulting holographic expression reproduces the trial $a$-anomaly coefficient of the dual conformal field theory, identifying the supergravity equations of motion with $a$-maximization. We present an exact correspondence between Chern-Simons couplings and the anomaly polynomial of the boundary theory. We illustrate our proposal by applying it to all known two- and four-derivative actions, including the ``off-diagonal'' invariants never before considered in the gauged supergravity literature. Finally, we argue that all invariants beyond four-derivative yield no genuinely new contributions to asymptotically AdS$_5$ BPS backgrounds, but instead reduce to linear combinations of the established two- and four-derivative actions.

Abstract: The analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix provides non-perturbative constraints on low-energy effective field theories based on the properties of high-energy theory. While the analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix is well understood, extending this framework to de Sitter space is challenging, as the expanding background complicates the definition of asymptotic states and breaks time-translation symmetry. This paper investigates how flat-space analyticity is imprinted on the de Sitter S-matrix. We derive a relation between flat-space amplitude and de Sitter S-matrix on a specific limit called the Hubble flat-space limit. Specifically, we show that the relation holds for tree-level amplitude exchanging a massive scalar field with any local derivative interactions. Finally, we argue that the flat-space limit is more compatible with the description of effective field theory, as the total energy dependence of de Sitter S-matrix becomes trivial, allowing the Mandelstam variable to be identified as the unique energy scale, just as in flat space.

Abstract: In this work we studies the long-range interactions in non-gravitational field theories and their behaviour in the deep infrared. To model such effects, we consider a nonlocal scalar theory obtained by adding a $φ\Box^{-1}φ$ term to the local action. Using the functional renormalisation group, we analyse its infrared fixed-point structure. Within the LPA, we show that nonlocality modifies phase-transition patterns and can induce symmetry breaking. Extending the LPA beyond polynomial truncations, we examine the convexity property of the effective potential as $k\rightarrow 0$ and find that the flow becomes singular for $λ^{2}>0$ before reaching the deep infrared. In the LPA$'$ framework, we find that the infrared-stable fixed point is the nonlocal Gaussian fixed point. We then generalise the model to $φ\Box^{σ/2}φ$ and analyse how the infrared properties depend on $σ$. With appropriate scaling choices, we show that the infrared behaviour remains unchanged up to $σ=d/2$ and follows Sak's prediction up to $σ=2$. Finally, we study higher-derivative cases within the LPA, focusing on $σ=4$, which corresponds to isotropic Lifshitz criticality, and obtain results consistent with earlier work.

Motivation: Understanding complexity and its relation to quantum gravity is a major goal in theoretical physics, and this work contributes to that understanding by studying a specific holographic setup.

Method: Used probe geodesic analysis in the Anabalon-Ross background, solving radial momentum and deriving analytic expressions using elliptic functions.

Result: Found oscillatory behavior in proper momentum and complexity, attributed to UV cutoff and IR end-of-space effects.

Conclusion: Supports the spread-momentum correspondence and differentiates conformal and confining dynamics in holography.

Abstract: We study holographic Krylov complexity in the Anabalon-Ross solitonic background, a top-down Type IIB solution describing a twisted-circle compactification of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM that flows to a confining, gapped three-dimensional theory. Following the proposal that the time derivative of Krylov complexity is dual to the proper radial momentum of a falling bulk particle, we analyze probe geodesics in this geometry. We obtain exact analytic solutions for the radial trajectory in terms of elliptic functions, confirming and extending UV and IR asymptotic expansions. The proper momentum and resulting complexity exhibit oscillatory behaviour, which we interpret as a holographic signature of the finite Hilbert-space truncation induced by the UV cutoff together with the IR end-of-space. Our results provide a controlled top-down test of the spread-momentum correspondence and highlight qualitative differences between conformal and confining holographic dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate two different definitions of a scalar field effective potential in quantum field theory in de Sitter spacetime: the standard textbook definition, and the constraint effective potential proposed by O'Raifeartaigh et al. in 1986. While these definitions are equivalent in Minkowski spacetime, they differ significantly in de Sitter. We demonstrate this by computing them both explicitly at one-loop order in perturbation theory. It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory. We discuss the physical interpretation of the two effective potentials. In particular, we provide evidence supporting an earlier conjecture that the constraint effective potential is the correct one to use in the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama theory.

Abstract: The IKKT matrix model, from the holographic perspective, arises at the p=-1 endpoint of the family of dualities relating type II supergravities on near-horizon Dp-brane geometries to (p+1)-dimensional super Yang-Mills theories with sixteen supercharges. In this work, we detail and expand results reported in a recent letter by establishing the holographic dictionary between gauge-invariant operators in the lowest BPS multiplet of the matrix model and the corresponding Kaluza-Klein fluctuations of Euclidean IIB supergravity compactified on the D(-1) instanton background. The full non-linear dynamics of these fluctuations can be encoded in a one-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity, which we construct explicitly. We provide its complete Lagrangian, up to second order in fermions, together with the corresponding supersymmetry transformations. We further discuss real forms of the theory for non-compact gauge groups and their embeddings into ten-dimensional supergravities with Lorentzian signature. From the analysis of the one-dimensional Killing spinor equations, we derive different classes of half-supersymmetric solutions, and discuss their uplifts as well as their relations to known solutions.

Abstract: A powerful approach to the celebrated Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model is provided by its free-field realization. However, explicit calculations of conformal blocks are not described in the literature in full detail. We begin this study with the simplest cases of the $\hat{sl}(2)_k$ and $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ WZW models, with special emphasis on their global $sl(2)$ and $sl(3)$ symmetries of the resulting correlators, which are not explicit in this formalism. Also non-trivial is the verification of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations in the $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ case, where the answers take the form of double integrals over screening charge positions and do not look like ordinary hypergeometric functions.

Result: A method is developed to obtain 3d ellipsoid partition functions from 4d SCFTs, connecting boundary VOAs to Schur sectors.

Conclusion: The work bridges 4d SCFTs and 2d VOAs through 3d topological field theories, offering new computational tools for studying these theories.

Abstract: We explore 3d $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ theories arising from twisted compactification of 4d $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ $ (G, G') $ Argyres-Douglas superconformal field theories (SCFTs), together with the 2d vertex operator algebras (VOAs) supported on the holomorphic boundary of their topologically twisted sector. Starting from the Coulomb branch BPS spectra of the $ (G,G') $ Argyres-Douglas theories, we develop a systematic and efficient method to obtain the ellipsoid partition functions of associated 3d theories using quiver mutations and wall-crossing invariants. This allows us to extract the modular data of the boundary VOAs, which are related to the Schur sectors of the 4d theories through the 4d SCFT/2d VOA correspondence. Our results provide a useful computational bridge between 4d SCFTs and 2d VOAs through interpolating 3d topological field theories.

Abstract: We present a novel, manifestly Lorentz-invariant, polynomial, and straightforwardly quantisable action for duality-symmetric gauge theories formulated using gauge potentials. Central to our construction is the identification of a harmonic higher-form symmetry which uniquely determines the field-strength and resolves the tension between Bianchi identities and dynamical equations of motion. Gauging this symmetry reproduces the flux-based description due to Sen and shows that the quantum consistency checks established for Sen's formalism are automatically subsumed by our action. Unlike Sen's flux-based formalism, our framework admits a simple minimal coupling to matter, the Witten effect, and extends readily to non-Abelian gauge fields. The new action admits remarkably simple supersymmetrisation. Using this action, we derive self-dual Yang-Mills equations from first principles and demonstrate the formalism explicitly for quantum electro-magnetodynamics in $D=4$. We also present a proof of charge quantisation that applies equally to ours and Sen's formulations.

Abstract: We explore a higher-dimensional universe that is a product of Minkowski space and the non-orientable Klein Bottle. The topology explicitly breaks important symmetries, such as translational invariance and (5+1)-dimensional CP invariance. Somewhat surprisingly, the (3+1)-dimensional cp of the Minkowski space can also be broken by the Klein Bottle, both explicitly and in the presence of a brane. The topology enforces a background of fermion correlations that amounts to a condensate wall localized in the Klein Bottle. The wall acts as an order parameter for the broken symmetries. If a brane passes through the wall, brane fermions that couple to the condensate are produced as quantified by the Bogoliubov coefficients for a time-dependent mass. The scenario meets the conditions, including cp violation, to potentially generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.

TL;DR: 研究了一维半整数QED在强外加电场下的非线性效应，计算了一阶微扰下电场的平均值并发现其满足非线性偏微分方程，显示出无耗散振荡，验证了理论结果与类经典的半经典方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子电动力学在极端条件下的行为一直是理论物理学中的重要研究领域，特别是当外加电场足够强时，系统可能会表现出非线性和量子效应。理解这些效应不仅能丰富量子场论的理论框架，还能为高能物理和量子光学等应用领域提供必要的理论支持。

Method: 我们使用了一维半整数QED的正则 boson化方法，将场论转换为包含余弦相互作用项的模型。假设外电场足够强，允许我们对质量m进行一级微扰展开。通过这一方法，我们对电场的平均值进行了量子修正，并推导出了其满足的一阶微扰解的非线性偏微分方程。

Result: 我们发现，一阶微扰下，电场的平均值满足一个与sinh-Gordon方程相关的非线性偏微分方程。通过求解该方程，我们观察到电场的振动是无耗散的，并且能够计算出精确的色波频率。此外，与半经典方法相比，我们发现半经典方法未能正确捕捉到一阶质量项对色波频率的修正。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了正则boson化方法如何在量子场论中处理强电磁场下的非线性效应。通过引入一级量子修正，我们发现与半经典方法相比，量子效应在色波频率上的修正更为显著，这为理解极端条件下的量子电动力学现象提供了新的理论视角。未来的工作可以考虑扩展到高阶微扰，并探索这些非线性效应对粒子生产过程的影响。

Abstract: In the presence of a strong electric field, the vacuum is unstable to the production of pairs of charged particles -- the Schwinger effect. The created pairs extract energy from the electric field, resulting in nontrivial backreaction. In this paper, we study 1+1D massive QED subject to strong external electric fields in a self-consistent and fully quantum manner. We use the bosonized version of the theory, which attains a cosine interaction term in the presence of nonzero fermion mass $m$. However, the assumption of strong electric field justifies a perturbative treatment of the cosine interaction, i.e., an expansion in $m$. We calculate the vacuum expectation value of the electric field to first order in $m$ and show that -- surprisingly -- it satisfies a classical nonlinear partial differential equation (related to the sine-Gordon equation). We show that the electric field exhibits dissipation-free oscillations (analogous to ordinary plasma oscillations) and calculate the plasma frequency analytically. We also compare to the semiclassical approximation commonly used to study backreaction, showing that it fails to capture the $O(m)$ shift in the plasma frequency.

Abstract: We report two types of singularities that arise from fluctuations during the formation of charge- or spin-density waves. The first is the exceptional point (EP), corresponding to a higher-order pole of the retarded Green's function. Such EPs lead to algebraic corrections in the decay of quasiparticle occupations and are observable through time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES). The second is a spectral cusp, defined by the coalescence of three extrema in the real-frequency spectral function $A(\mathbf{k}, ω)$. This cusp enforces the formation of Fermi arcs and induces a "threading" structure in the nearby band structure, both of which are directly observable in ARPES.

Abstract: We review recent transport experiments that reveal two-threshold voltage-current characteristics, marked by a significant increase in noise between the two threshold voltages, at low electron densities in the insulating regime in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, specifically in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures. The double-threshold voltage-current characteristics closely resemble those observed in the collective depinning of the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors. By adapting the model used for vortices to the case of an electron solid, good agreement with the experimental results is achieved, which supports a quantum electron solid forming in the low electron density state. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the double-threshold behavior occurs at voltages an order of magnitude lower and at significantly higher electron densities than the zero-field case. This indicates the stabilization of the quantum electron solid, aligning with theoretical predictions. Interestingly, the double-threshold voltage-current curves, indicative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime. This lack of observation does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.

Abstract: Regardless of various material design strategies, experimentally achieving substantial and controllable valley splitting in Si/SiGe quantum wells remains a central challenge for ensuring high gate uniformity. This difficulty arises from unavoidable atomic-scale disorder at the interface, caused by alloy randomness, which suppresses valley splitting and, more critically, induces large variations. Here, we demonstrate that CMOS-compatible uniaxial strain can substantially enhance valley splitting, rendering it immune to interface disorder. Atomistic pseudopotential calculations show that uniaxial strain linearly restores the valley splitting suppressed by interfacial disorder, with a large enhancement rate, while keeping disorder-induced variations within a narrow distribution. We reveal that uniaxial strain introduces a new coupling channel between bulk valleys in adjacent Brillouin zones through a small momentum transfer, which markedly reduces the susceptibility of valley splitting to interfacial disorder. These findings establish a viable route to improve gate uniformity in silicon-based spin qubits, paving the way for scalable quantum processors.

Abstract: The localisation of electrons in a lattice potential is an quantum-mechanical phenomenon and is often associated with remarkable physical properties of solids involving electron spins, electric polarisations and topological effects. In particular, even a small amount of distortion of the lattice potential can localise otherwise-delocalised quantum states in low-dimensional electron systems, dramatically influencing their thermodynamic properties and charge-transport behaviour. Study of such electron localisation induced by an aperiodic lattice potential remains exceptionally challenging in solid-state systems, since extrinsic disorders can trivially trap electrons in potential minima near disorders, obscuring the underlying quantum-mechanical origin of localisation phenomena. Van der Waals heterostructures can provide an alternative route for explorations of the phenomena via the emergence of superlattice potentials generated by rotating and stacking individual layers. Here, we report strong signatures of electron localisation in helical trilayer graphene, where the interplay of two moiré patterns gives rise to a moiré-of-moiré superlattice with distinct regions of moiré-periodic and moiré-aperiodic potentials. Remarkably, our measurements reveal the presence of double moiré-induced bands and high-order Brown-Zak oscillations, which are direct reflections of the periodic region with two constituent moiré patterns, and a superimposed anomalous hysteretic signal attributable to the aperiodic region. The data strongly suggest that electron wave functions are partially localised driven by the loss of a periodic lattice potential. Our work provides insight into the effects of spatially inhomogeneous lattice potentials on the low-dimensional electronic states and introduces a promising approach to control electron localisation for practical applications in solid-state devices.

Abstract: Defect charge-state dynamics are central to both spin-photon interfaces and photoelectrical spin readout. Despite the significance of silicon vacancies (V1/V2) in silicon carbide (4H-SiC) for both applications, their ionization behavior has remained unclear because their lack of optical blinking prevents conventional charge-state analysis. Here, we employ photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure the wavelength dependence of their excitation and ionization cross-sections. We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent. These results indicate that V2 and its surrounding environment appear more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. We also identify wavelength regimes that optimize defect-origin photocurrent for photoelectrical spin readout relative to background contributions, which differ between single-defect and ensemble measurements. Our results establish photocurrent spectroscopy as a powerful complement to optical methods, advancing the development of defect-based quantum devices.

Abstract: Miniaturization is an essential element in the development of information processing technologies and is also one of the main determinants of the usability of the tested artificial neural networks. It is also a key element and one of the main challenges in the development of magnonic neuromorphic systems. In this work, we propose a new platform for the development of these new spin-wave-based technologies. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic molecules regularly arranged on the surface of a thin ferromagnetic layer enable resonant coupling of propagating spin waves with the dynamics of the molecules' magnetic moments, opening a gap in the transmission spectrum up to 150 MHz. The gap, its width, and frequency can be controlled by an external magnetic field or the arrangement of molecules on the ferromagnetic surface. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic arrangement of the magnetic moments of molecules or clusters of molecules allows for control of the gap's position and width. Thus, the proposed hybrid structure offers reprogrammability and miniaturization down to the deep nanoscale, operating frequencies in the range of several GHz, key properties for the implementation of artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Ultrafast thermal transport in low-dimensional materials challenges traditional diffusive models due to reduced scattering, strong electron-phonon coupling, and pronounced non-equilibrium effects. To address these complexities, we extend the macroscopic multi-temperature model by incorporating non-diffusive and non-local phenomena, treating electrons, optical phonons, and acoustic phonons as coupled but thermally distinct subsystems. We benchmark this enhanced framework against the multi-temperature Boltzmann transport equation, enabling detailed resolution of branch-dependent energy relaxation and identifying bottlenecks in thermalization. This approach provides a more accurate and comprehensive description of heat flow in emerging materials, offering novel insights into phonon dynamics and electron-phonon interactions. These theoretical advances pave the way for the improved design and optimization of next-generation nanoelectronic and photothermal devices.

Modifications to the mobility equations are introduced to enable the modeling of intersubband scattering effect. The extracted models are used to enable deep-cryogenic simulations of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), showing close agreement with measurement results.

Abstract: The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) typically emerge in topological flat bands and are regarded as lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states. Conventionally, the flat-band wavefunctions that support FCIs are expected to mimic the lowest Landau level, a condition that can be quantified by the quantum-geometric indicators. In realistic systems, however, FCIs often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders, especially when the hosting flat bands not ideal. In this work, we propose stabilizing FCIs by exploiting the intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene, which naturally suppresses competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phase while FCIs are less effected. Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoiré scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems.

TL;DR: The quadrupole moments in graphene and graphite might be nearly zero and dominated by edge effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the quadrupole moments in carbon-based materials is essential for various applications, including electronic properties and material modeling.

Method: A theoretical framework was developed using the distributed multipole method basis-space iterated Stockholder atoms (BS-ISA) to analyze the quadrupole moments of carbon atoms in different carbon-based systems.

Result: Quadrupole moments for graphene and graphite were found to be near zero, and edge dipoles were identified as the main contributors to experimentally measured values of quadrupole moments in graphite.

Conclusion: The results suggest that zero quadrupole moments are realistic for infinite graphene, and finite graphene flakes may have quadrupole moments accounting for both edge dipoles and other factors.

Abstract: It is generally assumed that the carbon atoms of graphitic samples and their finite analogs have sizable quadrupole moments, with the out-of-plane component ($Q^{\rm C}_{20}$ in traceless spherical coordinates) being the dominate contribution.
  However, there is no consensus on what the quantity is for such carbon-based systems and values reported in the literature range from $Q^{\rm C}_{20} \sim -1.14$ to $+0.79$ a.u.
  In this work we propose a theoretical framework in which well-defined statements can be made about properties of atoms-in-a-molecule (AIMs) even when these properties are not experimentally observable.
  Using this framework and the distributed multipole method basis-space iterated Stockholder atoms (BS-ISA), we show that the atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene is essentially zero within the limits of precision of the numerical method used.
  We explain how the experimentally measured atomic quadrupole moment of a graphite sample determined by Whitehouse \& Buckingham likely originated almost entirely from edge dipoles, and we propose a more realistic electrostatic model for finite graphene nanoflakes.

Our results also suggest the presence of trivial long-range chiral edge current and offer a broadly applicable way to engineer transport properties in quantum Hall systems.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) are promising candidates for applications in memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing. Beyond planar films, theoretical studies predict that curvature can influence skyrmion stability by introducing effective chiral interactions. Here, we investigate skyrmion formation on self-assembled polystyrene particles coated with Pt/Co/Ta multilayers by magnetron sputtering. Vibrating sample magnetometry reveals clear differences in the magnetic reversal behavior of the curvilinear film compared to that of the planar counterpart. Using non-invasive imaging methods such as scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and high-sensitivity in-vacuum magnetic force microscopy (MFM) with low moment magnetic tipcs, we observe a maze domain pattern for the planar films while the curvilinear film reveals three-dimensional spiraling stripe states. By employing a conventional MFM operating under ambient conditions requiring a tip with a higher magnetic moment, we demonstrate that these stripe states can rupture into metastable skyrmions located at the top of the spherical particles by applying consecutive scans. Our results demonstrate that curvilinear films offer an accessible platform for stabilizing single skyrmions using local magnetic field stimuli, opening pathways to study the interplay between interfacial and curvature-induced DMIs and enabling controlled skyrmion writing on three-dimensional magnetic architectures.

Abstract: Charge Kondo circuits consist of metallic islands connected by single-mode quantum point contacts (QPCs). The island's charging energy makes these circuits tunable quantum simulators of various strongly interacting models. Here we propose a circuit that realizes the Kondo effect with effective Luttinger-liquid interactions, and show that it undergoes a localization transition in which the QPC transmission is fully suppressed below a critical value. Experimental signatures include a diverging charge susceptibility and an entropy step. Our findings open a path toward realizing localization transitions in more exotic settings.

Abstract: We investigate the phonon magnetochiral effect (PMCE) in chiral Weyl semimetals by deriving the nonreciprocal dispersion relations of both acoustic and non-polar optical phonons in the presence of a magnetic field. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann kinetic framework that incorporates Berry curvature, orbital magnetic moment, and node-dependent electronic structure, we obtain analytic expressions for the magnetic-field-induced corrections to the phonon dynamical matrix. Inequivalent Weyl nodes with distinct Fermi velocities, Fermi energies, and relaxation times generate a dynamical chiral imbalance that alters the phonon dispersion. For acoustic phonons, the formalism yields the magnetic-field-dependent corrections to the longitudinal mode, while for optical phonons we identify an optical analogue of the PMCE that produces a corresponding shift in the optical branch. Together, these results provide a unified theoretical description of how band-geometric properties of Weyl fermions influence both acoustic and optical phonon dispersions in chiral Weyl semimetals.

Abstract: We uncover a class of nonlinear odd viscoelastic effects in three spatial dimensions. We show that these dissipationless effects arise upon combining strains in two orthogonal directions, yielding momentum flow in the third direction. We demonstrate that the effect arises from nontrivial geometric tensors in quantum states, and can be scaled up with integer topological invariants. We further demonstrate that the effect fingerprints the multiband Hilbert-space geometry of underlying quantum states, as encoded in three-state geometric tensors. Our findings unravel the role of multistate geometry in viscoelastic phenomena, paving a path for experimental observation of uncharted nonlinear odd viscoelastic responses in quantum systems.

Abstract: Topologically protected Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have attracted intense interest due to their potential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation (TQC). Graphene nanoribbons, with tunable edge terminations and compatibility with planar device architectures, offer a promising alternative to semiconductor nanowires. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study of finite graphene strips with armchair, zigzag, and nearly square geometries, proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder. Using exact diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes tight-binding Hamiltonian, we analyze Majorana polarization, low-energy spectra, and real-space wavefunctions to identify the non-trivial topological phases supporting MZMs and distinguish them from from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or the quasi-Majoranas. We systematically chart the robustness of these modes across geometries and disorder regimes, finding that armchair strips with short zigzag edges provide the most stable platform. Our results unify polarization diagnostics with spatial wavefunction analysis and disorder effects, yielding concrete design guidelines for graphene-based topological superconductors.

Abstract: Our work establishes the mathematical equivalence between polymer Self Consistent Field Theory and interfacial SAFT based classical Density Functional Theory by providing an explicit proof that SCFT is the mean field (MF) or saddle point limit of a Legendre dual formulation of iSAFT CDFT. The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems.

Abstract: Topological particle-like excitations such as skyrmions and hopfions offer rich opportunities for spintronic and photonic applications. While skyrmions have been extensively studied, the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of three-dimensional hopfions remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases. These findings establish general principles for stabilizing, tuning, and assembling three-dimensional topological solitons in confined chiral systems, suggesting experimentally accessible routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control.

TL;DR: A new method to create ultra-broadband magnonic frequency combs (MFC) using a highly nonlinear, compact magnonic resonator with high intra-resonator power density, enabling more than 350 comb lines in a 450 MHz bandwidth. It is significantly more compact than conventional YIG sphere resonators, fully scalable, and highly tunable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With growing demands for compact, energy-efficient microwave signal processing solutions, traditional comb methods based on FSR-limited resonators prove insufficient. MFC offers a promising alternative, and this study advances MFC technology by introducing a novel mechanism that significantly enhances bandwidth and tunability while reducing size.

Method: The researchers employed a highly nonlinear, miniaturized magnonic resonator integrated with a slow-wave transducer to achieve high power density within a small volume. Parametric excitation of spin waves under a two-tone external drive facilitated comb generation. The system operates at relatively low power, with continuously tunable spacing across 450 MHz.

Result: The developed MFC system demonstrates exceptional performance: >350 comb lines spanning 450 MHz, tunable spacing, and a size reduction of 4-6 orders of magnitude compared to traditional YIG sphere resonators. It is highly scalable and tunable, enabling precise control of comb properties.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for new applications in microwave signal processing, neuromorphic computing, and precision sensing by offering a compact, tunable, and energy-efficient MFC platform.

Abstract: Magnonic frequency combs (MFCs) offer a promising route to compact, energy-efficient platforms for on-chip coherent microwave signal generation and processing. Conventional on-chip comb generation typically relies on nonlinear resonators supporting a series of equidistant, low-loss resonances driven by a strong monochromatic signal, resulting in fixed comb spacing defined by the resonator's free spectral range (FSR). Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism for ultrabroadband MFC generation using a highly nonlinear miniaturized magnonic resonator. The small resonator volume, combined with a slow-wave transducer, yields high intra-resonator power density, driving the system deep into the bistable regime where parametric excitation of propagating spin waves facilitates comb formation. Our approach yields more than 350 comb lines spanning a 450 MHz bandwidth, with spacing continuously tunable via a two-tone external drive, representing an order-of-magnitude enhancement over prior reports while operating at relatively low power. The platform is ultra-compact (4-6 orders of magnitude smaller in size than conventional YIG sphere resonators), fully scalable, and highly tunable, enabling precise control of comb properties through magnetic bias and pump manipulation. These results establish a new paradigm for frequency comb technology, unlocking transformative opportunities in microwave signal processing, neuromorphic computing, and precision sensing.

Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors exhibit a wide range of novel phenomena at millielectronvolt (terahertz-frequency) energy scales, including superconducting and correlation-induced insulating gaps that are frequently accompanied by symmetry breaking. However, due to the subwavelength dimensions and the often low conductivities of these systems, their intrinsic THz plasmons and meV-scale excitation gaps are difficult to access experimentally. Here we report an optical readout method that can image propagating THz-frequency collective modes in real time. The method relies on a strong coupling between the optical polarons of monolayer TMD semiconductors and the local THz fields in a waveguide, which enables us to image THz plasmons with micron scale spatial resolution and determine their propagation group velocities. Moreover, at finite magnetic fields, we observe coherent cyclotron oscillations resulting from Landau level repopulation induced by the THz field. Our findings provide a new near-field platform for probing collective excitations in strongly correlated two-dimensional semiconductors and enable "all-photonic" TMD-based architectures for time-domain THz plasmonics and optoelectronics.

Result: Intrinsic polarization, strong interactions, and SOC can drive quantum anomalous Hall states and other correlated metallic phases without an external electric field.

Conclusion: ABCB-stacked graphene offers a unique platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena through the interplay of intrinsic properties and strong correlations.

Abstract: ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.

Abstract: We realize strongly confined quantum dots (QDs) in InAs nanowires (NWs) by combining epitaxial crystal-phase control with chemical wet etching. A strong axial confinement is first introduced by growing closely spaced wurtzite (WZ) tunnel barriers in NWs to enclose a zinc blende (ZB) QD. The NW cross-section is then reduced by isotropic etching to obtain very small QDs, with a maximum observed charging energy > 30 meV. Using low-temperature electrical characterization and finite-element method simulations, we study how charging energies and the onset of electron filling scale with QD diameter. For extremely small diameters, we identify a regime where stray capacitances become non-negligible, limiting further increase in charging energy by diameter reduction alone. This approach to increasing confinement is particularly relevant for understanding the strong spin-orbit interaction observed in crystal-phase QDs, possibly linked to polarization charges at the WZ/ZB interfaces. Small diameter QDs allow considerably weaker interfering electric fields when studied, but the QDs cannot be realized with epitaxial growth alone due to a loss of crystal phase control.

Abstract: Knots, characterized by topological invariants called the Hopf number $H$, arise from the intertwining of strings and exhibit diverse configurations. The knot structures have recently been observed in condensed matters, as examplified by a magnetic hopfion, sparking interest in controlling their topology. Here, we show that spin-orbit torque (SOT) enables dynamic manipulation of the Hopf number of magnetic hopfions. We investigate the SOT-driven evolution of hopfions, revealing the splitting of a high-$H$ hopfion into multiple lower-$H$ ones, a process that can be quantified by an effective tension picture. Comparative analysis across different $H$ uncovers a hierarchy of instabilities that dictates these dynamical topological transitions. These findings establish SOT as a powerful tool for controlling hopfion topology, paving the way for potential applications in topological memory devices.

TL;DR: Hopfions, three-dimensional topological solitons, are studied through their nonequilibrium dynamics under spin-orbit torque (SOT). For H=1, SOT causes translational and precessional motion, sensitive to initial orientation. For H=2, intermediate SOT strengths can split the hopfion into two H=1 hopfions, explained by an effective tension picture. A hierarchical structure is identified, predicting dynamics for general H. Additionally, hoppification can be controlled by time-dependent SOT, enabling repeated splitting and recombination, suggesting applications in multilevel spintronic devices based on topology switching.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research explores the topology of hopfions under spin-orbit torque, which has implications for future spintronic devices. Understanding hopfion dynamics could aid in designing novel multilevel devices that leverage topology switching.

Method: The study theoretically investigates hopfion dynamics by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque. Simulations for various Hopf numbers (H=1 and H=2) were conducted to analyze the effects of SOT on hopfion behavior.

Result: The results show that spin-orbit torque significantly influences hopfion dynamics. For H=1, SOT induces both translational and precessional motion. For H=2, intermediate SOT strengths can split hopfions into two H=1 hopfions. A hierarchical structure is identified, allowing predictions for hopfion dynamics of general H. Additionally, it is shown that SOT can be scheduled to repeatedly induce splitting and recombination of hopfions.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive understanding of hopfion dynamics under spin-orbit torque and highlights potential applications in multilevel spintronic devices.

Abstract: Hopfions--three-dimensional topological solitons with knotted spin texture--have recently garnered attention in topological magnetism due to their unique topology characterized by the Hopf number $H$, a topological invariant derived from knot theory. In contrast to two-dimensional skyrmions, which are typically limited to small topological invariants, i.e., skyrmion numbers, hopfions can, in principle, be stabilized with arbitrary Hopf numbers. However, the nonequilibrium dynamics, especially interconversion between different Hopf numbers, remain poorly understood. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of hopfions with various Hopf numbers by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque (SOT). For $H=1$, we show that SOT induces both translational and precessional motion, with dynamics sensitive to the initial orientation. For $H=2$, we find that intermediate SOT strengths can forcibly split the hopfion into two $H = 1$ hopfions. This behavior is explained by an effective tension picture, derived from the dynamics observed in the $H=1$ case. By comparing the splitting dynamics across different $H$, we identify a hierarchical structure governing SOT-driven behavior and use it to predict the dynamics of hopfions with general $H$. Furthermore, we show that by appropriately scheduling the time dependence of the SOT, it is possible to repeatedly induce both splitting and recombination of hopfions. These results demonstrate the controllability of hopfion topology via SOT and suggest a pathway toward multilevel spintronic devices based on topology switching.

Abstract: Ready-to-use numerical toolbox for nanodiamond Raman spectra calculation and fit is presented. The developed theoretical approach allows accounting for arbitrary nanoparticle size-distribution and the microscopic line broadening mechanisms for the optical phonons. The two tools for solving the inverse problem of the nanodiamond properties reconstruction using a known Raman spectrum are provided. The first one utilizes a dense neural network trained on a vast array of synthetic Raman spectra. The second approach is based on the stochastic Metropolis algorithm, which updates the ensemble parameters by small quantities, tending to the state with minimal error. Both methods are available thanks to the computationally instant elasticity theory-like model for optical phonon modes in diamond nanocrystals that accurately reproduces the results of the atomistic approaches. Using experimental Raman spectra for nanodiamonds prepared by various techniques, we tested our tools and observed a faithful agreement with the data as well as between the two methods.

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides provide a platform for exploring spin-valley physics, offering a promising approach to electric-field-driven spin control for low-power spintronic and quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced spin splitting in the Q and Q' valleys of multilayer n-type WSe2 using quantum-point-contact spectroscopy. Systematic modulations in four distinct conductance quantization steps, providing direct evidence of spin-valley-layer coupling-driven spin-resolved density of states, were achieved by tuning the out-of-plane gate voltage. Notably, the electric-field-induced spin splitting significantly dominated the magnetic-field-induced Zeeman effect (e.g., ~ 6 meV for a displacement field change of ~ 0.04 V/nm vs. ~ 1 meV for a magnetic field of 9 T), demonstrating a powerful, non-magnetic manipulation of spin states. This ability to manipulate spin states by gate voltage is crucial for advancing next-generation low-power spintronic and quantum information technologies.

Motivation: Understanding the temperature dependence of spin qubits is essential for optimizing their use in quantum computing, given their potential for high operating temperatures compared to superconducting qubits.

Method: Analyzes theoretical models of spin qubit-phonon interactions and compares with experimental data to estimate the temperature sweet spot.

Result: The study reveals that phonon modes significantly affect qubit frequencies at very low temperatures, leading to a non-monotonic sensitivity. A theoretical model estimates an optimal temperature range of around 1K for maintaining qubit stability.

Conclusion: The findings shed light on the factors influencing low-temperature qubit performance, aiding in the design of more stable spin qubit systems for quantum devices.

Abstract: Spin qubits have proven to be a feasible candidate for quantum computation, and some realizations of spin qubits already benefit from advanced device manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is at the basis of the recent progress in artificial intelligence. But the progress is accompanied with increasing demands in computational resources and power supply. Reservoir neuromorphic computing uses a non-linear physical system to replace a part of a large neural network. The advantages can include reduced power consumption and faster learning. We show that the interference in an organic crystal waveguide resonator leads to efficient separation of optical patterns, allowing a significant reduction of the size of the neural network and an acceleration of the learning process. For more complex symbols, extending the reservoir output dimension thanks to spin-orbit coupling, we achieve a 10-times reduction of the network size and a 3-fold speedup. Our work suggests a general path for the performance improvement of photonic reservoir computing systems.

We show that despite the absence of constant magnetic field penetrating through the ring, in the regime of the ultrastrong light matter coupling, the total current in the ground state changes discontinuously with the light matter coupling in the direct analogy with the Aharonov-Bohm ring. We consider the driven-dissipative of the system and show that the discontinuous change of the total angular momentum can be directly probed via the spectral and statical properties of the radiation emitted by the system under weak coherent drive.

Conclusion: 我们提出了一个成功实现量子 LZT 在经典电路中的方法，展示了时变电路在模拟量子动力学现象方面的潜力。这一发现为研究更复杂的 LZT 与相关现象的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Landau-Zener tunneling (LZT) is a fundamental dynamical phenomenon, ubiquitous in various quantum systems. Here, we propose a time-varying electric circuit to address the question of whether the quantum LZT can occur in classical systems. Although the underlying differential equation of motion is quite different from the Schrödinger equation and the instantaneous frequency spectrum of the proposed circuit is not linear, the probability of the LZT in circuits (circuit LZT for short), based on our new definition for norm-unconserved systems, still follows the laws of the LZT in quantum systems, co-determined by the linear sweeping rate $α'$ and the frequency gap $Δ$, i.e., approaching the analytical value $\exp(-πΔ^2/2α')$, regardless of whether the coupling is reciprocal or nonreciprocal. The deep relationship between the circuit LZT and its quantum counterpart can be established through a linearization and block-diagonalization process. Our proposal provides a general method for simulating time-dependent quantum models using time-varying electric circuits, which has been lacking in previous studies, and paves the way for studying more complicated LZT and other dynamical phenomena in circuits and other classical systems.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A systematic framework for constructing all-bands-flat Hamiltonians with TRS-broken properties is presented, enabling the creation of states with local circulatory currents, and expanding to lattices with mixed bands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The understanding of interacting and noninteracting materials, especially those with unique electronic properties, is central to advancing condensed matter physics. The ability to engineer Hamiltonians that realize specific electronic states, such as flat bands with topological properties, is crucial for both fundamental research and potential applications in topological materials.

Method: The methodology involves introducing magnetic flux through specific plaquettes and applying local unitary transformations. This approach reconfigures the lattice geometry, converting semi-disconnected structures into fully flat bands while preserving the flux configuration. The resultant flat bands feature circulatory currents supported by the flux threading, and the approach is expanded to include lattices with mixed band structures.

Result: The framework successfully constructs ABF Hamiltonians that explicitly break TRS, supporting localized circulatory currents due to flux threading. It is shown that these flat bands can coexist with dispersive bands, each supporting both orthogonal and non-orthogonal localized states. This method provides a versatile tool for generating dispersionless lattices with controlled topological properties.

Conclusion: This work introduces a robust and systematic approach to constructing dispersionless lattices with TRS-broken properties, offering a valuable method for the design of materials with unique electronic transport and topological characteristics.

Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice Hamiltonians that explicitly break time-reversal symmetry (TRS). By threading magnetic flux through disconnected polygonal plaquettes and applying local entangling unitary transformations, we map plaquettes onto families of ABF models in one, two, and three dimensions. This procedure preserves the flux configuration while converting semi-detangled geometries into ABF lattices with nontrivial hopping structure. The resulting flat bands admit compact localized states (CLSs) whose support includes both the flux-threaded plaquettes and auxiliary sites introduced by the unitary transformations. In these TRS-broken constructions, the CLSs host localized circulatory currents whose magnitude depends on the applied flux. We further extend the framework to lattices with coexisting flat and dispersive bands, illustrating cases with both orthogonal and non-orthogonal CLSs. Our results provide a controlled route for generating dispersionless lattices supporting flux-induced local currents.

TL;DR: On-chip THz spectroscopy is used to study 2D materials, but the response can be influenced by finite-size and environmental effects. The paper identifies conditions for a genuine Drude response and introduces the Phantom-Drude response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately interpret on-chip THz spectroscopy measurements of 2D materials, it is important to account for finite-size effects and environmental influences.

Method: The paper systematically investigates the conditions under which a Drude or Phantom-Drude response is observed, considering factors like sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, and material properties.

Result: The study highlights the importance of sample dimensions, transmission line design, and material characteristics in preventing misinterpretation of on-chip THz data.

Conclusion: Understanding these factors is essential for reliable on-chip THz measurements of sub-wavelength 2D materials.

Abstract: On-chip THz spectroscopy enables quantitative measurements of the optical conductivity of sub-wavelength 2D materials by tightly confining THz fields in metallic transmission line structures interfaced to the material. However, because the probed structures are smaller than the THz wavelength, finite-size and environmental effects can strongly influence the measured response. Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances. If unrecognized, this regime can lead to misinterpretation of intrinsic material properties. We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Periodically driven Floquet-Lindblad dynamics enable the observation of topologically distinct edge modes with long lifetimes through the analysis of a Creutz ladder model, characterized by a key transition from chiral to helical damping dynamics, which provides a new way to diagnose topological phases via a polarization invariant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling the decay properties of topological phases in open quantum systems is crucial for potential applications in quantum information processing and other quantum technologies.

Method: We theoretically developed a Floquet-Lindblad framework to analyze periodically driven systems and applied it to a paradigmatic Creutz ladder model, a key system for studying topological phases.

Result: Our findings reveal a drive-induced transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, characterized by a chiral-helical damping crossover. This results in a new invariant, polarization drift, which effectively rescales the bulk localization length and allows for the dynamic isolation of boundary modes with distinct decay rates.

Conclusion: Periodic driving offers a powerful method to manipulate and study dissipative topological phases, enabling the dynamic isolation of long-lived edge modes which are otherwise difficult to observe.

Abstract: Engineering dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems is under active focus, especially in topological settings where resilient edge modes are expected to exhibit decay rates distinct from the bulk. In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.

Abstract: A quantitative description of the exchange interaction in quantum dots is relevant for modeling gate operations of spin qubits. By measuring the amplitude and frequency of exchange-driven qubit state oscillations, we measure the detuning dependence of the exchange coupling in a GaAs double quantum dot over three orders of magnitude. Both 1D and 3D full configuration interaction simulations can replicate the observed behavior. Extending a Hubbard model by including excited states increases the range of detuning where it provides a good fit, thus elucidating the underlying physics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We formulate the tight-binding model for cubic $α$-Sn based on the DFT calculations. In the model, we incorporate a variable bond angle, which allows us to simulate the effect of the in-plane strain. In the bulk, we demonstrate the presence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and a non-zero mirror Chern number, making $α$-Sn one of the rare cases where dual topology can be observed. We calculate the topological phase diagram of multi-layer $α$-Sn as a function of strain and number of layers. We find that a non-trivial quantum spin Hall state appears only for compressive strain above five layers of thickness. Quite surprisingly, both in the trivial and non-trivial phases, we find a plethora of edge-states with energies inside the bulk gap of the system. Some of these states are localized at the side surfaces of the slab, some of them prefer top/bottom surfaces and some are localized in the hinges. We trace the microscopic origin of these states back to a minimal model that supports chiral symmetry and multiple one-dimensional winding numbers that take different values in different directions in the Brillouin zone.

Abstract: We investigate the higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence in a family of chiral-symmetric Bloch Hamiltonians. These models generalize the $π$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Beyond symmetric models, we show that certain patterns of mirror-symmetry breaking induce selective boundary gap closings confined to a single boundary orientation while the bulk and other boundaries remain gapped. This mechanism extends to three dimensions, yielding hinge- and corner-selective transitions. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetry, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models.

Abstract: It is well known that tau functions of the KP hierarchy satisfy addition formulas. We consider the general addition formula in the determinant form and take a certain limit of it. It expresses certain shifts of a tau function in terms of the Wronskian determinants of wave functions at various values of the spectral parameter. As an application the relation between solutions created by vertex operators and those created by Darboux transformations is clarified. As another application the new addition formula for Riemann's theta functions of Riemann surfaces is obtained by considering theta function solutions of the KP hierarchy. This addition formula is different from any of formulas in Fay's book.

Abstract: The semiclassical limit of the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation with periodic initial conditions is studied analytically and numerically. The spectrum of the associated scattering problem for a certain class of initial conditions, referred to as periodic single-lobe potentials, is numerically computed, and it is shown that the spectrum becomes confined to the real and imaginary axes or the spectral parameter in the semiclassical limit. A formal Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin expansion is computed for the scattering eigenfunctions, which allows one to obtain asymptotic expressions for the number, location and size of the spectral bands and gaps. The results of these calculations suggest that, in the semiclassical limit, all excitations in the spectrum become effective solitons. Finally, the analytical predictions are compared with direct numerical simulations as well as with numerical calculations of the Lax spectrum, and the results are shown to be in excellent agreement.

### [181] [Electronic Transport Switching by Electric field Driven Tautomerism in Single and Fused Metal-free Benziporphyrins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21727)
*Yenni P. Ortiz,Arnau Cortés-Llamas,Jordi Ribas-Arino,Stefan T. Bromley*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the impact of tautomerism on the behavior of metal-free benziporphyrins, both as three-state molecular switches and as molecular wires with enhanced conductance when fused. The study shows how adjusting the symmetry and structure of the porphyrin affects its electronic properties and scalability for applications in molecular devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic properties of porphyrins, especially their tautomeric states, is crucial for designing molecular devices such as switches and wires.

Method: Density functional theory and quantum electron-transport calculations were used to analyze the statistical distribution of tautomers and their transport characteristics under different electric fields.

Result: The research reveals that applying moderate electric fields can influence tautomer distribution and transport properties, enabling the porphyrins to act as three-state switches and multi-state registers. Fusing two porphyrins increases the complexity of tautomeric states and enhances conductance, suggesting potential applications in molecular electronics.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into the design of tailored porphyrin-based molecular devices by manipulating tautomer states and demonstrating scalable structures for multistate applications.

Abstract: The capacity of many metal-free porphyrins (MFPs) to exhibit different H-bonded tautomers provides a platform for exploring the effects of reversible molecular changes on electronic transport. On-surface and molecular junction experiments have shown that tautomerism in single MFPs can be controlled by the magnitude of the current passing through them. Such conductance-based results confirm the potential for tautomeric switching but are not easily translated into device applications, where faster electric-field-gated switching is generally preferred. Previous work has focused on highly symmetric MFPs with four identical pyrrole rings, in which tautomers correspond to different H-N configurations of two protons. Here, we consider a synthesized metal-free benziporphyrin in which one pyrrole ring is replaced by a phenol moiety. This modification lowers the symmetry and increases the tautomer-dependence of the electronic state. The structural anisotropy of benziporphyrins also enhances their selective response to applied E-fields. Here, we use density functional theory and quantum electron-transport calculations to assess: (i) the statistical distribution of three distinct benziporphyrin tautomers under different applied E-fields, and (ii) the transport characteristics of each tautomer. We find that moderate E-fields can influence the tautomerism and that each tautomer exhibits distinct transport signatures, confirming that single metal-free benziporphyrins have potential to act as three-state molecular switches. By fusing two benziporphyrins, we show that the larger manifold of tautomeric states retains distinct transport signatures, opening the way to multistate molecular registers. Finally, we show that fused benziporphyrins can also act as molecular wires with enhanced conductance relative to a single unit.

Abstract: The discovery of next-generation photoinitiators for two-photon polymerization (TPP) is hindered by the absence of large, open datasets containing the quantum-chemical and photophysical properties required to model photodissociation and excited-state behavior. Existing molecular datasets typically provide only basic physicochemical descriptors and therefore cannot support data-driven screening or AI-assisted design of photoinitiators. To address this gap, we introduce QuantumChem-200K, a large-scale dataset of over 200,000 organic molecules annotated with eleven quantum-chemical properties, including two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections, TPA spectral ranges, singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) energies, toxicity and synthetic accessibility scores, hydrophilicity, solubility, boiling point, molecular weight, and aromaticity. These values are computed using a hybrid workflow that integrates density function theory (DFT), semi-empirical excited-state methods, atomistic quantum solvers, and neural-network predictors. Using QuantumChem-200K, we fine tune the open-source Qwen2.5-32B large language model to create a chemistry AI assistant capable of forward property prediction from SMILES. Benchmarking on 3000 unseen molecules from VQM24 and ZINC20 demonstrates that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy over GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B, and the base Qwen2.5-32B model, particularly for TPA and ISC predictions central to photoinitiator design. QuantumChem-200K and the corresponding AI assistant together provide the first scalable platform for high-throughput, LLM-driven photoinitiator screening and accelerated discovery of photosensitive materials.

Abstract: We extend the rigorous adiabatic coupled-channel formalism to ultracold nonreactive atom-molecule collisions in the presence of an external magnetic field. The wavefunction of the collision complex is expanded in adiabatic basis states obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for the adiabatic Hamiltonian (the total Hamiltonian of the collision complex minus the radial kinetic energy) on a grid of atom-molecule distances $R$. The resulting coupled-channel equations are solved using the diabatic-by-sector method. We show that the adiabatic approach provides accurate cross sections for cold and ultracold Mg ($^1$S) + NH ($^3Σ^-$) collisions in a magnetic field with ~2 times fewer channels than the standard diabatic basis. We further develop an efficient $R$-dependent basis truncation protocol (RBT), in which the elements of the log-derivative matrix are sampled and discarded as it is propagated from small to large $R$. While RBT can be applied in both the adiabatic and diabatic bases, we show that the adiabatic basis can be reduced to just the open channels at long range, leading to an overall computational gain of ~15-30 for the propagation part of the calculation. The gain is particularly significant in situations where substantial errors in the calculated cross sections ($<$50\%) can be tolerated or long-range interactions are involved, making the adiabatic basis formulation a promising approach to strongly anisotropic collisions and chemical reactions in the presence of an external magnetic field.

Abstract: Entangled photons have attracted increasing interest as resources for developing time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Theoretical studies suggest that their non-classical correlations enable time-resolved spectroscopy with monochromatic pumping and can selectively isolate specific Liouville pathways in nonlinear optical signals. In an earlier study, we proposed a fluorescence detection scheme that could, in principle, be implemented using existing single-photon detectors [Y. Fujihashi et al., arXiv:2502.02073 (2025)]. In that design, the time origin was defined by detecting the arrival of the pulsed laser used to pump the nonlinear crystal for spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a requirement that made the overall experiment cumbersome. This study theoretically examines an alternative protocol that defines the reference time based on the arrival of idler photons. We demonstrate that this idler-referenced scheme functions effectively when the entangled photons exhibit either negative or negligible frequency correlations. Eliminating the pump-timing channel simplifies the optical layout and lowers the experimental barrier to realizing time-resolved two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with entangled photons. Although the photons may exhibit frequency correlations in isolation, their frequency-time degrees of freedom can behave as effectively uncorrelated when considered over the full measurement timescale. Therefore, fully exploiting non-classical correlations requires an entangled photon source whose temporal characteristics are carefully matched to the overall timescale of the experiment.

TL;DR: A simple linear model for estimating basis set incompleteness errors (BSIE) in QP energies is developed, utilizing only the kinetic energy of the orbitals. The model is applied to G_0W_0, qsGW, and vertex-corrected QP energies for over 100 molecules, achieving extrapolation errors between 20 and 30 meV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop accurate and efficient methods for estimating basis set errors is crucial for reliable electronic structure calculations and materials property predictions.

Method: A linear model relating BSIE to kinetic energy of orbitals is introduced. The model parameters are determined using high-precision CBS limit reference data from multi-zeta basis sets. Extrapolation is performed to TZ basis set limit, evaluating error margins.

Result: The model successfully predicts QP energies with errors bounded between 20 and 30 meV across diverse molecules. It outperforms conventional inverse linear dependence assumptions, even at lower basis set levels.

Conclusion: This study paves the way for robust, computationally efficientBSIE estimation in GW and DFT calculations, enhancing the reliability of electronic structure simulations.

Abstract: We present a simple linear model to estimate the basis set incompleteness errors (BSIE) of (vertex-corrected) $GW$ QP energies based on the kinetic energy of the corresponding orbital only. We parametrise the model for $G_0W_0$, quasi-particle self-consistent $GW$ (qs$GW$), and vertex-corrected ($Σ^{BSE}@L^{BSE}$) QP energies on a large set of molecules containing 10 different elements for which we calculate complete basis set (CBS) limit extrapolated reference values with correlation-consistent basis sets ranging from triple- to hextuple-$ζ$ (TZ/6Z). Based on these accurate reference values, we obtain model parameters for Gaussian-type and Slater-type orbital (GTO/STO) basis sets which allow for the extrapolation of QP energies calculated with TZ basis sets to the CBS limit with errors of 20 to 30 meV. Analysing extrapolation errors, we show the commonly used extrapolation method which assumes an inverse linear dependence of the BSIE on the inverse number of basis functions to be valid, but to produce larger errors, even when a quadruple-$ζ$ calculation is used in the extrapolation.

Conclusion: 溶剂分离的离子配对作用是LiCl水-盐溶液中电双层异常行为的关键因素。该研究揭示了电双层在超浓电解质中的浓度依赖性强行为，并为提高水储能材料的电容性能提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The structure and thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL) at carbon electrodes strongly influence electrochemical performance, yet remain poorly understood in super-concentrated aqueous electrolytes. Here we combine classical and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations to resolve the interfacial organisation of aqueous LiCl from dilute to water-in-salt (WiS) (1--$20~\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$) concentrations at graphitic electrodes, and compare with electrochemical differential-capacitance measurements from which the potential of zero charge (PZC) is obtained. We uncover a concentration-driven restructuring of the EDL: below $6~\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$, solvated Li$^+$ dominates the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), but at higher concentrations co-adsorption of Cl$^-$ through solvent-separated ion pairs enforces a near 1:1 Li:Cl ratio at the interface. This transition expands the effective EDL thickness, redistributes the interfacial potential drop, and drives a decrease in the PZC, matching the trend inferred from differential-capacitance measurements on electrolyte-graphite interfaces. Capacitance calculations reveal that while both EDL and quantum contributions vary strongly with concentration, their opposing trends make the total capacitance appear nearly constant for pristine few-layer graphite; for electrodes with smaller quantum capacitance, however, the concentration dependence of the EDL capacitance would be directly reflected in the total capacitance. Solvent-separated ion pairing is identified as the key driver of anomalous EDL behaviour in LiCl WiS electrolytes, establishing design considerations for tuning interfacial capacitance and stability in next-generation aqueous energy-storage systems.

### [187] [How Thermostats Influence Dynamics Across Time Scales: A Systematic Study from Fast Motions to Slow Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22631)
*Frederick Heinz,Sascha Jähnigen,Joana-Lysiane Schäfer,Bettina G. Keller*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Dynamical properties from molecular dynamics simulations are sensitive to thermostats; NVE deterministic thermostats maintain NVE reference data best, while stochastic thermostats with longer coupling times distort dynamical properties. Thermostats with shorter coupling times can synchronize simulations with NVE, but over longer observation periods, their effects become significant. Choosing the appropriate thermostat scheme depends on the required accuracy of dynamical properties and sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling thermostatting artifacts in molecular dynamics simulations is critical for accurate modeling of dynamical properties in liquids of varying complexity.

Method: A systematic evaluation of different thermostatting methods was conducted by analyzing time-correlation functions for observables such as vibrational spectra, velocity and pressure autocorrelations, diffusion coefficients, shear viscosities, and Markov state models across various liquids.

Result: Deterministic thermostats and velocity-rescale dynamics closely reproduce NVE reference data. Strongly coupled stochastic thermostats (tau <1 ps) systematically distort dynamical properties. Moderate stochastic coupling (tau =1 ps) restores near-NVE behavior while maintaining canonical sampling.

Conclusion: Our findings provide practical guidelines for selecting appropriate thermostat schemes in molecular dynamics simulations to ensure accurate dynamical properties and efficient sampling.

Abstract: Reliable dynamical properties from molecular dynamics simulations require careful control of thermostatting artifacts. We systematically assess how NVE, deterministic thermostats, velocity-rescale dynamics, and stochastic Langevin-type thermostats affect time-correlation functions across liquids of varying complexity. The analysis spans vibrational spectra, velocity and pressure autocorrelations, diffusion coefficients, shear viscosities, and Markov state models. Deterministic thermostats and velocity-rescale dynamics closely reproduce NVE reference data over all observables. In contrast, strongly coupled stochastic thermostats (tau less 1 ps) systematically distort dynamical properties. By constrast, moderate stochastic coupling (tau eq. 1 ps) restores near-NVE behavior while maintaining canonical sampling. Our results provide practical guidelines for selecting thermostat schemes when accurate dynamical properties or Markov models are required.

Abstract: In molecular simulations, machine-learning force fields can achieve ab initio accuracy at a lower cost but remain limited in the explicit modeling of electrons. In this work, we develop an electron-aware machine-learning force field, in which an excess electron of interest is modeled quantum mechanically, while the remaining short-range interactions and long-range Coulombic forces are machine-learned to reproduce a density functional theory calculation. We demonstrate the method on the solvated electron in bulk water and its reaction with a hydronium ion. We identify a proton transfer mechanism by which the excess proton recombines with the electron. We determine the forward reaction rates between 350 K and 450 K from first-passage survival functions, which yield an Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy of 3.2 kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$, in good agreement with experiment. From an enhanced sampling simulation, we determine the equilibrium constant, and thus the reaction free energy, which is also consistent with experimental measurements.

Abstract: The development of next-generation electrochemical energy storage requires devices that combine the high energy density of batteries with the power capability and long cycle life of supercapacitors. However, the interfacial phenomena governing performance in these systems remain poorly unified. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanoscale film formed by electrolyte decomposition, is well studied in batteries but its counterpart in supercapacitors has received limited systematic investigation despite growing experimental evidence. This review argues that SEI formation is a universal electrochemical process that occurs whenever electrode potentials drive electron transfer into electrolyte orbitals beyond their stability limits, independent of whether charge storage is Faradaic or non-Faradaic. Differences between battery SEIs and supercapacitor interphases arise mainly from operating conditions, not fundamental chemistry. Engineered interphases created through electrolyte additives, protective coatings, or surface functionalization suppress leakage currents, improve capacitance retention, and enable stable high-voltage operation. By identifying shared mechanisms and establishing transferable design rules, this unified framework provides a foundation for predictive interphase engineering that supports long-lived, high-performance energy-storage technologies.

TL;DR:  Portable optical clocks have the potential to achieve sub-picosecond timing instability, but current methods for disseminating and comparing these signals are insufficient, particularly over open-air paths. This paper proposes using optically derived millimeter-wave carriers for time-frequency links, achieving a one-second residual instability of 2x10^-15 and demonstrating a free-space frequency comparison link with a one-second instability of 10^-14. Technical and systematic uncertainties are characterized to support future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-precision timing systems in applications such as positioning, navigation, radar, and fundamental physics experiments drives the search for novel methods to achieve sub-picosecond timing stability. Portable optical clocks hold promise, but current techniques fall short in terms of scalability and reliability over open-air paths.

Method: The paper introduces an architecture for synthesizing 90 GHz millimeter waves with an average residual instability of 2x10^-15 and demonstrates a phase-stabilized free-space frequency comparison link in the millimeter-wave band with an instability of 10^-14. The authors also investigate and characterize technical and systematic uncertainties to support their approach.

Result: The proposed method achieves the desired sub-picosecond timing instability and demonstrates a robust free-space frequency comparison link, overcoming the limitations of existing techniques. This opens up new possibilities for practical applications and future research in time and frequency transfer.

Conclusion: The development of optically derived millimeter-wave carriers for time-frequency links represents a significant step forward in achieving reliable and scalable sub-picosecond timing systems. The characterized uncertainties provide a solid foundation for advancing time and frequency transfer experiments involving distributed portable optical clocks.

Abstract: Robust and portable optical clocks promise to bring sub-picosecond timing instability to smaller form factors, offering possible performance improvements and new scenarios for positioning and navigation, radar technologies, and experiments probing fundamental physics. However, there are currently limited methods suitable for broadly disseminating the sub-picosecond timing signals or performing frequency comparison of these clocks--particularly over open-air paths. Established microwave time transfer techniques only offer nanosecond level time synchronization, whereas optical techniques have challenging pointing requirements and lack the capability of all-weather operation. In this paper, we explore optically derived millimeter-wave carriers as a time-frequency link for full utilization of the next generation of portable optical clocks. We introduce an architecture that synthesizes 90 GHz millimeter waves with a one second residual instability of 2x10^-15, averaging into the 10^-17 range. In addition, we demonstrate a first-of-its-kind 110 m phase-stabilized free-space frequency comparison link over a millimeter-wave band with a one second instability in the 10^-14 region. Technical and systematic uncertainties are investigated and characterized, providing a foundation for future time and frequency transfer experiments among distributed portable optical clocks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIMFormer, a novel reconstruction framework for structured illumination microscopy (SIM) that learns a data-driven prior to surpass the theoretical resolution limit of SIM by approximately 45-200 nm, achieving resolutions down to 45 nm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses the limitations of SIM, which are fundamentally limited by diffraction, and introduces a novel approach to overcome this limitation by leveraging machine learning.

Method: The authors propose a fully blind reconstruction framework called SIMFormer. The method uses self-supervision to learn a powerful prior directly from raw image data without requiring labeled training data. This prior is then used to regularize the solution of the inverse problem of reconstructing high-resolution images from band-limited data.

Result: The framework, particularly its self-distilled variant SIMFormer+, shows significant improvements in resolution and noise robustness. The method is validated on both synthetic and real datasets, including the BioSR dataset, demonstrating its ability to resolve sub-nanometer features that were previously thought to require STORM-level resolution.

Conclusion: This work opens a new direction for solving the inverse problem in SIM by learning from raw data. The approach is effective, efficient, and scalable, showing promising applications in various fields such as cellular imaging and live-cell imaging.) 

Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a wide-field super-resolution technique normally limited to roughly twice the diffraction-limited resolution ($\approx 100$--$200$~nm). Surpassing this bound is a classic ill-posed inverse problem: recovering high-frequency structure from band-limited raw data. We introduce SIMFormer, a fully blind SIM reconstruction framework that learns a powerful, data-driven prior directly from raw images via self-supervision. This learned prior regularizes the solution and enables reliable extrapolation beyond the optical transfer function cutoff, yielding an effective resolution of approximately 45~nm. We validate SIMFormer on synthetic data and the BioSR dataset, where it resolves features such as flattened endoplasmic reticulum lipid bilayers previously reported to require STORM-level resolution. A self-distilled variant, SIMFormer+, further improves noise robustness while preserving high resolution at extremely low photon counts. These results show that learned priors can substantially extend SIM resolution and robustness, enabling rapid, large-scale imaging with STORM-level detail.

Abstract: Period-averaged electromagnetic spin angular momentum is a well-established quantity for monochromatic fields, governing phenomena such as light-matter interactions with chiral particles and spin-orbit coupling effects. In contrast, the spin angular momentum of non-monochromatic fields remains unexplored. Here, we extend the concept of optical spin to the domain of non-monochromatic electromagnetic fields. Through this formulation, we uncover the precessional dynamics of electromagnetic spin in specific polychromatic configurations, including the superposition of circularly and linearly polarized plane waves propagating orthogonally at different frequencies, as well as fields generated by a precessing magnetic dipole. We discover that the dynamics of the electromagnetic spin in these cases obeys a Landau-Lifshitz-like equation establishing a profound parallel between dynamics of magnetization and photonic spin.

TL;DR: Monolayer MoS2 has limitations in optical signals due to its atomic thickness but can be enhanced with Au nanoparticles for stronger photonic responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of monolayer MoS2 in photonic applications and explore their potential in optoelectronic and related technologies.

Method: Sub-band gap photons generate photocurrent when Au nanoparticles are deposited on MoS2. The Au nanoparticles enhance the light-matter interaction via localized surface plasmons, leading to supercontinuum generation and efficient resonant energy transfer from Au nanoparticles to MoS2.

Result: The photocurrent generated by Au nanoparticles exceeds an order of magnitude that of two-photon photocurrent in monolayer MoS2.

Conclusion: This method holds great potential for applications in detecting near-infrared photons and advancing optical telecommunication technologies due to the enhanced photonic signal.

Abstract: Monolayer MoS$_2$ is a direct band gap semiconductor with potential applications in optoelectronics and photonics. MoS$_2$ also has a large optical nonlinearity. However, the atomic thickness of the monolayer limits the strength of the measured functional signals, such as the photocurrent or photoluminescence, in optoelectronic devices. Here, we show that photocurrent in monolayer MoS$_2$ can be induced by sub-band gap photons by depositing Au nanoparticles on it. In this system, the nonlinear light-matter interaction in Au nanoparticles enhanced by the localized surface plasmons results in the generation of supercontinuum, which is reabsorbed by MoS$_2$ due to efficient resonant energy transfer. Au nanoparticle assisted photocurrent is more than an order of magnitude larger than two-photon photocurrent in monolayer MoS$_2$. Optimization of the shape, size and composition of the nanoparticle has the potential to enhance the photocurrent significantly with the prospect of applications in the detection of NIR photons, and related technologies including optical telecommunication.

Abstract: Active control of optical nonlinearity is essential for advancing next-generation electronics and photonics, including high-speed wireless communications, optical information processing, and nonlinear signal manipulation. However, achieving tunable nonlinearity at terahertz (THz) frequencies faces significant challenges due to the lack of materials that combine high nonlinear responses with strong sensitivity to external stimuli in this spectral regime. Here, we show giant modulation of THz nonlinearity by optically tailoring the valley degree of freedom in semiconductor-based metasurfaces. Mediated by the resonant behaviors of metasurfaces, photoexcited electrons transition into different valleys in the conduction band in response to the driving THz field, with the transition rate controlled by light intensity. Since THz nonlinearities vary significantly with electron dynamics in different valleys, various nonlinear effects-such as nonlinear transmission and generation-can be efficiently enhanced and modulated within a single metasurface using weak optical pumping. With optical energy as low as a few picojoules, we achieve on-off switching of THz third harmonic generation with a modulation depth exceeding 20000%, along with effective tunability of its nonperturbative behaviors. Our approach breaks new ground in active THz devices fully compatible with semiconductor industry standards, indicating a promising building block for ultrafast THz signal processing, all-optical computing, and nonlinear optical elements.

Our proposed method simplifies the design process while maintaining high efficiency， offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for low-frequency sound absorption. This innovation provides a new direction for designing compact yet effective acoustic absorption materials and systems.

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective method for low-frequency broadband acoustic absorption. The absorber consists of two concentric space-coiling resonators with distinct resonance frequencies, with the inner resonator characterized by a low-quality factor (Q) and the outer resonator by a high Q factor. The coupling between the two resonators enables efficient broadband absorption within a deep-subwavelength range exceeding 15 times the structural thickness. Numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and experimental measurements demonstrate that highly efficient (greater than 80 percent) low-frequency broadband absorption is achieved in the range of 198-315 Hz, as well as a 58 percent fractional bandwidth spanning 183-334 Hz. Furthermore, with the outer dimension fixed, adjusting the parameters of the internal resonators enables flexible tuning of the absorption band across a broad frequency range. This work presents a powerful design methodology that eliminates the need for traditional complex spatially arranged multi-resonator assemblies. By employing a single class of resonant units, thin and efficient broadband absorbers can be achieved, offering various application prospects in the field of low-frequency sound absorption.

Abstract: The theory of the method of magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy in reflected light (RMCD) has been developed using a simplified scheme without an analyzer, with the use of an additional mirror in the optical system and with the application of the method of phase modulation of the light wave using a photoelastic modulator. An additional mirror reflector, together with the mirror surface of the sample, forms a double mirror located between the pole pieces of a powerful laboratory electromagnet. The presence of an additional mirror leads to mixing of the amplitude ($ΔR/R$) and phase ($Δφ$) RMCD-components in the amplitudes of the signals at the first and second harmonics of the phase modulation. It is shown that the RMCD spectroscopy technique using a simplified scheme and an additional mirror requires the synchronous measurement of three electrical signals proportional to the amplitudes of the corresponding terms in the expression for the total intensity of monochromatic radiation detected by the photodetector: a constant signal $V_{dc}$ and high-frequency amplitudes $V_f$ and $V_{2f}$ at phase modulation frequencies $f$ and $2f$. The ratios $V_f/V_{dc}$ and $V_2f/Vdc$ determine a system of linear equations for $ΔR/R$ and $Δφ$ with known ellipsometric parameters $\tanΨ$ and $Δ$ of the additional mirror, which are found either from additional measurements using an ellipsometer or directly (in sity) using the RMCD spectrometer itself.

TL;DR: Two-dimensional semiconductors exhibit strong excitonic transitions and are used to explore light-matter interactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop compact and efficient photonic metasurfaces with high-quality factors for applications like integrated optics and two-dimensional material platforms.

Method: The method involves fabricating a metasurface based on hBN, utilizing radially distributed asymmetry to create bound states in the continuum (BIC). Multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations are added to enhance resonance quality. The hBN structure is integrated with WS₂ monolayers to achieve exciton-photon coupling.

Result: The researchers successfully create a metasurface with a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 μm² and significantly higher Q-factors compared to previous designs. Integration with WS₂ monolayers enhances photoluminescence and exhibits discrete momentum-space patterns, indicating successful generation of hybrid photonic-excitonic states.

Conclusion: This work presents a scalable approach for generating hybrid states in 2D materials, opening possibilities for exciton localization, valley emission, and compact luminescent devices.

Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), exhibit strong excitonic transitions at room temperature and offer a unique platform for exploring light-matter interactions in nanoscale photonic systems. In this work, we demonstrate a compact and polarization-invariant photonic metasurface, fabricated from hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) and based on radial bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are formed by radially distributed pairs of structurally asymmetric resonators. The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $μm^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint. By integrating the hBN photonic structure with a WS$_2$ monolayer, we observe enhanced photoluminescence when its resonance is spectrally aligned with the exciton resonance, accompanied by signatures of discrete momentum-space patterns that identify the orbital-angular-momentum-carrying ring eigenmodes. These features persist over a wide range of excitation powers and show minimal linewidth broadening, indicating robust and spatially modulated exciton-photon coupling. This work establishes a scalable approach for generating hybrid photonic-excitonic states with momentum-space structure, offering new opportunities for exciton localization, valley emission, spatially programmable light-matter interaction in two-dimensional material platforms and compact luminescent devices based on 2D material-integrated metasurfaces.

Abstract: Fabry-Pérot based photoacoustic tomography (FP-PAT) is a promising all-optical imaging modality for a wide range of preclinical and clinical applications. However, there exist several challenges in routinely applying FP-PAT in time-critical experiments. Among those, the need for spectral tuning of the laser between each scan position can severely limit the effective imaging speed. Here, we present an interrogation trajectory optimization approach which allows to increase the overall speed in a way that is independent of the type of interrogation laser used as well as the FP quality. Our approach provides a way to tackle speed degradation caused by hardware limitations and simplify the use of FP-PAT systems.

Here, we overcome this challenge by revealing that wave dynamics in translation-symmetric lattices intrinsically performs convolution, with the dispersion relation uniquely defining the complex-valued kernel. Leveraging this universal principle, we develop a convolutional architecture of minimal complexity through wave evolution in programmable photonic synthetic lattices, delivering high-throughput, multifunctional capabilities at a rate of 13.5 tera-operations per second (TOPS) for image processing. Beyond convolution acceleration, the kernel's complex nature facilitates the photonic simulation of both irreversible diffusion and reversible unitary quantum dynamics under classical incoherent excitation. Capitalizing on the physics-based reversibility and undetectable phase information, we demonstrate a novel convolution-driven optical encryption strategy. This work establishes a unified framework for photonic computing by grounding convolution in wave dynamics, opening avenues toward scalable, multifunctional photonic processors with high integration potential.

Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy offers unparalleled opportunities in sensing through chemically specific detection of molecular absorption fingerprints. Yet, its practical applications are limited by the weak light-matter interaction in the mid-IR range and low brightness of mid-IR light sources. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy addresses the sensitivity limitations by leveraging resonant photonic structures, in particular, plasmonic and frequency-selective dielectric metasurfaces. However, current implementations of SEIRA approach mainly rely on complex instruments and scanning components such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and tunable external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC QCLs). Here, we present a compact and high-throughput imaging-based SEIRA platform that combines broadband gradient metasurfaces with a radiofrequency-modulated QCL that generates remarkably broad instantaneous emission spectrum (250 cm$^{-1}$) covering absorption bands of multiple distinct molecular vibrational modes. By matching the resonance spectrum of the compact (1 mm$^2$) broadband gradient metasurface with the laser emission projected on its surface through a dispersive element, we ensure that every QCL spectral component is uniquely addressed for an efficient targeted enhancement of the electromagnetic field. This enables us to use a low-cost and room-temperature mid-IR camera, acquiring in a single frame the enhanced absorption signatures of analytes deposited on the metasurface as a barcode image, thus reducing the acquisition time by up to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the FTIR and EC QCL based measurements. Eliminating the need for tunable light sources, bulky spectrometers, and expensive low-temperature detectors, our approach enables high-throughput, miniaturized, and highly specific molecular diagnostics for diverse chemical and biological applications.

Abstract: Microring resonators (MRRs) are fundamental building blocks of photonic integrated circuits, yet their dynamic reconfiguration has been limited to tuning refractive index or absorption. Here, we demonstrate acoustic control over optical path topology on a lithium niobate on sapphire platform. By launching gigahertz acoustic waves into a hybrid phononic-photonic waveguide, a dynamic Bragg mirror (DBM) is created within the optical path, coupling forward and backward propagating light. Employing a pair of coupled MRRs, we achieve strong coupling between supermodes of the photonic molecule with only milliwatt-level drive power, yielding a cooperativity of 2.46 per milliwatt. At higher power, DBM reflectivity up to 24% is achieved, revealing breakdowns of both the photonic molecule picture and perturbative coupled mode theory, indicating the transformation toward Mobius strip topology. Our work establishes a new dimension for controlling photonic devices, opening pathways toward fully reconfigurable photonic circuits through acoustic drive.

Abstract: Holography can reconstruct immersive light fields for virtual and augmented reality by modulating optical wavefront. Due to huge pixel sizes, current spatial light modulators (SLMs) have small field-of-view (FOV) for holographic displays. Despite various methods for etendue expansion, the largest full-screen FOV for dynamic holography is only 70 ° X 70 °, which remains insufficient for large-scale, high-resolution, three-dimensional displays. Here, we report a pixel-interpolation-assisted holographic meta-projector that substantially expands the FOV by integrating multiple subwavelength metasurface pixels within each microscale pixel of a traditional SLM. Leveraging large-angle diffraction of the metasurface and implementing k-space distortion correction for ultra-wide angles, we experimentally demonstrate dynamic holographic image reconstruction with a FOV of 160 ° X 160 ° -equivalent to a system numerical aperture of 0.985-at a high framerate of 60 Hz, surpassing the temporal resolution threshold of human vision. This system represents the state-of-the-art near-full-screen holographic dynamic display, thereby opening the door to high-dynamic-range and large-FOV holographic displays.

Abstract: Entangled photons are fundamental resources for quantum communication, computing, and networking. Among them, polarization-entangled photon pairs play an important role due to their straightforward state manipulation and direct use in quantum key distribution, teleportation, and network protocols. However, realizing compact, efficient, and scalable polarization-entangled sources that meet the requirements of practical deployment remains a major challenge. Here, we present a simple yet high-performance on-chip polarization-entangled photon-pair source on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our device employs dual quasi-phase matching (D-QPM) that sequentially supports type-0 and type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a single nanophotonic waveguide, eliminating the need for interferometers, polarization rotators, or other complex circuits. The source directly produces high-fidelity Bell states with broad bandwidth, high brightness, and low noise. Using this integrated platform, we realize wavelength-multiplexed entanglement distribution in a four-user quantum network deployed over metropolitan fiber links up to 50 km. These results establish a robust and scalable pathway toward practical quantum communication systems and multi-user quantum mesh networks based on integrated photonics.

Abstract: Photonic molecules support the excitation of higher-order states, which are otherwise hard to access at individual waveguides. In this work, we demonstrate the resonant excitation of photonic molecular states which evanescently couple to single-mode waveguides. We implement the experiments on femtosecond laser written photonic structures and demonstrate an efficient resonant excitation of higher-orbital states, optimized at specific wavelengths and propagation distances. We suggest the use of long photonic molecules as long-distance photonic links, and demonstrate strong coupling for very distant waveguides separated by 127 μm. We apply this concept to a one-dimensional lattice and demonstrate the excitation of topological edge states emerging due to the third-order next-neighbour interactions. Our findings demonstrate effective long-range evanescent coupling which could be a concrete solution for fiber-based photonic chips, topological physics emerging from long-range interactions, or fundamental studies of initially uncoupled systems.

Result: Er:Gd₂O₃ thin films show exceptional material gain (78.3±2.1 dB/cm) and on-chip net gain (13 dB) in a 6-mm-long waveguide at 2.3 K, with maintainable gain up to room temperature. Demonstrated continuous-wave lasing at low threshold, narrow linewidth, and high side-mode suppression ratio.

Conclusion: Er:Gd₂O₃ is identified as the first monolithic, integrating crystalline gain medium directly on silicon, enabling scalable and high-performance cryogenic and quantum photonic circuits.

Abstract: On-chip erbium-doped optical amplifiers and lasers are essential for realizing fully integrated active silicon photonic circuits, but their performance has been limited by the low gain of amorphous host materials and the difficulty of direct integration on silicon. Here, we demonstrate optical amplification and lasing from erbium-doped single-crystal gadolinium oxide (Er:Gd$_2$O$_3$) thin films epitaxially grown on silicon. Optical gain measurements on waveguides fabricated on this platform exhibit a giant material gain of $78.3\pm2.1$ dB/cm and an on-chip net gain exceeding 13 dB in a 6-mm-long waveguide at 2.3 K, while a measurable gain is maintained up to room temperature. Continuous-wave lasing with low threshold, narrow linewidth, and large side-mode suppression ratio is also demonstrated in Er:Gd$_2$O$_3$ microring resonators. These results establish Er:Gd$_2$O$_3$ as the first monolithic crystalline gain medium directly integrated on silicon, providing a scalable route toward high-performance cryogenic and quantum photonic integrated circuits.

Abstract: Entangled photon-pair sources are indispensable building blocks of quantum information processing technologies. Among the available approaches, on-chip microresonators are particularly promising owing to their resonant enhancement, CMOS-compatible fabrication, and wafer-scale integration capabilities. In this study, we optimized the structure of silicon microring resonators to suppress sidewall scattering. As a result, we achieved an intrinsic Q-factor of 1.26$\times$10$^6$ using only standard fabrication processes. The high-Q resonator enabled a brightness coefficient of 3.9$\times$10$^9$ Hz/GHz/mW$^2$, with a maximum brightness of 22.0 MHz/GHz and a maximum photon-pair generation rate of 9.19 MHz. Furthermore, Franson-type two-photon interference exhibited a visibility of 98.0$\pm$0.2%, confirming time-energy entanglement. These results show that narrow bandwidth and high generation rate can be achieved simultaneously in CMOS-compatible silicon photonic sources, advancing their use in quantum repeaters.

Abstract: Ghost imaging leverages a single-pixel detector with no spatial resolution to acquire object echo intensity signals, which are correlated with illumination patterns to reconstruct an image. This architecture inherently mitigates scattering interference between the object and the detector but sensitive to scattering between the light source and the object. To address this challenge, we propose an optical diffraction neural networks (ODNNs) assisted ghost imaging method for imaging through dynamic scattering media. In our scheme, a set of fixed ODNNs, trained on simulated datasets, is incorporated into the experimental optical path to actively correct random distortions induced by dynamic scattering media. Experimental validation using rotating single-layer and double-layer ground glass confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our scheme can also be combined with physics-prior-based reconstruction algorithms, enabling high-quality imaging under undersampled conditions. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for imaging through dynamic scattering media, which can be extended to other imaging systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The traditional integer-pixel displacement search algorithm of digital image correlation method has low computational efficiency and has been gradually eliminated, and some intelligent optimization algorithms have their own strengths and weaknesses. The white shark optimizer has excellent global search capabilities. However, its calculation is cumbersome, programming complex and inefficient. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the white shark optimizer, it is improved by using the Tent map, introducing the dynamic nonlinear time factor, setting the automatic termination condition and adding the three-step search method. The improved white shark optimizer is applied to the integer-pixel displacement search. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sub-pixel displacement calculation, an improved surface fitting method is proposed by combining bicubic interpolation, improved white shark optimizer and surface fitting method. Through grayscale interpolation, the distance between the fitting points is reduced, and the accuracy of search of the surface fitting method is further improved. The performance of the improved white shark optimizer and the improved surface fitting method is tested by simulated speckle pattern. Test results revealed that the computational efficiency of the improved white shark optimizer is comparable to that of the particle swarm optimization, and the search success rate is as high as 100%. The calculation accuracy of the improved surface fitting method is comparable to that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm, but the computational efficiency is much higher than that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Finally, the tensile experiment of low-carbon steel is used to verify the feasibility of the improved surface fitting method in actual measurement.

Abstract: Meeting the escalating demands of data transmission and computing, driven by artificial intelligence (AI), requires not only faster optical transceivers but also advanced integration technologies that can seamlessly combine photonic and electronic components. Traditional approaches struggle to overcome the parasitic limitations arising from fabricating those components using different processes. Here, we report a novel 3D heterogeneously integrated optical receiver based on micro-transfer printing (μTP), enabling the co-integration of a compact bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) electronic chiplet (0.06 mm2) directly onto a silicon photonic integrated circuit (SiPIC). While previous μTP demonstrations have focused primarily on photonic integration, our work pioneers the direct integration of electronics and photonics, significantly enhancing performance and scalability. The resulting optical receiver achieves 224 Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) operation, delivering -5.2 dBm optical modulation amplitude(OMA) sensitivity at a bit-error rate (BER) of 2.4 x 10-4, a record-small footprint, and an excellent power efficiency of 0.51 pJ/b. This demonstration not only showcases the potential of μTP for high-density, cost-efficient integration but also represents a critical step toward next-generation optical interconnects in the AI era.

Conclusion: The integration of machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, presents a promising solution to enhance the fidelity of 2PP fabrication processes, moving beyond traditional iterative correction methods.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing using 2-Photon Polymerization (2PP, aka direct laser writing DLW) enables the fabrication of almost arbitrary complex 3D structures from the meso to the submicron scale. However, deviations between the anticipated target structure and the actual print often occur due to physico-chemical processes, limiting the accuracy and reliability of this technology. To minimize these deviations, we hereby present our latest research in developing different neural networks, targeting the above-mentioned aspect. Our networks are trained on several experimental as well as theoretical datasets and show good results in predicting fabrication deviations and (pre-) correcting 2.5D micro-structures. Hence, we demonstrate, that besides conventional iterative correction methods, neural networks are a promising alternative to significantly improving the output quality in DLW. Furthermore, there are no fundamental limitations to transferring this machine learning approach to other 3D printing technologies, as they all face the same challenge in terms of fidelity. To our point of view, the use of neural networks has the potential to enhance the capabilities of this technology, enabling the creation of complex structures with increased accuracy and precision in the near future.

Abstract: We demonstrate optical bistability in an erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) using a low saturation intensity covalent organic framework (COF) saturable absorber (SA). The COF-SA satisfies the free-energy criterion for bistability, enabling switching among non-lasing, continuous-wave, and mode-locking states. Two optical bistability regions are observed, including a distinctive direct mode-locking to non-lasing transition during pump down-sweep, absent in previous EDFL studies. Stable soliton-like pulses and stepwise pulse-number hysteresis further indicate first-order phase-transition-like dynamics. These results show that low-saturation intensity SAs offer a compact route to bistability-assisted pulse formation in fiber lasers.

Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical investigation of double-slit diffraction under coherent illumination by three plane waves: one normally incident and two symmetrically angled at plus/minus theta. By imposing an edge-zero condition on the incident field, we derive compact closed-form Fresnel expressions written solely in terms of standard Fresnel integrals. The framework generalizes straightforwardly to an arbitrary number of incident plane-wave components, enabling intuitive control of the transmitted angular spectrum through interference engineered at the aperture. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the closed-form model and characterize the influence of slit geometry, wavelength, partial coherence, and Gaussian beam width. We also discuss experimental feasibility and highlight potential applications in apodization, structured illumination, beam shaping, and multiplexed sensing. Overall, the results show that multi-wave coherent illumination provides a simple and tunable route to tailoring diffraction patterns and generating propagation-robust field profiles.

These instabilities, observed in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, manifest as topological reconnections of mode branches, delayed mode stabilization, and scalar mode dominance, which together enhance weak static mode splittings into observable signatures, linking gravitational symmetry breaking to non-Hermitian spectral physics. This offers new ways to test modified gravity theories using gravitational wave observations.

Motivation: The paper addresses the fundamental question of how quantum gravitational effects can manifest in the macroscopic realm, particularly in black hole physics and gravitational wave observations. By introducing environmental perturbations and studying their impact on quasinormal modes, the research seeks to detect signatures of modified gravity theories, providing insights into the nature of spacetime and quantum gravity effects through observable phenomena.

Method: The research employs a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Analytically, it studies the dynamics of quasinormal modes in))/(Schwarzschild)/(black holes under environmental perturbations in the context of dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. Numerical methods involve solving the perturbed black hole equations of motion and analyzing the resulting mode instabilities and their impacts on gravitational wave signals.

Result: The key findings include the identification of three unique phenomena—topological reconnections of mode branches, delayed mode stabilization, and scalar mode dominance—which are absent in classical general relativity. These dynamical features lead to the amplification of weak static mode splittings into observable spectral signatures. The research establishes a direct connection between gravitational symmetry breaking and non-Hermitian spectral physics, demonstrating that such instabilities could be a source of detectable signatures in gravitational wave astronomy.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for testing theories of modified gravity by incorporating environmental drivers into black hole physics and gravitational wave observations. The discovery of mode instabilities associated with parity violation provides a measurable framework for addressing fundamental questions about the quantum nature of gravity and its deviations from classical general relativity.

Abstract: We propose a dynamical amplification mechanism for detecting symmetry breaking in black holes through environmentally driven spectral instabilities of quasinormal modes. Focusing on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as a paradigm for parity violation, we perturb the Schwarzschild background with a localized potential bump. Our analysis reveals three distinctive phenomena absent in general relativity: 1) topological reconnections of mode branches, 2) counterintuitive mode stabilization that delays overtaking transitions, and 3) scalar mode dominance emerging at intermediate coupling strengths. These dynamical features amplify weak static splittings into observable signatures, establishing a connection between gravitational symmetry breaking and non-Hermitian spectral physics. Our framework provides new pathways for testing modified gravity theories through gravitational wave observations.

TL;DR: We created a numerical framework to study 5D black hole shadows, using ray tracing and visualization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding shadow properties of higher-dimensional black holes and their dependence on observer position provides insights into spacetime geometry and black hole physics.

Method: Backward ray tracing with observer position control and visualization techniques like surface contouring and reflection difference maps.

Result: The framework validates spherical symmetry in Schwarzschild-Tangherlini, shows hypershadow dependence on observer position and spin, and offers size reduction and displacement measures.

Conclusion: The framework is adaptable for studying exotic objects like black rings.

Abstract: We develop a fully numerical framework to compute and visualize the \emph{hypershadow}\cite{Novo:2024wyn}, the three-dimensional generalization of the black hole shadow in five-dimensional spacetimes. Our method is based on backward ray tracing and allows flexible control over observer position, enabling the reconstruction of the full shadow volume. For visualization, we combine discrete sampling with surface contouring and introduce reflection difference maps on central slices to quantify mirror symmetries. Applying this method to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini and Myers-Perry geometries, we validate the former's spherical symmetry and systematically discuss the hypershadow's dependence on observer position and black hole spin parameters. We also provide compact quantitative measures for size reduction and global displacement, revealing clear monotonic trends.The framework is readily extendible to other metrics and opens the way to numerical studies of more exotic objects, such as black rings and their prospective toroidal hypershadows.

Motivation: 研究$f(R)$引力中的对称性和守恒量对理解空间时间结构和引力作用具有重要意义，尤其是在Reissner--Nordström黑洞的动态中，对称性的存在意味着特定的守恒量，这对于分析物理行为和解的有效性至关重要。同时，采用Noether和Mei两种方法，可以更全面地研究系统的对称性，揭示更深层次的物理特性。

Abstract: We study the symmetries and conserved quantities in $f(R)$ gravity for the static, spherically symmetric Reissner--Nordström spacetime using two complementary frameworks: Noether symmetries and Mei symmetries. Starting from a canonical Lagrangian for radial metric functions and the curvature scalar $R$, we derive the associated Hamiltonian and show that the Legendre map is regular whenever both the first derivative of $f(R)$ with respect to $R$ and the second derivative with respect to $R$ is non-zero. Within Noether's approach (variational and Lie-derivative forms), we obtain general, canonical, and internal symmetry classes and identify explicit generators; for the quadratic model $f(R)=R^{2}$ these include radial translations and scaling symmetries. We then formulate Mei symmetry conditions as invariance of the Euler--Lagrange equations under the first prolongation, which yields an overdetermined partial differential equation (PDE) system for the generator components. Solving this system for $f(R)=R^{2}$, we find eight independent Mei generators and construct the corresponding conserved currents, some without a direct Noether analog. The analysis demonstrates that Mei symmetries extend the standard Noether framework for higher-order Lagrangians and provide additional conserved quantities relevant to black-hole dynamics in modified gravity. We conclude with a comparison of the two symmetry schemes and outline applications to broader $f(R)$ models and to rotating spacetimes.

Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be important sources for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of late-time tails in gravitational radiation from merging spin-aligned eccentric binary black holes, using high-accuracy point-particle black hole perturbation theory simulations. We simulate the late-time evolution of 15 binary black hole mergers with mass ratio $q = 1000$, dimensionless spins $χ= [-0.9, -0.6, 0.0, 0.6, 0.9]$ and eccentricity at the last stable orbit $e_{\rm LSO} = [0.8, 0.9, 0.95]$. We track the tail amplitudes and exponents up to a retarded time coordinate $t = 9000M$ after merger for the six spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes $(2,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,3)$, and $(4,4)$ employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. We note that the tails are increasingly pronounced for binaries with high eccentricity $e_{\rm LSO}$ and large negative spin $χ$. We find that the overall late-time exponents closely approach their predicted asymptotic values ($p=-\ell-4$ for Weyl curvature scalar $ψ_{4,\ell m}$ where $\ell$ is the spin-weighted spherical harmonic index), while estimates restricted to the latest portion of the data exactly recover them. We further verify numerically that modes with the same spherical index $\ell$ share identical tail exponents, while variations in $m$ do not affect the tail behavior. Our analysis framework is publicly available through the gwtails Python package.

Abstract: The multi-messenger detection of the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 has revolutionized the field of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, several important questions remain to be answered. One of these is the nature of the compact remnant leftover by GW170817 (short- or long-lived NS versus black hole). A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks. This framework can be used to identify the most promising regions of parameter space in which to concentrate search efforts, helping design future search strategies to optimally balance search sensitivity and related parameter space gridding schema against computational cost.

Abstract: The mass transfer process is prevalent during the inspiral phase of compact binary systems. Detection of gravitational waves from the inspiral phase of binaries with white dwarfs will allow us to measure the mass transfer rate. Mass transfer effects provide additional contributions to the phase of gravitational waves, which can break the degeneracy between binary masses and redshift. Based on the analytic mass transfer rate to the first order post-Newtonian evolution of orbital angular frequency, we use the Fisher matrix to forecast the ability of DECIGO to measure the redshift of compact binaries with mass transfer. We conclude that for compact binary systems containing white dwarfs, the redshift can be determined to an accuracy of $10\%$ for $z=0.01$ with a $SNR\thicksim 30$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The purpose of this paper is to explore the existence and properties of black hole solutions in modified Einstein-Yang-Mills systems, which have implications for our understanding of gravitational and gauge field interactions.

Method: The authors used a combination of analytical and numerical methods to investigate the properties of black hole solutions in both Abelian and non-Abelian cases.

Result: The paper found that in the Abelian U(1) case, static spherically symmetric black holes include the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom solutions as special cases. Additionally, a stealth Schwarzschild solution with electric hair was identified, but magnetic hair is not possible in the U(1) gauge case. In contrast, non-Abelian SU(2) stealth solutions can sustain both electric and magnetic hair. The SU(2) black hole can admit non-Abelian configurations with arbitrary integer magnetic parameters, unlike conventional SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes which require a unit magnetic parameter for non-Abelian contributions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the mimetic extension of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system allows for a richer variety of black hole solutions with unique hair-like properties, particularly in the non-Abelian SU(2) case where arbitrary integer magnetic parameters are permissible.

Abstract: We investigate black hole solutions in the mimetic extension of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, in which the Yang-Mills term is constrained to be constant. In the Abelian U(1) case, we find a static spherically symmetric solution that includes the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes as special cases. Moreover, we identify a stealth Schwarzschild solution with an electric hair. We show that it is impossible to have magnetic hair in the U(1) gauge case, while, in contrast, the non-Abelian SU(2) stealth solutions can sustain both electric and magnetic hair. Unlike the conventional SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills black hole, which requires a unit magnetic parameter to exhibit nontrivial non-Abelian contributions, the stealth mimetic SU(2) solution admits genuinely non-Abelian configurations with arbitrary integer magnetic parameter.

Abstract: Based on the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism, we investigate the kinematic images of plasma before and after magnetic reconnection in Kerr-Anti-de Sitter(Kerr-AdS) black holes. Following a brief review of the Comisso-Asenjo process in Kerr-AdS black holes, we introduce the hotspot model and the imaging method. Building upon these foundational theories, we obtain the trajectory of the plasma and the temporal evolution of the hotspot images. It is found that there are three flares within the observing time, which is driven by the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism. We also discuss the influence of the cosmological parameter on the hotspot imaging. The results indicate that the hotspot image enlarges as the absolute value of $Λ$ increases, demonstrating that the cosmological constant significantly affects the hotspot.

Using ray tracing, we examine light deflection, the structure of direct emission, lensing rings, and photon rings, and we explore three thin-disk emission models--starting at the ISCO, at the photon sphere, and at the event horizon--together with static and infalling spherical accretions. Larger values of this parameter enlarge the shadow, move all optical features outward, and suppress the observed intensity through gravitational redshift, with additional dimming produced by Doppler effects for infalling matter

Abstract: We study the retrograde second caustics of extremal Kerr black holes, where the intensity of the light beam is infinitely magnified. We find that the caustics of different polarized beams are split by as much as $10^{-3}$rad by an external black hole for a suitable range of parameters. A lensing black hole at several lys away separates the polarized beams about $10^{12}$m apart. This splitting is larger than the radius of the Earth. Therefore, an observer on Earth would see different circularly polarized light according to their location. The polarization will change while the detector is wandering around. Thus, the polarization of light beams can be an important quantity in retrolensing observations.

Abstract: We investigate the charging process of a rotating Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically uniform magnetic field of strength $B_{0}$. In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal "saturation charge" $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the "attracted" charge exceeds the upper bound for the "repelled" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.

Abstract: We investigate gravitational perturbations, quasinormal modes, grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections of the recently proposed regular and asymptotically flat black hole supported by a Dehnen-type dark-matter halo. This geometry provides a remarkably simple analytic model of supermassive black holes embedded in galactic environments, having a lapse function $
f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}, $
[R. A. Konoplya, A. Zhidenko, 2511.03066]. The regularizing parameter $a$ is the characteristic scale of the halo. We compute the quasinormal spectrum for both axial "up" and "down" perturbations using the WKB method and verify the results through time-domain integration. The two sectors are no longer isospectral, and the deviations grow with the halo scale parameter. The grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections are extracted via standard scattering boundary conditions and the WKB approach, and their behaviour is fully consistent with the structure of the effective potentials. Altogether, our analysis demonstrates that a dark-matter halo imprint induces modifications in the gravitational response, while the employed approximation schemes remain sufficiently accurate for quantitative predictions. At asymptotically late times, the presence of the halo does not alter the Price-law decay, which remains identical to that of a Schwarzschild black hole in vacuum.

Abstract: Theories of emergent gravity have established a deep connection between entropy and the geometry of spacetime by looking at the latter through a thermodynamic lens. In this framework, the macroscopic properties of gravity arise in a statistical way from an effective small scale discrete structure of spacetime and its information content. In this review we begin by outlining how theories of quantum gravity imply the existence of a minimum length of spacetime as a general feature. We then describe how such a structure can be implemented in a way that is independent from the details of the quantum fluctuations of spacetime via a bi-tensorial quantum metric $q_{αβ}(x, x')$ that yields a finite geodesic distance in the coincidence limit $x\rightarrow x'$. Finally, we discuss how the entropy encoded by these microscopic degrees of freedom can give rise to the field equations for gravity through a thermodynamic variational principle.

Abstract: Spacetimes in general relativity can be uniquely decomposed into a set of multipole moments. Given the usefulness of moments in the categorisation of radiation patterns, tidal deformations, and other phenomena associated with compact objects, a number of studies have explored their construction in beyond-Einstein theories of gravity. It is shown here that uniqueness does not necessarily extend across theories: by comparing a few static and spherically-symmetric solutions in different theories, we find that two distinct objects can possess the same Geroch-Hansen moments. Moreover, two metrics can match and yet take different moments. Implications of this result are explored in the context of black-hole shadows and ``universal'' relations hinging on moment computations.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the thermodynamic aspects of a modified version of Rastall's gravity theory and its implications for cosmological scenarios. We analyze the role of non-conserved energy-momentum tensor equations and investigate their influence on particle production within an irreversible thermodynamic framework. By introducing a novel Lagrangian, we derive modified field equations and establish their relationship with matter production, both with and without entropy generation. Our analysis focuses on ideal fluid models and extends to spatially flat LFRW cosmologies, providing key equations that govern energy density, pressure, and curvature dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a bouncing cosmological model, in which the universe undergoes cycles of contraction and expansion, avoiding the singularity associated with the Big Bang. Our results indicate that this bouncing scenario is feasible within the Rastall-like gravity framework, supported by particle production processes and stability conditions. The violation of energy conditions near the bounce point further confirms the consistency of this alternative cosmological model. The present work is focused on the theoretical foundations and internal consistency of the model; possible observational implications will be addressed in future investigations. We conclude that the proposed theory offers a coherent phenomenological approach to matter production and provides new insights into non-standard cosmological evolution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In gravitational theories containing matter fields and higher-derivative corrections, the standard Smarr formula often fails unless all dimensionful couplings are incorporated consistently. Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics.

### [232] [Electromagnetic radiation from circular orbits in Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22611)
*João P. B. Brito,Rafael P. Bernar,Luís C. B. Crispino*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates the electromagnetic radiation from a charged particle orbiting a four-dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole. We calculate the probability amplitude and spectral distributions for the emitted power, and find that the electromagnetic power is approximately twice that of a scalar field with conformal coupling for low angular velocity orbits, whereas scalar fields with minimal coupling can even exceed the electromagnetic power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely to explore the effects of electromagnetic fields in strong gravitational fields near black holes, comparing them with scalar field emission. This paper compares these emissions in different coupling scenarios and spacetimes. The investigation also includes spectral distributions and synchrotron emission, with a focus on the broader frequency spectrum of electromagnetic emissions compared to scalar fields.

Method: The method involves using a semiclassical approach to calculate the probability amplitude for a charged particle emitting a photon, and then deriving the emitted power and spectral distributions for both scalar and electromagnetic cases in Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Schwarzschild spacetimes.

Result: The main results are that the electromagnetic power is approximately twice that of a scalar field with conformal coupling for low-velocity orbits, similar to Schwarzschild spacetime. However, for minimal coupling, the scalar power can exceed the electromagnetic power. Additionally, the electromagnetic case has a much broader frequency spectrum, with a noticeable contribution from lower angular momentum (multipole) states, and there is the potential for synchrotron emission from orbits near the photon sphere.

Conclusion: The conclusions are that the electromagnetic power from a charged particle orbiting a black hole can be significantly higher than the power emitted by scalar fields, depending on the coupling. The spectra also differ, with electromagnetic cases having a broader range of frequencies and the possibility of synchrotron emission. These results extend our understanding of electromagnetic radiation in the vicinity of black holes and have implications for gravitational wave detection and astrophysical observations near compact objects.

Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a charged particle orbiting a four-dimensional Schwarzschild--de Sitter black hole using a semiclassical approach. We calculate the probability amplitude for the charged particle to emit a photon, from which we derive the emitted power and spectral distributions. The results are compared with those obtained for scalar fields, considering both minimal and nonminimal coupling, as well as the corresponding electromagnetic case in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is found that the total electromagnetic power is approximately twice that of the scalar field with conformal coupling for orbits with low angular velocity, similar to the Schwarzschild case, whereas for minimal coupling, the scalar power can even exceed the electromagnetic power. We also investigate the spectral distributions and possible synchrotron emission by orbits near the photon sphere. The electromagnetic case has a much broader frequency spectrum, with a non-negligible lower multipole contribution.

Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations of the four-dimensional, traversable wormhole solution of Maldacena, Milekhin, and Popov(arXiv:1807.04726). The geometry is constructed by matching an asymptotically flat, near-extremal Reissner--Nordström region to a throat described by $AdS_2 \times S^2$, supported by charged massless fermions. We derive the effective scalar potential governing wave dynamics, which when viewed in the tortoise coordinate, exhibits two extremely sharp and widely separated barriers. These barriers form a resonant cavity and are a direct consequence of the near-horizon geometry of the wormhole mouths. Using time-domain integration, we analyze the wormhole's response to an initial scalar wave packet inside the throat. We find that the late-time signal contains a distinct train of echoes whose amplitude depends on the angular momentum number $l$. We show that higher $l$ modes produce significantly stronger echoes, as the corresponding potential barriers are taller and more reflective, which results in more efficient trapping of the wave within the wormhole throat.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art approaches to black hole (BH) dynamics, encompassing several effective approximation schemes, offer a remarkable control of the quantitative aspects of strong gravity. They also provide key insights into some qualitative aspects of the problem. In spite of this, there remain blind spots that hinder the understanding of the mechanisms underlying some observed phenomena, in particular concerning simplicity and universality in BH spacetimes. Adopting an 'asymptotic reasoning' approach, by filtering non-essential degrees of freedom, can potentially unveil universality patterns by identifying key underlying structural stability mechanisms. We first illustrate such an asymptotic approach by focusing on a BH quasinormal (QNM) Weyl's law, that accounts for the universal asymptotics of the QNM "counting function". This permits to identify light-trapping and the (local) redshift effect as the underlying mechanisms, also offering a bridge to the universal patterns found in BH QNM spectral instability. As a by-product, Weyl's law universality formally opens an observational access to spacetime (effective) dimensionality. More heuristically, we sketch a program recently put forward to apply such 'asymptotic reasoning' to address the observed simplicity and universality patterns in binary BH merger dynamics. This program is built as a hierarchy of asymptotic models, potentially making contact with integrability theory in gravity, namely through the background sector in a "wave-mean flow" approach to BH binary dynamics.

Abstract: Infinite towers of higher-order corrections to General Relativity have been proposed as a mechanism to resolve singularities in early-universe cosmology and black holes, in a variety of settings. In this work, we consider an infinite tower of higher-order Proca corrections inspired by dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. We find that the Big Bang singularity present in General Relativity is replaced by an inflationary epoch. Furthermore, the Lovelock-Proca tower allows for regular planar black hole solutions and spherically symmetric black holes with primary hair.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of particle creation from accelerating mirrors is crucial for interpreting forthcoming analog Hawking radiation experiments such as AnaBHEL. However, realistic experimental setups render the associated Bogoliubov integrals analytically intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the Inertial Replacement Method (IRM), a hybrid analytic-numerical framework for computing Bogoliubov coefficients for general moving-mirror trajectories. The IRM replaces the asymptotically inertial portions of a trajectory with analytic inertial extensions, so that numerical evaluation is required only for the finite accelerating segment. We derive perturbative error bounds for both perfectly and imperfectly reflecting mirrors, providing controlled accuracy estimates and guiding the choice of segmentation thresholds. The method is validated against analytically solvable trajectories and then applied to a fully numerical, PIC-based Chen-Mourou plasma-mirror trajectory relevant to the planned AnaBHEL experiment. A key physical insight emerging from this analysis is that the radiation spectrum is determined almost entirely by the finite accelerating region, with negligible sensitivity to the far-past and far-future inertial motion. These results establish the IRM as a reliable and broadly applicable computational tool for modeling particle creation in realistic analog-gravity systems such as AnaBHEL.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can encode valuable information about the properties of the intervening lens, yet most existing studies remain restricted to the small-deflection, weak-field regime. To bridge this crucial gap, this work presents the first systematic analysis of strong-field, wave-optical GW lensing by a Kerr black hole (BH), extending recent results for non-rotating lenses obtained in Chan et al. to the astrophysically more relevant case of spinning lens. Using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism, we compute the strong-field scattering factor (SFSF) and show that the the spin produces characteristic modifications to the lensed waveform, and high-frequency incident radiation is not strongly absorbed by the BH lens, contrary to earlier claims in Chan et al. We further derive an explicit expression for the observed waveform for the general source-lens-observer configuration, showcasing the distortions produced by the scattering and quantifying their departure from the Schwarzschild case. Specializing to on-axis scattering, a mismatch analysis for a \texttt{GW150914}-like source lensed by a Kerr BH of mass $M=10^2M_\odot$ situated $100GM/c^2$ away from the source reveals percentage-level deviations from the direct (unscattered) wave at scattering angles near $30^\circ$, across a range of lens spin values. The mismatch exhibits a sharp decrease at larger scattering angles. For a fixed scattering angle, however, the mismatch shows only a weak dependence on the BH spin in the case of on-axis scattering, which may improve for more general off-axis considerations. The framework developed here offers a unified treatment of strong-field GW scattering in Kerr spacetime and provides tools for interpreting future high-precision observations of compact-object lenses in the wave-optics regime.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the signatures of Lorentz violation in Horava gravity through thin-disk images and polarization simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of Lorentz violation in gravitational theories, particularly in the context of black hole physics and high-precision observational tests.

Method: Utilized a backward ray-tracing method to simulate photon paths and polarization features around rotating black holes in the Horava gravity framework under a thin-disk accretion model.

Result: The Lorentz violation parameter l significantly impacts the inner shadow, brightness asymmetry, and polarization properties of the thin disk. A decrease in l leads to more elliptical and untilted inner shadows, while an increase in l produces a more leftward D-shaped critical curve. l also affects the distribution of polarized intensity and direction, particularly near the critical curve. The sign of l influences the angular velocity of the black hole, with positive l enhancing it and negative l suppressing it.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that future high-resolution EHT observations, combining thin-disk images and polarization patterns, could offer valuable insights into the LV effect and testing Horava gravity.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the observable signatures of Lorentz violation (LV) in low-energy Horava gravity by simulating the images and polarization features of rotating LV black holes using a backward ray-tracing method. Within a thin-disk accretion model and the ZAMO framework, we numerically solve the geodesics equation of photon and simulate the corresponding thin-disk images and polarization patterns. The results show that the LV parameter l strongly affects the inner shadow, brightness asymmetry, and polarization properties of the thin disk. The decrease of l leads to a more elliptical and untilted inner shadow, while increasing l produces a pronounced leftward D-shaped structure of the critical curve. In addition, the variation of l alters the distribution of polarized intensity and polarization direction, especially near the critical curve. Moreover, it also shows that a positive l enhances the black hole's angular velocity, while a negative one suppresses it, indicating that the sign of l determines the trend direction of the LV effect. These findings suggest that future high-resolution EHT observations combining the thin-disk images and polarization patterns could provide valuable tests of the LV effect.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how scalar fields affect black hole singularities is key to exploring spacetime's structure and the nature of singularities.

Method: Mathematical analysis of scalar field perturbations in Hayward spacetime, examining weak and strong field behaviors.

Result: Inner horizons either collapse to zero size or vanish, creating singularities at thresholds of field strength and profile parameters.

Conclusion: This suggests a transition in black hole singularities governed by scalar field properties, proposing new insights into spacetime singularities and their scaling behaviors.

Abstract: Regular black holes, free of central singularities, provide an ideal laboratory for probing the geometric structure of spacetime. The global structure of some regular black holes, e.g. Hayward black hole, features an event horizon and a Cauchy horizon, raising fundamental questions about the latter's stability. In this work, we investigate collapse of a scalar field in Hayward spacetime. Under weak scalar perturbations, the inner horizon maintains a stable finite radius. In the circumstance of a strong scalar field, the inner horizon shrinks to zero volume, accompanied by the formation of a spacelike singularity. The Hayward geometry is effectively converted into a Schwarzschild-like geometry. Furthermore, the strength of the scalar field governs the contraction dynamics of the inner horizon. As the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field approaches the critical threshold ${p_*}$, the radius of the inner horizon ${r_{-}}$ exhibits a universal scaling behavior: ${r_{-}}\propto{|p - {p_*}|^γ}$, with a critical exponent $γ\approx 0.5$.

Conclusion: 这项研究扩展了Price定律适用于更强的时序度量，并为与不同维度和时空结构相关的非线性波方程提供了新的见解。这些发现对于深入理解引力波和静态或动态黑洞的行为具有重要意义。

Abstract: We prove the global leading-order late-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions to inhomogeneous wave equations on dynamical black hole exterior backgrounds that settle down to Schwarzschild backgrounds with arbitrarily small decay rates. In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power.
  Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time "tails", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.
  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions.

We offer interpretations of the period during which the Kontsevich-Segal criterion holds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  understanding quantum entanglement in inflationary perturbations is important for testing quantum origins of the universe and distinguishing between Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions.

Method:  use standard momentum-space techniques to analyze inflationary perturbations, specifically focusing on comoving curvature perturbation. They employ Entanglement Distance to quantify entanglement and compare Gaussian and cubic perturbations.

Result:  cubic perturbations generate more quantum correlations, and the Entanglement Distance is proportional to the total number of excitations for cubic perturbations, providing a bound for entanglement entropy.

Conclusion:  cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in inflation lead to significant quantum correlations, and the amount of entanglement is sensitive to inflationary parameters like energy scales and e-foldings.

Abstract: We discuss some entanglement features associated with cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflationary scenarios. We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll.

Abstract: Cosmological implications of a class of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-minimal matter-geometry coupling is considered. The theory contains a metric curvature tensor, together with a curvature tensor constructed from an independent affine connection. We will show that the model could be written as a bi-scalar-tensor gravity with a non-minimal coupling between matter sector and a scalar field. The theory will then be confronted with observational data from Cosmic Chronometers, BAO dataset from DESI and the Pantheon$^+$ dataset. We will show that the theory could be a good alternative to the $Λ$CDM model with the difference that the conservation of the baryonic matter sector holds only at the background level. The statefinder analysis will also be applied to the theory and it is observed that the DE behavior of the theory exhibits a quintessence to phantom transition occurs at redshifts around $z\approx0.86$.

Abstract: Recently, a remarkable new class of spacetimes describing black holes immersed in a non-aligned electromagnetic field has been found. While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Plebański--Demiański family. Here we demonstrate that the whole class admits a hidden symmetry encoded in the non-degenerate conformal Killing--Yano 2-form. Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Plebański--Demiański class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full "tower of symmetries". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics. Moreover, as we shall show, the novel spacetimes provide an interesting test-ground for studying the recently defined Penrose charges whose existence is intrinsically related to hidden rather than explicit symmetries.

Abstract: High-speed thermal imaging in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) is critical for applications from autonomous navigation to medical screening, yet existing uncooled detectors are fundamentally constrained. Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators require vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity, preventing simultaneous fast and high-sensitivity operation. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation -- leaving gas-mediated convection as the dominant tunable pathway -- and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $34~μ\mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. While the demonstrated sensitivity is instrument-limited, our analysis shows that the device architecture itself supports a >25-fold performance enhancement toward its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3.1\times10^{8}$ Jones). Crucially, because the optical readout is pressure-insensitive, the operating point can be tuned along the speed-sensitivity trade-off. We expect this architecture to provide a general route toward scalable, high-performance thermal imaging systems.

Abstract: Radiation forces and torques are key to manipulating objects with acoustic or electromagnetic waves. An important concept in this context is the Generalized Wigner-Smith (GWS) matrix, which has previously been primarily studied for optimizing radiation forces and torques on single objects embedded inside complex scattering environments. Here, we develop a unified scattering framework that rigorously establishes this connection for arbitrary inhomogeneous, lossless electromagnetic and acoustic media, as well as for controlling multiple objects individually. Variational identities relate parametric changes of the medium to perturbations of the scattering fields, from which the GWS matrix emerges as a natural generator of radiation forces and torques. For a single object, its extremal eigenstates yield maximal force or torque along a chosen direction; for multiple objects, the same framework defines Pareto-optimal compromises among competing objectives and reveals uncertainty relations for their simultaneous optimization. This establishes a comprehensive foundation towards collective and selective manipulation of objects in complex media.

Abstract: We consider stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) when the final state is a superposition of two non-degenerate states. The system consists of four states coupled by two light fields. We find the relative phase of the final superposition depends on relative amplitude, width and timing of the adiabatic transfer pulses. We discuss these results in the context of experiments measuring symmetry violation in atomic and molecular systems.

Abstract: The long-standing fine-structure anomaly in muonic $^{90}$Zr is resolved through a rigorous treatment of the relativistic-recoil effect. From a fit of ab initio QED calculations of the muonic $^{90}$Zr spectrum to precision measurements performed four decades ago, we extract a significantly more precise root-mean-square (rms) charge radius with 6-fold improvement in quality of the fit. A 2-parameter Fermi (2pF) distribution is assumed to model the nuclear charge density and yields a best-fit value of rms charge radius of $r_\text{rms}[^{90}\text{Zr}]=4.2732(7)$ fm ($χ^2 /{\text{DoF}} = 0.995$), in agreement with the previous muonic spectroscopy value, but a factor $6$ more precise, and 3$σ$ larger than the accepted literature value. Additionally, the same analysis has been performed for $^{120}$Sn, where the extracted value of $r_\text{rms}[^{120}\text{Sn}]=4.6518(34)$ fm ($χ^2 /{\text{DoF}} = 0.88$) is consistent with the accepted value. These results confirm our assumption that the muonic fine-structure puzzle arose from an incomplete treatment of QED effects and their uncertainties.

Abstract: We report the construction and characterization of an experimental setup for producing a cold gas of $^{40}$Ca atoms and excite them to high Rydberg states with a resonant three-photon-excitation scheme. The apparatus comprises four stages, each designed in-house. An oven heated to $\sim 500^\circ$C generates an atomic beam that is collimated by a capillary stack. The beam is sent into a passive, permanent-magnet-based Zeeman slower that reduces the atomic velocity to $30$ m/s. The slow atoms are captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and cooled to $1.0(3)$ mK with a trapping time of $16(2)$ ms. Ground-state atoms in the cold gas are excited to high Rydberg states via resonant excitation through the intermediate $4s4p\, ^1P_1$ and $4s4d\, ^1D_2$ states. The MOT is operated at the center of an electrode stack, which serves to apply continuous and pulsed electric fields and field-ionize the Rydberg atoms for detection. We benchmark our MOT against previous implementations and find its performance consistent with state-of-the-art results in terms of temperature and trapping lifetime. Finally, we demonstrate Rydberg spectroscopy of calcium, confirming the system's suitability for ultracold Rydberg physics experiments.

Abstract: Control of the temporal waveform and Fock state statistics of photons produced during spontaneous emission from single quantum emitters provides a crucial tool in the establishment of hybrid quantum systems, optimal state transfer and interferometric stability of network architectures based on flying qubits. We describe a method to generate photons of any temporal waveform from emitters of any lifetime. Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate qudit: (1) control of the phase-parity and (2) modulation of the amplitude of a field coupling a ground state to an excited manifold which produces a photon during relaxation. We detail how to find optimal excitation pulse shapes, both numerically and experimentally, by employing variational algorithms to feedback on atomic populations. Additionally, we develop Quantum Monte Carlo based tools to determine emission statistics and establish techniques for optimal post-selection to ensure maximum fidelity of photon generation protocols. We situate our work in the context of other prior research on bespoke single photon sources and networking including post-emission pulse shaping, temporal gating and cavity-based methods. In comparison, our free-space process has greater flexibility in producing any waveform, requires less infrastructure and can be readily applied across a wide domain of emitters of any frequency or lifetime. We demonstrate temporal waveform shaping in $^{174}$Yb$^+$ trapped ions. Using feedforward validation of photon waveforms, we estimate an achievable process fidelity of at least $\approx$0.996.

Abstract: The paper reports on the timing resolution obtained with the Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors for extreme fluences at the DESY Test Beam Facility with 4 GeV/c electrons. The LGADs adopt an $n$-in-$p$ technology with a $p^{+}$-type boron gain implant, co-implanted with carbon to mitigate acceptor deactivation. The substrate thickness of the sensors varies from 20 $μ$m to 45 $μ$m, with an active area spanning from 0.75 $\times$ 0.75 to 1.28 $\times$ 1.28 mm$^{2}$. A set of 30 $μ$m sensors irradiated with neutrons at fluences between 4 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ and 2.5 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ n$_{\textrm{1 MeV eq.}}$cm$^{-2}$ were tested on the beam. The gain was measured between 7 and 40 across all non-irradiated sensors in the study, and between 7 and 30 in irradiated sensors. The experimental setup consisted of a 45 $μ$m-thick trigger sensor with an active area of 3.6 $\times$ 3.6 mm$^{2}$, four device-under-test (DUT) planes, and a Photonis micro-channel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP) as a time reference. The timing resolution was calculated from Gaussian fitting of the difference in times of arrival of a particle at a DUT and the MCP, using the constant fraction discrimination technique. A timing resolution of 26.4 ps was achieved in 45 $μ$m sensors, and down to 16.6 ps in 20 $μ$m sensors. The combination of two 20 $μ$m LGAD sensors reached a timing resolution of 12.2 ps. A timing resolution of below 20 ps was obtained in all irradiated 30 $μ$m sensors.

TL;DR: NaI(Tl) crystal detectors are the only viable method to directly detect dark matter so far. ASTAROTH aims to develop next-generation detectors by cooling them with liquid argon in a cryogenic chamber.

The paper discusses thermal management, material properties, and successfully operated the cryostat for over 30 cooling cycles without degradation.

Motivation: Dark matter detection remains a significant unsolved problem in astrophysics. The development of more sensitive and reliable detectors is crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe.

Method: The ASTAROTH project involves creating a cryogenic chamber, cooling detectors with liquid argon, and thermalizing them in helium. The design incorporates a finite element analysis for thermal and mechanical properties, and the actual device operates for over 30 cycles without issues.

Result: The cryostat demonstrated successful operation, with temperatures tunable from 87 to 150 K and minimal thermal stress. The system is efficient and robust, suitable for dark matter detection and other precision cooling applications.

Conclusion: ASTAROTH provides a feasible and reliable solution for next-generation dark matter detectors, showcasing advancements in cryogenic systems and materials science.

Abstract: Among the global efforts to directly detect dark matter, the only positive claim so far relies on NaI(Tl) crystal detectors, making this technology of particular interest. ASTAROTH is a project aimed at developing the next generation of such detectors by reading out their scintillation light with SiPM matrices operated at cryogenic temperatures. This paper describes the innovative design of the ASTAROTH cryostat, consisting of a double-walled copper-steel cryogenic chamber that cools the detectors by means of a liquid argon bath. The detectors are thermalized in a helium atmosphere at a temperature tunable from 87 to 150 K. The design has been validated in terms of heat transfer efficiency and mechanical stress, developing of a nonlinear multiphysics model. The mechanical properties of OFHC copper were experimentally evaluated on dedicated tensile samples. The simulation results show that the structural integrity is guaranteed. At the highest operating temperature, the region with the steepest temperature gradient exhibits stresses that slightly exceed the yield strength of copper (localized strain-hardened condition). Following construction, the cryostat was commissioned and has been in regular operation for over 30 cooling cycles, with no signs of degradation. The temperature can be tuned across the full target range and remains stable within 0.1 K. These results demonstrate that this is a viable design for next-generation dark matter detectors, as well as for a variety of applications requiring uniform and tunable gas-conducted cooling of instrumentation.

Motivation: The paper's motivation is to explore the use of novel water-based scintillators in neutrino detectors and to assess the potential of LAPPDs with high sampling rate digitizers for precise timing applications.

Method: The study employs a picosecond laser to measure the timing jitter between two LAPPD channels, using digitizers like HDSoC and AARDVARC with sampling rates in the nanosecond range.

Result: The experiment successfully measured timing jitter, confirming the effectiveness of the setup for precise timing applications in potentially large-scale neutrino detectors.

Conclusion: The findings validate the suitability of the proposed technology for high-precision timing in future experiments, particularly in neutrino physics with improved detector capabilities.

Abstract: We first briefly describe the history and motivation behind Cherenkov and scintillation light detection. We then discuss the instrumentation needed to detect these photons as it applies to both photodetectors and readout electronics. One of the motivations is future large neutrino detectors that could in principle differentiate between Cherenkov and scintillation light if using novel water-based scintillators. In this paper, we present the first measurements utilizing the second generation of Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors (LAPPDs) in conjunction with commercial system-on-a-chip readouts from Nalu Scientific -- specifically, the High Density System on Chip (HDSoC) and Advanced ASoC Rapid Digitizer, Variable Adaptive Readout Chip (AARDVARC) platforms. These state-of-the-art full-waveform digitizers feature sampling rates on the order of 1 and 10 samples per nanosecond, respectively. Using a picosecond laser, we measured the timing jitter between a pair of LAPPD channels, demonstrating the potential of this setup for precise timing applications.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study addressing pile-up effects in single photoelectron counting with R-11265 Hamamatsu multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs) equipped with the SPACIROC-3 ASIC. Extended dead time in the electronics causes saturation and quenching of the counting rate, an effect we counter by inverting the pile-up plot once the double pulse resolution is determined. Our work combines extensive numerical simulations with experimental validations to quantify the statistical uncertainties associated with the corrected event rates. We apply this methodology to the Mini-EUSO experiment onboard the International Space Station where machine learning techniques are employed to extract pixel-by-pixel double pulse resolutions from long-term photon count histograms. This integrated approach enables the accurate recovery of true photon fluxes essential for studying ELVES, meteors and other transient phenomena detected by Mini-EUSO.

Abstract: Understanding photophysical properties of DNA is important: It can help us elucidate and probe the impact of charges and free radicals in the cellular environment. For example, a photoemission at a given nucleobase means that we both charge it and place an electron right next to a neighboring part of the genetic code. Inverse photoemission means that we trap a free electron (at some empty state or resonance), and instead emit a low-energy photon. This may reduce the damage if it happens at an already charged base, but it can cause extra damage if it arises somewhere else. Predicting the nature of sudden optically-driven excitations, termed quasi-particles (QPs), help us detail interactions and possibly control the damage that might follow. Also, these QPs contain information on the larger DNA assembly because they reflect the fingerprints of nucleobase polarity, the hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick pairs, and the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the Watson-Crick-pair stacking that makes up the genome. In this study, we utilize the recently developed (optimally tuned) range-separated hybrid vdW density functional, AHBR-mRSH* [JPCM 37, 211501 (2025)] to analyze the electron-attached and ionized QP states of these DNA components, with a particular focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances). We also evaluate critical properties such as dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Finally, we classify the Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature. This classification provides the foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity.

Abstract: We investigate the flow dynamics of nutrient solution through the xylem vessels of Brassica juncea under drought stress. To this end, we perform experiments to obtain morphological traits of xylem vessels under drought-stressed conditions, and develop a mathematical framework to model the underlying flow through the xylem, considering several features relevant to the plant system. Performing experiments using state of the art instruments, we measure the morphology of xylem vessels, physicochemical and mechanical properties of xylem walls under drought stressed conditions. Our experimental results unveil that drought reduces both xylem diameter and pit aperture size, implicating hydraulic adaptations of plants to drought stress. We find that the reduced cellulose content in drought stressed xylem vessels lowers the zeta potential and decreases elasticity of the vascular region. Additionally, drought stress alters metabolite activity, increases reactive oxygen species, reduces chlorophyll content, and limits the uptake of essential metallic nutrients. Besides, we perform three-dimensional numerical simulations to evaluate local flow field, mechanical stress, hydraulic conductivity, and radial transport efficiency of xylem vessels under drought stressed conditions. Simulated results reveal that under drought conditions, resistance to axial flow through xylem vessels increases significantly, which in turn, promotes radial transport of nutrients, allowing plants to survive even in drought stress. We show that the radial flow efficiency of xylem vessels becomes notably higher under drought stress than in well-watered control plants. Overall, results of this endeavor provide new insights into how geometric adaptations of xylem vessels modify flow behavior under water deficient conditions, enhancing the plants ability to survive environmental stress.
