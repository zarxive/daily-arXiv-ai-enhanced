This Best Practices aims to provide a general guide for the user of\nnonadiabatic molecular dynamics by (i) discussing the fundamentals of\nnonadiabatic molecular dynamics and the various trajectory-based methods\ndeveloped for molecular systems, (ii) introducing the different\nelectronic-structure methods and concepts - adiabatic/diabatic representation,\nconical intersections - that can be used with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics\n(or for benchmarking), (iii) providing details on the various steps required to\nperform a nonadiabatic dynamics simulation and their practical use, as well as\nguided examples and a discussion on the calculation of observables, (iv)\nproposing a FAQ with the typical questions a user may have when performing\nnonadiabatic dynamics, and (v) sketching a checklist for the key practical\nsteps when performing a (trajectory-based) nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces best practices for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations, covering fundamentals, methods, steps, and practical guidance.", "motivation": "The field of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is growing rapidly, but understanding its complex steps and choosing the right methods remains a challenge for users.

Experimental and Theoretical Resolution of the Paradox", "comment": "10 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "The \"Mpemba effect\" is the name given to the assertion that hot water freezes\nquicker than cold water1 or, in a modern and more general form, that the system\nthat is initially more distant from its equilibrium state comes to this state\nearlier2. This counterintuitive statement seems to breach fundamental\nthermodynamic and kinetic laws; however, numerous experiments3-10 with\nclassical and quantum systems demonstrate this paradoxical Mpemba effect,\nleading to extensive discssions in prominent scientific jornals2,5,9,12-14.\nHowever, the fundamental physical mechanisms behind this effect have remained\nelusive14. Here we performed the water freezing experiments under carefully\ncontrolled conditions, and found that the Mpemba effect only occurred when the\nfreezer temperature was very close to the temperature of ice nucleation.

In the classical setting, linear\nprogramming (LP) decoders offer provable performance guarantees and can\nleverage fast practical optimization algorithms. Although LP decoders have been\nproposed for quantum codes, their performance and limitations remain relatively\nunderexplored. In this work, we uncover a key limitation of LP decoding for\nquantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes: certain constant-weight error\npatterns lead to ambiguous fractional solutions that cannot be resolved through\nindependent rounding. To address this issue, we incorporate a post-processing\ntechnique known as ordered statistics decoding (OSD), which significantly\nenhances LP decoding performance in practice. Our results show that LP\ndecoding, when augmented with OSD, can outperform belief propagation with the\nsame post-processing for intermediate code sizes of up to hundreds of qubits.\nThese findings suggest that LP-based decoders, equipped with effective\npost-processing, offer a promising approach for decoding near-term quantum LDPC\ncodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08LP\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u5904\u7406\u67d0\u4e9b\u56fa\u6709\u9519\u7801\u65f6\u4f1a\u5f97\u5230\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u5206\u6570\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5round\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5e8f\u7edf\u8ba1\u89e3\u7801\uff08OSD\uff09\u5904\u7406\u540e\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50LDPC\u7801\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u63a8\u8fdb\uff0c\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5947\u5076\u6821\u9a8c\uff08LDPC\uff09\u7801\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684LP\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76LP\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u63aa\u65bd\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5947\u5076\u6821\u9a8c\u7801\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u7801\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u5e8f\u7edf\u8ba1\u89e3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u5904\u7406\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u7801\u65f6\u4f1a\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u6570\u89e3\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786eround\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u52a0\u5165\u6709\u5e8f\u7edf\u8ba1\u89e3\u7801\u540e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50LDPC\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u5e8f\u7edf\u8ba1\u89e3\u7801\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u5408\u4e2d\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50LDPC\u7801\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

The model\nincludes two distinct couplings: $J_d$ on the dimer bonds and $J_t$ on the\ntrimer bonds. While it is established that the system hosts a valence bond\nsolid (VBS) phase for $J_d \\ge J_t$, the ground state phase diagram for $J_d <\nJ_t$ has remained unsettled. Our iPEPS simulations uncover a first-order phase\ntransition at $J_d/J_t \\approx 0.18$, significantly lower than previously\nreported estimates. Beyond this transition, we identify a close competition\nbetween two valence bond crystal (VBC) states: a columnar VBC and a $\\sqrt{3}\n\\times \\sqrt{3}$ VBC, with the latter consistently exhibiting lower energy\nacross all finite bond dimensions. The high-order series expansion supports\nthis by finding that the $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ VBC state indeed becomes\nenergetically favorable, but only at sixth order in perturbation

With this approach we extract the biexciton binding\nenergies in a series of CdSe/CdS QD ensembles of several core/shell sizes,\nmanifesting a transition between attractive and repulsive exciton-exciton\ninteractions.

The measurements on ensembles provide high photon counts and low\nnoise levels, and alongside the time-gated heralded approach thus enable the\nobservation of MX characteristics that are difficult to resolve in single\nparticle studies. The approach can be further implemented in the\ncharacterization of the energies and lifetimes of MXs in other QD systems to\nenable rapid characterization and understanding of the MX properties.

Eccentricity is a key\nobservable, suggesting that binaries form in a dense stellar environment\nthrough dynamical encounters. This work performs the first matched-filtering\nsearch for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes (BBHs)\ncovering the mass range $[5, 200]~M_\\odot$ and eccentricity at 20 Hz up to 0.5\nwith a newly developed effective-one-body waveform model. Throughout the third\nobservation run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, we identify 28 BBH events with a\nfalse alarm rate below once per 100 yr; all of which were previously reported\nin the GWTC-3 and 4-OGC catalogs. Additional candidates with false alarm rates\nbetween once per 1 and 100 yr are also reported. We perform an injection\ncampaign to characterize the sensitive volume time of our search pipeline.\nAssuming that none of the eccentric BBH events were missed by previous\nsearches, our results provide constraints on the event rate of eccentric BBHs\nin the mass range [5, 30] $M_\\odot$. For a 30-30 $M_\\odot$ BBH with\neccentricity 0.5, the event rate is limited to less than 0.06 Gpc$^{-3}$\nyr$^{-1}$; this marks an order of magnitude improvement for sensitive volume\ncompared with the previous search with a minimally modeled algorithm without\nusing templates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, for most\nresearchers, access to compute time on quantum hardware is limited. This\nnecessitates the need to build simulators that mimic the execution of quantum\ncircuits on noisy quantum hardware accurately and scalably.\n  In this work, we propose TUSQ - Tracking, Uncomputation, and Sampling for\nNoisy Quantum Simulation. To represent the stochastic noisy channels\naccurately, we average the output of multiple quantum circuits with fixed noisy\ngates sampled from the channels. However, this leads to a substantial increase\nin circuit overhead, which slows down the simulation. To eliminate this\noverhead, TUSQ uses two modules: the Error Characterization Module (ECM), and\nthe Tree-based Execution Module (TEM).\n  The ECM tracks the number of unique circuit executions needed to accurately\nrepresent the noise. That is, if initially we needed $n_{1}$ circuit\nexecutions, ECM reduces that number to $n_{2}$ by eliminating redundancies so\nthat $n_{2} < n_{1}$. This is followed by the TEM, which reuses computation\nacross these $n_{2}$ circuits. This computational reuse is facilitated by\nrepresenting all $n_{2}$ circuits as a tree. We sample the significant leaf\nnodes of this tree and prune the remaining ones. We traverse this tree using\ndepth-first search. We use uncomputation to perform rollback-recovery at\nseveral stages which reduces simulation time. We evaluate TUSQ for a total of\n186 benchmarks and report an average speedup of $52.5\\times$ and $12.53\\times$\nover Qiskit and CUDA-Q, which goes up to $7878.03\\times$ and $439.38\\times$\nrespectively.

In this work, we propose a simple and general framework for\ncertifying HDE in general bipartite pure states under restricted operations,\nsuch as local operations and classical communication (LOCC).

The security of\nthe protocol is augmented by analyzing the joint probability distributions of\nthe walkers' measured positions and their associated coin states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u8d70\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u884c\u8d70\u5728\u6781\u503c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u79d8\u5bc6\u5171\u4eab\u3002\u534f\u8bae\u5229\u7528\u4e86QRW\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u6027\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u8fc5\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\uff08QKD\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u6cc4\u9732-proof\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\uff08QRW\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u8da3\u4e14\u6709\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u5174\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u6b63\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u8d70\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u5347QKD\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u8d70\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u6b65\u76f8\u4e92\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u91cf\u5b50 walking\u7684QKD\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u884c\u8d70\u7684\u6781\u503c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5176coin state\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e86QRW\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5QKD\u534f\u8bae\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u901f\u7387\u548c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u91cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u901f\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u601d\u8def\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u8d70\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u5c5e\u6027\u878d\u5165\u5230QKD\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u521b\u6027\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5177\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86QKD\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a\nframework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted\non projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced\non a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement,\ntracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded\noutcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the\nPPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing\nhow scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs)\nassociated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an\nexperimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs\ndisplay exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting\nexponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate\nthese findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics\nin the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our\nanalysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic\nresults for the $\\ell$-bit model.
