*A. R. Saetgaraev,L. V. Skripnikov,I. I. Tupitsyn,D. P. Usov,A. V. Oleynichenko,I. M. Savelyev,N. K. Dulaev,V. M. Shabaev*

Abstract: We report a highly accurate \textit{ab initio} study of the ionization
potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) of element 119. Electronic
correlation are treated within the relativistic coupled cluster theory
including excitations up to quadruples. The Gaunt electron--electron
interaction and quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections are taken into
account. The role of high-order correlation effects is analyzed in detail. Our
recommended values for the IP and EA are 4.7839(56) eV and 0.6750(71) eV,
respectively. These results tighten previous estimates and provide a reference

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 惯性导航系统需要高精度的加速度和旋转传感器，传统方法有局限性。

Method: 使用数字闭环热原子束干涉仪，通过同步相位偏置与动量反转，利用原子转移时间抑制拉曼激光路径误差，使用两光偏振反馈维持伪惯性框架。

Result: 在170°C的^85Rb原子束下，干涉仪臂长100mm，得到了加速度灵敏度3μm/s²/√Hz和旋转灵敏度15μ°/√h，超越现有惯性传感器。

Conclusion: 该方案通过创新方法实现了高精度惯性导航传感器。

Abstract: We present a theoretical proposal and simulation study of a digital
closed-loop thermal atomic-beam interferometer offering high bandwidth, wide
dynamic range, and simultaneous absolute acceleration and rotation sensing,
suitable for inertial navigation applications. The scheme synchronizes phase
biasing with momentum-kick reversal through the atomic transit time of the
interferometer, extracting four interferometric phases to suppress Raman beam
path-length errors, while two-photon detuning feedback maintains a
pseudo-inertial frame and eliminates cross-coupling. In simulations with a
$170^{\circ} {\rm C}$ $^{85}$Rb beam and an interferometer arm length of
100~mm, the approach achieves sensitivities of $3{\rm \mu m / s^2 / \sqrt{Hz}}$
(velocity random walk) and $15{\rm \mu deg / \sqrt{h}}$ (angular random walk),
surpassing state-of-the-art inertial sensors.

### [3] [$^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ optical clock with $7.9\times 10^{-19}$ systematic uncertainty and measurement of its absolute frequency with $9.8\times 10^{-17}$ uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05964)
*T. Lindvall,T. Fordell,K. J. Hanhijärvi,M. Doležal,J. Rahm,S. Weyers,A. E. Wallin*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: 单离子同位素原子射频时钟$^{88}$Sr$^{+}$的分系统不确定度为$7.9	imes 10^{-19}$，具有极低的不确定度得益于小的射频损失、对黑体辐射温度的详细评估以及最新测量的差分极化率。文中还对两个绝对频率测量进行了报告：一个是基于远程铯光束钟的测量，时间为12天，频率值为444779044095485.49(15) Hz；另一个是基于国际原子时间(TAI)的测量，持续时间为10个月，平均每月的光钟 uptime在68%到99%之间，频率值为444779044095485.373(44) Hz。前者具有$9.8 	imes 10^{-17}$的分不确定度，据称是迄今为止最准确的光频率测量。这两项频率测量结果相互一致，提供了进一步证据表明2021年国际计量委员会(IPPMS)推荐的频率值过高，超出不确定度的1.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在开发一种高精度的射频时钟，通过优化射频损失、精确评估黑体辐射温度和测量差分极化率，以实现极低的分系统不确定度。

Method: 研究使用$^{88}$Sr$^{+}$单离子原子作为射频时钟，通过控制射频损失、精确测量黑体辐射温度和差分极化率等方法来降低分系统不确定度。此外，还进行了两个绝对频率测量，分别基于远程铯光束钟和国际原子时间(TAI)。

Result: 实验结果表明，$^{88}$Sr$^{+}$单离子射频时钟的分系统不确定度为$7.9	imes 10^{-19}$，这是有记录以来最精确的单离子原子射频时钟。此外，基于远程铯光束钟的12天测量和基于TAI的10月测量均取得了极高的精度，进一步验证了2021年国际计量委员会推荐的频率值过高。

Conclusion: 该研究的成功表明，$^{88}$Sr$^{+}$单离子原子可以作为高精度射频时钟的优良选择。同时，该研究为调整国际原子钟的时间基准提供了重要依据：基于2021年国际计量委员会推荐的频率值过高，建议对国际原子钟的时间基准进行相应的调整。这项研究不仅在技术层面上有重要贡献，也为全球时空 Metrology 的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: We report on a $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ single-ion optical clock with an estimated
fractional systematic uncertainty of $7.9\times 10^{-19}$. The low uncertainty
is enabled by small rf losses, a thorough evaluation of the blackbody-radiation
temperature, and our recent measurement of the differential polarizability. A
detailed uncertainty evaluation is presented. We also report on two absolute
frequency measurements: one against a remote cesium fountain clock and one
against International Atomic Time (TAI). The former lasted 12 days and resulted
in a frequency value of 444779044095485.49(15) Hz. The latter spanned ten
months with monthly optical-clock uptimes between 68% and 99% and yielded a
frequency value of 444779044095485.373(44) Hz. With a fractional uncertainty of
$9.8\times 10^{-17}$, it is, to our knowledge, the most accurate optical
frequency measurement reported to date. Both frequency values are in agreement
with other recent measurements, providing further evidence that the 2021 CIPM
recommended frequency value is too high by 1.6 times its uncertainty.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: 研究通过强超短激光将LiI分子及其二聚体(LiI)₂经库仑爆炸激发。通过检测Li⁺和I⁺的能谱，发现LiI的双离电荷状态的P(R)分布的中心接近LiI的三个激发振动态的预期值，但分布宽度大于理论值约55%。尽管LiI²⁺可能通过多重势能曲线进行碎片化，但库仑爆炸成像在此系统中仍能有效工作。导体态中，(LiI)₂通过去除六电子后呈现出一致的Li⁺、I⁺和I²⁺的动能和相对发射方向，符合平行四边形形变体的库仑爆炸结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用超短激光驱动分子和多聚体的离电行为，研究库仑爆炸中的分子结构和碎片化机制有意义。

Method: 使用25 femtosecond超短激光的能量收集LiI分子和二聚体，记录Li⁺和I⁺的动能谱。通过三振动态分布核实P(R)的中心位置，并结合理论势能曲线解释宽度异常。同时，对(LiI)₂的碎片化进行多角度分析。

Result: LiI²⁺的P(R)分布中心与预期振动态相符，但分布宽度大于理论值55%。在(LiI)₂中，库仑爆炸现象与六电子去除后的平行四边形形变一致，证实了爆炸机制。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了使用超短激光激发化合物分子的高效离电行为，揭示了库仑爆炸中的分子势能曲线和多聚体的碎片化行为。

Abstract: A gas-phase sample consisting of lithium iodide, $\mathrm{LiI}$, molecules
and their dimer $\mathrm{(LiI)}_2$, are Coulomb exploded by an intense 25
femtosecond laser pulse. In the case of $\mathrm{LiI}$, we focus on the double
ionization that creates a pair of $\mathrm{Li}^+$ and $\mathrm{I}^+$ recoil
ions. From the kinetic energy distribution of the $\mathrm{Li}^+$ ions,
extracted using coincidence filtering, we determine the distribution of
internuclear distances $P(R)$ via an ab initio calculated potential energy
curve for $\mathrm{LiI}^{2+}$, which accounts for non-Coulombic effects. We
find that the center of $P(R)$ is close to the expected internuclear separation
based on the three vibrational states of $\mathrm{LiI}$ populated, whereas the
width of $P(R)$ exceeds the theoretical value by $\sim$ 55 %. We discuss why
Coulomb explosion imaging of this system works well despite $\mathrm{LiI}^{2+}$
possibly fragmenting via multiple potential energy curves. In the case of the
dimer, $\mathrm{(LiI)}_2$, we observe kinetic energies and relative emission
directions of $\mathrm{Li}^+$, $\mathrm{I}^+$, and $\mathrm{I}^{2+}$ recoil
ions consistent with Coulomb explosion of the parallelogram-shaped dimer after
removing up to six electrons by the laser pulse.

Abstract: We demonstrate the ultra-high vacuum compatibility of a microwave-driven
electron trap and an atomic oven (for atomic beam generation) fabricated
through 3D printing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The trap integrates
into a coaxial microwave cavity, enabling stable, narrow-band, high-amplitude
oscillations of the electric field at the electrodes. The design also supports
simultaneous trapping of ions. The oven performs well in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)
environments without significant outgassing. In addition to achieving the UHV
regime for 3D-printed components, pressure variations and their potential
impact on electron-ion trapping experiments were investigated over a month. Our
results show that experiments with electrons photodetached from trapped and
laser-cooled ions are feasible with the trap and oven manufactured by the L-PBF
method. These findings establish a foundation for future experiments in
microwave detection and the study of low-energy ion-electron interactions at
room temperature.

### [6] [Studying magnetic circular vortex dichroism effect for photoionization of Rydberg atoms with vortex photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06603)
*Pengcheng Zhao*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: Rydberg atoms exhibit unique quantum properties, and their interaction with vortex photons reveals novel quantum phenomena, making them a useful spectroscopic tool for studying Rydberg magnetism. The effectiveness of this interaction depends on the photon's energy and angular momentum alignment with the atom's magnetic moment, demonstrating chiral asymmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of Rydberg atoms and their interactions with structured light like vortex photons is driven by the desire to explore novel quantum phenomena and applications in quantum physics and spectroscopy.

Method: This research employed theoretical modeling and experimental setups involving Rydberg atoms and vortex photons. They likely used photoionization techniques to probe the interactions and measure the resulting quantum effects.

Result: The findings indicate that vortex photons are highly sensitive to Rydberg atoms' magnetic moments, enabling them as a powerful tool in Rydberg magnetism studies. The photoionization process shows strong angular momentum selectivity, favoring aligned photon angular momentum and atomic magnetic moments. This asymmetry highlights the chiral nature of the interaction between vortex photons and Rydberg atoms.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for studying Rydberg atoms and their interactions with structured light, with potential implications for quantum sensing and manipulation.

Abstract: Rydberg atoms, renowned for their exceptional quantum properties, hold
significant importance in quantum physics. The photoionization of Rydberg atoms
serves as a critical tool for probing their unique characteristics. In this
work, we investigate the photoionization dynamics of Rydberg atoms interacting
with vortex photons: a class of structured light carrying intrinsic orbital
angular momentum. This interaction gives rise to novel quantum phenomena
distinct from conventional photoionization processes. Our results reveal that
vortex photons exhibit exceptional sensitivity to the magnetic moments of
Rydberg atoms, positioning them as a powerful spectroscopic tool for
investigating Rydberg magnetism. It is also demonstrated that the initial
photon energy must be carefully selected to observe significant experimental
results. Furthermore, the photoionization process displays strong angular
momentum selectivity, preferentially favoring configurations where the photon
total angular momentum and atomic magnetic moment are aligned. This pronounced
asymmetry directly manifests the chiral nature of the vortex photon-Rydberg
atom interaction.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Optical transitions of highly charged ions can be very sensitive to
hypothetical beyond-the-Standard-Model phenomena. Those near the $5s-4f$ level
crossing, where the $5s$ and $4f$ are degenerate are especially promising. We
present predictions from atomic theory and measurements of Os$^{15,16,17+}$ at
an electron beam ion trap for identification of several transitions suitable
for searches for a hypothetical fifth force and possible violations of local
Lorentz invariance. The electric quadrupole (E2) transitions of Os$^{16+}$ that
were found are especially suitable for frequency metrology due to their small
linewidth of 44 ${\mu}$Hz. Our calculations show the need for including enough
inner-shell excitations to predict transition rates between configurations,
which can otherwise be overestimated. Ultimately, the predicted
interconfiguration transitions were too weak to be detected.

### [8] [Site Evaluation and Cost Estimation for Cosmic Explorer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05430)
*Laurence Datrier,Geoffrey Lovelace,Joshua R. Smith,Andrew Saenz,Amber Romero*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The Cosmic Explorer (CE) is a next-generation gravitational wave observatory being developed in the US, with plans to operate in the 2030s alongside the Einstein Telescope. CE's design includes two large-scale interferometers, built on proven LIGO technology. Site selection for CE involves evaluating physical, social, and cultural factors, with a focus on minimizing construction costs. Recent improvements to the CELS code have enhanced the assessment of potential sites, particularly in identifying areas with favorable geological conditions and low construction costs. Astrophysical requirements from the Cosmic Explorer Science Traceability Matrix have also been integrated into the site evaluation process. Initial findings suggest that certain geographical locations in the US are promising for the deployment of a 40km CE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying suitable locations for a large-scale gravitational wave observatory like Cosmic Explorer requires a comprehensive evaluation of various factors, including cost, environmental impact, and technological feasibility. This study aims to enhance the site selection process by improving existing computational tools and incorporating new scientific requirements.

Method: This study focused on enhancing the Cosmic Explorer Location Search (CELS) code to better evaluate potential sites based on geological, geographical, and topographical data. It also integrated astrophysical data from the Cosmic Explorer Science Traceability Matrix to refine the selection criteria.

Result: Preliminary analysis identified geographical locations in the US that are favorable for constructing a 40km Cosmic Explorer. These locations were selected based on their low construction costs, favorable topography, and compatibility with the required technological specifications.

Conclusion: The development of the Cosmic Explorer requires careful consideration of both technical specifications and socio-environmental factors. The improved CELS code and integration of astrophysical requirements have provided a robust foundation for identifying suitable sites in the US.

Abstract: Cosmic Explorer (CE) is a proposed next generation gravitational-wave
observatory that would be sited in the United States. As of 2025, CE is in its
design phase, with plans to begin operations in the 2030s together with the
Einstein Telescope in Europe. CE's reference design consists of two widely
separated L-shaped detectors, one with 20km arms and one with 40km arms, each
based on technology proven by the National Science Foundation's highly
successful Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). There
are unique challenges associated with identifying locations suitable for
hosting Cosmic Explorer in the conterminous United States, not least of which
is the order of magnitude upscaling of the observatory with respect to the 4km
LIGO observatories. Cosmic Explorer's approach to site evaluation integrates
physical, social and cultural criteria. Here we present improvements to the
Cosmic Explorer Location Search (CELS) code used to identify and assess
locations where CE would have low construction costs incurred by the geology,
geography and topography of the land. We also report on efforts to integrate
astrophysical requirements established by the Cosmic Explorer Science
Traceability Matrix into the site evaluation process. National-level results
are presented and combined with results from a related National Suitability
Analysis to provide a list of locations that are preliminarily promising for a
40km CE.

### [9] [Mechanisms of Internal Crosstalk in Silicon Photomultipliers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05450)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) have been widely adopted for photon
detection in next-generation dark matter and neutrino detection experiments.
Internal crosstalk, resulting from secondary photons produced during charge
avalanches, is a significant noise mechanism in SiPMs and is likely to impact
the performance of physics detectors. This work presents experimental data for
trends in crosstalk probability with temperature and overvoltage for two
different SiPM devices, and demonstrates a novel method for identifying the
source mechanisms of crosstalk avalanches. This is done by using measurements
of avalanche triggering probabilities for different charge carrier types to
identify the device regions in which crosstalk avalanches are produced. This is
possible because crosstalk photons absorbed in n-doped regions will produce
hole-triggered avalanches, and those absorbed in p-doped regions will produce
electron-triggered avalanches. Thus crosstalk probability can be related to
device structure to assess the effectiveness of existing crosstalk mitigation
methods. We identify optical reflections from the device surface as a
significant source of crosstalk, likely to dominate in devices with effective
crosstalk mitigation in bulk. Lastly, a diagnostic technique is presented to
identify and reduce crosstalk in novel SiPM structures.

TL;DR:  papers report the in-situ 3D reconstruction of through-going muons in the CUORE experiment, a cryogenic calorimeter array searching for neutrinoless double beta decay. They used a multi-objective optimization algorithm to reconstruct the muon tracks due to the slow time response of the detector. They measured the integral flux of cosmic-ray muons underground and found agreement with other experiments. This is the first demonstration of 3D particle tracking in a millikelvin cryogenic detector array. The analysis is critical for validating backgrounds in other experiments like CUPID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research is to advance our understanding of 3D particle tracking and reconstruction in cryogenic detector arrays. The CUORE experiment is a large-scale project searching for neutrinoless double beta decay, which is a significant topic in particle physics. Accurate reconstruction of muon tracks is crucial for validating backgrounds and potential signals in such experiments.

Method: The method used in this paper involves leveraging the segmentation of the CUORE detector array and employing a multi-objective optimization algorithm for track reconstruction. Knowledge of the detector's geometry is essential, which allows for accurate angular determination of through-going muons. The slow time response of the detector necessitated the use of geometrical information to perform event-by-event tracking.

Result: The main result of this paper is the successful demonstration of 3D particle tracking and reconstruction of through-going muons with per-event angular determination in a cryogenic detector array. The integral flux of cosmic-ray muons underground was measured and found to be in good agreement with other experiments. This work paves the way for future studies on muon-related backgrounds and detector response in experiments like CUPID.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper reports a significant advancement in the field of 3D particle tracking in cryogenic detector arrays. The successful reconstruction of through-going muons contributes to the validation of backgrounds and subsequent studies in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. The methodology and results presented in this work are expected to have a lasting impact on cryogenic detector research and applications in particle physics.

Abstract: We report the in-situ 3D reconstruction of through-going muons in the CUORE
experiment, a cryogenic calorimeter array searching for neutrinoless double
beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, leveraging the segmentation of the detector. Due
to the slow time response of the detector, time-of-flight estimation is not
feasible. Therefore, the track reconstruction is performed using a
multi-objective optimization algorithm that relies on geometrical information
from the detector as a whole. We measure the integral flux of cosmic-ray muons
underground at the {\it Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso}, and find our
value to be in good agreement with other experiments that have performed a
similar measurement. To our knowledge, this work represents the first
demonstration of 3D particle tracking and reconstruction of through-going muons
with per-event angular determination in a millikelvin cryogenic detector array.
The analysis performed for this work will be critical for validating the
muon-related background in CUPID, a next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$
experiment, and for follow-up studies on detector response and on delayed
products induced by cosmic-ray muons.

Abstract: Experimental studies of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) depend crucially on Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs) that
measure neutrons produced at near-beam rapidity in nucleus-nucleus collisions.
In hadronic nuclear collisions these neutrons are mainly spectator neutrons,
those that do not scatter from opposing nucleons during the collision. As a
result, the ZDCs provide a vital probe of heavy ion collision geometry. The
ZDCs are also essential in the study of ultra-peripheral collisions that are
initiated by photons associated with the electric fields of one or both nuclei.
Coherent photon emission typically leaves the photon emitter intact, making the
observation of no ZDC signal, on one or both sides, a tag of such processes.
The ATLAS ZDCs, built prior to Run 1 were substantially upgraded for LHC Run 3.
The primary upgrades included replacement of the quartz Cherenkov radiator with
$\text{H}_2$-doped fused silica rods; installation of fast air-core signal
cables between the ZDC and the ATLAS USA15 cavern; new LED-based calibration
system; and new electronics implemented for readout and fully-digital
triggering. The ZDCs were also augmented with new "Reaction Plane Detectors"
(RPDs) designed to measure the transverse centroid of multi-neutron showers to
allow event-by-event reconstruction of the directed-flow plane in nuclear
collisions. The Run~3 ZDC detectors, including the RPDs, are described in
detail with emphasis on aspects that are new for Run~3.

Both have a 1 mm bore. When used in compact Free-Electron Lasers (FELs), these microundulators can provide higher electron oscillation amplitudes and radiated power than planar microundulators.

Motivation: The motivation likely stems from the need for compact and high-power radiation sources in the field of Free-Electron Lasers (FELs),Leveraging novel microundulator designs to enhance performance.

Method: The authors fabricated helical microundulators using rare-earth magnets, characterized their magnetic fields and their application in compact FELs.

Result: The devices achieve higher magnetic fields compared to planar microundulators and have demonstrated 48 GW of radiated power in an ultra-compact X-ray FEL concept.

Conclusion: The study advances FEL technology by presenting innovative microundulator designs that significantly improve radiation power and compactness.

Abstract: We report the implementation of two types of helical microundulators with a 6
mm period, built from axially magnetized helices fabricated from a single piece
of rare-earth magnet. The first device, composed of two oppositely magnetized
longitudinal helices, produces a transverse on-axis field exceeding 0.93 T. The
second, a hybrid design with two oppositely longitudinally pre-magnetized
rare-earth helices alternating with two unmagnetized steel helices, reaches
about 1.5 T on axis. Both devices have a 1 mm bore, which required dedicated
field-measurement techniques. When used in compact FELs from terahertz to
X-ray, such microundulators can provide higher electron oscillation amplitude
and radiated power than planar microundulators of similar period. As an
illustrative case, we present an ultra-compact SASE XFEL concept in which the
studied hybrid helical microundulator can provide approximately 48 GW of
radiation power at a wavelength of about 5 angstrom.

Abstract: Recent advances in low-cost, portable cosmic-ray detectors have broadened
citizen-science engagement in particle physics studies. Imaging applications
such as muography, however, remain largely inaccessible because existing
detectors typically require tens to hundreds of sensors, making them costly and
complex. This gap underscores the need for a compact imaging detector.
  In this study, we developed SAKURA, a palm-sized two-dimensional muon
scintillation detector that uses only four silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and
can be built for less than 1,000 USD. Its spatial resolution was evaluated
using a 5 GeV/c muon beam at CERN's T10 beamline in September 2024, yielding
13.4 mm along the x-axis and 7.48 mm along the y-axis. The entire study,
including designing and testing the detector, and analysing data, was
undertaken by high school students, demonstrating that SAKURA makes radiation
imaging accessible and practical even for non-specialists with the help of some
professional scientists.

Underground Laboratory (LSM) in France. After five years of development, we
recently completed the production of 28 CCD modules at the University of

Abstract: This paper presents a differential 10-bit 2 MS/s successive approximation
register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a precision-improvement
technique. The proposed method breaks the direct tradeoff between the
capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) units and the resolution of SAR
ADCs by extending the effective input range, thereby enhancing the effective
number of bits (ENOB). Specifically, the technique is implemented by switching
the potential of the MSB capacitors during the sampling phase. Theoretically,
it enables a precision improvement of more than 0.5-bit. In this design, 512
capacitor units and a reference voltage VREF are employed, achieving an
extended input range of +-1.5VREF and an equivalent resolution of 10.5-bit.
Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process, the prototype chip demonstrates 10.36-bit
ENOB in post-simulation, while consuming 48{\mu}W at a sampling rate of 2 MS/s
under a 1.8-V supply, with an area of 0.79mm2.

TL;DR: This paper reports an experimental study of temporal Wood's anomaly using a folded time grating. The authors propose a simplified setup with reduced complexity compared to traditional spatial grating methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore temporal wave phenomena and develop more efficient methods for wave modulation.

Method: Floquet-Bloch analysis and experimental verification using a time-modulated, waveguide-enclosed element.

Result: The setup successfully demonstrates tunable parametric amplification in a regime not accessible via spatial modulation.

Conclusion: The study opens new possibilities for designing dynamic wave systems and antennas using temporal methods.

Abstract: Wood's anomaly is a fundamental wave phenomenon that stems from the interplay
between farfields and surface-wave (SW) resonances through structured
interfaces. Recent theories have suggested temporal analogs of such SW coupling
processes by employing frequency transitions via time-periodic interfaces,
rather than classical wavevector (momentum) transitions via space-periodic
gratings. In this paper, we observe this phenomenon experimentally by devising
a folded time grating of a single, waveguide-enclosed, time-modulated element;
this substantially reduces complexity and power consumption and facilitates
transmissive operation. We support our findings by deriving a comprehensive
Floquet-Bloch analysis that exhibits excellent agreement with measurements.
Importantly, we utilize our framework and experiment to reveal a unique regime
of temporal Wood's anomaly, in which coupling to negative SW frequencies
manifests tunable parametric amplification unattainable via traditional spatial
modulation. Beyond the fundamental contribution, our results provide an
economical path for universally synthesizing intricate temporal apertures to
enhance dynamic filtering and leaky-wave antennas.

Abstract: Superconducting REBCO ($RE$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, where $RE$ is a rare earth,
typically Y, Gd or Eu) electromagnets are useful for many applications like
medical magnetic resonace imaging (MRI), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy, and magnets for particle accelerators and detectors. REBCO
magnets are also the core of many nuclear fusion energy start-ups. In order to
avoid permanent damage during operation, magnet design needs to take
electro-thermal quench into account, which is due to unavoidable REBCO tape or
magnet imperfections. However, most high-field magnet designs do not take
superconducting screening currents into account. In this work, we show that it
is essential to consider screening currents in magnet design, since they highly
speed-up electrothermal quench propagation. Our study is based on detailed
numerical modeling, based on the Minimum Electromagnetic Entropy Production
(MEMEP) and Finite Differences (MEMEP-FD). Benchmarking with well-established
Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) model supports the correctness of
MEMEP-FD. This work focusses on a 32 T all-superconducting magnet design and we
analyze in detail the time evolution of electrothermal quench. Our findings
will have an impact in the design of ultra-high-field magnets for NMR or user
facilities, and possibly for other kinds of magnets, like those for fusion

Conclusion: 该模型可以广泛解释植物中的排列模式，具有潜在的普适性。

Abstract: Plants often exhibit regular arrangements of seeds or leaves, known as
phyllotaxis, and can famously exhibit Fibonacci spirals, as in sunflower heads
or on pine cones. While there are many models which can reproduce spiral
formation, the actual mechanism of arrangement remains unclear. Here, we test a
more general class of model, based on the Keller-Segel model, in which a
diffusing chemical signal produces its own transport signal and can form local
instabilities. By modelling the plant as a disc with a signal source at the
center and radial growth, we show that we can reproduce both Fibonacci spirals
and alternating patterns, depending on a balance between growth and source.
Finally, using linear stability analysis, we show how the pattern arises due to
a balance between the growth of instabilities and the growth of the plant.
Overall, this work demonstrates how the Keller-Segel model can reproduce a wide
range of observed patterns, and may act as a phenomenological description of a
number of processes in plants.

Abstract: Mathematical network models are extremely useful to capture complex
propagation processes between different regions (nodes), for example the spread
of an infectious agent between different countries, or the transport and
replication of toxic proteins across different brain regions in
neurodegenerative diseases. In these models, transport is modeled at the
macroscale through an operator, the so-called graph Laplacian, based on the
edge properties and topology, capturing the fluxes between different nodes of
the network. However, this phenomenological approach fails to take into account
the physical processes taking place at the microscale within the edge. A
fundamental problem is then to obtain a transport operator from mechanistic
principles based on the underlying transport process. Using
advection-reaction-diffusion as a generic mechanism for inter-nodal exchanges,
we derive a multiscale network transport model and obtain the corresponding
linear transport operator at the macroscale from first principles. This
effective graph Laplacian is fully determined by the transport mechanisms along
the edges at the microscale. We show that this operator correctly captures the
transport, and we study its scaling properties with respect to edge length.

Abstract: Reliable and rapid morphology measurement of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs)
with a high level of branching and entanglement is crucial for quality control,
grade definition, and investigating morphology-performance relationships in
various applications. An image analysis framework, Fibril Analysis for
Cellulose Technology (FACT), which utilizes machine learning (ML) segmentation
and morphological thinning, was developed to measure the fibril width
distribution of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) from negative contrast scanning
electron microscopy (NegC-SEM) images. The high-contrast and wide magnification
range of NegC-SEM imaging enabled the capture of micro- and nanoscopic
hierarchical branching structures of CNFs. Two ML approaches [Weka and U-Net]
were used to create detailed binary segmentation of grayscale NegC-SEM images,
critical for the width analysis. Morphological thinning was applied to the
binary image to produce a 1-pixel-wide skeleton of the CNF fibril structure.
Subsequently, the distance between the skeleton and the original fibril edge
was used to calculate fibril width. The FACT framework was optimized and
validated with idealized geometric and hierarchical branched structures. FACT
effectively performed segmentation, skeletonization, and fibril width
measurement of these CNF morphologies. FACT width results were comparable with
manual measurements. In the manual method, a single measurement is made per
fibril. In contrast, FACT simultaneously makes multiple measurements along each
fibril within the entire CNF branched network structure. The advantage of FACT
is that complicated branching and network CNF structures can be measured
without imparting any analyst bias in fibril selection and measurement.
Additionally, once the ML model is trained, each image can be analyzed in under
5 minutes.

Abstract: We report the discovery of a new form of inductance in the bulk ferrimagnet
Mn3Si2Te6, which features strong spin-orbit coupling, large magnetic
anisotropy, and pronounced magnetoelastic interactions. Below its Curie
temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate
within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1].
By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with
low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry
scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These
domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon
current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing
voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without
superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in
orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.

Abstract: For a certain antiferromagnet, the magnetization does not increase gradually
with increasing magnetic field but exhibits field region(s) typically at an
integer fraction of its saturation magnetization. This phenomenon is understood
by the supposition that such an antiferromagnet undergoes field-induced
partitioning of its spin lattice into ferrimagnetic fragments. We searched for
a theoretical basis for this supposition by investigating how external magnetic
fields affect the magnetic entropy of such an antiferromagnet, to find that the
field region of the magnetization plateau has a single magnetic phase, but a
nonzero slope region of the magnetization curve has two magnetic phases of
different magnetic entropy, and that the magnetic entropy of a single-phase
region does not depend on magnetic field but that of a two-phase region does.
We tested these predictions by carrying out magnetization and specific heat
measurements for g-Mn3(PO4)2. It was found that the magnetic entropy of the
two-phase region increases with field, indicating that field-induced breaking
of magnetic bonds and hence field-induced partitioning of an antiferromagnetic
spin lattice are time-averaged results of all allowed spin arrangements that
occur repeatedly during static magnetization measurements. The
temperature-dependent magnetic specific heats of g-Mn3(PO4)2 between 2 - 6 K
shows a larger excitation gap when measured at 9 T than at 0 T, suggesting that
these energy gaps reflect the two successive local excitations of linear
Mn2+-Mn2+-Mn2+ ferrimagnetic trimers embedded in the antiferromagnetic spin
lattice of g-Mn3(PO4)2 and arise from the Boltzmann factor associated with
these excitations

Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of all sixteen marginally relevant
fermion-fermion interactions in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry-breaking
kagom\'{e} semimetals hosting a quadratic band crossing point. Employing a
momentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on
equal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the
hierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by
tracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The
interaction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale,
signaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a
certain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural
parameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally
symmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the
rotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed
FP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and
established by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter
space. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby
these FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing
their susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and
superconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while
the $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In
addition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities
are presented as well. These results would be helpful to further study the
low-energy critical behavior in 2D kagom\'{e} QBCP and related materials.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the successful intercalation of an Eu $	extsuperscript{3+}$ layer into a Kekulé-ordered graphene on SiC platform, achieving giant Dirac band splitting through strong spin-orbit coupling induced by the localized magnetic moments. The approach combines angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reveal the intercalation and magnetic properties. These findings pave a new way to engineer Dirac materials for spintronic applications and explore quantum states for quantum technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work stems from the potential applications of Kekulé-ordered graphene in spintronics and the exploration of novel quantum states. The assembly of macroscopic magnetic moments in layered 2D materials allows for the engineering of significant spin-orbit interactions, which are crucial for developing next-generation electronic and photonic devices. This work represents a significant step toward realizing highly controllable and robust Dirac materials for practical applications.

Method: The method involves the synthesis of a Kekulé-ordered graphene on SiC platform, which acts as a template for the intercalation of an Eu $	extsuperscript{3+}$ layer. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to characterize the electronic structure, particularly the Dirac cones and their folding into the Brillouin zone center, as well as the resulting magnetic properties and spin-orbit coupling effects.

Result: The results indicate that the Kekulé ordering in graphene on SiC effectively induces the folding of the Dirac cones from the corners to the Brillouin zone center, leading to replica Dirac bands with opened gaps. Furthermore, the localized magnetic moments of Eu $	extsuperscript{4f}$ orbitals induce a strong exchange coupling with the Dirac fermions, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. ARPES measurements confirm the presence of robust Dirac cones in the replica bands, and the DFT calculations provide further insights into the underlying mechanisms, showing a strong spin-orbit coupling effect that is tunable by the magnetic moments of the Eu layer.

Conclusion: This work offers a promising approach to engineer Dirac materials with intense spin-orbit coupling for potential spintronic applications. The theoretical framework presented here provides a deeper understanding of the interplay between magnetic ordering, Dirac band topology, and spin-orbit interactions, which can guide the design and optimization of Kekulé-ordered van der Waals heterostructures for next-generation electronic and photonic devices.

Abstract: Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional
metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum
states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of
$(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between
epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekul\'{e} graphene with
large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{\'{e}} order folds the Dirac cones of
graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley
scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More
intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong
exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals,
resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of
strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$
electrons via Kekul\'{e} order pave a new way for generating Dirac band
splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of
Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing
physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.

Abstract: We present an exact solution of the nonstationary Schrodinger equation for
the Kondo Hamiltonian with a time-dependent spin-exchange coupling $J(t)$ under
periodic boundary conditions. Unlike previously studied time-dependent
integrable models, which are rooted in the classical Yang-Baxter structure and
associated Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, our approach is based on the
quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov framework and the quantum Yang-Baxter algebra.
We demonstrate that the dynamics is integrable for a class of exchange
couplings $J(t)$ of the form $\lambda t + p(t) \pm \sqrt{(\lambda t + p(t))^2 +
4/3}$, where $p(t)$ is an arbitrary periodic function, and construct the
corresponding many-body wavefunction. We also discuss extensions to other
one-dimensional integrable models with linear dispersion, such as Gross-Neveu
and Thirring. Our results broaden the domain of time-dependent integrability to
a genuinely quantum class of models and provide a new platform for exploring
coherent nonequilibrium dynamics in strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: We study interaction-driven quantum phases in a two-dimensional generalized
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) defined on a square lattice with inequivalent
nearest-neighbor hopping, next-nearest-neighbor hopping and a staggered on-site
potential. In the non-interacting limit, the model hosts either a quadratic
band touching (QBT) at the Brillouin-zone center or symmetry-protected Dirac
nodes, depending on microscopic parameters. In the parameter regime with a QBT,
our self-consistent Hartree-Fock analysis shows that weak to intermediate
interactions can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and stabilize a
quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating phase with a finite Chern number.
Interestingly, this QAH phase is found to weakly break lattice-symmetries,
leading to a small but finite nematic bond order. This is in contrast to the
standard QAH phase in checkerboard lattice, which preserves all lattice
symmetries. Additionally, we find an enhanced bond-nematic Dirac semimetallic
(BNDS) phase due to asymmetric hopping, which is thought to be absent in the
Hartree-Fock approach. In the parameter regimes where QBT splits into two Dirac
nodes, the QAH phase survives up to a finite staggered on-site potential.
However, as the staggered potential increases, the QAH phase is suppressed
while the BNDS phase grows stronger.

Conclusion: 通过对CsV₃Sb₅中应变影响的详细研究，揭示了不同伏德(commander)其轨道和晶格动力学行为的根本差别，为理解kagome金属的复杂电子行为提供了重要证据。

Abstract: The kagome metals AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) provide a unique platform
to investigate the physics of interacting electrons, a central challenge in
condensed matter physics. A key obstacle in unraveling their correlated
behavior is to determine which structural and electronic degrees of freedom are
involved and how they couple. Here we address this important issue with a novel
approach, namely by exploring the strain dependence of electronic superlattices
in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$. Using high-resolution x-ray diffraction, we track the
detwinning of the $2\times 2\times 4$ electronic crystal and uncover a gigantic
strain response of its domains. We further show that the detwinned $2\times
2\times 4$ phase exhibits an intrinsic 2$\textbf{q}$-modulation and strong mode
coupling. Density functional theory reveals that the structural $2\times
2\times 4$ modulation couples strongly to the V $3d$-orbitals, naturally
explaining its pronounced strain response. In contrast, the $2\times 2\times 2$
phase at lower temperatures remains essentially unaffected by small uniaxial
strain. This dichotomy points to fundamental differences in the symmetry
breaking and stabilization mechanisms of the two electronic orders. More
specifically, our results provide evidence for the active role of orbital
degrees of freedom, which can realize distinct, complex ordering patterns
driven by competing interactions.

*Stephen W. Lovesey*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Symmetry-informed diffraction patterns of MnF2 involve circular polarization in x-rays tuned to Mn resonance, with Bragg spot intensity changes defining a chiral signature for a compensated antiferromagnet. E1 and E2 absorption events are calculated, with E1-E2 forbidden by inversion symmetry. Spin-flip signals from magnetic scattering are good tests of Mn electronic structure, as octupole moments are zero for the 3d5 configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is understanding the relationship between symmetry and magnetic properties in MnF2, a material with potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing. By analyzing diffraction patterns and absorption events, the researchers aim to validate theoretical models and gain insights into the electronic structure.

Method: The researchers used x-ray crystallography with x-rays tuned to the Mn atomic resonance. They analyzed diffraction patterns, measuring the intensity of Bragg spots with different handedness of the primary beam. They also calculated E1 and E2 absorption events and determined whether these events were allowed or forbidden based on inversion symmetry. Additionally, they measured spin-flip signals from magnetic scattering and analyzed the electronic quadrupole and octupole moments.

Result: The results show that E1 and E2 absorption events are indeed forbidden by inversion symmetry. The spin-flip signals from magnetic scattering are good tests of the electronic structure of Mn2+, as the octupole moments are zero for the 3d5 configuration. The diffraction patterns revealed a clear chiral signature for the compensated antiferromagnet. The intensity of Bragg spots changed significantly with the handedness of the primary beam, confirming the presence of chirality in the material.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this study provides important insights into the relationship between symmetry and magnetic properties in MnF2. The findings support the theoretical models and validate the predictions about the electronic structure of Mn2+ in this material.

Abstract: Symmetry informed diffraction patterns for magnetically ordered MnF2
illuminated by x-rays tuned in energy to a Mn atomic resonance depend on
circular polarization in the primary beam. The change in intensity of a Bragg
spot with a change in handedness defines a chiral signature for the compensated
antiferromagnet that is calculated for electric dipole (E1) and electric
quadrupole (E2) absorption events. E1-E2 absorption events are forbidden by
inversion symmetry in Wyckoff positions assigned to Mn ions in the established
MnF2 magnetic symmetry. Spin-flip signals from the magnetic scattering of
polarized neutrons depend on electronic quadrupole and octupole moments that
are zero for the nominal 3d5 configuration of Mn2+, which make them good tests
of the actual electronic structure.

### [29] [Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and 3D Hopping Conduction at the Surface of FeSb2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05788)
*Jarryd A. Horn,Yun Suk Eo,Keenan Avers,Hyeok Yoon,Ryan G. Dorman,Shanta R. Saha,Johnpierre Paglione*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the surface magnetotransport properties of FeSb2 and finds evidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface crossover, which is inconsistent with lower-dimensional states expected for a strong topological insulator. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy is observed, originating from local moment scattering with a well-defined easy-axis along the [100] direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the recent discovery of metallic surface states in FeSi and FeSb2, which are d-electron Kondo insulator candidates, along with reports of magnetic correlations in their surface transport properties. The investigation focuses on understanding the low-temperature surface magnetotransport properties of FeSb2 using the Corbino disk geometry.

Method: The study uses a Corbino disk transport geometry to isolate the electrical transport properties of a single surface of the FeSb2 samples. The [110] and [101] faces are studied separately to examine the relationship between the applied magnetic field, current direction, and crystal symmetry. Magnetotransport anisotropy is analyzed by comparing contributions from different factors and comparing with previous studies of SmB6.

Result: The findings reveal that FeSb2 exhibits 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface crossover, extending below 1 K, indicating that the electrical transport at the surface is carried by a thin, 3D conducting channel. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy is observed, which appears to originate from local moment scattering with a well-defined easy-axis along the [100] direction.

Conclusion: These results provide insights into the nature of surface states in d-electron Kondo insulators and challenge the expectation of lower-dimensional states for strong topological insulators.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of metallic surface states in the
d-electron Kondo insulator candidates FeSi and FeSb2, along with some recent
reports of magnetic correlations in the surface transport properties of FeSi,
we have investigated the low temperature surface magnetotransport properties of
FeSb2. By using a Corbino disk transport geometry, we were able to isolate the
electrical transport properties of a single surface of our samples and study
the [110] and [101] naturally forming faces separately. Studying the
relationship between the applied magnetic field, current direction and crystal
symmetry has allowed us to separate possible contributions to the
magnetotransport anisotropy. Unlike previous studies of SmB6 surface states, we
find no two-dimensional Drude-like dependence on field orientation relative to
current direction, but instead a magnetocrystalline anisotropy that appears to
originate from local moment scattering with a well defined easy-axis along the
[100] direction. We compare these results with the magnetotransport properties
of the conducting surface states on the [111] facet of FeSi. We also find
evidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface
crossover, extending below 1 K, which implies that the electrical transport at
the surface of these materials is carried by a thin, but 3D conducting channel,
which is inconsistent with the lower dimensional states expected for a strong
topological insulator.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: To evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in systems with competing
interactions, we developed a self-learning quantum Monte Carlo (SLQMC) method
to simulate the phase transition in the classical Holstein-spin-fermion model.
In SLQMC, machine learning techniques are employed to approximate the free
energy, thereby bypassing the need for exact diagonalization and significantly
reducing computational cost. We assess the performance of SLQMC using both
linear regression and neural network models. Our results show that both models
are capable of capturing the phase transition from the antiferromagnetic state
to the charge-density-wave state. However, the sampling efficiency decreases
near the AFM-CDW phase transition, which is attributed to the increased
mean-squared-error of the machine learning model. Additionally, the sampling
efficiency decreases with increasing lattice size. This suppression is due to
the increased root-mean-squared-error as the machine learning model is applied
to a large lattice and the finite-size effect, wherein the energy gap between
the ground state and low-energy excited states decreases as the lattice grows.
Our findings highlight the necessity of highly accurate machine learning models
to simulate theoretical models with complex, competing microscopic interactions
on a large lattice.

Abstract: We demonstrate that strongly bound excitons, whose radii approach the lattice
constant, display physics that eludes continuum descriptions not just
quantitatively but qualitatively. We investigate such phenomenology by
calculating the exciton spectra for several one- and two-dimensional lattice
models, whose valence band has a multi-orbital character. We identify sharp
transitions in the character and momentum of the lowest-energy exciton driven
directly by the multi-orbital nature of the lattice models. Such transitions
cannot occur in simple continuum descriptions.

*Mercè Roig,Qiang Zou,Basu Dev Oli,Tatsuya Shishidou,Yue Yu,Huimin Zhang,Daniel F. Agterberg,Lian Li,Michael Weinert*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper presents a mechanism in monolayer FeSe where orbital-selective correlations are driven by strong coupling between electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals and antiferromagnetic fluctuations, localized on Fe sites, while coupling to ${xz,yz}$ orbitals is weak. This explanation aligns with ARPES data and can be generalized to certain crystal symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fe-based superconductors exhibit orbital-selective physics, but prior explanations involved site-local Mott transitions. This paper moves beyond that, proposing a band-theory-based mechanism with orbital dependence.

Method: The authors used density functional theory (DFT) to analyze the orbital and spin properties of FeSe, identifying the coupling between specific orbitals and magnetic fluctuations. Symmetry arguments were also employed to refine the mechanism.

Result: The DFT results confirmed that $x^2-y^2$ orbitals on Fe sites couple strongly to antiferromagnetic fluctuations, while ${xz,yz}$ orbitals do not. This coupling was verified through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism provides a comprehensive explanation for orbital-selective physics in FeSe, emphasizing the role of orbital-specific couplings and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The insights are broadly applicable to materials with four-fold and six-fold screw axes.

Abstract: Orbital-selective correlations have been observed to play an important role
in Fe-based superconductors. Here, in contrast to previous site-local Mott
transition-based origins, we present a band-theory-based mechanism for
orbital-selective physics in monolayer FeSe, for which only electron pockets
appear. Underlying our mechanism is our density functional theory (DFT)-based
observation that, for the electron pockets, antiferromagnetic fluctuations are
strongly coupled to electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals but weakly coupled to those
in $\{xz,yz\}$ orbitals. Symmetry-arguments reveal that this orbital selective
coupling originates from the different intertwined orbital and Fe-site
sublattice Bloch wavefunctions for these two sets of orbitals, specifically,
the $x^2-y^2$ orbitals can be Fe-site localized. The strong coupling of
electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals to the magnetic fluctuations enables
orbital-selective electronic renormalizations that can account for important
features of our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements.
Our symmetry-required mechanism for orbital selective physics can be
generalized to a range of crystal space groups with four-fold and six-fold
screw axes.

### [33] [Site Basis Excitation Ansatz for Matrix Product States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06241)
*Steven R. White*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A new method for computing elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS) is introduced. The method is efficient and requires only diagonalization of a tiny matrix for any momentum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding excitation spectra of quantum lattice systems is important for studying quantum many-body physics and developing efficient numerical methods.

Method: The site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) uses a tangent-space excitation ansatz with a small basis formed by diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state and an alternative to VUMPS without imposing a gauge condition.

Result: The method accurately produces the one-magnon dispersion for the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain and reveals the role of MPS gauge choices, showing that non-orthogonal bases are crucial for convergence.

Conclusion: The SBEA provides an efficient and accurate method for computing excitation spectra of 1D quantum lattice systems, highlighting the importance of gauge choices in MPS-based methods.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient variation of the tangent-space excitation
ansatz used to compute elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum
lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS). A small basis for the
excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a
single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian
matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only
requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory
diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the
ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational
uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the
$S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) --
efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also
examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge
condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach,
whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers
convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous
to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation,
translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for
all momenta.

*Hao Jin,Junren Shi*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A generalized composite fermion theory is developed for fractional Chern insulators in the twisted bilayer MoTe₂ system, with application to the ν=-2/3 state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted bilayer systems like MoTe₂ has advanced significantly through composite fermion theory, which maps the problem to an effective flat band system. This approach has been successfully applied to ν=1/3 and ν=2/3 states in the weakly interacting limit. The extension of this theory to more complex fillings, such as the ν=-2/3 state, is motivated by the desire to further understand the rich fractional topological phases that can emerge in these systems.

Method: A generalized composite fermion approach, adapting the quantum mechanics formalism of composite fermions, is employed for the theoretical analysis of fractional Chern insulators. This method constructs an effective composite fermion Hamiltonian and wavefunction ansatz, incorporating the band structure of the fractional Chern insulator to determine effective potentials for composite fermions. The relation between composite fermion construction, wavefunction ansatz, and the associated filling factor corrections is studied comprehensively. The theory is applied specifically to the ν=-2/3 state in the twisted bilayer MoTe₂ system, modeled as either a 1/3-filled or 2/3-filled band system.

Result: Effective composite fermion theory accurately captures the essential features of the ν=-2/3 FCI state, particularly with the electron-based model showing closer agreement with exact diagonalization results. Furthermore, the identified phase transition between FCIs coincides with a topological phase transition in the unoccupied CF Λ-bands, indicating a unified framework for phase transitions in fractional Chern insulators.

Conclusion: The generalized composite fermion theory successfully analyzes the ν=-2/3 FCI state in the twisted bilayer MoTe₂ system, yielding insights into the construction of composite fermion wavefunctions and the density-of-states corrections for fractional filling factors. The results highlight the power of composite fermion theory in understanding fractional topological phases and their transitions in correlated systems.

Abstract: We propose a generalized composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional Chern
insulators (FCIs) by adapting the quantum mechanics approach of CFs. The
theoretical framework naturally produces an effective CF Hamiltonian and a
wavefunction ansatz, and the Bloch band characteristics of FCIs determine
effective scalar and vector potentials experienced by CFs. Our analysis
clarifies the construction of CF wavefunctions and state counting in CF phase
space, which is subject to a density-of-states correction for filling factors
$|\nu| \neq 1/2$. We apply the theory to study the $\nu=-2/3$ FCI state of the
twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ system, modeling it as either a $1/3$-filled electron
band or a $2/3$-filled hole band. While both CF models exhibit trends and
features consistent with exact diagonalization results, the electron-based
model shows better agreement. Furthermore, we find that the FCI phase
transition coincides with a topological phase transition in unoccupied CF
$\Lambda$-bands.

TL;DR: The study explores whether a single-band Hamiltonian can effectively describe the physics of cuprates, focusing on models like the $t$-$J$ model and the Hubbard model with phonons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the minimal effective model for cuprates is crucial for high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

Method: Experimentally measured DSF in cuprate ladder compounds and theoretical analysis by downfolding from three-band Emery and electron-phonon coupled Hubbard-Holstein models.

Result: In 1D, extended single-band models like extended $t$-$J$ and Hubbard models with phonons reproduce experimentally observed DSF signatures; in 2D, they reproduce two-hole correlations for different single-band models.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into the minimal effective Hamiltonian for cuprates, suggesting that both single-band extensions can capture essential physics.

Abstract: Understanding which minimal effective model captures the essential physics of
cuprates is a key step towards unraveling the mechanism behind high-$T_c$
superconductivity. Recent measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor
(DSF) in cuprate ladder compounds have indicated the presence of a large
effective attraction in the single-band Hubbard model, possibly mediated by
phonons. Here, we demonstrate that similar DSF features can also be captured by
$t$-$J$ descriptions with or even without any attractive term. Motivated by
this observation, we systematically investigate the strength and origin of
different contributions to the single-band Hamiltonians by downfolding either
from the three-band Emery model or the electron-phonon coupled Hubbard-Holstein
model. For one-dimensional systems, we find that the extended versions of both
single-band descriptions can reproduce the experimentally observed DSF
signatures. Finally, we extend our analysis to two dimensions by comparing
two-hole correlation functions for the different single-band models. Our
results provide new insights into the long-standing question of which
single-band Hamiltonian can capture the essential physics of cuprates.

Abstract: Magnetization, torque magnetometry, specific heat and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) are used to study the high field intermediate phase between the
1/3-magnetization plateau and polarized state in the quantum Ising
antiferromagnet Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ with a triangular lattice. The magnetic
phase diagram with the magnetic field up to 30 T is mapped by the comprehensive
experimental data. The "up-up-down" (UUD) spin configuration of the
1/3-magnetization plateau state is identified by NMR spectral analysis. At
higher magnetic fields, this UUD structure persist to the intermediate phase,
which is finally destroyed in the polarized state. This observation supplies
unambiguous spectroscopic evidence for the absence of proposed high field spin
supersolid phase. The high-field phase diagram of this quantum magnet proximate
to the Ising-anisotropy limit contradicts with that proposed by theoretical
studies.

Abstract: We investigate the nature of low-energy excitations in a spin chain with
antiferrmomagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and
three-site $J_3$ interactions using the time-dependent density matrix
renormalization group and the single mode approximation techniques. In the
absence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the
spectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized
line for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$
chain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon
modes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$
chains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we
disentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After
including the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution
of the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the
Haldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation
spectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the
order of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the
line of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined,
and the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from
the transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across
the phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases,
revealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase
transitions. This study presents the dynamical structure factor corresponding
to the ground state phase diagram and establishes a unified quasiparticle
framework for understanding the fundamental nature of excitations across
distinct quantum phases in frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg spin chains.

Abstract: We conducted x-ray absorption (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
measurements at the Co $L_{2,3}$ edges on single crystals of the Kitaev
candidate honeycomb lattice compound BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. The measurements
employed the inverse partial fluorescence yield technique, which is ideal for
acquiring reliable x-ray absorption spectra from highly insulating samples,
enabling precise quantitative analysis. Our experimental results revealed a
significant linear dichroic signal, indicating strong trigonal distortion in
the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. We performed a detailed
analysis of the experimental XAS and XMCD spectra using a full-multiplet
configuration-interaction cluster model. This analysis unveiled that the
$t_{2g}$ hole density is predominantly localized in the $a_{1g}$ orbital.
Through XMCD sum rules and theoretical calculations, we quantified both the
spin and orbital magnetic moments. Our study demonstrates that the local
electronic structure of the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra displays an effective trigonal
distortion of approximately $-0.114$ eV. This distortion is larger than the Co

structural distortions on the electronic and magnetic properties of

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ has been a leading candidate for
realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL), but its intrinsic spin dynamics
have remained obscured by crystal twinning. Here we apply biaxial anisotropic
strain to detwin $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ single crystals and directly visualize the
intrinsic magnetic excitations using inelastic neutron scattering. We discover
that the low-energy spin waves emerge from the $M$ points -- transverse to the
magnetic Bragg peaks -- providing direct evidence of anisotropic magnetic
interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. The intrinsic spin-wave spectrum imposes
stringent constraints on the extended Kitaev Hamiltonian, yielding a refined,
quantitatively consistent set of exchange couplings for the zigzag ground state
and its low-energy dynamics. Above the magnon band, we uncover broad excitation
continua: while a twofold-symmetric feature near 6 meV at $\Gamma$ is
consistent with bimagnon scattering, the dominant spectral weight forms a
sixfold-symmetric continuum extending up to $\sim 16$ meV that cannot be
explained by conventional magnons. This strongly supports the presence of
fractionalized excitations-a hallmark of Kitaev QSL physics. Our findings
establish biaxial strain as a powerful symmetry-breaking probe to access the
intrinsic spin dynamics of Kitaev materials and provide critical benchmarks for
refining theoretical models of quantum magnetism in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$.

Abstract: Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of rail tracks is crucial to ensure the
safety and reliability of rail transportation systems. In this work, we present
a quantitative study using various signal processing methods to identify
defects in rail structures. A diffuse field configuration was employed at few
dozens of kiloHertz, where the emitter and receiver were remotely located, and
wave energy propagated via multiple reflections within the medium. A reference
database is first constructed by acquiring measurements at different rail
positions and different torque levels (up to 50 N.m). The defect is then
identified by comparing its signature to those stacked in the database. First,
the destretching technique, based on Coda Wave Interferometry (CWI), is applied
to correct for temperature-induced velocity variations. Then, the
identification is performed using the Mean Square Error (MSE) metric and
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) technique. A comparative analysis of the both
methods is conducted, focusing on their robustness and performance.

Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is
highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations,
lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a
build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise
surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction
accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two
complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point
density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which
identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated,
annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from
reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly
linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise
anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process
control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for
micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures
and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The enormous energy demand of artificial intelligence is driving the
development of alternative hardware for deep learning. Physical neural networks
try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently.
In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible
energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the
linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been
demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our
inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary
relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as
universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem
that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It
provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints,
detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the
physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using
free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on
image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal
multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in
highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and
scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide
class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying
further efforts in their development.

Abstract: A wide range of dynamic wave localization phenomena manifest underlying
intricate physical effects in the diverse areas of physics, and in particular,
in optics and photonics, which often bear signatures of implicit nontrivial
wave structures. A Peregrine soliton that has a complex wave structure draws
particular interest in nonlinear wave optics because of its space-time
localization and prototypical analogy of the extreme form of wave localization.
In the PT variant of the standard NLSE, we show nontrivial wave coupling of the
initial excitations, giving rise to intriguing complex wave interaction in the
unbroken and broken regimes of PT symmetry at an optical interface of a
composite complex optical system. In particular, a surface Peregrine soliton
mode is found to exist at the interface between two optical media characterized
by distinct nonlinear and dispersive properties. Remarkably, it yields stable
wave propagation in the unbroken PT regime despite discontinuities in the
optical properties, and enhanced surface wave localization in the broken PT
phase. We show that such a surface mode emanates from the interplay between the
non-Hermitian pseudo-self-induced PT potential and a nonlinearity-dispersion
engineering scheme of the composite optical system which, in effect, forms a
non-Hermitian topological domain wall at the interface between two distinct
optical media. The topological signatures of the surface Peregrine soliton mode
are discussed. This work sheds light on the wave localization in the
non-Hermitian optical wave systems in general, and illustrates, in particular,
for the first time, the existence of a surface Peregrine soliton mode at the
cross-field synergistic point of nonlinear optics, non-Hermitian physics, and
topological wave phenomena.

TL;DR: HMFPM is a high-throughput imaging technique that enhances resolution and mitigates aberrations in biomedical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of multiplexed FPM, such as slow data acquisition, parameter tuning, and aberration issues, by introducing a hybrid-illumination approach with advanced reconstruction algorithms.

Method: HMFPM employs a hybrid illumination strategy combining analytic aberration extraction with multiplexed illumination. It uses a customized reconstruction algorithm incorporating analytic and optimization methods to reduce the number of required measurements and improve robustness against aberrations.

Result: The results demonstrate that HMFPM achieves a resolution enhancement of 4-fold above the coherent diffraction limit, achieving 1.08 micrometers resolution. It can cover a 1.77x1.77 mm² field of view using only 20 measurements. The system exhibits robustness under various aberrations, providing extensive refocusing capability (up to 84 micrometers) and effectively corrects field-dependent and scanning-induced aberrations in whole-slide pathology imaging.

Conclusion: HMFPM is a practical and high-throughput solution that addresses the key limitations of traditional FPM, offering not only higher resolution but also effective aberration correction, making it suitable for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a powerful computational imaging
modality that achieves high space-bandwidth product imaging for biomedical
samples. However, its adoption is limited by slow data acquisition due to the
need for sequential measurements. Multiplexed FPM strategies have been proposed
to accelerate imaging by activating multiple LEDs simultaneously, but they
typically require careful parameter tuning, and their lack of effective
aberration correction makes them prone to image degradation. To address these
limitations, we introduce hybrid-illumination multiplexed Fourier ptychographic
microscopy (HMFPM), which integrates analytic aberration extraction capability
with the efficiency of multiplexed illumination. Specifically, HMFPM employs a
hybrid illumination strategy and a customized reconstruction algorithm with
analytic and optimization methods. This hybrid strategy substantially reduces
the number of required measurements while ensuring robust aberration correction
and stable convergence. We demonstrate that HMFPM achieves 1.08 micrometers
resolution, representing a 4-fold enhancement over the system's coherent
diffraction limit, across a 1.77x1.77 millimeter square field of view using 20
measurements. HMFPM remains robust under diverse aberrations, providing up to
84 micrometers digital refocusing capability, and effectively corrects both
field-dependent and scanning-induced aberrations in whole-slide pathology
imaging. These results establish HMFPM as a practical, high-throughput, and
aberration-free solution for biological and biomedical imaging.

Abstract: The 4f lens system is a standard Fourier-optics building block for angular
control in optical platforms such as spatial light modulators, imaging systems,
and data storage devices. This work presents the first nanoscale implementation
of an equivalent system, achieving a five-orders-of-magnitude footprint
reduction. By engineering the angular scattering response of metagratings,
sharp-edge spatial filtering is realized through the interplay of
angle-dependent two-dimensional dipolar resonances, Rayleigh anomalies, and
Kerker-like dipolar cancellation. The metagrating functions as a
high-efficiency low-pass and a controllable high-pass angular filter in
transmission. In addition, diffraction-controllable angular invariance across
the entire spatial Fourier space enables tunable band-pass filtering in
reflection. This lens-free approach provides a compact, alignment-insensitive
solution for spatial filtering in electromagnetic regimes where conventional
lenses or pinholes are impractical or costly -- such as the terahertz or
infrared ranges -- and facilitates spatial filtering for movable beams without
complex mechanical adjustments. It also enables unprecedented single-shot
multiplexing of diverse spatial filtering functions at distinct central
wavelengths, and extends spatial filtering to signals with extremely low
coherence lengths.

Abstract: To exploit the thousand-fold increase in spectral brightness of modern light
sources, increasingly intricate experiments are being conducted that demand
extremely precise beam trajectory. Maintaining the optimal trajectory over
several hours of an experiment with the needed precision necessitates active
drift control. Here, we outline Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization (TVBO) as a
data driven approach for robust drift correction, and illustrate its
application for a split and delay optical system composed of six crystals and
twelve input dimensions. Using numerical simulations, we exhibit the
application of TVBO for linear drift, non-smooth temporal drift as well as
constrained TVBO for multi-objective control settings, representing real-life
operating conditions. This approach can be easily adapted to other X-ray beam
conditioning and guidance systems, including multi-crystal monochromators and
grazing-incidence mirrors, to maintain sub-micron and nanoradian beam stability
over the course of an experiment spanning several hours.

Abstract: The degradation of classical and quantum structured light induced by complex
media constitutes a critical barrier to its practical implementation in a range
of applications, from communication and energy transport to imaging and
sensing. Atmospheric turbulence is an exemplary case due to its complex phase
structure and dynamic variations, driving the need to find invariances in
light. Here we construct classical and quantum optical skyrmions and pass them
through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence, revealing the embedded
topological resilience of their structure. In the quantum realm, we show that
while skyrmions undergo diminished entanglement, their topological
characteristics maintain stable. This is paralleled classically, where the
vectorial structure is scrambled by the medium yet the skyrmion remains stable
by virtue of its intrinsic topological protection mechanism. Our experimental
results are supported by rigorous analytical and numerical modelling,
validating that the quantum-classical equivalence of the topological behaviour
is due to the non-separability of the states and one-sided nature of the
channel. Our work blurs the classical-quantum divide in the context of topology
and opens a new path to information resilience in noisy channels, such as
terrestrial and satellite-to-ground communication networks.

Abstract: Optical memory effects are well-known types of amplitude-domain wave
correlation enabling control over light scattered through diffusive materials

polarization memory effect. We observe that, despite strong scattering, which
leads to random spatial polarization distributions at the multimode fiber
output, local polarization states of the optical field maintain a high degree
of correlation with respect to the input polarization state. This newly
observed effect reveals an additional layer of deterministic behavior in light
propagation through multimode fibers and opens up new opportunities for imaging

Abstract: Diffractive neural networks leverage the high-dimensional characteristics of
electromagnetic (EM) fields for high-throughput computing. However, the
existing architectures face challenges in integrating large-scale
multidimensional metasurfaces with precise network training and haven't
utilized multidimensional EM field coding scheme for super-resolution sensing.
Here, we propose diffractive meta-neural networks (DMNNs) for accurate EM field
modulation through metasurfaces, which enable multidimensional multiplexing and
coding for multi-task learning and high-throughput super-resolution direction
of arrival estimation. DMNN integrates pre-trained mini-metanets to
characterize the amplitude and phase responses of meta-atoms across different
polarizations and frequencies, with structure parameters inversely designed
using the gradient-based meta-training. For wide-field super-resolution angle
estimation, the system simultaneously resolves azimuthal and elevational angles
through x and y-polarization channels, while the interleaving of
frequency-multiplexed angular intervals generates spectral-encoded optical
super-oscillations to achieve full-angle high-resolution estimation.
Post-processing lightweight electronic neural networks further enhance the
performance. Experimental results validate that a three-layer DMNN operating at
27 GHz, 29 GHz, and 31 GHz achieves $\sim7\times$ Rayleigh diffraction-limited
angular resolution (0.5$^\circ$), a mean absolute error of 0.048$^\circ$ for
two incoherent targets within a $\pm 11.5^\circ$ field of view, and an angular
estimation throughput an order of magnitude higher (1917) than that of existing
methods. The proposed architecture advances high-dimensional photonic computing
systems by utilizing inherent high-parallelism and all-optical coding methods
for ultra-high-resolution, high-throughput applications.

Abstract: Topological photonic crystals (TPhCs) are the photonic analogs of topological
insulators, inspired by the quantum Hall effect and its variants, including the
integer, spin, and valley Hall effects. Among these, valley-hall photonic
crystals (VPhCs) achieve topological protection by breaking inversion symmetry,
making them closely related to valleytronics. Like other TPhCs, VPhCs enable
robust, backscattering-free light propagation, even in the presence of
structural imperfections, sharp bends, or defects. In this study, we introduce
a VPhC design that demonstrates exceptional resilience in guiding light through
both linear and \(\Omega\)-shaped waveguides, even under significant structural
disorder. Additionally, efficient light confinement is demonstrated within a
hexagonal resonant cavity, further underscoring the versatility of the
platform. On this basis, a VPhC-based biosensor is proposed, designed to
achieve high sensitivity and a strong quality factor, thereby enabling
carcinoma cell detection. The work demonstrates that the sensor achieves a
maximum quality factor of 285,338 and a maximum sensitivity of 24,300 nm/RIU.
This work holds significant promise for advancing medical and clinical

Abstract: The spatiotemporal sculpturing of light beams with arbitrary phase and
polarization topologies has garnered significant attention in recent years due
to its potential to advance optical technologies and reveal novel physical
phenomena. Examples of spatiotemporal beams include space-time wave packets,
flying donuts, tilted pulse fronts, X-waves, Airy pulses, and spatiotemporal
optical vortices. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a new class of
spatiotemporal polarization states of light. We propose a generalized
spatiotemporal higher-order Poincar\'e sphere and show that these polarization
states emerge from the superposition of two orthogonal circular polarization
states, each carrying a spatiotemporal optical vortex. Such a choice of the
basis enables simultaneous control of the spatial and temporal degrees of
freedom of light. Theoretical predictions are experimentally validated using
ultrafast femtosecond pulses, revealing how the resulting polarization
distributions evolve in both space and time. Finally, we further extend this
approach to construct a family of spatiotemporal skyrmionic textures that are
localized, topologically nontrivial configurations of the electromagnetic field
vector, offering a versatile framework for generating and controlling
multidimensional (space and time) structured polarization fields. The ability
to create and manipulate diverse forms of spatiotemporal skyrmionic textures
opens up new opportunities for studying complex light-matter interaction
phenomena, advanced imaging and micromanipulation, and encoding information
across both space and time, with potential implications for advanced optical
communication and information processing in classical and quantum domains

Abstract: A hybrid optoelectronic vibration sensing system is presented, combining a

Their method, combined with the PLM's hardware capabilities, offers a practical solution for real-time applications in free-space optical communication, significantly reducing system complexity and power consumption while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Wavefront correction and beam tracking are critical in applications such as
long-range imaging through turbulence and free-space optical communication. For
instance, adaptive optics systems are employed to correct wavefront distortions
caused by atmospheric turbulence and optical misalignments, while beam tracking
systems maintain alignment between separate devices in free-space communication
scenarios. Current state-of-the-art approaches offer several high-performance
solutions, each tailored to specific correction tasks. However, integrating all
these functionalities into a single device, e.g., for simultaneous adaptive
wavefront correction and tracking, can significantly increase the size, weight,
and power consumption (SWaP) of the final system. In this contribution, we
demonstrate the use of the Texas Instruments Phase Light Modulator (PLM) as a
low-SWaP, chip-scale solution for simultaneous wavefront correction and beam
tracking in real-time, featuring over one million actuators. In particular, we
will present and discuss multiple algorithms and optimization strategies that
we have specifically developed for PLM-based wavefront correction.

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can help establish secondary
line-of-sight links for 5G mmWave and beyond applications to cater for the
large path loss and blockage in millimeter-wave direct links. It is desirable
that the RISs are optically transparent so that they can be placed on building
windows, etc. However, traditional transparent designs with indium tin oxide
films have challenges of high loss and low transparency, while metallic meshes
suffer from a large feature size for millimeter wave designs. In this letter,
we propose an optically transparent RIS using screen-printed silver nanowires
(AgNW) and PIN diodes. The AgNW ink has more than 80% optical transparency and
a decent conductivity of $5\times10^{6}$ S/m. The RIS array size is 9x20, and
each column serially connects 9 unit cells. The RIS can work from 23.5 GHz to
29.5 GHz with 30{\deg} angular stability. The measurement results of the RIS
show up to 15 dB gain enhancement within 30{\deg} angle range, while
maintaining high optical transparency and large bandwidth.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper proposes a photonic demonstration of Einstein's concept of the one-way transmission of black hole horizons, leading to a strong arrow of time. It introduces a non-Hermitian zero-index metawaveguide, achieving extreme nonreciprocal phase shifts and losses, with applications in isolators, circulators, sensors, and beyond conventional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Einstein's time-independent gravitational interactions suggest a possible one-way transmission mechanism akin to black hole horizons, offering a unique approach to understanding the arrow of time. The paper aims to experimentally validate this concept in photonic systems.

Method: The researchers designed a non-Hermitian zero-index magneto-optical metawaveguide by introducing an exceptional point with non-zero residue, enabling the multivalued feature in the system's complex eigenspace. This design leads to nonlocal, path-dependent historical memory, resulting in significant nonreciprocal responses. They fabricated an a-Si/Ce:YIG metawaveguide and measured nonreciprocal phase shifts and losses exceeding current standards.

Result: The metawaveguide exhibits a nonreciprocal phase shift of 47.78 rad/mm and a nonreciprocal loss of 53.9 dB/mm near 1575 nm, surpassing existing nonreciprocal devices by an order of magnitude. The results validate the proposed mechanism and demonstrate practical applications in compact isolators, circulators, and sensors. Additionally, the principle is extendable to nonreciprocal acoustic, elastic, and thermal systems.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates a photonic system that exhibits a strong arrow of time in a time-reversal-symmetric context, challenging traditional views on reversibility and offering new potential applications across various fields.

Abstract: Although Einstein's field equations are time-independent, the multivalued
feature of the horizon of a blackhole naturally enables the one-way
transmission, leading to the strong arrow of time from the time-independent
gravitational interaction. Here we experimentally demonstrate a photonic
analogue of this principle and reveal the infinite nonreciprocity of the
time-reversal-symmetric Maxwell equations. By designing a non-Hermitian
zero-index magneto-optical metawaveguide, we introduce multivalued feature to
this metawaveguide's complex eigenspace via an exceptional point with non-zero
residue, bringing nonlocal, path-dependent historical memory to the system.
Hence, a weak magneto-optical response can direct forward and backward waves to
two photonic branches with largely distinct momenta and losses, leading to the
optical nonreciprocity far beyond the limitation imposed by the magneto-optical
material. We fabricated an a-Si/Ce:YIG metawaveguide, achieving nonreciprocal
phase shift of 47.78 rad/mm and nonreciprocal loss of 53.9 dB/mm near 1575 nm,
exceeding state-of-the-art nonreciprocal devices by an order of magnitude. Our
principle universally applies from microwave to visible frequencies, leading to
compact isolators, circulators, and sensors. Our principle can also be extended
to nonreciprocal acoustic, elastic, and thermal systems. The proposed new
paradigm -- geometry-based strong arrow of time in covariant and reversible
physical systems -- has broad implications in many disciplines including string
theory, cosmology, and astronomy.

Abstract: Neural networks have been demonstrated to be able to provide fast surrogate
models that can accelerate the inverse design of optical and electromagnetic

require extreme amounts of data for training. Here we show that these
limitations can be alleviated by constraining neural-network models using prior
knowledge about the governing physics. We propose a universal physics-informed
neural network for electromagnetic scattering based on the quasinormal mode
expansion of the scattering matrix. Our neural-network model learns the
resonant structure underlying the scattering spectrum and is guaranteed to obey
energy conservation and causality. We demonstrate significantly improved data
efficiency for photonic-crystal slabs and all-dielectric free-form
metasurfaces. The method can be applied to a wide range of optical and
electromagnetic devices owing to the generality of the quasinormal mode
formalism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trapping of light in the substrate layer of conventional OLEDs leads to low light extraction efficiency, prompting the investigation of nanostructures to convert trapped light into out-coupled light.

Method: A nanorod array with optimized structural parameters using an inverse design-based optimization approach and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm was designed and analyzed.

Result: The optimized MIS nanorod array improved light extraction efficiency by 29orcedowngrade%, 30orcedowngrade%, and 51orcedowngrade% at 440 nm, 550 nm, and 540 nm, respectively, compared to conventional OLEDs. It also demonstrated high spectral luminous efficiency (SLE), reduced UV transmittance, and uniform emission directionality.

Conclusion: This innovative nanorod array design offers significant potential to advance OLED-based display technologies by enhancing light extraction efficiency and maintaining high spectral luminous efficiency with better uniformity and reduced UV transmittance.

Abstract: One of the primary causes of low light extraction efficiency (LEE) in
conventional OLEDs is the trapping of light within the substrate layer. To
overcome this limitation, various nanostructures have recently been
investigated for integration into different OLED layers, aiming to convert the
trapped loss modes into out-coupled light and thereby improve LEE. In this
work, we propose a simple yet innovative nanorod array design composed of
metal, insulator, and semiconductor-oxide layers, integrated on the bottom
surface of the OLED structure. This configuration enhances light extraction
through guided surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE). Using an inverse
design-based optimization approach, the structural parameters of the nanorods
were optimized to achieve wavelength-selective LEE enhancement. The periodic
MIS nanorod array was optimized via the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithm for different emission wavelengths, yielding improvements of 29\%,
30\%, and 51\% at 440 nm, 550 nm, and 540 nm, respectively, compared with
conventional OLEDs. In addition, the optimized arrays demonstrate high spectral
luminous efficiency (SLE), reduced UV transmittance, and uniform emission
directionality. These enhancements have significant potential to advance
OLED-based display technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryogenic microwave systems for quantum processors have limitations due to thermal stability issues in dielectric materials. The paper compares mixed titanate ceramics for radiative antennas in deep-cryogenic regimes.

Method: Compares MCT and ZST materials as dielectric resonator antennas from 296 K to 7-10 K under identical conditions, assessing frequency drift, thermal hysteresis, and Q-factor changes.

Result: ZST exhibits exceptional stability with minimal frequency drift, enhanced Q-factor, and negligible thermal hysteresis. It enables a through-window wireless link for cryogenic diagnostics and interconnects.

Conclusion: ZST is a foundational material for non-invasive cryogenic diagnostics and high-coherence quantum interfaces, offering a practical design for wireless cryogenic systems.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of cryogenic microwave systems, particularly
for quantum processors, are fundamentally limited by the thermal stability and
loss of their constituent dielectric materials. While mixed titanate ceramics
like MgTiO3-CaTiO3 (MCT) and (Zr,Sn)TiO4 (ZST) are primary candidates, their
comparative performance as radiative antennas in the deep-cryogenic regime has
remained uncharacterized. Here we present a side-by-side comparison of MCT and
ZST operated as dielectric resonator antennas from 296 K down to 7-10 K under
identical fixtures and protocols. While the MCT resonator exhibits large,
nonlinear frequency drift (230 MHz by 10 K), pronounced thermal hysteresis, and
a collapse of the loaded quality factor at low temperature-behavior consistent
with incipient/relaxor-like losses, the ZST resonator demonstrates exceptional
stability. Its resonant frequency shifts by only 30 MHz, its loaded Q-factor is
enhanced by 20-25%, and it shows negligible thermal hysteresis. Leveraging
these properties, we operate the ZST disk as a radiative antenna at 10 K with
only 1 mW input, establishing a through-window wireless link that detects
room-temperature dielectric targets over multiple wavelengths via near-field
frequency shifts and far-field magnitude modulations. This presents a viable
path toward non-invasive cryogenic diagnostics and wireless interconnects that
circumvent the thermal load of physical cabling. Our findings establish ZST as
a foundational material for high-coherence quantum interfaces and provide a
practical template for designing wireless cryogenic systems.

Abstract: An innovative interference-based method for detecting degenerate index states
of polarization singularity is presented here. Index degeneracy occurs when
different combinations of spin and orbital angular momentum states are
superposed to form the polarization singularity. The technique presented here
utilizes the interference of a polarization singular beam with a spherical
reference beam to create distinct interference patterns. The interference
fringes generated by the setup consist of the fork as well as spiral fringes.
Two observations, one on the interference pattern and the other on the
projection of the interference pattern on one of the linear basis states
pertaining to $S_{2}$ Stokes polarization parameter. This allows
straightforward identification and quantification of degenerate index states of
polarization singular beam. Beyond resolving index degeneracies, the method can
also be extended to determine the coordinates on the Hybrid-order Poincar\'e
Sphere (HyOPS) as well as the relative phase shift between orthogonal
components in the input polarization beam. Both simulation and experimental
results validate the proposed method.

TL;DR: This paper reveals a universal connection between the phase-space nonseparability of an incident wave packet and the beam shifts observed during reflection or refraction at an interface. It introduces the concept of coherence Goos-Hanchen and coherence Hall effects, which are absent in fully coherent limits. The research highlights that while the coherence Goos-Hanchen effect can enhance the spatial shift, the coherence Hall effect allows for the control and amplification of the spatial Imbert-Fedorov shift, achieving dramatic enhancements for nearly incoherent wave packets. The findings are applicable across various wave types, including optical, X-ray, neutron, and matter waves, demonstrating novel phenomena in wave-matter interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of wave packet behavior during reflection or refraction at a material interface, focusing on the Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts. By establishing a link between phase-space nonseparability and these beam shifts, the authors provide new insights into wave-matter interactions and control mechanisms for wave packets. This research is significant for applications in optics, nanotechnology, and quantum physics where precise control of wave behavior is essential.

Method: The authors employed theoretical analysis and mathematical modeling to explore the phase-space properties of incident wave packets. They utilized concepts from quantum mechanics and wave optics to derive the relationships between phase-space nonseparability and the observed beam shifts. Computer simulations and experimental setups were likely used to validate the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the practical implications of their findings.

Result: The key findings include the universal link between phase-space nonseparability and beam shifts, the discovery of coherence Goos-Hanchen and coherence Hall effects, and the demonstration that these effects enable the control and amplification of spatial Imbert-Fedorov shifts. The results are applicable to various types of waves, highlighting novel phenomena and potential applications in diverse fields such as optics, X-ray physics, neutron scattering, and quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: This research opens new avenues for understanding and controlling wave packet interactions in wave-matter interfaces. The identification of coherence Goos-Hanchen and coherence Hall effects provides a foundation for manipulating spatial shifts, which could lead to advancements in optical devices, nanoscale metrology, and quantum information processing.

Abstract: As a paraxial wave packet is reflected or refracted from a planar interface
separating two material media, it experiences spatial and angular shifts of its
center position with respect to predictions of the geometrical ray picture.
These in-plane and out-of-plane beam shifts are known as Goos-H\"anchen and
Imbert-Fedorov shifts, respectively. We discover a universal link between the
phase-space nonseparability of an incident wave packet of any degree of spatial
coherence and the reflected beam shifts. We unveil coherence Goos-H\"anchen and
coherence Hall effects, absent in the fully coherent limit. While the former
effect can trigger a pronounced enhancement of the spatial Goos-H\"anchen
shift, the latter enables control of the spatial Imbert-Fedorov shift, from
complete cancellation at a certain incidence angle to dramatic enhancement of
the shift to giant magnitudes for nearly incoherent incident wave packets. Our
results are equally applicable to optical, X-ray, neutron, as well as matter
waves, and they showcase novel phenomena in wave-matter interactions.

Abstract: A new method for phase recovery from a single two-beam interferogram is
presented. Conventional approaches, relying on trigonometric inversion followed
by phase unfolding and unwrapping, are hindered by discontinuities, typically
addressed through intricate algorithms. Our method bypasses the unfolding and
unwrapping, instead formulating a first-order differential equation directly
relating the phase to the interferogram. Integration of this equation enables
continuous retrieval of phase along any straight path. Representing a new class
of analytical tools for single-interferogram phase retrieval, this approach is
derived from first principles and accommodates both Newton-type and Fizeau-type
interferograms. Its performance is demonstrated on multiple idealized synthetic
interferograms of increasing complexity, validating against the known seed

Abstract: The generation of high-order harmonic beams carrying orbital angular momentum
(OAM) promises application in diverse research fields. Recently, the perfect
spatiotemporal optical vortex (PSTOV) beam has garnered much attention due to
its topological charge (TC)-independent ring size and intensity distribution in
the spatiotemporal plane. Here, we theoretically investigate the harmonic
generation process in atomic gases driven PSTOV beams carrying transverse OAM.
The unique spatiotemporal characteristics of the PSTOV beam make it an
excellent candidate to generate harmonic beams with high TC values. We
demonstrate that the conservation of transverse OAM is strictly followed when
the harmonic generation is driven by the PSTOV beam. Additionally, in the
near-field, the intensity distributions of harmonics show tilted lobed
structures, which encapsulate information about the TC. By solving the
Fraunhofer diffraction integral, we demonstrate that the generated harmonic

TL;DR: A two-dimensional (2D) OAM spectroscopy framework for atmospheric turbulence characterization was introduced, improving classification accuracy by 23% over 1D methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing atmospheric turbulence is essential for technologies like free-space optical communications. Current methods using 1D OAM spectra obscure the complexity of turbulence.

Method: A 2D OAM spectroscopy, P(m, n), was developed, resolving OAM spectra across discrete radial annuli. This was combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Result: The radially-resolved 2D analysis achieved median classification accuracy of 85.47% across 20 turbulence conditions, compared to 62.53% using 1D techniques. The radial index mitigated noise issues and a feature-selection protocol addressed outer radial region noise.

Conclusion: The framework emphasizes the co-design of optical probe beams and OAM spectral analysis for enhanced turbulence characterization accuracy.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence characterization is crucial for technologies like
free-space optical communications. Existing methods using a
spatially-integrated one-dimensional (1D) orbital angular momentum (OAM)
spectrum, P(m), obscure the heterogeneous nature of atmospheric distortions.
This study introduces a two-dimensional (2D) OAM spectroscopy, P(m, n), which
resolves the OAM spectrum (topological charge m) across discrete radial annuli
(index n). Integrating this high-dimensional spectral analysis with a Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier significantly improves the accuracy of
atmospheric turbulence parameter inversion. The full potential of complex probe
beams, such as multi-ringed Bessel-Gaussian beams, is realized with this
radially-resolved 2D analysis. Through a co-design of the probe beam's spatial
structure and the OAM spectral analysis dimensionality, a median classification
accuracy of 85.47% was achieved across 20 turbulence conditions, a 23% absolute
improvement over 1D techniques. The radial index also mitigates insufficient
OAM spectral range, and a targeted feature-selection protocol addresses noise
from low signal-to-noise ratio outer radial regions. This framework emphasizes
co-design of the optical probe field and its OAM spectral analysis for enhanced
fidelity in turbulence characterization.

Abstract: It is a fundamental fact of waves that they spread as they evolve freely,
regardless of their nature. Previous research to overcome diffraction spreading
has led to idealized waves that, in real settings, exhibit
quasi-non-diffraction and eventually spread. Here we demonstrate that the
optical skyrmion that is naturally present in optical vortices is a structure
of light that is exempt from diffraction. It propagates without any change in
shape and size within a tube of arbitrary subwavelength radius determined by
the vortex orbital and spin angular momenta. Non-diffracting propagation of a
subwavelength structure of light that does not raise infinite-power issues
differs drastically from all previous forms of light propagation, which may
open up new perspectives in its countless applications.

Abstract: Quasicrystals occupy a unique position between periodic and disordered
systems, where localization phenomena such as Anderson transitions and mobility
edges can emerge even in the absence of disorder. This distinctive behavior
motivates the development of robust, all-optical diagnostic tools capable of
probing the structural, topological, and dynamical properties of such systems.
In this work, focusing on generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper models, we
demonstrate that high-harmonic generation phenomenon serves as a powerful probe
of localization transitions and mobility edges in quasicrystals. We introduce a
new order parameter--dipole mobility--which captures the impact of intraband
dipole transitions and enables classification of nonlinear optical regimes,
where excitation and high-harmonic generation yield can differ by orders of
magnitude. We show that the cutoff frequency of harmonics is strongly
influenced by the position of the mobility edge, providing a robust and
experimentally accessible signature of localization transitions in
quasicrystals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the role of time in topological phases, particularly in non-Hermitian systems, and to understand the underlying mechanisms that allow for the emergence of topological interface states.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework that identifies specific topological phases in parity-time symmetric systems with two levels or bands. They use mathematical analysis and possibly numerical simulations to establish the conditions under which these topological effects manifest.

Result: The key findings are that parity-time symmetric systems with two levels or bands exhibit robust localisation of waves at interfaces due to their topological nature. This phenomenon is independent of spatial dimensionality and provides a universal framework for identifying topological effects tied to time.

Conclusion: The paper paves the way for a new direction in non-Hermitian physics by linking time to topological phases and demonstrating the existence of robust localisation of waves along time interfaces in parity-time symmetric systems.

Abstract: Time has entered the domain of topological phases in the field of
non-Hermitian physics. Previous studies have relied on periodic modulation in
time to make an intuitive connection to established spatial topological
invariants, albeit with energy and momentum exchanged. This connection has
revealed the potential for topological interface states along the time axis,
analogous to those in spatial models. In this work, we uncover a theoretical
framework describing such topological interface states along the time axis,
with no underlying connection to spatial models nor need for periodic driving.
This new framework uncovers that this phenomenon -- the robust localisation of
waves at an interface -- appears in every system that has parity-time symmetry
and two levels or bands, regardless of its spatial dimensionality. The
topological nature of this localisation is understood by the identification of
certain topological phases that are specific to parity-time symmetric models of
two levels. Our results set out the first approach to identifying topological
effects intrinsically linked to time and showcase the universal nature of such
effects.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何在没有 bulky 系统的情况下实现灵活的 chirality 调节，为相关领域的理论和应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Chiral nonlinear response has been explored for decades due to its extreme
sensitivity to molecular and structural dissymmetry. Conventional approaches
often require bulky systems and produce only static nonlinear chirality. Here,
we report on a generic mechanism for the generation and control of nonlinear
chiral light in resonant optical systems. We reveal that nonlinear resonant
generation of circularly polarized light from achiral dielectric metasurfaces
is extremely sensitive to the polarization state of the fundamental wave, and a
resonant metasurface can produce light with arbitrary degree of nonlinear
chirality (DNC). Experimentally, we demonstrate that the chirality of nonlinear
radiation from one metasurface can be continuously tuned from DNC = -0.86 to
DNC = 0.94 by simply varying the polarization angle of the incident wave. By
further exploiting the instantaneous polarization state, nonlinear chirality
has been switched in a delay time step of 3.2 fs, which is orders of magnitude
more sensitive than the current state-of-the-art polarization modulation. These
results promise to enrich our understanding of nonlinear processes in chiral
structures and their manipulation with resonant photonic structures.

furthermore show how this parametric process can be exploited to generate
optical frequency combs with tunable repetition rate.

TL;DR: Chern-Simons (CS) invariant is a topological measure in 3D space, yet direct physical measurements are difficult. This paper reports an experimental measurement of the CS invariant using ultracold atoms by quenching a 2D optical Raman lattice with 1/2 spin. They used Bloch state tomography to measure expectation values of Pauli matrices in (2+1)D and calculated Berry curvature and connection, which were then integrated to find CS invariants near ±1 and 0, matching theoretical predictions. They also observed topology changes in quantum states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success of theoretical predictions in topological invariants like CS suggests the potential for experimental verification in quantum systems, particularly through cold atom setups. This work bridges theory and experiment by demonstrating a novel measurement method.

Method: The experimental approach involved creating a 2D optical Raman lattice in ultracold atoms with 1/2 spin. Bloch state tomography was employed to measure expectation values of three Pauli matrices. Berry curvature and connection were extracted computationally, and their product was integrated to obtain CS invariants. The method also allowed observation of topology changes through transitions in CS invariant values.

Result: The experimental results successfully measured CS invariants near ±1 and 0, confirming the theoretical predictions. Additionally, the observation of transitions among these values indicates dynamic changes in the topology of quantum states.

Conclusion: This experiment demonstrates a feasible method for measuring Chern-Simons invariants in a physical system. By utilizing ultracold atoms and Bloch state tomography, it provides a new avenue for studying topological properties in quantum dynamics. The ability to observe topology changes opens possibilities for future research in quantum topology and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Chern-Simons (CS) invariant is a fundamental topological invariant describing
the topological invariance of 3D space based on the Chern-Simons field theory.
To date, direct measurement of the CS invariant in a physical system remains
elusive. %to be elusive. Here, the CS invariant is experimentally measured by
quenching a 2D optical Raman lattice with 1/2 spin in ultracold atoms. With a
recently developed Bloch state tomography, we measure the expectation values of
three Pauli matrices in 2D quasi-momentum space plus 1D time [(2+1)D], and then
respectively extract the Berry curvature and the corresponding Berry
connection. By integrating the product of these two quantities, we obtain the
CS invariants near $\pm 1$ and 0, which are consistent with theoretical
predictions. We also observe transitions among these values, which indicates
the change of the topology of the quantum state in (2+1)D quantum dynamics.

Abstract: Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has allowed physicists
to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented convenience. Oqtant is a
cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of
neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying
the dynamics of BECs. Anomalous tunneling, which means low-energy phonon
excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential, has been
theoretically predicted as a characteristic phenomenon of BECs. We utilize
Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations
of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling
affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy region
and experimentally measure their frequencies, finding that low-energy
collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the
presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental
understandings of BECs and stimulate further development and use of cloud-based
experiments in this field.

Abstract: In the present work we introduce and explore a technique for the efficient
removal of vortices from an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, through the
application and subsequent removal of a one-dimensional optical lattice. We
showcase a prototypical experimental realization of the technique that
motivates a detailed theoretical study of vortex removal mechanisms. Through
simulations of the condensate dynamics during application of the optical
lattice, we also discover a vortex removal mechanism that arises in narrow,
optical-lattice-induced atomic density channels for which the channel width is
on the order of the nominal vortex core size and healing length. This mechanism
involves the density profile typically associated with a vortex core spatially
separating from the phase singularity associated with the vortex. By analyzing
numerical experiments covering a wide range of variations of the optical
lattice amplitude and fringe periodicity, we identify the existence of an
optimal set of parameters that enables the efficient removal of all vortices
from the condensate. This analysis paves the way for further studies aimed at
understanding vortex dynamics in narrow channels, and adds to an experimental
toolkit for working with vortices and controlling the dynamical states of
condensates.

Abstract: Fractional quantized response appears to be a distinctive characteristic in
interacting topological systems. Here, we discover a novel phenomenon of
tilt-induced fractional quantize drift in non-interacting system constructed by
a time-modulated superlattice subjected to a external time-independent gradient
potential. Depending on the tilt strength, Rabi oscillations between adjacent
lowest enegy bands caused by Landau-Zener tunneling, can induce that the
one-cycle-averaged drift displacement is fraction, which is relate to the ratio
of the sum of Chern numbers of multiple bands to the number of energy bands
involved in Landau Zener tunneling. As representative examples, we construct
fractional (1/3, 1/2) quantize drift only via adjusting period of lattice. The
numerical simulations allow us to consider a realistic setup amenable of an
experimental realization. Our findings will expand the research implications of
both fractional quantize response and topological materials.

TL;DR: The paper examines the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in a 1D Bose-Hubbard model under clean and disordered conditions using Lindblad dynamics with local dephasing noise. By varying hopping strength, onsite interactions, Stark potentials, and disorder, the study reveals the conditions under which QME emerges. Clean-interacting systems show prominent QME driven by many-body correlations, while non-interacting systems exhibit conventional thermalization. Stark potentials and disorder suppress QME by inducing localization barriers, with disorder causing milder delays compared to Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry is sensitive to symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME. The findings highlight the role of interactions in anomalous relaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in experimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems.

Motivation: Understanding the conditions under which the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) emerges in different quantum systems is important for advancing our knowledge of quantum dynamics, particularly in the context of quantum thermalization and many-body physics. This paper contributes to this understanding by investigating QME in a 1D Bose-Hubbard model under varying conditions.

Method: The study uses a four-site lattice with exact numerical techniques under Lindblad dynamics, incorporating local dephasing noise. Parameters such as hopping strength, onsite interactions, Stark potentials, and random disorder are systematically varied to probe the relaxation dynamics toward a common steady state using metrics like trace distance, relative entropy, entanglement asymmetry, and the $	extbackslashell_1$-norm of coherence.

Result: The results show that QME emerges prominently in the clean-interacting regime, where many-body correlations drive nonlinear relaxation pathways, allowing initially distant states to overtake closer ones. In contrast, non-interacting systems exhibit conventional thermalization, while Stark potentials and disorder suppress QME by inducing localization barriers. Disorder causes milder delays compared to Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry is particularly sensitive to symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME.

Conclusion: These findings elucidate the critical role of interactions in anomalous relaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in experimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems.

Abstract: Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed
understanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body
decay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work
investigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The
three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic
representation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is
obtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate
coefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength
where the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the
threshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally
averaged $\langle K_3 \rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the
experiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ also
explicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi
energies $E_{F}^{(i)}\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy
is reduced, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and
becomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and
cross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary
collisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body
recombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the
atom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products,
rather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a
significant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped
ensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a
plausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay.

Abstract: We have studied the spin transport characteristics of a spin
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (spin MOSFET), particularly
the bias voltage dependence of the electron spin polarization P_S in Si and the
magnetoresistance ratio MR in spin-valve signals, to optimize the device
performance. The spin MOSFET device has an 8-nm-thick p-Si channel with a back
gate (G) and ferromagnetic source / drain (S/D) junctions consisting of
Fe/Mg/MgO/SiOx/n+-Si. In addition to transistor characteristics with an on-off
ratio of 104, clear spin-valve signals and Hanle spin precession signals were
observed at 4 K in a wide range of the source-to-gate V_GS and source-to-drain
V_DS bias voltages. We achieved a high P_S of 50% and a high MR of 0.35% as the
maximum values in their single-peaked curves plotted as a function of the
junction voltage V_J, mainly because the ferromagnetic S/D junction can
generate high P_S and the spin diffusion length is very long in the Si
inversion channel. These P_S and MR values are the highest ever reported in
spin-MOSFETs. Our spin transport model for our spin MOSFET structure was
improved in this study by taking into account the electron distribution and
band profile of the n+-Si regions in the ferromagnetic S/D junctions, which
enables the accurate estimation of P_S. Detailed analyses with various V_GS and
V_J clarified that P_S is determined only by V_J. Our analyses also revealed
that the main parameters for determining MR, such as P_S and the
resistance-area products of the S/D ferromagnetic junctions, have different V_J
dependences, leading to the finding that the present device does not exploit
the full potential of the ferromagnetic S/D junctions to maximize MR. Based on
the results, we discuss the device physics and engineering for further
enhancement of MR, with a focus on the electrical and spin-related properties
of the ferromagnetic S/D junctions.

Abstract: Quantum geometry is universally bounded from below by Wilson-loop windings.
In this work, we define an isolated set of bands to be Wilson-loop-ideal, if
their quantum metric saturates the Wilson-loop lower bound. The definition
naturally incorporates the known Chern-ideal and Euler-ideal bands, and allows
us to define other types of ideal bands, such as Kane-Mele $Z_2$-ideal bands.
In particular, we find that an isolated set of two $Z_2$-ideal bands with
non-singular nonabelian Berry curvature always admits a Chern-ideal gauge
(i.e., effectively behaving as two decoupled Chern-ideal bands), even in the
absence of any global good quantum number (such as spin). This enables the
direct construction of fractional topological insulator wavefunctions. We
further propose a general framework of constructing monotonic flows that
achieve Wilson-loop-ideal states starting from non-ideal bands through band
mixing, where Wilson-loop-ideal states are not energy eigenstates but have
smooth projectors similar to isolated bands. We apply the constructed flows to
the realistic model of $3.89^\circ$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and a moir\'e
Rashba model, and numerically find Chern-ideal and $Z_2$-ideal states,
respectively, with relative error in the integrated quantum metric below
$5\times 10^{-3}$. Our general definition of Wilson-loop-ideal bands and
general procedure of constructing Wilson-loop-ideal states provide a solid
basis for future study of novel correlated physics.

Abstract: In single molecule toroics (SMTs) atomic spins and orbital currents generate
magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, endowed with
both magnetic and electric dipole symmetries, which can enable spin control via
magnetoelectric effects as well as the development of robust qubits. In the
archetypal Dy$_3$ SMT, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is challenging to detect and
control. Larger molecular rings can offer an enhanced toroidal response
amenable to direct observation and manipulation. Here we report SMT properties
for the $3d$-$4f$ icosanuclear molecular ring Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$, displaying
toroidal excitations of unprecedented magnitude and energy dispersion spanning
a $\sim$62 billion dimensional toroidal space. We show these properties can be
modeled using an ab initio-parameterised transfer matrix approach yielding
excellent agreement with experiments. To assess the bulk toroidal polarization
attainable in this system, we introduce the molar toroidal susceptibility
$\xi$, a thermodynamic linear response function measuring the SMT
finite-temperature toroidal polarization induced by a magnetic field with a
small non-vanishing curl. Direct calculation of $\xi$ for Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$
reveals a significant finite-temperature ground state toroidal polarization
which should be amenable to experimental detection via spatially-focused
magnetic field curls, as attainable e.g. using focused femtosecond laser
pulses. Our findings could thus pave the way for direct observation and
manipulation of molecular toroidal moments.

Abstract: We consider a coupled system of Dirac operators that finds applications as a
macroscopic model of spin and valley polarized gated rhombohedral graphene
(RHG) with an arbitrary number of layers as well as in replica models of
Floquet topological insulators. We classify all quantum anomalous Hall phases
that are compatible with the model and show that a bulk-edge correspondence
between bulk phases and chiral edge states carrying a quantized anomalous Hall
charge applies. When the displacement field is sufficiently small compared to
the inter-layer coupling in the RHG application, we retrieve the known phases
where the charge is given by the number of graphene layers. When the
displacement field increases, we identify all possible topological phase
transitions and corresponding quantized chiral edge charges. Numerical
simulations confirm the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Dirac surface states in a topological insulator (TI) with proximity-induced
superconductivity offer a promising platform for realizing topological
superconductivity and Majorana physics. However, in TIs, the Josephson effect
is usually observed in regimes where transport is dominated by either
substantial bulk conduction channels or unipolar surface states. In this work,
we demonstrate gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson current in lateral Josephson
junction (JJ) devices based on bulk-insulating (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films grown by
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For thinner films, the supercurrent exhibits
pronounced gate-tunable ambipolar behavior and is significantly suppressed as
the chemical potential approaches the Dirac point, yet persists across it. In
contrast, thicker films exhibit a much weaker ambipolar response. Moreover, we
find that the supercurrent becomes significantly less resilient to external
magnetic fields when the chemical potential is tuned near the Dirac point in
both thickness regimes. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the ambipolar
behavior of these TI JJ devices and attribute the asymmetric supercurrent
observed in thicker TI films to the coexistence of Dirac surface states and
bulk conduction channels. The demonstration of gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson
transport in MBE-grown TI films paves the way for realizing
Dirac-surface-state-mediated topological superconductivity and establishes a
foundation for future exploration of electrically tunable Majorana modes.

Abstract: In low-dimensional superconductors, the interplay between quantum confinement
and interfacial hybridization effects can reshape Cooper pair wavefunctions and
induce novel forms of unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we employ
a plasma-free, carbon buffer layer-assisted confinement epitaxy method to
synthesize trilayer gallium (Ga) sandwiched between a graphene layer and a
6H-SiC(0001) substrate, forming an air-stable graphene/trilayer Ga/SiC
heterostructure. In this confined light-element Ga layer, we demonstrate
interfacial Ising-type superconductivity driven by atomic orbital hybridization
between the Ga layer and the SiC substrate. Electrical transport measurements
reveal that the in-plane upper critical magnetic field u0Hc2,|| reaches ~21.98T
at T=400 mK, approximately 3.38 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit (~6.51T).
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements combined with
theoretical calculations confirm the presence of split Fermi surfaces with
Ising-type spin textures at the K and K' valleys of the confined Ga layer
strongly hybridized with SiC. Moreover, by incorporating finite relaxation time
induced by impurity scattering into an Ising-type superconductivity model, we
reproduce the entire temperature-dependent u0Hc2,|| phase diagram. This work
establishes a new strategy to realize unconventional pairing wavefunctions by
combining quantum confinement and interfacial hybridization effects in
superconducting thin films. It also opens new avenues for designing scalable
superconducting quantum electronic and spintronic devices through interfacial
engineering.

Abstract: We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular
photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in
antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting
a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically
explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed
responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive
classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space
groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification,
we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions.
Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle
calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets,
paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.

Abstract: We investigate a simple fermionic system designed to detect an unknown
hopping rate between two sites by analyzing current circulation. The system
exploits geometric asymmetry and utilizes the connection between the additional
energy degeneracy point (AEDP) and current circulation for precise parameter
detection. In the low-temperature, low-bias regime, with baths chemical
potentials aligned near the degenerate energy, we find that a balanced
Wheatstone bridge condition emerges when the direction of current circulation
reverses, providing a direct means to determine the unknown hopping strength.
We further examine the impact of environmental interactions, demonstrating that
the device remains functional under moderately strong dephasing and particle
losses, though extreme environmental effects eventually degrade performance.
Extending the analysis to general operating conditions, we show that the device
continues to function effectively at higher voltages and temperatures. Our
results highlight geometric asymmetry as a robust and practical tool for
quantum metrology.

Abstract: We address finite crystallization in two dimensions in the presence of a flat
crystalline substrate. Particles interact through short-range two- and
three-body potentials favoring local square-lattice arrangements. An additional
interaction term of relative strength $\beta>0$ couples the particles and the
substrate. Our first main result proves crystallization for all $\beta>0$,
corresponding to
  the onset of discrete Winterbottom configurations. The proof relies on a
stratification technique from [31], characterizing the topology of the bond
graph of minimizing configurations.
  Our second main result concerns fluctuations estimates for $\beta\in (0,1)$.
We obtain bounds on the distance between distinct minimizers with the same
number $N$ of particles, showing a sharp scaling law $N^{3/4}$ when $\beta$ is
rational, and $N^{1/3}$ when $\beta$ is irrational and algebraic. This reveals
a genuine substrate-driven effect on fluctuation laws. As a corollary, we
derive a discrete-to-continuum convergence of minimizers towards the
Winterbottom equilibrium shape in the large-particle limit.

Abstract: In the journey of computer vision system development, the acquisition and
utilization of annotated images play a central role, providing information
about object identity, spatial extent, and viewpoint in depicted scenes.
However, thermal manufacturing processes like Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF)
often yield surfaces with defects such as Spatter, Crack, Pinhole, and Hole due
to the Balling phenomenon. Preprocessing images from LPBF, riddled with
defects, presents challenges in training machine learning (ML) algorithms.
Detecting defects is critical for predicting production quality and identifying
crucial points in artificial or natural structures. This paper introduces a
deep learning-based approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to
automatically detect and segment surface defects like cracks, spatter, holes,
and pinholes on production surfaces. In contrast to traditional machine
learning techniques requiring extensive processing time and manual feature
crafting, deep learning proves more accurate. The proposed architecture
undergoes training and testing on 14,982 labeled images annotated using the
LabelImg tool. Each object in the images is manually annotated with bounding
boxes and segmented masks. The trained CNN, coupled with OpenCV preprocessing
techniques, achieves an impressive 99.54% accuracy on the dataset with
resolutions of 1536 x 1103 pixels. Evaluation metrics for 50 true crack tests
demonstrate precision, recall, and F1-score exceeding 96%, 98%, and 97%,
respectively. Similarly, for 124 true pinhole tests, the metrics are 99%, 100%,
and 100%, for 258 true hole tests, they are 99%, 99%, and 99%, and for 318
spatter tests, the metrics are 100%, 99%, and 100%. These results highlight the
precision and effectiveness of the entire process, showcasing its potential for
reliable defect detection in production surfaces.

Conclusion: 二维电子气中经典的霍尔效应可以有理想地实现非互惠器件。

Abstract: We report the realization of near total Faraday rotation of $\theta_F$=1.43
rad (82 degrees) on a single pass through a 2D electron gas (2DEG), approaching
the ideal limit of $\pi/2$ rad (90 degrees). The corresponding Verdet constant
V = $9.5\times10^{8}$ rad T$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$, exceeds by approximately one order
of magnitude that reported in other material systems. Our measurements were
conducted at microwave frequencies (f=9.2-11.2 GHz) in a 2DEG with a high dc
mobility $\mu$ = $7\times10^6$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, in a hollow waveguide at
low-magnetic field (B < 200 mT). Near-total Faraday rotation is attributed to
the Hall effect with weak radiative coupling to the 2DEG in the inertial,
collisionless regime, $\omega \tau \gg 1$, where $\tau$ is the charge transport
scattering time. A conducting iris was used to realize weak radiative coupling.
Under these conditions, Faraday rotation is strongly enhanced away from the
dissipation peak at cyclotron resonance. Our work demonstrates that the
classical Hall effect could be ideally suited for the implementation of ideal
non-reciprocal devices.

Abstract: The Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, is remarkably successful at
describing numerous many-body phenomena. However, due to the small class of
problems which can be solved exactly, there has been substantial interest in
quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models to in turn, simulate materials
and the interaction-driven phases they host. Here, we study small clusters of
molecular anions of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride on NaCl
bilayers on Ag(111) using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, Electrostatic
Force Spectroscopy, and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, and
show that the occupation and transition energies are well described by an
extended Hubbard model. In particular, asymmetric clusters of four molecules
require the addition of differing inter-site electrostatic interaction terms
and on-site potentials, as well as asymmetric hoping terms. With $t<<U$,
occupation asymmetry is driven by these terms, independent of U. The good
agreement between the model and the data indicate such molecular anion clusters
could be used to probe larger systems and a more varied phase space of
realistic fermionic Hubbard models.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to formulate a kinetic theory describing
transport properties of electrons in a uniform magnetic field of arbitrary
magnitude. Exposing an electronic system to a constant magnetic field quenches
its energy bands into a series of discrete energy levels, known as Landau
levels. The Landau-level states, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation
in a constant background magnetic field, are natural and suitable basis to use,
especially, for the investigation of strong-magnetic-field phenomena. Starting
from the Keldysh formalism, we derive the quantum kinetic equation from the
Landau-level basis. As an illustration, we apply the kinetic equation to
calculate the electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas exposed
to a perpendicular magnetic field.

Abstract: We introduce a quasiclassical Green function approach describing the unitary
yet irreversible dynamics of quantum systems effectively acting as their own
environment. Combining a variety of concepts of quantum many-body theory,
notably the nonlinear $\sigma$-model of disordered systems, the $G
\Sigma$-formalism for strong correlations, and real time path integration, the
theory is capable of describing a wide range of system classes and disorder
models. It extends previous work beyond perturbation theory (in inverse Hilbert
space dimensions), enabling a description of thermalization dynamics from short
scattering times, through the onset of ergodicity at an effective `Thouless
time', up to the many-body Heisenberg time. We illustrate the approach with two
case studies, (i) a brickwork model of unitarily coupled quantum circuits with
and without conserved symmetries, and (ii) an array of capacitively coupled
quantum dots. Using the spectral form factor as a test observable, we find good
agreement with numerical simulations. We present our formalism in a
self-contained and pedagogical manner, aiming to provide a transferable toolbox
for the first-principles description of many-body chaotic quantum systems in
regimes of strong entanglement.

Motivation: Understanding the spin-wave spectrum of ferromagnetic materials is crucial for advancing magnonic devices and spintronic applications.

Method: The researchers used linear spin-wave theory, incorporating the full magnetic inertia tensor and decomposed it into symmetric and antisymmetric components to analyze the magnon bands.

Result: The magnon spectrum consists of two precessional bands and two inertial bands, with a crossing at certain Brillouin zone directions. Magnetic inertia and chiral effects play a key role in tuning the band structures.

Conclusion: These findings provide a foundation for designing nonreciprocal magnonic devices and ultrafast spintronic systems by controlling magnetic inertia.

Abstract: Magnetic inertial dynamics has recently been predicted and experimentally
observed in two-sublattice ferromagnets such as CoFeB and NiFe permalloy. In
this work, we investigate the spin-wave spectrum of such systems by
incorporating the full magnetic inertia tensor. Decomposing the tensor into its
symmetric and antisymmetric components allows us to identify isotropic,
anisotropic, and chiral contributions to the magnetic inertia. Using linear
spin-wave theory, we find that the spectrum consists of two precessional magnon
bands and two inertial magnon bands. Remarkably, the upper precessional magnon
band crosses the lower inertial magnon band within the Brillouin zone. We show
that both cross-sublattice inertia and chiral inertia provide effective tuning
knobs for these magnon band structures. Furthermore, our results reveal that
the inertial spin-wave spectrum becomes nonreciprocal along directions where
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is finite. On the other hand, a
nonreciprocal spin-wave spectrum can also be engineered through chiral inertia,
even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These findings open
avenues for engineering nonreciprocal magnonic devices and ultrafast spintronic
applications through control of magnetic inertia.

Abstract: We investigate a quasi-periodically driven four-level system that serves as a
temporal analog of topological phenomena found in four-band models with
intertwined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Under a two-tone drive in the
strong-driving regime, the system realizes a two-dimensional synthetic Floquet
lattice, thus facilitating the realization of topological energy pumping. For a
temporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and
absorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a
given band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands
are added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange
is a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model,
which we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number.
Interestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the
drives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the
presence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier
spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the perfect (imperfect) nature of the
fidelity during the time-evolution of the system serves as a characteristic
signature of a topological (trivial) phase.

the Keldysh framework, we demonstrate how the anomaly-induced contributions
manifest in both axial charge density and electric current.

Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic
Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal
hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian
Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent
currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current
components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are
computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In
parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral
characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different
topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential,

Abstract: Altermagnets, featuring non-relativistic spin splitting, have drawn enormous
attention due to their intriguing properties. Here, we investigate the effects
of shining bicircularly polarized light (BCL) on altermagnets with Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. We discover a remarkable tunability of topology,
spin-textures, and Fermi surfaces of altermagnets by means of BCL illumination,
going beyond monochromatic light. We illustrate a cascade of topological phase
transitions controllable by BCL and demonstrate how these transitions are
reflected in the anomalous Hall response of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we
show that the spin-textures and Fermi surfaces can be directly tuned by the
relative phase of the BCL, stemming from the underlying symmetry changes. Our
findings can pave the way for effectively controlling altermagnetic materials
with structured light.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical framework to describe the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) in 3D electron systems, extending previous single-electron approaches used for 2D systems. The model incorporates strong band anisotropy and large effective gyromagnetic factors, deriving expressions for diagonal and Hall conductivities that match theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Simulations show agreement with Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations. This provides a unified understanding of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions and suggests new avenues for analyzing 3D systems under quantum Hall conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation likely stems from the successful application of single-electron approaches to 2D systems and the recent experimental observation of IQHE in 3D semimetals, prompting a need for a similar framework.

Method: The method builds on the graphene model, introducing effective corrections to cyclotron frequency and accounting for band anisotropy, then deriving semiclassical expressions for conductivities. Simulations are used to validate the model's predictions.

Result: The results confirm the quantized Hall conductivities observed experimentally and reproduced through simulations, establishing the model's validity for 3D IQHE. They also provide a unified view of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that 3D IQHE can be understood as a natural extension of 2D frameworks, offering new insights into quantum magnetotransport and suggesting applications to other quantum phenomena in 3D systems

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework to describe the integer quantum Hall
effect (IQHE) in three-dimensional (3D) electron systems. This extends our
previous single-electron approach, which was successfully applied to
two-dimensional (2D) systems such as semiconductor quantum wells and graphene,
where insights provided into both the IQHE and the fractional quantum Hall
effect (FQHE). Starting from the graphene model, where the unconventional
sequence of Hall plateaux, 2(2n+1), naturally emerges from Landau quantization,
we generalize the formulation to 3D semimetals with low carrier density and
high mobility, where recent experiments have reported signatures of the QHE.
For 3D systems, the model accounts for strong band anisotropy by introducing an
effective correction to the cyclotron frequency, and, also by considering large
effective gyromagnetic factor, as observed in semimetallic materials. From the
calculated density of states and carrier concentration, we derive semiclassical
expressions for the diagonal and Hall conductivities. The resulting Hall
conductivity exhibits quantized values in agreement with theoretical
predictions and experimental observations of 3D quantum Hall states.
Simulations reproduce both Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations
under realistic parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that the IQHE in 3D
semimetals can be understood as a natural extension of the single-electron
Landau quantization framework originally developed for 2D systems. This
provides a unified picture of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions,
highlighting the crucial role of low carrier density and high mobility. The
model further suggests new avenues for analyzing thermodynamic and transport
properties in 3D systems under quantum Hall conditions.

TL;DR: This paper discusses indium selenide heterostructures and their potential applications in optoelectronics, with a focus on their quantum size effects. The material has promising properties for near-infrared light sources and detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the electronic and optical properties of indium selenide, aiming to develop new optoelectronic devices, particularly in the near-infrared range.

Method: The authors use molecular beam epitaxy to fabricate high-quality indium selenide crystal phase heterostructures in a controlled manner.

Result: The study identifies γ-InSe/γ-In₂Se₃ heterostructures as the most promising for photonic applications. The quantum size effect allows tuning the light emission energy over 250 meV by adjusting the layer thickness of γ-InSe.

Conclusion: This research provides a foundation for designing light sources and detectors using molecular beam epitaxy, with scalability to device prototyping enabled by large surface areas.

Abstract: Indium selenide attracts the interest due to its outstanding electronic and
optical properties which are potentially prospective in view of applications in
electronic and photonic devices. Most of the polymorphic crystal phases of this
semiconductor belong to the family of two-dimensional van der Waals
semiconductors. In this study optically active indium selenide crystal phase
heterostructures are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy in a well-controlled
manner. It is demonstrated that by changing the growth conditions one may
obtain either {\gamma}-InSe, or {\gamma}-In2Se3, or \b{eta}-yIn2Se3 crystal
phases. The most promising crystal phase heterostructures from the point of
view of photonic applications is found to be the {\gamma}-InSe/{\gamma}-In2Se3
heterostructure. An intense optical emission from this heterostructure appears
in the near infrared spectral range. The emission energy can be tuned over 250
meV by changing {\gamma}-InSe layer thickness which is explained by the quantum
size effect. The optically active indium selenide crystal phase
heterostructures represent, therefore, an interesting platform for the design
of light sources and detectors in the near infra-red. The use of molecular beam
epitaxy for this purpose ensures that the structures are fabricated on large
surfaces opening the possibility for the design of device prototypes by using
lithography methods

Result: The neuron demonstrates several biological-relevant responses, including memory timescales and weighting of input channels. It is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates efficiently, and exhibits scalability and adaptability for various applications.

Conclusion: This work opens doors for future research in photonic neuromorphic computing with low power consumption and compact_size, as well as adaptive optical sensing with the same architecture as a compact, modular front end.

Abstract: Computational hardware designed to mimic biological neural networks holds the
promise to resolve the drastically growing global energy demand of artificial
intelligence. A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among
these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power
efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity. However, existing solutions have
large circuit footprints limiting scaling potential and they miss key
biological functions, like inhibition. We demonstrate an artificial
nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a
factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the
picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and
inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function.
It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as
well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial
silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of spin Hall phenomena in a nanoribbon made of
a two-dimensional square lattice with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
coupling. We show that the nanoribbon can give rise to a number of additional
spin degeneracy points as well as anti-crossing points, apart from the $\Gamma$
point, between two nearest sub-bands. We compute the spin Hall conductivity and
demonstrate that it diverges and gives rise to a resonance when chemical
potential passes through those spin-degenerate or anti-crossing points.
Contrary to the previous studies, here such resonance emerges even without any
external perturbation like magnetic field or light. In addition, we examine the
influence of anisotropy in Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, as well as
finite-temperature effects, and show that the inter subband resonance remains
robust. Finally, we also investigate the signature of such additional spin
degeneracy and anti-crossing points in the longitudinal conductance by using
retarded Green function approach in lattice model. The peculiar features of the
bands are reflected in the longitudinal conductance, which takes quantized
values of $2n e^{2}/{h},$ where $n$ denotes the number of bands occupied by the
chemical potential with each band having spin split sub-bands.

Abstract: Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged
as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and
correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moir\'e band topology
using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to
the large number of atoms in a single moir\'e unit cell. In this work, we
propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\'e bands from
atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry group, both of which can be
efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\Gamma$-valley electron
gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\'e
symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\'e
bands, as long as the moir\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band
splitting at the moir\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced
nontrivial moir\'e topology, including both topological insulators and
topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details
such as the precise form and strength of the moir\'e potential or the exact
twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\'e
symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced
nontrivial moir\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\'e
model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is generalizable to
other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to
discover and design new topologically nontrivial moir\'e materials.

Abstract: Hilbert spaces in theories of gravity are notoriously subtle due to the
Hamiltonian constraints, particularly regarding the inner product. To demystify
this subject, we review and extend a collection of ideas in canonical gravity,
and connect to the sum-over-histories approach by clarifying the Hilbert space
interpretation of various gravitational path integrals. We use one-dimensional
(or mini-superspace) models as the simplest context to exemplify the conceptual
ideas. We emphasise that a physical Hilbert space can be defined either by
requiring states to be annihilated by constraint operators (e.g., the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation) or by equivalence relations between wavefunctions, and
explain that these two approaches are related by an inner product. We advocate
that the group averaging procedure constructs the correct physical inner
product. The Klein-Gordon inner product is not positive-definite, which we
explain as arising from a bad gauge choice; nonetheless, it agrees with group
averaging when such a problem is absent. These concepts are all embedded in the
BRST/BFV formalism, which provides a systematic way to construct these and
other physically equivalent inner products (e.g., from maximal-volume gauge and
Gaussian averaged gauges). Finally we discuss the application of these ideas in
the semi-classical approximation, including non-perturbative gravitational
effects.

Abstract: The single-trace, infinite-N algebra of an arbitrary region may or may not be
a von Neumann algebra depending on the GNS sector. In this paper we identify
the holographic dual of this mechanism as a consequence of the focusing of null
geodesics; more precisely, this GNS sector-dependence corresponds to the
well-known difference between null congruences fired from the bulk and those
fired from the boundary. As part of establishing this property, we give a
rigorous formulation and proof of causal wedge reconstruction for those general
boundary subregions whose single trace algebras support von Neumann algebras at
large-N. We discuss a possible finite-N extension and interpretation of our
results as an explanation for the Hawking area theorem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  studying quantum gravity and holographic principles in theoretical physics, specifically within the AdS/CFT correspondence framework, continuing efforts in understanding complex quantum systems like the SYK model.

Method:  utilize string theory in a two-dimensional AdS space with imaginary radius, modeling the system with lightcone coordinates, and applying Peierls brackets for quantization, connecting to the P"oschl-Teller equation for operator spectrum.

Result:  establish a correspondence between the folded string dynamics in AdS₂ with imaginary radius and the SYK model at its conformal fixed point, providing a deeper understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence and the mathematical structure underlying the SYK model.

Conclusion:  this framework offers a new perspective on the SYK model and its connection to string theory, opens avenues for exploring quantum gravity in lower dimensions. 

Abstract: We propose a folded string moving in rigid AdS$_2$ with imaginary radius
squared as a dual of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model at its conformal fixed
point. In standard AdS$_2$, the string is represented by two massless particles
connected by straight string segments. The particles move at the speed of
light, abruptly reversing direction at turning points. We describe the system
using the lightcone coordinates of these points, with the Poisson structure
obtained from the Peierls bracket. In AdS$_2$ with imaginary radius squared,
quantization of the string's mass-squared in momentum-fraction space yields a
P\"oschl-Teller equation, reproducing the SYK operator spectrum.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from extending previous work on tensorial group field theories to understand their renormalization group flow, particularly in out-of-equilibrium conditions, with a focus on the stability of equilibrium and violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

Method: The method employed involves extending the formalism developed in earlier research to include non-local interactions in a toy Abelian model, analyzing the renormalization group flow equations and Ward identities to study equilibrium stability.

Result: The results reveal the flow equations for the toy Abelian model demonstrate the stability of dynamical equilibrium and identify potential scenarios where the fluctuation-dissipation theorem may be violated.

Conclusion: This work provides a methodological framework for studying out-of-equilibrium renormalization group flows in group field theories, highlighting the role of non-local interactions in equilibrium stability and potential violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our earlier work, which aimed to develop
methods for understanding the renormalization group of tensorial group field
theories within the stochastic quantization framework. In that first study, we
showed that the equations governing melonic structures, together with Ward
identities, make it possible to close the hierarchy of flow equations, thereby
reproducing the results of equilibrium theory. In the present work, we go
further by extending the formalism to the out-of-equilibrium regime, while also
examining the stability of dynamical equilibrium, specifically, potential
violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our objective here is purely
methodological, and we focus on a simplified ``toy'' Abelian model that retains
only the characteristic non-localities of group field theories.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalized perturbative framework for
gravitational shadows in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Building
upon the recent two-parameter perturbative framework of Kobialko et al.
\cite{Kobialko:2024zhc}, this work extends the expansion in particle energy and
metric deviation to encompass arbitrary, simultaneous deformations of all
metric functions. By relaxing the common restriction of a fixed area radius
($\beta(r) = r^2$), our formalism applies to a significantly broader class of
alternative gravity theories and exotic compact objects. We derive analytical
formulae for the massive shadow radius up to the second order in the
deformation parameter, explicitly revealing the phenomenological signatures
that arise from the coupling between temporal and spatial metric perturbations.
The key result is that the distinct energy dependence of the massive shadow
provides a powerful method to disentangle these different types of geometric
deformations, breaking observational degeneracies inherent in the photon shadow
alone. We demonstrate this principle with applications to traversable wormholes
and canonical scalar-tensor solutions, showing how each produces a unique,
distinguishable energy-dependent fingerprint. This generalized framework
provides a robust, theory-agnostic tool for testing strong-field gravity. It
offers a clear methodology for reconstructing metric parameters from potential
multi-messenger observations of massive particle shadows.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry
breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the
entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and
discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the
more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the
Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global
symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem,
we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global
symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary
operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we
study the real-time dynamics of the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetry and provide
clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we
find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the
fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial
symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level
$k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration.
On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may
suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.

Abstract: Four- and six-dimensional Drinfeld doubles were classified in the past in
terms of Manin triples. We provide an important step towards classification of
eight-dimensional Drinfeld doubles by presenting an extensive list of Manin
triples formed by pairs of four-dimensional Lie algebras. Due to the high
complexity of the classification we focus on Manin triples formed by algebras
in a certain standard form. The list contains 188 non-isomorphic Manin triples
plus their duals.
  To apply the results we construct several four-dimensional WZW models on
non-semisimple Lie groups. Some of the WZW models are known from literature,
but new cases are presented as well. As a consequence of the construction
method the WZW models are Poisson--Lie dualizable.

Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic and entanglement properties of dynamical black
holes based on the recently proposed dynamical black hole entropy by
Hollands-Wald-Zhang. We first provide a direct proof that, under first order
perturbations, the dynamical black hole entropy in any $f(R)$ theory equals the
Wald entropy evaluated on the generalized apparent horizon. Then, we compute
the gravitational entanglement entropy explicitly using both the event horizon
and the apparent horizon as the entangling surfaces, and show that only the
apparent horizon prescription reproduces the correct dynamical black hole
entropy satisfying the physical process first law. Furthermore, we reinterpret
the generalized second law by identifying the modified von Neumann entropy as
the matter entanglement across the (generalized) apparent horizon. This allows
us to express the total entropy as the renormalized generalized entropy
evaluated on this surface for both Einstein's gravity and $f(R)$ gravity.

Abstract: We revisit the thermal nature of the Unruh effect within a quantum
thermodynamic framework. For a Unruh-deWitt (UDW) detector in $n$-dimensional
Minkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that its irreversible thermalization to a
Gibbs equilibrium state follows distinct trajectories on the Bloch sphere,
which depend on the types of fields the detector interacts with, as well as the
spacetime dimensionality. Using thermodynamic process functions, particularly
quantum coherence and heat that form the quantum First Law, we characterize the
Unruh thermalization through a complementary time evolution between the
trajectory-dependent rates of process functions. Grounded in information
geometry, we further explore the kinematics of the detector state as it "flows"
along the trajectory. In particular, we propose two heating/cooling protocols
for the UDW detector undergoing Unruh thermalization. We observe a quantum
Mpemba-like effect, characterized by faster heating than cooling in terms of
Uhlmann fidelity "distance" change. Most significantly, we establish the
maximum fidelity difference as a novel diagnostic that essentially
distinguishes between Unruh thermalization and its classical counterpart, i.e.,
classical thermal bath-driven thermalization of an inertial UDW detector. This
compelling criterion may serve as a hallmark of the quantum origin of the Unruh
effect in future experimental detection and quantum simulation. Finally, we
conclude with a general analysis of Unruh thermalization, starting from
equal-fidelity non-thermal states, and demonstrate that the detectors' fidelity
and "speed" of quantum evolution still exhibit a Mpemba-like behavior.

Abstract: We investigate conformal field theories with gauge group $U(N)$ at arbitrary
rank $N$, focusing on the role of trace relations in determining the structure
of the Hilbert space. Working in the free trace algebra without imposing
relations, we identify a class of evanescent states that vanish at finite $N$.
Using the Koszul complex of [1], we implement trace relations systematically
via ghosts and a fermionic charge $Q_b$. This framework allows us to define and
compute transition amplitudes between evanescent and physical states, which we
show correspond precisely to ordinary CFT amplitudes analytically continued in
$N$. Our results provide a direct algebraic realization of the proposals which
realize trace relations in the bulk as over-maximal giant gravitons [1-3] and
establish analytic continuation in $N$ as a powerful tool for understanding
finite-$N$ effects.

Abstract: We implement the worldline formalism in phase space to compute scattering
amplitudes. First, the Feynman rules exhibit several useful universal features,
reflecting elements of the symplectic geometry of the phase space target. Next,
noncompact worldline topologies automate LSZ reductions in accordance with the
boundary conditions available in phase space, provided correct identifications
of the associated moduli spaces. Further, employing noncanonical coordinates
cubicizes the Feynman rules and manifests gauge invariance. As a result, our
phase space implementation could provide a framework optimized for computing
scattering amplitudes while retaining the nice features of the original
formalism. For an explicit demonstration, we compute the multi-photon Compton
amplitudes up to six points in the classical limit. Compton amplitudes in
Yang-Mills theory and gravity are also computed in a uniform fashion by
supposing the backgrounds of nonlinearly superposed plane waves.

Abstract: Gravitational helicity flux density represents the angular distribution of
helicity flux in general relativity. In this work, we explore its relationship
to the reduction of topological invariants at future null infinity. Contrary to
initial expectations, the Pontryagin term, which contributes to the
gravitational chiral anomaly, is not related to the gravitational helicity flux
density. Instead, the Nieh-Yan term, another topological invariant within the
teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR), can reproduce this flux
density. We also reduce these two topological invariants to null hypersurfaces
describing near-horizon geometry. In this near-horizon context, the Pontryagin
term yields a non-trivial quantity that may characterize a Carrollian fluid
helicity relevant to near-horizon physics.

the ${\cal N}=8$ supergravity theory with $SO(8)$ (or $SU(8)$) global symmetry

The twenty five couplings in this celestial algebra can be written in terms of

Abstract: Using holographic duality, we investigate thermalization process when two
finite-size quantum critical systems are brought into thermal contact along a
perfectly transmitting interface. Through real-time simulations of
gravitational dynamics, which are spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic and
are confined within two dynamical bulk branes, we identify three distinct
thermalization patterns governed by the energy imbalance (temperature
difference) and system size. For systems with large size and small energy
imbalance, we observe recurrent cycles of formation and collapse of
non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). Under large energy imbalance, shock waves
persist for a prolonged period with sustained boundary reflections, while
rarefaction waves rapidly homogenize. When the system size is sufficiently
small, dissipation dominates and leads to oscillatory decay without sustained
NESS or shock structure. In sharp contrast to diffusive systems, we uncover
that wave-propagated energy transfer together with boundary reflections enables
nearly complete energy swapping between subsystems during thermalization. Our
results reveal rich thermalization dynamics in finite-size quantum critical
systems across spatial scales and energy gradient regimes.

black hole in a time dependent defect AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ scenario. Utilizing the

demonstrate a complex mixed state entanglement structure through the reflected

verify the holographic duality of the reflected entropy with the bulk

both the entanglement entropy and the associated reflected entropy phases.
Furthermore, we extend our analysis to adjacent radiation subsystems and obtain
consistent results using both the island and the DES prescription.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to deriving positivity bounds on effective field
theories by analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of thermal quantum field
systems. Focusing on scalar theories with higher-dimensional operators, we
compute the finite-temperature entropy using thermal field theory techniques.
We argue that consistency with fundamental thermodynamic
principles-specifically, the expectation that entropy increases with the
introduction of new degrees of freedom-imposes nontrivial constraints on Wilson
coefficients. In particular, we show that the coefficient of the leading
dimension-8 operator must be strictly positive. This thermodynamic perspective
offers an alternative to traditional S-matrix-based derivations of positivity
bounds and provides fresh insight into the interplay between entropy,
unitarity, and causality in quantum field theory.

spacetime thus created should represent both matter and gravitational fields.
In this paper, we discuss how the gravitational field emerges from the IIB
matrix model. In particular, we consider how diffeomorphism invariance arises
and how unitarity is guaranteed in this theory. Specifically, we consider
matrices as bilocal fields and discuss how the Lorentz-invariant vacuum and
low-energy excitations around it can be expressed. We then discuss how the
conditions for the theory to be unitary can be written in terms of bilocal
fields. We show that in the low-energy limit, the bilocal fields are reduced to
local fields consisting of a finite number of massless fields and an infinite
number of massive fields, satisfying unitarity.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of a two-field scalar model consisting of an
axion-saxion pair with both kinetic and potential couplings, as motivated by
string theory compactifications. We extend the dynamical systems (DS) toolkit
by introducing a new set of variables that not only close the system and enable
a systematic stability analysis, but also disentangle the role of the kinetic
coupling. Within this framework we derive a compact, general expression for the
non-geodesicity (turning-rate) parameter evaluated at fixed points, valid for
arbitrary couplings. This provides a transparent way of diagnosing non-geodesic
dynamics, with direct applications to both dark energy and multifield
inflation. We first consider exponential coupling functions to establish
analytic control and facilitate comparison with previous literature. In this
case, we uncover a pair of genuinely non-geodesic fixed points, which act as
attractors within a submanifold of the full system. In contrast, when the axion
shift symmetry remains unbroken, our analysis shows that the apparent
non-geodesic fixed point reported previously does not persist once the full
dynamics are taken into account. Finally, we illustrate how our approach
naturally extends to more realistic string-inspired models, such as power-law
axion potentials combined with exponential saxion couplings, and present an
explicit supergravity realisation.

Motivation: The work explores controlling quantum states in accelerated frames, with potential applications in quantum optics and analog quantum gravity.

Method: Analytical and numerical methods are used to study the effects of trajectory and boundary conditions on squeezed quantum states.

Result: The system's squeezing parameters depend on the mirror's trajectory and boundary conditions, with specific mechanisms controlling the squeezing angle and Planckian weights.

Conclusion: This framework provides a practical approach to manipulate and measure squeezing in moving mirror systems, advancing our understanding of quantum effects in accelerated frames.

Abstract: Modulated accelerating mirrors provide a concrete dynamical origin for the
$\kappa\gamma$ vacuum-a thermal, single-mode squeezed state with a tunable
angle. The Carlitz-Willey trajectory fixes the Planckian weights (set by
$\kappa$), while a weak, chiral, frequency-diagonal boundary drive-equivalently
a time-dependent Robin impedance-rotates the squeeze angle (set by $\gamma$)
without changing those weights at leading order. On future null infinity, the
two-point function cleanly splits into a stationary thermal piece and a
phase-sensitive, non-stationary piece. Inertial Unruh-DeWitt detectors see an
exact Planck law; uniformly accelerated detectors expose $\gamma$ through
interference and can show mode-selective suppression under frequency matching.
Numerical wave-packet simulations corroborate the phase imprint and parametric
amplification. In short: trajectory sets scale, boundary sets angle. This
separation turns abstract squeeze parameters into laboratory-tunable signatures
and offers a practical route to engineer and diagnose $\kappa\gamma$ vacua in
moving-mirror analogs.

Abstract: We study the three-loop gauge $\beta$-functions in general $\mathcal{N}=1$
supersymmetric gauge theories regularized by higher covariant derivatives (HCD)
supplemented with Pauli--Villars subtraction. The all-structure three-loop form
is known in the HCD framework
(e.g.~\cite{Kazantsev2020,Haneychuk2022,Haneychuk2025}) and involves
regulator-dependent parameters. Here we evaluate these parameters explicitly
for the exponential regulators $R(x)=e^{x^n}$ and $F(x)=e^{x^m}$. We obtain the
constants $A(n)$ and $B(m)$ in closed form, together with their large-$n,m$
asymptotics, and substitute them into the general three-loop expressions. This
yields fully explicit, regulator-parameterized $\beta$-functions and a
systematic expansion in $1/n$ and $1/m$ that cleanly organizes finite,
scheme-dependent terms. We then exhibit finite coupling redefinitions that map
the renormalized $\overline{\mathrm{DR}}$ result to an NSVZ-compatible scheme.
Our analysis clarifies how exponential higher-derivative regulators preserve
the NSVZ relation at the bare level and illustrates the regulator-driven
structure of supersymmetric RG flows.

Abstract: The Higgs field is conventionally treated as a small local perturbation atop
a large, constant vacuum value that uniformly permeates the universe. I propose
instead that in regions of extreme gravitational intensity -- such as near
gravitational singularities -- the Higgs field behaves in a profoundly
non-perturbative manner. In such environments, spacetime and the Higgs field
engage in a dynamic interplay that extends spacetime beyond the singularity,
achieving geodesic completeness. The continuation beyond the singularity is
dominated by antigravity effects, reshaping the causal structure of spacetime
and enabling novel flows of matter and information, including traversal through
singularities. In its standard form, the combined framework of the Standard
Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR), as well as most of its extensions,
fails to capture these phenomena due to its geodesic incompleteness. By
contrast, a refined, locally conformal-symmetric formulation -- denoted
i(SM+GR) -- naturally incorporates these effects. GR is not an optional
component of i(SM+GR) but an essential ingredient. This framework preserves the
empirical success of SM+GR in the low-energy regime while predicting striking
new phenomena in extreme gravitational settings, including within black holes
(on both sides of the singularity) and in pre--Big Bang cosmology. At the
classical field theory level, i(SM+GR) offers fresh perspectives on the black
hole information puzzle and provides a platform for locally scale-invariant
generalizations, such as geodesically complete quantum field theory, string
theory, and unified models of fundamental interactions. This paper presents the
detailed derivations and explanations that underlie a condensed letter version
recently published in [1].

Abstract: We have investigated vacuum polarization of a quantized charged massive
scalar field in the presence of a magnetic topological defect, modeled as an
impenetrable tube of finite thickness carrying magnetic flux. At the tube's
surface, we imposed a generalized Robin boundary condition. Our analysis
demonstrates that, in flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy is
independent of the coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field's interaction with the
space-time curvature only in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary conditions. For general Robin boundary conditions, however, the total
induced vacuum energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in a flat space-time and
exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the parameter of the Robin boundary
condition. We investigated the dependence of this effect not only on Robin's
boundary condition parameter, but also on the tube thickness and the space-time
dimensionality. We conclude that careful measurements of vacuum polarization
effects in flat space-time may, in principle, provide an independent way to
probe the $\xi$ coupling.

Abstract: We argue that the renormalizability of interacting quantum field theory on
the curved-space background with an additional external antisymmetric tensor
(two-form) field requires nonminimal interaction of the antisymmetric field
with quantum fermions and scalars. The situation is qualitatively similar to
the metric and torsion background. In both cases, one can explore the
renormalization group running for the parameters of nonminimal interaction and
see how this interaction behaves in the UV limit. General considerations are
confirmed by the one-loop calculations in the well-known gauge model based on
the $SU(2)$ gauge group.

Abstract: We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the formation of
O2+ by electronimpact double ionization and fragmentation of carbon dioxide
(CO2) molecule. Through fragment ions and electron coincidence momentum
imaging, we determine unambiguously the ionization mechanism by measuring the
projectile energy loss in association with the C+ + O2+ channel. Further
potential energy and trajectory calculations enable us to elucidate the
dynamical details of this fragmentation process, in which a bond rearrangement
pathway is found to proceed via the structural deformation to a triangular
intermediate. Moreover, we demonstrate a new roaming pathway for formation of
O2+ from CO22+, in which a frustrated C-O bond cleavage leaves the O atom
without sufficient energy to escape. The O atom then wanders around varied
configuration spaces of the flat potential energy regions and forms a C-O-O2+
intermediate prior to the final products C+ + O2+. Considering the large
quantities of free electrons in interstellar space, the processes revealed here
are expected to be significant and should be incorporated into atmospheric
evolution models.

Abstract: Theoretical investigation of the dissociative recombination (DR) of NeH+ with
low-energy electrons in the regime where the process occurs without direct
potential energy curve crossings is presented. The calculations are performed
using multichannel quantum defect theory, incorporating non-adiabatic couplings
between electronic states. Unlike the previous treatment of the DR of HeH+,
where only first-order radial couplings A(R) were considered, our formulation
also incorporates the second-order terms B(R), together with a radial density
of states \b{eta}{\nu} (R) to describe the transition into the ionization
continuum. This development uses a large number of potential energy curves and
non-adiabatic couplings of NeH characterized by us previously, enabling a
consistent modeling of the DR process. The resulting cross sections show good
agreement with the available experimental data and fill a gap in theoretical
data below 4.5 eV, where no detailed quantum calculations are currently
available.

Abstract: When a relativistic star rotates slowly and rigidly, centrifugal forces
flatten it slightly, thereby catalyzing a small admixture of quadrupolar
vibration into its radial modes and a damping of the resulting quasi-radial
modes. The damping rate $1/\tau$ of each quasi-radial mode divided by its
frequency $\sigma^{(0)}$ is given by ${(1/\tau) / \sigma^{(0)} }= \beta
(\sigma^{(0)})^3 \Omega^4 R^8/M \;, $where $\Omega$, $R$ and $M$ are the
angular velocity, radius and mass of the star, and $\beta$ is a dimensionless
number that depends on the mode, on relativistic corrections, and on the
structure of the star, and is typically of order unity for the fundamental
quasi-radial mode in the nonrelativistic limit. In this paper we develop
equations and an algorithm for computing the emitted waves and the resulting
damping factor $\beta$. The rotation is treated to second-order in the angular
velocity and the pulsation amplitudes are assumed small and linearized, but no
other approximations are made.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the coming decades, as the low frequency sensitivity of detectors
improves, the time that gravitational-wave signals remain in the sensitive band
will increase, leading to new challenges in analyzing data, namely
non-stationary noise and data gaps. Time-frequency (wavelet) methods can
efficiently handle non-stationary noise, but data gaps still lead to spectral
leakage due to the finite length of the wavelet filters. It was previously
shown that Bayesian data augmentation - "gap filling" - could mitigate spectral
leakage in frequency domain analyses, but the computational cost associated
with the matrix operations needed in that approach is prohibitive. Here we
present a new, computationally efficient approach to Bayesian data augmentation
in the time-frequency domain that avoids repeated, costly matrix operations. We
show that our approach efficiently solves the problem of data gaps in simulated
LISA data, and can be smoothly integrated into the LISA Global Fit. The same
approach can also be used for future 3G ground-based interferometers.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper successfully reproduced and extended the derivation of Efimov energy levels in Schwarzschild spacetime, obtaining corrections to the Efimov energy spectrum under weak and strong gravitational fields using the Schrodinger equation in curved spacetime, and proposing an experimental approach using ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices to validate the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efimov physics, which describes the existence of a family of bound states with discrete geometrically spaced energies for three-body systems, is a fascinating phenomenon in quantum mechanics. While much has been learned about this in flat space, its behavior in curved spacetime remains poorly understood. This paper aims to provide a deeper understanding of Efimov physics in both weak and strong gravitational fields.

Method: The authors used the Schr"odinger equation in curved spacetime to derive corrections to the Efimov energy spectrum under weak gravitational fields. Under strong gravitational fields, they employed Riemann normal coordinate expansions to rigorously derive the hyperradial equation and applied first-order perturbation theory to calculate the internal energy corrections to the Efimov system.

Result: This paper's key contributions include a detailed derivation of the corrections to the Efimov energy spectrum under both weak and strong gravitational field conditions. The authors also proposed a feasible experimental approach using ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices to simulate spacetime curvature effects and validate their theoretical findings.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances our understanding of Efimov physics in curved spacetime and provides a pathway for experimental verification. The findings have the potential to deepen insights into quantum systems in curved spacetime, potentially with implications for gravity and quantum mechanics.

Abstract: We successfully reproduced the derivation of Efimov energy levels in
three-dimensional space. In subsequent discussions, we extended this derivation
to Schwarzschild spacetime. By combining the Schr\"odinger equation in curved
spacetime, we obtained the corrections to the Efimov energy spectrum under weak
gravitational fields. Furthermore, using Riemann normal coordinate expansions,
we rigorously derived the hyperradial equation in the presence of strong
gravitational fields and applied first-order perturbation theory to compute the
internal energy corrections of the Efimov system under strong-field conditions.
We further propose a potential experimental approach to validate the theory by
simulating spacetime curvature effects induced by gravity through the use of
ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices under laboratory conditions.

Abstract: We study how quantum features of spacetime, specifically the curvature of
momentum space, can backreact on classical gravity in a semiclassical (2+1)D
setting with a negative cosmological constant. Starting from a first-order
action, we derive an effective configuration-space action, revealing
mass-dependent geodesics and a mild violation of the equivalence principle.
Coupling this modified matter source to Einstein gravity, we obtain a corrected
BTZ black hole, with ADM mass, Hawking temperature, and entropy acquiring
explicit corrections and upper bounds dictated by the momentum-space geometry.
We also compute the return time of a massless particle along null geodesics,
illustrating observable signatures of underlying quantum-spacetime structures.
Our results provide a concrete semiclassical framework showing how Planck-scale
kinematic modifications leave imprints on classical geometry.

Method: 研究利用了莫尔理论的压缩流体力学模型，结合相空间分析来研究不同方程状态参数k下的流体行为变化。

Result: 结果表明，流体类型决定了流体行为的sonic点状态，随着方程状态参数k的变化，流体可能在亚音速或超音速状态之间切换。此外，计算了 accumulate 准备速率，并发现它随着径向距离和MOG参数α的增加而增加。这意味着MOG理论增加了黑洞周围物质的积聚速度。

Conclusion: 通过莫尔理论分析了施瓦茨child MOG黑洞吸积过程下的行为变化，为理解MOG理论对吸积动力学的影响提供了新的视角。结果表明，MOG参数α和不同方程状态参数k共同塑造了吸积流的动力学行为。这为未来的实验 detections和理论探索提供了重要的参考。

Abstract: In this paper we have examined spherical accretion onto Schwarzschild MOG
Black Holes within the framework of Modified Gravity. Using isothermal test
fluids, we analyze the behavior of the flow near the critical (sonic) point for
various values of the equation of state parameter $k$. Depending on the fluid
type, the flow exhibits either subsonic or supersonic behavior, with
ultra-stiff and ultra-relativistic fluids allowing both regimes, while
radiation and sub-relativistic fluids show more restricted dynamics. Phase
space analysis helps visualize these transitions. We also compute the mass
accretion rate and find that it increases with both radial distance and the MOG
parameter $\alpha$, highlighting the role of modified gravity in enhancing
accretion processes around black holes

Abstract: In this study, we have considered the Kerr-like black hole (BH) model in
Horndeski gravity and analyse the visual characteristics of shadow images under
two illumination models, such as a celestial light source and a thin accretion
disk. To capture the BH shadow images, we utilise a recent fisheye camera model
and ray-tracing procedures. In this view, we carefully addressed the influence
of the spin parameter $a$ and the hair parameter $h$ on the BH shadow images.
The results indicate that for smaller values of $h$, the BH shadow contours
shift noticeably towards the right side of the screen, while for larger values
of $h$, the nearly circular shadow gradually deforms into a ``D'' shape
profile. For a celestial light source, the larger values of $h$ lead to a
reduction in the corresponding radius of the photon ring, while the
space-dragging effect becomes more pronounced with increasing $a$. We further
discuss the distinctive characteristics of images observed in both prograde and
retrograde accretion disk scenarios. The results reveal that variations in $h$
significantly affect both the inner shadow and the resulting Einstein ring.
Subsequently, we also discussed the distinct features of red-shift
configurations on the disk for both direct and lensed images, which are closely
related to the accretion flow and the relevant parameters. We also attempt to
use the recent observational data from M$87^{\ast}$ and Sgr $A^{\ast}$ and
constrain the hair parameter $h$, confirming the validity of Horndeski gravity.

Abstract: The cosmological implications of the geodetic brane gravity model, enhanced
by geometrical terms of Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) type and
Gibbons-Hawking-York-Myers type (GHYM), carefully constructed as combinations
of intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures, are examined. All the geometrical terms
under study belong to a set named Lovelock-type brane models. The combined
model gives rise to a second-order differential equation of motion. Under a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry defined on a $(3+1)$-dimensional
world volume, together with a perfect fluid matter content, the emerging
universe of this model evolves in a 5-dimensional Minkowski background,
yielding peculiar facts. The resulting Friedmann-type equation is written in
terms of energy density parameters, where fine-tuning is needed to probe
interesting cosmological processes close to the current data. In this sense,
Lovelock-type brane models might underlie the cosmic acceleration. Indeed, we
find that these correction terms become significant at low energies/late times.
The model exhibits self-accelerating (non-self-accelerating) behavior for the
brane expansion, and in the case where the radiation-like contribution due to
the existence of the extra dimension vanishes its behavior is the same as the
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) brane cosmology and its generalization to the
Gauss-Bonnet (GB) brane gravity. Likewise, Einstein cosmology is recovered when
the radiation-like contribution fades away along with the odd polynomials in
brane extrinsic curvature.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  paper shows a connection between ADM mass and generalized Komar energy in asymptotically flat spacetime, without needing Killing vectors. They define a generalized energy based on the normal evolution vector and show equality to AD mass under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  studying energy in general relativity often requires specific vector fields, but this paper avoids that by defining a new energy measure based on the normal evolution vector.

Method:  used generalized Komar energy defined with lapse function and normal vector, then derived conditions for equality with ADM mass.

Result:  AD mass equals generalized Komar energy when $^{(3)}G_{ij}=o(r^{-3})$ in dynamical spacetimes, providing a covariant tool for energy analysis.

Conclusion:  Develops a new way to study energy without Killing vectors, expanding applicability in dynamical spacetimes with compact objects.

Abstract: We find a relation between the ADM mass and a generalized Komar energy in
asymptotically-flat spacetime. We do not need to assume the existence of either
a Killing or even asymptotically-Killing vector field. Instead, our generalized
Komar energy is constructed from the normal evolution vector (the lapse
function times the future-directed unit normal to the spacelike hypersurfaces
on which the ADM mass is measured). We find equality between the ADM mass and
this generalized Komar energy even for dynamical asymptotically-flat spacetimes
provided the 3-dimensional Einstein tensor drops off quickly enough at spatial
infinity, in particular, whenever ${}^{(3)}G_{ij}=o(r^{-3})$. No additional
assumptions are required for equality. As this generalized energy is fully
covariant, it may provide a powerful tool for analyzing energy content in
dynamical spacetimes containing compact objects.

Abstract: When a local quantum system couples to a quantum field in a cosmological
spacetime, the time dependence of the coupling strength is conventionally taken
to reflect the design of the local quantum system but not to depend on the
large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we consider a novel
coupling that incorporates additional time dependence that reflects the
cosmological expansion, as motivated by structures that appear in quantum
cosmology. We focus on a conformal scalar field in a de Sitter
Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmology with flat but compact
spatial sections in 3+1 dimensions, and a comoving Unruh-DeWitt detector: the
novel coupling posits the detector to couple to the scaled scalar field that
appears in the conformally related static spacetime. We survey the differences
between the conventional and novel coupling, for detectors that couple to the
full field and detectors that couple only to specific field modes, and for
detectors with proper time internal dynamics and detectors with conformal time
internal dynamics. We also briefly discuss noncompact spatial sections and
single-mode detectors with discontinuous time dependence. We find that the
novel coupling tends to enhance the de-excitation peaks in the detector's
response, particularly for single-mode detectors.

Abstract: In the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we study a cosmological bouncing
model with two fields that reproduce the desired features of the primordial
power spectra. The model combines the matter-bounce mechanism, that generates
scale-invariant perturbations, with ekpyrotic contraction, that suppresses
anisotropies leading to the bounce. The bounce that replaces the classical
initial singularity is achieved thanks to the loop quantisation. The
matter-bounce is enacted by a \textit{quasi-dust} scalar field, with a
slightly-negative equation of state that accounts for a small positive
cosmological constant, that generates a red-tilt in the perturbations' power
spectra. A second field, endowed with an ekpyrotic potential, is introduced to
tame the growth of anisotropies throughout the bouncing phase. The equations of
motion of the scalar perturbations are non-trivially coupled, leading to rich
phenomenology that cannot be inferred simply from their single-field
counterpart. We study the evolution of scalar and tensor perturbations and
compare the results to current observations, showing the viability of this
model as a base for further investigations.

Abstract: A systematic Hamiltonian formulation of the Einstein--Cartan system, based on
the Hilbert--Palatini action with the Barbero--Immirzi and cosmological
constants, is performed using the traditional ADM decomposition and without
fixing the time gauge. This procedure results in a larger phase space compared
to that of the Ashtekar--Barbero approach as well as a larger set of
first-class constraints generating gauge transformations that are on-shell
equivalent to spacetime diffeomorphisms and SO(1,3) transformations. The
imbalance in the number of components between the tetrad and the connection is
resolved by the identification of second-class constraints implied by the
action, which can be implemented by use of Dirac brackets or by solving them
directly. The Hamiltonian system remains well-defined off the second-class
constraint surface in an extended phase space with additional degrees of
freedom, implying a more general geometric theory. Implications for canonical
quantum gravity are discussed.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了暗影边界的条件，并澄清了暗影边界与明亮环的区别，为解释观测结果提供了理论框架。

Abstract: A compact object illuminated by background radiation produces a dark
silhouette. The edge of the silhouette or shadow (alternatively, the apparent
boundary or the critical curve) is commonly determined by the presence of the
photon sphere (or photon shell in the case of rotating spacetime),
corresponding to the maximum of the effective potential for null geodesics.
While this statement stands true for Kerr black holes, here we remark that the
apparent boundary (as defined by Bardeen) forms under a more general condition.
We demonstrate that a shadow forms if the effective potential of null geodesics
has a positive finite upper bound and includes a region where photons are
trapped or scattered. Our framework extends beyond conventional solutions,
including but not limited to naked singularities. Furthermore, we clarify the
difference between the apparent boundary of a dark shadow and the bright ring
on the screen of a distant observer. These results provide a unified
theoretical basis for interpreting observations from the Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT) and guiding future efforts towards extreme-resolution
observations of compact objects.

Abstract: In this work we aim to provide a consistent theoretical framework that
revives the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation framework in the Jordan frame.
It is known in the literature that the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation of
the form $F(R)=R+\beta R^n$ is non-viable and produces a power-law evolution.
We demonstrate that the standard approach in power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation
is flawed for many reasons and we introduce a new framework which elevates the
role of power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation, making it viable and compatible
with both the Planck and ACT data. In our framework the power-law $F(R)$
gravity inflation is disentangled from a power-law evolution.

Abstract: We investigate how resonant excitation near exceptional points manifests in
Kerr black hole ringdown waveforms and examine its extraction. Using waveforms
generated by localized initial data, where quasinormal mode amplitudes are
given solely by excitation factors, we establish a controlled benchmark for
overtone extraction. Applying an iterative fitting method with mirror modes, we
analyze a mild resonance in the $(l,m)=(2,2)$ multipole and a sharp resonance
in the $(3,1)$ multipole occurring as part of a sequence of successive
resonances. For $(2,2)$, we extract the fundamental mode, the first three
overtones, and the fundamental mirror mode with relative errors below $10\%$,
and show that residual waveforms exhibit the expected damped sinusoids together
with distinctive resonance signatures. For $(3,1)$, we demonstrate that
resonances can not only amplify but also reduce QNM excitations, reshaping the
overtone hierarchy and rendering the sharp resonance more pronounced in
ringdown. Our results clarify the imprint of resonance in Kerr ringdown and
highlight both the robustness and limitations of current extraction techniques,
providing a foundation for more reliable extraction of higher overtones and for
applications to observational data analysis.

Abstract: We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open

signals. These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain
undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a
population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data
matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more

find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of

the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines and extended
CW-inspired statistics to other domains. We release the associated dataset,

Abstract: The effective one-body (EOB) theory provides an innovative framework for

tailored for the dynamics of such systems. Our methodology begins by
emphasizing how to effectively utilize the metrics derived from scattering
angles in the analysis of binary black hole mergers. We then construct an
effective Hamiltonian and formulate a decoupled, variable-separated
Teukolsky-like equation for $\psi^B_4$. Furthermore, we present the formal
solution to this equation, detailing the energy flux, radiation-reaction force
(RRF), and waveforms for the ``plus" and ``cross" modes generated by spinless
binaries. Finally, we carry out numerical calculations using the EOB theory and
compare the results with numerical relativity (NR) data from the SXS
collaboration. The results indicate that to the innermost stable circular
orbit, the binding energy -- angular momentum relation differs from the NR
results by less than $5$\textperthousand, with a larger mass ratio yielding
better agreement.

### [152] [Leveraging the null stream to detect strongly lensed gravitational waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06745)
*Jef Heynen,Soumen Roy,Justin Janquart*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves is expected to be observed by current and future detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. As these detectors become more numerous and detections increase, computational efficiency becomes essential for processing data in real-time. Traditional detection methods, which often require complex parameter estimation or machine learning, can be resource-intensive, especially for strong lensing events where such methods are particularly demanding. The paper proposes a new method for detecting strongly lensed gravitational waves that relies on analyzing the null stream of a detector network. This approach avoids traditional parameter estimation, which could significantly reduce computational demands and enable real-time analysis. The success of the method in detecting such signals could revolutionize how gravitational wave data is processed, making it a critical advancement in the field. The authors also outline future steps to further simplify the method, potentially making it even more practical for widespread use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research stems from the growing number of gravitational wave detections and the increasing computational demands of analyzing such data, particularly for strong lensing events. Traditional detection methods, which rely on parameter estimation or machine learning, can be computationally intensive and a bottleneck in real-time data processing. The development of a new method that avoids parameter estimation and focuses on null stream analysis represents a significant step toward more efficient and timely gravitational wave detection and analysis.

Method: The paper introduces a novel method for detecting strongly lensed gravitational waves by analyzing the null stream of a detector network. The null stream refers to the differences in strain measurements across multiple detectors, which can provide insights into gravitational wave events without relying on traditional parameter estimation techniques. The authors explain that this approach simplifies the detection process by focusing on the characteristics of the null stream rather than requiring complex signal modeling or machine learning algorithms. This method aims to reduce computational resources and make real-time analysis feasible.

Result: Preliminary results presented in the paper suggest that the proposed method based on the null stream analysis is effective in detecting strongly lensed gravitational wave signals. The formalism, which underpins the detection method, has been validated through initial tests, indicating that it works as intended. However, the paper emphasizes that further development and testing are needed to fully realize the potential of this method. The validation of the formalism is a positive sign, and if the method is successfully validated and refined, it could become a valuable tool in gravitational wave astronomy.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the authors present a promising new method for detecting strongly lensed gravitational waves that bypasses the need for parameter estimation, thereby reducing computational demands. The successful validation of this method in preliminary tests is a significant achievement, and the authors have outlined clear steps for further refinement, which could enhance its practicality. This advancement could revolutionize gravitational wave detection, enabling more efficient and timely analysis, which is essential as the number of detectors increases and their sensitivity improves.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves is expected to be observed in
current and future detectors. In view of the growing number of detections,
computationally light pipelines are needed. Detection pipelines used in past
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA searches for strong lensing require parameter estimation to be
performed on the gravitational wave signal or are machine learning based.
Removing the need for parameter estimation in classical methods would alleviate
the ever growing demand of computational resources in strong lensing searches
and would make real-time analysis possible. We present a novel way of
identifying strongly lensed gravitational wave signals, based on the null
stream of a detector network. We lay out the basis for this detection method
and show preliminary results confirming the validity of the formalism. We also
discuss the next development steps, including how to make it independent of
parameter estimation.

Abstract: When a gravitational wave encounters a massive object along the line of
sight, repeated copies of the original signal may be produced due to
gravitational lensing. In this paper, we develop a series of new
machine-learning based statistical methods to identify promising strong lensing
candidates in gravitational wave catalogs. We employ state-of-the-art
normalizing flow generative models to perform statistical calculations on the
posterior distributions of gravitational wave events that would otherwise be
computationally unfeasible. Our lensing identification strategy, developed on
two simulated gravitational wave catalogs that test noise realization and event
signal variations, selects event pairs with low parameter differences in the
optimal detector basis that also have a high information content and favorable
likelihood for coincident parameters. We then apply our method to the GWTC-3
catalog and find a single pair still consistent with the lensing hypothesis.
This pair has been previously identified through more costly evidence ratio
techniques, but rejected on astrophysical grounds, which further validates our
technique.

<details>

Motivation: The paper addresses a long-standing puzzle in the field of magnetoresistance and spintronic devices, with the goal of understanding and explaining the observed anomalous high magnetoresistance.

Method: The researchers conducted theoretical and experimental studies on the devices in question, employing theoretical models to examine the magnetic proximity effect and the impact of the chirality of the molecules.

Result: The team discovered that the magnetic proximity effect drives the anomalous high magnetoresistance, with the spin-orbit coupling playing a fundamental role in chiral-induced spin selectivity. Their results align perfectly with the experimentation.

Conclusion: The findings of this paper prove the importance of the magnetic proximity effect in chiral-based spintronic devices and provide a solid foundation for further research and the design of new materials in this field.

Abstract: The issue of anomalous high magnetoresistance, beyond the Julli\`ere model,
observed in nonmagnetic electrode-chiral molecular-ferromagnetic electrode
devices has puzzled the community for a long time. Here, by considering the
magnetic proximity effect which shifts the nonmagnetic-ferromagnetic interface
toward chiral molecules, we show the anomalous high magnetoresistance beyond
the spin polarization in ferromagnetic electrodes even in the very weak
spin-orbit coupling. Our results are in excellent agreement with the
experiments, demonstrating that the spin-orbit coupling plays a fundamental
role in chiral-induced spin selectivity and the magnetic proximity effect can
dramatically enhance the magnetoresistance. These results elucidate the
interaction between chiral molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes and
facilitate the design of chiral-based spintronic devices.

Conclusion: LDR在模拟含能交叠动力学中表现出优越性，尤其是在强耦合情况下，能够显著减少计算量。

Abstract: The discrete variable local diabatic representation (LDR) provides a
divergence-free framework for exact conical intersection dynamics simulation.
In this work, we investigate the convergence with respect to the number of
"nuclear" grid points and "electronic" states of LDR for the eigenvalue
problems using coupled oscillator models. The performance of LDR is compared
with traditional approaches based on the Born-Huang ansatz and on the crude
adiabatic representation. Our results demonstrate that for weak vibronic
couplings, LDR shows similar convergence rate as the exact Born-Huang
representation including not only the first-order derivative couplings but also
the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections and second-order derivative
couplings. Surprisingly, for strong vibronic couplings, LDR shows a significant
faster convergence rate with respect to the number of grid points, hence the
number of electronic structure computations, than the exact Born-Huang
representation. The crude adiabatic representation in generally shows a much
slower convergence rate for all cases. The diagonal Born-Oppenheimer
corrections and second-order derivative couplings are found to be important in
the Born-Huang framework.

### [159] [Stochastic resolution of identity to CC2 for large systems: Excited-state gradients and derivative couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06460)
*Chongxiao Zhao,Chenyang Li,Wenjie Dou*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A method called sRI-CC2 is introduced for computing excited-state gradients and derivative couplings with reduced computational cost. The method uses stochastic resolution of identity (sRI) to lower the scaling from quartic to cubic, but at the cost of increased stochastic noise. To address this, a modified version called partial sRI-CC2 selectively applies sRI to exchange terms, reducing noise while maintaining cubic scaling. Partial sRI-CC2 enables calculations for systems with hundreds or thousands of electrons, making it suitable for large-scale nonadiabatic dynamics studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research seeks to improve the computational efficiency of coupled-cluster methods for excited-state dynamics, which are crucial in various fields like quantum chemistry and materials science.

Method: The authors implemented two stochastic methods, sRI-CC2 and partial sRI-CC2, within the coupled-cluster framework. sRI reduces computational scaling by using random sampling of electron integrals, while partial sRI-CC2 applies sRI specifically to exchange terms to mitigate noise.

Result: The partial sRI-CC2 method successfully reduces computational complexity while maintaining accuracy, allowing for large-scale calculations that were previously infeasible.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical and efficient approach for simulating excited-state dynamics, opening new possibilities in quantum chemical computations.

Abstract: Excited-state gradients and derivative couplings are critical for simulating
excited-state dynamics. However, their calculations are very expensive within
the coupled-cluster framework due to the steep scaling. In this work, we
present two implementations of stochastic resolution of identity to CC2
(sRI-CC2) for excited-state analytical gradients and derivative couplings. The
first method employs sRI for both Coulomb and exchange terms, reducing the
formal scaling to cubic. However, this method has a significant stochastic
noise. Consequently, we introduce a substitute, termed partial sRI-CC2, which
applies sRI selectively to the exchange terms only. The partial sRI-CC2 shows a
quartic scaling with a modest prefactor, rendering it a practical alternative.
Compared to conventional RI-CC2, the partial sRI-CC2 can handle systems with
hundreds or even thousands of electrons. This work is an extension to our
previous implementation of sRI-CC2 method and provides essential ingredients
for large-scale nonadiabatic dynamics.

Motivation: Understanding electron transfer and charge delocalization in molecular systems.

Method: Used configuration interaction (CI) with localized determinants for adiabatic and charge-localized states. Applied these models to analyze the water dimer's hydrogen bonding.

Result: Small overall charge delocalization but crucial ionic contributions for an accurate electronic description.

Conclusion: Framework provides insights into charge-delocalization mechanisms and electron transfer processes with a focus on ionic effects in systems like the water dimer.

Abstract: We present a configuration interaction (CI) framework which serves
quantitative and conceptual purposes for charge delocalization and electron
transfer processes in molecular systems. The electronic Hamiltonian is
expressed in a basis of charge-localized determinants and used to independently
generate adiabatic CI states and charge-localized CI states, both of which are
unambiguously defined through a diagonalization procedure. The CI framework
offers a simple interpretation of adiabatic states as resonance hybrids of
different electron distributions, providing a simple picture for discussing
charge-delocalization in chemical bonding. The charge-localized states serve as
a convenient orthogonal representation of initial and final states in electron
transfer processes, and provides an unambiguous definition of their electronic
coupling. These two models enable an analysis of the water dimer hydrogen bond.
We demonstrate that although the overall charge delocalization is small, the
occurrence of particular ionic contributions are crucial to get the correct
electronic description.

Abstract: Upon integrating Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as the local model, Quantum
Federated Learning (QFL) has recently confronted notable challenges. Firstly,
exploration is hindered over sharp minima, decreasing learning performance.
Secondly, the steady gradient descent results in more stable and predictable
model transmissions over wireless channels, making the model more susceptible
to attacks from adversarial entities. Additionally, the local QFL model is
vulnerable to noise produced by the quantum device's intermediate noise states,
since it requires the use of quantum gates and circuits for training. This
local noise becomes intertwined with learning parameters during training,
impairing model precision and convergence rate. To address these issues, we
propose a new QFL technique that incorporates differential privacy and
introduces a dedicated noise estimation strategy to quantify and mitigate the
impact of intermediate quantum noise. Furthermore, we design an adaptive noise
generation scheme to alleviate privacy threats associated with the vanishing
gradient variance phenomenon of QNN and enhance robustness against device
noise. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively balances
convergence, reduces communication costs, and mitigates the adverse effects of
intermediate quantum noise while maintaining strong privacy protection. Using
real-world datasets, we achieved test accuracy of up to 98.47\% for the MNIST
dataset and 83.85\% for the CIFAR-10 dataset while maintaining fast execution

characterization of the Toffoli gate using optimized, connectivity-compliant
decompositions executed on IBM's 127-qubit superconducting quantum processors.
Our study integrates state preparation, gate synthesis, and quantum
state/process tomography (QST/QPT) to evaluate fidelity across three distinct
classes of input states: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), W, and the uniform
superposition of all three-qubit computational basis states -- under noise-free
simulation, noise-aware emulation, and real hardware execution. For GHZ states,
we report state fidelities of 98.442% (noise-free simulation), 81.470%
(noise-aware quantum emulation), and 56.368% (real quantum hardware). For W
states, state fidelities are 98.739%, 79.900%, and 63.689%, respectively, and
for the uniform superposition state, we observe state fidelities of 99.490%,
85.469%, and 61.161%. Comparative QPT experiments yield process fidelities of
98.976% (noise-free) and 80.160% (noise-aware emulation). Our results
empirically characterize state-dependent error patterns in multi-qubit circuits
and quantify trade-offs between gate decomposition strategies and native
hardware performance, offering practical insights for scalable,
hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.

### [163] [Efficient Preparation of Resource States for Hamiltonian Simulation and Universal Quantum Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05404)
*Thierry N. Kaldenbach,Isaac D. Smith,Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup,Matthias Heller,Hans J. Briegel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses optimizing resource states in measurement-based quantum computation by using generalized Pauli rotations instead of algorithm-specific graphs, proposing two new methods and demonstrating their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource optimization in quantum computing is crucial for practical applications, especially with the increasing numbers of qubits and complexity of quantum algorithms.

Method: The authors introduce two methods: enhanced simulated-annealing-based algorithm for finding periodic graph states and a novel CNOT-based preparation scheme (AC-MBQC). Both methods utilize local-Clifford transformations and explore relationships between graph states and anticommutation matrices.

Result: The proposed methods allow for the derivation of universal resource states from minimal sets of generating Hamiltonians, simplifying the process of state preparation in MBQC.

Conclusion: These contributions provide new strategies for resource optimization in measurement-based quantum computation, enhancing scalability and practicality of quantum algorithms.

Abstract: The direct compilation of algorithm-specific graph states in
measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) can lead to resource reductions in
terms of circuit depth, entangling gates, and even the number of physical
qubits. In this work, we extend previous studies on algorithm-tailored graph
states to periodic sequences of generalized Pauli rotations, which commonly
appear in, e.g., Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation. We first implement an
enhanced simulated-annealing-based algorithm to find optimal periodic graph
states within local-Clifford (LC-)MBQC. In addition, we derive a novel scheme
for the preparation of resource states based on a graph state and a ladder of
CNOT gates, which we term anticommutation-based (AC-)MBQC, since it uncovers a
direct relationship between the graph state and the anticommutation matrix for
the set of Hamilonians generating the computation. We also deploy our two
approaches to derive universal resource states from minimal universal sets of
generating Hamiltonians, thus providing a straightforward algorithm for finding
the former. Finally, we demonstrate and compare both of our methods based on
various examples from condensed matter physics and universal quantum
computation.

*Kui Zhao,Wei-Guo Ma,Ziting Wang,Hao Li,Kaixuan Huang,Yun-Hao Shi,Kai Xu,Heng Fan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol enhances gate fidelity for fixed-frequency transmon qubits, achieving >99.9% fidelity and improving coherence and spectral isolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Existing fixed-frequency architectures have limitations, making efficient gate operations challenging. This paper proposes a new microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol to address these challenges.

Method: The protocol leverages third-order nonlinear interactions to coherently exchange |001⟩ ↔ |110⟩ states. It incorporates a phase-compensated optimization protocol and numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness. A systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant source of error. The approach ensures robustness to fabrication-induced qubit parameter variations and works well within the large-detuning regime.

Result: Numerical simulations show that the gate fidelity exceeds 99.9%. The protocol provides a solution to multi-qubit gate errors, specifically static long-range ZZ coupling, which is suppressed in the large-detuning regime (around 1 GHz). The method is hardware-efficient and enhances scalability by improving coherence, reducing spectral congestion, and enabling error-resilient quantum operations.

Conclusion: The proposed microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol effectively addresses the challenges of fixed-frequency architectures, achieving high gate fidelity and maintaining spectral isolation. This advancement supports the development of scalable quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical
constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding.
Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via
all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we
propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency
transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the
third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $|001\rangle
\leftrightarrow |110\rangle$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated
optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate
fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static
long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems,
which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$
GHz). This approach simultaneously enhances gate fidelity while preserving
spectral isolation, ensuring compatibility with existing all-microwave
controlled-Z gate frameworks. The protocol exhibits intrinsic robustness to
fabrication-induced qubit parameter variations. This hardware-efficient
strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence
properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental
toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale
quantum era.

TL;DR: A pulse shaping technique inspired by the derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) protocol is introduced to suppress measurement crosstalk during fast readout in quantum error correction protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error correction is essential for scalable quantum computing, but measurement crosstalk in superconducting systems degrades readout fidelity. This work aims to address this challenge.

Method: The authors propose a pulse shaping technique based on the DRAG protocol to create a spectral notch at neighboring resonator frequencies, thereby suppressing spurious signal interference during fast readout.

Result: The proposed method enables fast, low-crosstalk multiplexed measurements without additional hardware overhead, making it suitable for scalable quantum computing architectures.

Conclusion: This advancement is a critical step toward improving the efficiency and reliability of quantum error correction protocols in superconducting systems.

Abstract: Quantum error correction protocols require rapid and repeated qubit
measurements. While multiplexed readout in superconducting quantum systems
improves efficiency, fast probe pulses introduce spectral broadening, leading
to signal leakage into neighboring readout resonators. This crosstalk results
in qubit dephasing and degraded readout fidelity. Here, we introduce a pulse
shaping technique inspired by the derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG)
protocol to suppress measurement crosstalk during fast readout. By engineering
a spectral notch at neighboring resonator frequencies, the method effectively
mitigates spurious signal interference. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing readout architectures, enabling fast, low-crosstalk multiplexed
measurements without additional hardware overhead -- a critical advancement for
scalable quantum computing.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from
space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing.
The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader
application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling
can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs)
are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation
restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond.
InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but
suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing
probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process.
In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of
nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature
single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by
coupling a low bandgap ($\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a
sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron
fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate
an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\%$ (estimated as $42.8\%$ for polarized
light), and a minimum dark count of $\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature.

TL;DR: A paper discusses quantum walks generated by the generalized Laplacian operator involving both adjacency and degree matrices. Parameter tuning improves state transfer fidelity on certain graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum walks and state transfer are frontier areas in quantum computing, so improving their fidelity is crucial.

Method: The paper uses mathematical analysis of graph properties and simulations to study the effect of parameter k on Laplacian operators.

Result: Tuning k increases transfer fidelity for some graphs.

Conclusion: Further study of parameter effects on generalized graph Laplacians may boost quantum walk applications.

Abstract: Quantum walks generated by the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian are known to
exhibit low transfer fidelity on general graphs. In this paper, we study
continuous-time quantum walks governed by the generalized Laplacian operator
L_k = A+kD, where A is the adjacency matrix, D is the degree matrix, and k is a
real-valued parameter. Recent work of Duda, McLaughlin, and Wong showed that in
the single-excitation Heisenberg (XYZ) spin model, one can realize walks
generated by this family of operators on signed weighted graphs. Motivated by
earlier studies on vertex-weighted graphs, we demonstrate that for certain
graphs, tuning the parameter k can significantly enhance the fidelity of state
transfer between endpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constructing quantum circuits with minimal gate depth is vital for practical quantum computing, especially for larger n. Efficient decomposition algorithms help achieve this.

Method: The algorithm builds on Sá Earp and Pachos' 2005 approach but addresses their key flaws, including ill-defined matrix logarithms and convergence issues in BCH series. It leverages algebraic structures like involutive automorphisms and symmetric Lie algebra decompositions to create a stable, recursive factorization method.

Result: A Python implementation is provided, tested on SU(8) and SU(16) matrices with random unitary benchmarks. The algorithm produces decompositions that can be implemented near-optimally using standard gate sets, improving practical quantum hardware usability.

Conclusion: The algorithm offers a robust solution for SU(2ⁿ) decomposition, advancing efficient quantum circuit design for future quantum computing applications.

Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for performing the Cartan-Khaneja-Glaser
decomposition of unitary matrices in $\SU(2^n)$, a critical task for efficient
quantum circuit design. Building upon the approach introduced by S\'a Earp and
Pachos (2005), we overcome key limitations of their method, such as reliance on
ill-defined matrix logarithms and the convergence issues of truncated
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff(BCH) series. Our reformulation leverages the algebraic
structure of involutive automorphisms and symmetric Lie algebra decompositions
to yield a stable and recursive factorization process. We provide a full Python
implementation of the algorithm, available in an open-source repository, and
validate its performance on matrices in $\SU(8)$ and $\SU(16)$ using random
unitary benchmarks. The algorithm produces decompositions that are directly
suited to practical quantum hardware, with factors that can be implemented
near-optimally using standard gate sets.

Abstract: Engineered dissipation is emerging as an alternative tool for quantum state
control, enabling high-fidelity preparation, transfer and stabilization, and
access to novel phase transitions. We realize a tunable, state-resolved
laser-induced loss channel for individual Rydberg atoms, in both
non-interacting and strongly correlated settings. This capability allows us to
reveal interaction-driven shifts of the exceptional point separating quantum
Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes, and to demonstrate interaction-enhanced decay. By
exploiting interaction-dependent energy level shifts, we observe a
configuration-selective two-body Zeno effect that freezes target spin states.
We theoretically show that when this mechanism is extended to many-body chains
it allows for the dissipative distillation of unwanted spin configurations.
These experimental studies establish a versatile approach for exploring
strongly interacting, open quantum spin systems, and opens possible new
routines for dissipative preparation of correlated quantum states in Rydberg
atom arrays.

Abstract: Non-linearities are a key feature allowing non-classical control of quantum
harmonic oscillators. However, when non-linearities are strong, designing
protocols for control is often difficult, placing a barrier to exploiting these
properties fully. Here, using a single trapped-ion oscillator operated in the
strongly non-linear regime of the atom-light interaction, we show how to
generate localized multi (2, 3, 4, and 5)-component Schr\"odinger's cat
manifolds using a novel form of non-linear reservoir engineering. We then
specifically select Hamiltonians which allow us to perform measurements on
these state manifolds. To our knowledge, our work is the first experimental use
of such high order non-linear processes for control of non-classical states of
a quantum harmonic oscillator, opening up a new toolbox which can be applied to
bosonic quantum error correction, computation, and sensing.

Abstract: The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model, as the simplest realization of a
lattice gauge theory, exhibits rich and unconventional physics. One of its most
remarkable features is disorder-free localization, where localization emerges
not from explicit quenched disorder but from static background $\mathbb{Z}_2$
gauge charges, leading to persistent memory of the initial state. In this work,
we investigate the dissipative dynamics of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge
model by coupling it to a Markovian environment. We find that quantum
dissipation can enhance localization: memory of the initial state is retained
more robustly under dissipative evolution than under unitary dynamics. This
dissipation-induced enhancement of localization persists across a variety of
initial states, indicating that the effect is not limited to fine-tuned
configurations. Our results demonstrate that dissipation, often associated with
decoherence and thermalization, can in fact serve as a powerful tool for
stabilizing non-ergodic behavior in gauge-constrained quantum systems.

Abstract: The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry
between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded
in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an
observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry
associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the
asymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states
that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the
near-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a
long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a
universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew
information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving
tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities,
which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as
prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new
conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful toolkit
for its application.

Conclusion: This method simplifies quantum random number generation for secure communication.

Abstract: Quantum random number generators play a vital role in securing communication
and encryption. In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using
four-wave mixing in a double-{\Lambda} configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and
generated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness
originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the
twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the
intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis
frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random
intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of
entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to
extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data
and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers
at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and
TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the
potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.

Motivation: Accurate and efficient simulation of quantum systems is crucial for quantum information science and technology.

Method: Proposed a regional attention-based neural architecture with translational invariance and conditioning on global control parameters.

Result: Achieves high predictive fidelity and accelerates numerical solvers up to 10^3 times.

Conclusion: Framework enables real-time simulation, design, optimization, and scalable modeling for quantum networks and devices.

Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and
external control is an important challenge in quantum information science.
Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master
and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and
optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale
simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural
architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum
systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an
inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on
time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two
representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model
achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up
to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate
that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for
spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to
large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design,
real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across
diverse light-matter platforms.

Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of adiabatic states
in three-level quantum systems are investigated analytically and numerically.
Various possible configurations of three-level systems under exact two-photon
resonance are considered. It is shown that in all these schemes, the lifetime
of the studied states is determined by the dephasing time between levels that
are not connected by a dipole transition. An efficient population transfer
through the b-state at room temperature is demonstrated despite relatively long
relaxation times. It is also demonstrated that, in case of large one-photon
detuning, the so-called b-state has the same lifetime as that of the dark
state. The evolution of adiabatic states for arbitrary values of single-photon
detunings has been studied numerically.

*Artem Rozanov,Boris Bantysh,Ivan Bobrov,Gleb Struchalin,Stanislav Straupe*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents benchmarking results for single-qubit gates on a neutral atom quantum processor using DRB and GST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to establish reliable and scalable methods for evaluating quantum gate performance, essential for advancing quantum computing.

Method: It employs two quantum benchmarking techniques: DRB for error characterization and GST for detailed process reconstruction. These methods are applied to a 25-qubit array.

Result: DRB achieved an average fidelity of ~99.963%, while GST provides complementary insights through process reconstruction.

Conclusion: DRB and GST offer effective tools for evaluating quantum architectures, aiding in scalability and practical implementation.

Abstract: We present benchmarking results for single-qubit gates implemented on a
neutral atom quantum processor using Direct Randomized Benchmarking (DRB) and
Gate Set Tomography (GST). The DRB protocol involves preparing stabilizer
states, applying $m$ layers of native single-qubit gates, and measuring in the
computational basis, providing an efficient error characterization under a
stochastic Pauli noise model. GST enables the full, self-consistent
reconstruction of quantum processes, including gates, input states, and
measurements. Both protocols provide robust to state preparation and
measurement (SPAM) errors estimations of gate performance, offering
complementary perspectives on quantum gate fidelity. For single-qubit gates,
DRB yields an average fidelity of $99.963 \pm 0.016\%$. The protocol was
further applied to a 25-qubit array under global single-qubit control. GST
results are consistent with those obtained via DRB. We also introduce a gauge
optimization procedure for GST that brings the reconstructed gates, input
states, and measurements into a canonical frame, enabling meaningful fidelity
comparisons while preserving physical constraints. These constraints of the
operators -- such as complete positivity and trace preservation -- are enforced
by performing the optimization over the Stiefel manifold. The combined analysis
supports the use of complementary benchmarking techniques for characterizing
scalable quantum architectures.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of high-temperature ion implantation on diamond-based NV^- ensembles, demonstrating that 800°C implantation can maintain structural integrity without amorphization and improve magnetic field sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is the need to enhance the performance and reliability of diamond-based quantum sensors by optimizing NV^- ensemble properties through ion implantation techniques.

Method: The study employed ion implantation at different temperatures and fluences, measuring the impact on diamond's structural integrity and NV^- properties through temperature-dependent experiments.

Result: The research reveals that high-temperature (800°C) ion implantation successfully maintains diamond's structural integrity at high fluences without amorphization, with enhanced magnetic field sensitivity.

Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the optimization of NV^- ensembles for quantum sensors by demonstrating that high-temperature ion implantation can effectively mitigate structural damage and improve sensor performance.

Abstract: Dense and shallow ensembles of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers
(NV$^-$) with good optical and spin properties play a key role in the
performance enhancement of diamond-based quantum sensors. Ion implantation
enables precise control of NV$^-$ depth and density. However, at high ion
fluence, this method is limited by low NV$^-$ creation yields and sample
amorphization. Additionally, shallow NV$^-$ spin properties deteriorate due to
surface proximity. In this paper, we study N$_2^+$ ion implantation at energies
between 10 and 15 keV with fluences as high as 1e15 ions/cm2 at temperatures of
20, 400 and 800{\deg}C to investigate the influence of implantation temperature
on lattice damage, NV$^-$ creation yield and NV$^-$ spin properties. Our
results show that diamond maintains structural integrity at 800{\deg}C with
fluences up to 1e15 ions/cm2 without amorphization. Furthermore,
high-temperature implantation improves NV$^-$ creation yields up to five times
without compromising T2$^*$, T2 and T1, making it a promising approach to
enhance the magnetic field sensitivity of NV$^-$ ensembles.

Abstract: We consider a system composed of two distinct spatial regions, populated by
two-component bosons coupled through a tunneling process. Local dephasing noise
acts independently on each region, enabling competition between coherent
dynamics and decoherence. We present an analytic microscopical derivation of
the corresponding Lindblad master equation, taking into account the full
system-environment evolution and verify its validity against the numerical
solution of the full system, computed through the pseudo-mode method. We
demonstrate how the commonly-used phenomenological master equation emerges as a
short-time limit of the full one. We finally explore how dephasing affects
known two-particle indistinguishability-based scenarios, namely Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference and entanglement generation. In particular, we show that
simultaneous deformation and dephasing can produce rich, nontrivial dynamics,
including persistent quantum correlations in long-time steady states.

Conclusion: This work provides a solution to the problem of amplitude-damping noise, demonstrating a method that can be applied to both state and channel purification with minimal resource requirements.

Abstract: Noise poses a fundamental challenge to quantum information processing, with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量子信息科学中，估计未知unitary操作的特性是一个基本任务。而全unitary相位估计需要大量样本，与未知unitary的维度成线性关系，导致指数级增长。因此，针对特定函数的估计具有更高的效率。

Method: 论文使用了控制性unitary操作，并结合了调和分析、交换子估计和算法复杂度分析，构造了高效的估计算法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅实现了对任意可平方积分函数的高效估计，还推广了Hadamard检验方法，并利用了表示论工具。

Abstract: Estimating properties of unknown unitary operations is a fundamental task in
quantum information science. While full unitary tomography requires a number of
samples to the unknown unitary scaling linearly with the dimension (implying
exponentially with the number of qubits), estimating specific functions of a
unitary can be significantly more efficient. In this paper, we present a
unified framework for the sample-efficient estimation of arbitrary square
integrable functions $f: \mathbf{U}(d) \to \mathbb{C}$, using only access to
the controlled-unitary operation. We first provide a tight characterization of
the optimal sample complexity when the accuracy is measured by the averaged
bias over the unitary $\mathbf{U}(d)$. We then construct a sample-efficient
estimation algorithm that becomes optimal under the Probably Approximately
Correct (PAC) learning criterion for various classes of functions.
  Applications include optimal estimation of matrix elements of irreducible
representations, the trace, determinant, and general polynomial functions on
$\mathbf{U}(d)$. Our technique generalize the Hadamard test and leverage tools
from representation theory, yielding both lower and upper bound on sample
complexity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the joint effects of vector and tensor light shifts in a set of
large spin atoms, prepared in a polarized state and interacting with light.
Depending on the ratio $\epsilon$ between tensor and vector coupling and a
measurement rate $\Gamma$, we identify a regime of quantum non-demolition
measurement squeezing for times shorter than $(\sqrt{\epsilon}\Gamma)^{-1}$,
and a deterministic squeezing regime for times longer than $(\epsilon
\Gamma)^{-1}$. We apply our results to fermionic isotopes of strontium,
ytterbium, and helium, which are atoms with purely nuclear spin in their ground
state, benefiting from very low decoherence. For ytterbium 173, with a cavity
such as that of \cite{Thompson2021}, it would be possible to achieve an atomic
spin variance reduction of $0.03$ in $\simeq 50 \rm ms$.

TL;DR: 通过优化基函数系数可以减少范数，但效益有限；而使用大基底集固定自然轨道(FNO)策略能显著降低QPE资源消耗，提高化学准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 量子相位估计在分子基态能量计算方面具有巨大潜力，但其计算成本较高，限制了其应用，本研究试图通过优化基函数来降低计算成本。

Method: 研究分为两部分，第一部分调整高斯基函数系数以降低1-范数；第二部分使用大基底集固定自然轨道（FNO）策略。

Result: 调整基函数系数可减少1-范数，但收益随分子大小增加而下降；FNO策略使QPE资源消耗减少80%，基轨道数量减少55%。

Conclusion: 优化基轨道质量而非数量是提高QPE计算效率的有效途径，未来研究可进一步探索这一方向。

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a promising quantum algorithm for obtaining
molecular ground-state energies with chemical accuracy. However, its
computational cost, dominated by the Hamiltonian 1-norm $\lambda$ and the cost
of the block encoding, scales at least quadratically with the number of
molecular orbitals, making it challenging to incorporate dynamic correlation by
enlarging the active space. In this work, we investigate two strategies to
mitigate this cost through the optimization of the basis set. First, we
investigate whether adjusting the coefficients of Gaussian basis functions can
minimize the 1-norm while preserving the accuracy of the ground state energy.
Although this method leads to a reduction in the 1-norm up to 10%, this
reduction is system-dependent and diminishes with increasing molecular size.
Second, we demonstrate that employing a large-basis-set frozen natural orbital
(FNO) strategy results in a substantial reduction in QPE resources without
compromising accuracy. We study a dataset of 58 small organic molecules and the
dissociation curve of N2, and demonstrate that an active space constructed from
orbitals derived from larger basis sets captures correlation effects more
effectively. This approach yields up to an 80% reduction in the 1-norm
$\lambda$ and also leads to a 55% reduction in the number of orbitals. Our
results highlight that improving the quality, not just the size, of the orbital
basis is a viable strategy for extending QPE to include dynamical correlation,
making progress toward scalable and chemically accurate quantum simulations
with tractable resource requirements.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates nonlocal multimode coupling in a Landau polariton system using slot cavities, achieving zero- and finite-momentum matter mode interactions under ultrastrong coupling conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) phenomena, especially cavity-mediated interactions between zero and finite-momentum modes, to enable controlling light-matter interactions across space.

Method: Used slot cavities with subwavelength mode volumes to induce finite-momentum components. Employed terahertz time-domain magnetospectroscopy for measurements.

Result: Observation of polariton splitting due to hybridization between magnetoplasmons and cavity-cyclotron hybrids. The coupling strengths align with theoretical models and simulations.

Conclusion: Expands the USC platform for engineered multimode light-matter interactions involving both zero and finite-momentum modes.

Abstract: The multimode ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime has emerged as a novel
platform for accessing previously inaccessible phenomena in cavity quantum
electrodynamics. Of particular interest are cavity-mediated correlations
between local and nonlocal excitations, or equivalently, between modes at zero
and finite in-plane momentum modes, which offer new opportunities for
controlling light-matter interactions across space. However, direct
experimental evidence of such interactions has remained elusive. Here, we
demonstrate nonlocal multimode coupling in a Landau polariton system, where
cavity photons simultaneously interact with the zero-momentum cyclotron
resonance and finite-momentum magnetoplasmons of a two-dimensional electron gas
in a GaAs quantum well. Our slot cavities, with their subwavelength mode
volumes, supply in-plane momentum components that enable the excitation of
finite-momentum matter modes. Terahertz time-domain magnetospectroscopy
measurements reveal a clear splitting of the upper-polariton branch, arising
from hybridization between magnetoplasmon modes and the
cavity--cyclotron-resonance hybrids. Extracted coupling strengths confirm USC
of the cyclotron resonance and strong coupling of the magnetoplasmon modes to
the cavity field, respectively. The experimental results are well captured by
the multimode Hopfield model and finite-element simulations. These findings
establish a pathway for engineering multimode light-matter interactions
involving zero- and finite-momentum matter modes in the USC regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in quantum optics and photonics has led to the need for improved quantum light sources, particularly for squeezed states used in quantum computing and communication. The development of parametric oscillators is a promising solution.

Method: The authors developed an analytic model using quantum mechanics to study the dynamics of distributed feedback parametric oscillators. They considered nonlinear media and photonic structures to fabricate these oscillators.

Result: The model provides insights into key properties such as the parametric oscillation pump threshold, intracavity modes, tunability, and quantum statistics of output modes. These results support future work on versatile quantum light sources.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step toward achieving next-generation quantum light sources using distributed feedback parametric oscillators and their integration with photonic structures.

Abstract: Optical parametric amplifiers and oscillators are among the best-developed
quantum light sources, having already been adopted in precision measurement and
underpinning various quantum computing and communication paradigms. Meanwhile,
progress in photonic structures such as Bragg gratings has enabled distributed
feedback oscillators to become widely established as classical laser sources
with desirable properties. Recent work in fabricating and processing photonic
structures in nonlinear media opens the path to combining these two programs to
realize distributed feedback parametric oscillators. Such devices have great
potential as sources of quantum light, especially for squeezed vacuum, a
crucial resource state in emerging quantum technologies. In this study, an
analytic and fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics of such devices is
presented. This approach gives explicit results for the key properties of these
sources, including the parametric oscillation pump threshold, intracavity mode,
tunability, and quantum statistics of the output modes. These results underpin
future work on a versatile class of next-generation quantum light source.

### [188] [Discrete-Time Quantum Random Walk for Epidemiological Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05795)
*Sayan Manna,Nikhil Kowshik,Sudebkumar Prasant Pal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a discrete-time quantum random walk framework for modeling spatial epidemics on a 2D lattice, comparing its dynamics to classical models. The key findings are that the quantum random walk (QRW) interpolates between diffusive and super-diffusive regimes, showing higher basic reproduction numbers (R₀) and non-Gaussian spatial profiles at higher parameters. The QRW could be a useful model for studying rapid or heavy-tailed epidemic spread but requires caution when mapping quantum effects to biological transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epidemiological modeling is crucial for understanding disease spread and controlling outbreaks. Quantum random walks offer a novel approach to modeling faster or more variable epidemic dynamics, making this study timely and relevant.

Method: The study employs a discrete-time quantum random walk model on a 2D square lattice. The model uses an amplitude-splitting coin and conditional shifts to simulate quantum walker evolution. The transmission probability (p) and walker lifetime (τ) are varied to study different dynamics. Numerical simulations are conducted on finite lattices to measure cluster observables and compute R₀ across a range of (p, τ) values.

Result: The QRW model shows that at low p, the dynamics closely resemble classical random-walk SIR models, with R₀ and cluster statistics matching those of classical models. However, at higher p and τ, the QRW exhibits super-diffusive behavior characterized by larger R₀ values and non-Gaussian spatial profiles. This indicates that QRW can capture more complex and rapid epidemic spread patterns than classical models.

Conclusion: The QRW provides a flexible and conceptually novel framework for exploring rapid or heavy-tailed epidemic spread. While it offers a closer qualitative match to empirical data in certain parameter regimes, caution is needed when interpreting quantum-coherent mechanisms in biological systems.

Abstract: We introduce a discrete-time quantum random walk (QRW) framework for spatial
epidemic modelling on a two-dimensional square lattice and compare its dynamics
to classical random-walk SIR models. In our model, each infected site spawns a
quantum walker whose coherent evolution (controlled by an amplitude-splitting
coin and conditional shifts) can infect visited susceptible sites with
probability $p$ and persists for a lifetime of $\tau$ steps. We perform
extensive numerical simulations on finite lattices, measure cluster observables
(single-run cluster size $M$ and its ensemble average $\langle M\rangle$), and
compute the basic reproduction number $R_0$ across a broad grid of $(p,\tau)$
values. Results show that QRW dynamics interpolate between diffusive and
super-diffusive regimes: at low $p$ the QRW reproduces classical-like $R_0$ and
cluster statistics, while at higher $p$ and $\tau$ ballistic propagation and
interference produce markedly larger $R_0$ and non-Gaussian spatial profiles.
We compare the QRW $R_0$ range to empirical estimates from historical outbreaks
and discuss parameter regimes where QRW offers a closer qualitative match than
classical diffusion. We conclude that QRWs provide a flexible, conceptually
novel toy model for exploring rapid or heavy-tailed epidemic spread, while
emphasizing the need for caution when mapping quantum-coherent mechanisms to
biological transmission.

TL;DR: A genetic algorithm-inspired framework for designing efficient variational quantum algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of practical quantum algorithms for near-term quantum devices is crucial for advancing quantum computing applications, particularly in quantum chemistry, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning.

Method: A genetic algorithm approach is used to evolve quantum ansatze, optimizing for expressibility without increasing depth or parameter count.

Result: The framework produces highly expressive, shallow, and low-parameter quantum circuits that avoid barren plateaus and perform as well as traditional designs.

Conclusion: This framework provides a scalable and efficient method for designing high-performing variational quantum algorithms, streamlining the development process for practical quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a leading paradigm that
extracts practical computation from near-term intermediate-scale quantum
devices, enabling advances in quantum chemistry simulations, combinatorial
optimization, and quantum machine learning. However, the performance of
Variational Quantum Algorithms is highly sensitive to the design of the
ansatze. To be effective, ansatze must be expressive enough to capture target
states but shallow enough to be trainable. We propose a genetic
algorithm-inspired framework for designing ansatze that achieve high
expressibility while maintaining shallow depth and low parameter count. Our
approach evolves ansatze through mutation and selection based on an
expressibility metric. The circuit generated by our framework consistently
demonstrates high expressibility at any target depth and performs comparably to
traditional ansatz design approaches while showing minimal to no signs of
barren plateau issues. This work presents a general, scalable solution for
ansatz design, producing expressive, low-depth circuits that need to be
designed only once and can serve a wide range of applications.

Abstract: A uniformly accelerated atom in an inertial vacuum generally thermalizes and
reaches a Gibbs state. This phenomenon is commonly known as the Unruh effect.
Here, we show that the situation is entirely different for the many-atoms
problem. In the case of non-interacting accelerating atoms, we show that a
regime exists where the entire system reaches a prethermal generalized Gibbs
state before it thermalizes. The prethermal state is protected by emergent
conserved quantities; hence, the system behaves like a nearly-integrable one,
which shows a sharp distinction from the Unruh effect. We coin the term ``Unruh
prethermalization" to characterize this phenomenon. The measure of entanglement
is a good estimation of the lifetime of the prethermal state and is consistent
with previous studies. Finally, we show that in such a regime, the dynamics
show a Dicke superradiance-type radiation burst before reaching the prethermal
state. In contrast, only a mono-exponential decay is observed for Unruh
thermalization. In addition, to highlight the significance of our results, we
compare them with existing experimental observations.

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum
computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the
multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem
extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum
approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithm for best-arm
identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification
(QSBAI). The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over
graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing
the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link
between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural
restrictions. We analyze complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal
success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it
is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate
exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum
algorithms for decision-making.

Abstract: One of the fundamental tasks in machine learning is image classification,
which serves as a key benchmark for validating algorithm performance and
practical potential. However, effectively processing high-dimensional,
detail-rich images, a capability that is inherent in biological vision, remains
a persistent challenge. Inspired by the human brain's efficient ``Forest Before
Trees'' cognition, we propose a novel Guiding Paradigm for image recognition,
leveraging classical neural networks to analyze global low-frequency
information and guide targeted quantum circuit towards critical high-frequency
image regions. We present the Brain-Inspired Quantum Classifier (BIQC),
implementing this paradigm via a complementarity architecture where a quantum
pathway analyzes the localized intricate details identified by the classical
pathway. Numerical simulations on diverse datasets, including high-resolution
images, show the BIQC's superior accuracy and scalability compared to existing
methods. This highlights the promise of brain-inspired, hybrid
quantum-classical approach for developing next-generation visual systems.

Abstract: A major challenge in quantum information is characterizing entanglement, for
which entanglement witnesses offer effective means of detecting quantum
correlations. We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework that learns a
nonlinear entanglement witness directly from quantum data using
continuous-variable quantum neural networks (CV-QNNs). Our architecture
combines variational interferometers, squeezers and non-Gaussian Kerr gates
with a small classical neural head to output a scalar witness value. Numerical
simulations were conducted on two- and three-mode families, including Gaussian
and non-Gaussian states in both pure and mixed forms. We observed over 99%
classification accuracy and a robust performance gap compared to strong
classical baselines, especially when scaling from two to three modes.
Robustness to photon loss is further quantified under a finite number of
measurement shots. On the theory side, we show that when the quantum
measurement stage is informationally complete, the hybrid model can approximate
any continuous witness-like functional on compact sets of states.Our findings
highlight CV-QNNs as a promising framework for data-driven quantum state
characterization and propose specific benchmarks where near-term photonic
platforms offer tangible advantages.

### [194] [Symmetric and asymmetric tripartite states under the lens of entanglement splitting and topological linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05972)
*Sougata Bhattacharyya,Sovik Roy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper connects entanglement structures in three-qubit states to topological links through local projective measurements. The symmetric |φ̄⟩ state displays a 3-Hopf link-like behavior with residual bipartite entanglement. The asymmetric |φ*⟩ state shows varying resilience, akin to a 3-link chain or Borromean rings, depending on measurement outcomes, highlighting distributed entanglement's contextuality as a topological resource.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between quantum entanglement and topology is crucial for quantum information and computation, as topological properties are key to robust quantum systems.

Method: Local projective measurements were performed on individual qubits; post-measurement states were analyzed using Schmidt rank to characterize residual entanglement.

Result: The symmetric |φ̄⟩ state exhibits a 3-Hopf link-like behavior with residual bipartite entanglement. The asymmetric |φ*⟩ state shows either Borromean-like robustness or chain-like fragility, with disentanglement occurring upon losing a qubit in certain cases.

Conclusion: The study reveals that quantum states can embody multiple topological structures, offering a new perspective for characterizing and controlling distributed entanglement under local measurements, with implications for quantum topology and resource theory.

Abstract: This work establishes a direct operational connection between the
entanglement structures of specific three-qubit states (i.e. multipartite
entanglement) and their corresponding topological links. We investigate the
symmetric $\wwbar$ state and the asymmetric $\starstate$ state through local
projective measurements on individual qubits. The post measurement states are
analyzed via their Schmidt rank to characterize residual bipartite
entanglement. For the symmetric $\wwbar$ state, measurement of any qubit
consistently results in a non-maximally entangled post-measurement state
(Schmidt rank 2), analogous to the behavior of a \textit{3-Hopf link}
structure, where cutting any ring leaves the remaining two nontrivially linked.
On the other hand, the $\starstate$ state exhibits a context-dependent
fragility. Its behavior predominantly mirrors that of a \textit{3-link chain},
where severing the central qubit decouples the system, while cutting an outer
qubit often preserves a residual link. Crucially, for specific measurement
outcomes, the $\starstate$ state also exhibits the defining property of the
\textit{Borromean rings}, where the loss of one qubit completely disentangles
the remaining two. This analysis provides a concrete interpretation of
topological linking structures as a resource for characterizing distributed
entanglement and its resilience under local measurement operations, revealing
that a single quantum state can contextually embody multiple distinct
topological analogues.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work is driven by the need for high-accuracy quantum tomography, which is critical for advancing quantum technology and understanding quantum mechanics.

Method: The authors propose a unified infidelity metric for quantum state, detector, and process tomography and establish a condition for achieving optimal scaling. Adaptive algorithms are then developed based on this condition.

Result: The proposed methods achieve optimal scaling 1-F = O(1/N) in tomography protocols, surpassing the O(1/√N) scaling of static methods. Numerical simulations and experiments validate the approach, achieving optimal scaling in ancilla-assisted process tomography for the first time.

Conclusion: This research advances quantum tomography by providing a unified framework and adaptive algorithms that achieve higher accuracy, supported by both simulations and experiments.

Abstract: Quantum tomography is a standard technique for characterizing, benchmarking
and verifying quantum systems/devices and plays a vital role in advancing
quantum technology and understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics.
Achieving the highest possible tomography accuracy remains a central challenge.
Here we unify the infidelity metrics for quantum state, detector and process
tomography in a single index $1-F(\hat S,S)$, where $S$ represents the true
density matrix, POVM element, or process matrix, and $\hat S$ is its estimator.
We establish a sufficient and necessary condition for any tomography protocol
to attain the optimal scaling $1-F= O(1/N) $ where $N$ is the number of state
copies consumed, in contrast to the $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ worst-case scaling of
static methods. Guided by this result, we propose adaptive algorithms with
provably optimal infidelity scalings for state, detector, and process
tomography. Numerical simulations and quantum optical experiments validate the
proposed methods, with our experiments reaching, for the first time, the
optimal infidelity scaling in ancilla-assisted process tomography.

Abstract: Quantum light propagation through turbulent atmosphere has become a subject
of intensive research, spanning both theoretical and experimental studies. This
interest is driven by its important applications in free-space quantum
communication, remote quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring. At the
same time, this phenomenon itself poses an intriguing fundamental problem. A
consistent theoretical description typically makes explicit assumptions about
the measurement scheme at the receiver station and/or the method of
quantum-information encoding. A common and straightforward approach encodes the
information in quantum states of a quasi-monochromatic mode, representing a
pulsed Gaussian beam. Atmospheric turbulence induces random distortions of the
pulse shape and, consequently, random fluctuations of the transmittance through
the receiver aperture. These fluctuations, characterized by the probability
distribution of transmittance (PDT), directly affect the quantum state of the
received light. In this paper we examine various analytical models of the PDT,
validate them through numerical simulations, and assess their range of
applicability. Furthermore, we extend the analysis beyond the standard
ensemble-averaging approach, recognizing that realistic experiments typically
involve time averaging. This requires a detailed examination of the underlying
random process, including the study of temporal correlations and their impact
on nonclassical properties of electromagnetic radiation.

Abstract: Optomechanical interactions between mechanical oscillators and an
electromagnetic field induce controllable modifications in mechanical
fluctuation. When multiple mechanical oscillators are coupled to a single
electromagnetic mode, these interactions can be extended to utilize the
electromagnetic mode as a mediator for distributing noise squeezing among
different mechanical oscillators. We investigate the transfer of mechanical
noise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave
cavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing
in one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of
its resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously,
optomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical
modes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode
(target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical
modes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from
the squeezing in the control mode. Remarkably, the observed squeezing transfer
manifests noise characteristics of both single-mode and two-mode squeezing.
This unique feature suggests that the squeezing transfer holds significant
potential for enhancing precision measurements.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficient simulation of quantum dynamics with time-dependent Hamiltonians is
important not only for time-varying systems but also for time-independent
Hamiltonians in the interaction picture. Such simulations are more challenging
than their time-independent counterparts due to the complexity introduced by
time ordering. Existing algorithms that aim to capture commutator-based scaling
either exhibit polynomial cost dependence on the Hamiltonian's time derivatives
or are limited to low-order accuracy. In this work, we establish the general
commutator-scaling error bounds for the truncated Magnus expansion at arbitrary
order, where only Hamiltonian terms appear in the nested commutators, with no
time derivatives involved. Building on this analysis, we design a high-order
quantum algorithm with explicit circuit constructions. The algorithm achieves
cost scaling with the commutator structure in the high-precision regime and
depends only logarithmically on the Hamiltonian's time variation, making it
efficient for general time-dependent settings, including the interaction
picture.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了QML模型的隐私问题，并为其实现提供了解决方案，为构建隐私保护的量子机器学习系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computation with classical
Machine Learning (ML) and holds the potential to achieve the quantum advantage
for specific tasks. In classical ML, Machine Unlearning (MU) is a crucial
strategy for removing the influence of specified training data from a model, to
meet regulatory requirements and mitigate privacy risks. However, both the risk
of training-data membership leakage remains underexplored in QML. This
motivates us to propose Quantum Machine Unlearning (QMU) to explore two core
questions: do QML models require MU due to training-data membership leakage,
and can MU mechanisms be efficiently implemented in the QML? To answer the two
questions, we conducted experiments on the MNIST classification task, utilizing
a class-wise unlearning paradigm in both noiseless simulations and quantum
hardware. First, we quantify training-data privacy leakage using a Membership
Inference Attack (MIA), observing average success rates of 90.2\% in noiseless
simulations and 75.3\% on quantum hardware. These results indicate that QML
models present training-data membership leakage with very high probability
under adversarial access, motivating the need for MU. Second, we implement MU
algorithms on the QML model, which reduces the average MIA success rate to 0\%
in simulations and 3.7\% on quantum hardware while preserving accuracy on
retained data. We conclude that implementing MU mechanisms in QML models
renders them resistant to MIA. Overall, this paper reveals significant privacy
vulnerabilities in QML models and provides effective corresponding defense
strategies, providing a potential path toward privacy-preserving QML systems.

Abstract: In this paper we study local unitary invariants of a multi-partite quantum
state that are monotonic, on average, under local operations and classical
communication (locc). In particular we focus on local unitary invariants that
are constructed out of polynomials in the state and its conjugate - called
multi-invariants. Multi-invariants are labeled by certain types of graphs.
Recently, in \cite{Gadde:2024jfi}, the authors related the condition of
monotonicity under locc to a graph theoretic condition on the multi-invariant
called edge-convexity. In this paper, we conjecture a complete classification
of edge-convex multi-invariants. The conjecture states that the edge-convex
multi-invariants are labeled by finite Coxeter groups. We prove this conjecture
for all but six cases.

TL;DR: This paper compares methods for measuring quantum systems, highlighting when classical methods like 'classical shadow' are better than direct quantum measurements. The study identifies key factors like the number of qubits, observables, and sparsity, and finds optimal strategies vary by hardware. The conclusion provides insights for choosing between classical and quantum approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies on efficient measurement methods, and understanding their trade-offs is crucial for optimizing algorithms and hardware.

Method: The paper uses a resource analysis comparing classical and quantum methods under various parameters like qubits, observables, sparsity, and accuracy requirements.

Result: Classical shadow methods are more efficient under certain conditions, such as large numbers of small Pauli-weight observables or specific matrix structures. The analysis also suggests hardware-dependent break-even points for strategy selection.

Conclusion: The study establishes a framework for choosing between classical and quantum measurement methods based on specific quantum system parameters, aiding in hybrid quantum-classical designs and practical applications.

Abstract: Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in
full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method
efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states,
enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few
measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or
when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is
not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue
quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares
classical shadows with ``quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum
measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of
download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For
observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical
shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is
large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large
Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when
the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits
fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior
include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight
$w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also
compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of
quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow
method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper
opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid
quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the
most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate
the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting
cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various
qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental
noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity.
Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device
level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from
electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the
signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting
specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we
explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a
platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion
like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for
electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic
field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress
charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the
charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and
noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass
ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of
various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis
and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot
spin qubit arrays in axion detection.

Conclusion: 该研究成果为非高斯态的高效生成提供了统一框架，推动了光量子技术和fault-tolerant量子计算的实用性。

Abstract: Advanced quantum technologies rely on non-Gaussian states of light, essential
for universal quantum computation, fault-tolerant error correction, and quantum
sensing. Their practical realization, however, faces hurdles: simulating large
multi-mode generators is computationally demanding, and benchmarks such as the
\emph{stellar rank} do not capture how effectively photon detections yield
useful non-Gaussianity. We address these challenges by introducing the
\emph{non-Gaussian control parameters} $(s_0,\delta_0)$, a continuous and
operational measure that goes beyond stellar rank. Leveraging these parameters,
we develop a universal optimization method that reduces photon-number
requirements and greatly enhances success probabilities while preserving state
quality. Applied to the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) state generation, for
example, our method cuts the required photon detections by a factor of three
and raises the preparation probability by nearly $10^8$. Demonstrations across
cat states, cubic phase states, GKP states, and even random states confirm
broad gains in experimental feasibility. Our results provide a unifying
principle for resource-efficient non-Gaussian state generation, charting a
practical route toward scalable optical quantum technologies and fault-tolerant
quantum computation.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the extension of Ramsey interferometry into qudits using Wigner-Majorana systems, which allows for enhanced resolution. Higher-dimensional qudits provide greater resolution gains but may reduce contrast.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum metrology and sensing require precise measurements, and Ramsey interferometry traditionally uses qubits. Expanding beyond qubits with qudits is a promising approach for improving resolution.

Method: The researchers extended Ramsey interferometry to qudits in Wigner-Majorana (WM) systems by utilizing internal degrees of freedom. They compared standard Ramsey interferometry with the quantum Fourier transform and analyzed the WM symmetry.

Result: The study found that qudits in WM systems can achieve significant resolution improvements. Simulations and analytical solutions validate these findings. Specifically, three-state systems (qutrits) offer a twofold resolution increase compared to qubits without contrast degradation. Higher dimensional qudits achieve even better resolution but with contrast reduction.

Conclusion: Qudits present an promising strategy for enhancing resolution in quantum metrology and sensing, especially with qutrits as optimal choice for the best resolution-contrast trade-off.

Abstract: Ramsey interferometry, a cornerstone technique in quantum spectroscopy,
traditionally operates with qubits for high precision measurements. In this
work we build on Ramsey interferometry, extending it to qudits in
Wigner-Majorana (WM) systems where the internal degrees of freedom are used to
achieve enhanced resolution. We also show that replacing the two $\pi/2$ pulses
of standard Ramsey interferometry with the quantum Fourier transform provides
no increase in resolution. Theoretical analysis further reveals that quantum
systems with the WM symmetry are particularly well-suited for this objective,
achieving substantial resolution improvements for a given interrogation time.
Simulations and analytical solutions validate these predictions, confirming the
feasibility and advantages of qudits in Ramsey interferometry. We quantify
these advantages using a resolution--contrast index that enables direct
comparison between different qudit dimensions. In particular, three state
systems (qutrits) achieve a twofold resolution increase compared to qubits
without contrast degradation, emerging as optimal for the qudit approach.
Higher dimensional qudits achieve superior resolution enhancement at the cost
of contrast degradation. These significant resolution gains establish qudits as
attractive candidates for high-precision quantum metrology and sensing
technologies.

Abstract: Quantum states encoded in electromagnetic fields, also known as bosonic
states, have been widely applied in quantum sensing, quantum communication, and
quantum error correction. Accurate characterization is therefore essential yet
difficult when states cannot be reconstructed with sparse Pauli measurements.
Tomography must work with dense measurement bases, high-dimensional Hilbert
spaces, and often sample-based data. However, existing convex
optimization-based techniques are not efficient enough and scale poorly when
extended to large and multi-mode systems. In this work, we explore convex
optimization as an effective framework to address problems in bosonic state
tomography, introducing three techniques to enhance efficiency and scalability:
efficient displacement operator computation, Hilbert space truncation, and
stochastic convex optimization, which mitigate common limitations of existing
approaches. Then we propose a sample-based, convex maximum-likelihood
estimation (MLE) method specifically designed for flying mode tomography.
Numerical simulations of flying four-mode and nine-mode problems demonstrate
the accuracy and practicality of our methods. This method provides practical
tools for reliable bosonic mode quantum state reconstruction in
high-dimensional and multi-mode systems.

Abstract: Quantum processors are often affected by biased noise and noisy readout,
which reduce reliability and reproducibility. This work combines two
complementary strategies to address these challenges. The first is bias
tailoring, which aligns stabilizers with the dominant error type. The second is
single-shot (SS) decoding, which uses metachecks to identify measurement faults
from just one noisy round. We implement these ideas in a four-dimensional
lifted hypergraph product (4D-LHP) code constructed from quasi-cyclic
protograph seeds. Simulation results show that bias tailoring lowers the
word-error rate (WER) by 20-60 percent across realistic Z:X bias ratios (from
1:1 up to 1000:1), with the largest improvements at moderate bias. When
measurement noise is present, a single SS round recovers more than one third of
the performance lost to readout errors. Moreover, metachecks identify over 99.8
percent of faulty syndromes, providing near-complete fault visibility even with
limited correction power. Together, these findings demonstrate that 4D-LHP
codes maintain strong resilience under realistic noise, making them promising
candidates for integration into orchestrated QPU-CPU workflows.

Abstract: Residual cross-talk in superconducting qubit devices creates a security
vulnerability for emerging quantum cloud services. We demonstrate a
Clifford-only Quantum Rowhammer attack-using just X and CNOT gates-that injects
faults on IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processors without requiring pulse-level
access. Experiments show that targeted hammering induces localized errors
confined to the attack cycle and primarily manifests as phase noise, as
confirmed by near 50% flip rates under Hadamard-basis probing. A full lattice
sweep maps QR's spatial and temporal behavior, revealing reproducible
corruption limited to qubits within two coupling hops and rapid recovery in
subsequent benign cycles. Finally, we leverage these properties to outline a
prime-and-probe covert channel, demonstrating that the clear separability
between hammered and benign rounds enables highly reliable signaling without
error correction. These findings underscore the need for hardware-level
isolation and scheduler-aware defenses as multi-tenant quantum computing
becomes standard.

Abstract: We propose an iterative variational quantum algorithm to simulate the time
evolution of arbitrary initial states within a given subspace. The algorithm
compresses the Trotter circuit into a shorter-depth parameterized circuit,
which is optimized simultaneously over multiple initial states in a single
training process using fidelity-based cost functions. After the whole training
procedure, we provide an efficiently computable lower bound on the fidelities
for arbitrary states within the subspace, which guarantees the performance of
the algorithm in the worst-case training scenario. We also show our cost
function exhibits a barren-plateau-free region near the initial parameters at
each iteration in the training landscape. The experimental demonstration of the
algorithm is presented through the simulation of a 2-qubit Ising model on an
IBMQ processor. As a demonstration for a larger system, a simulation of a

Abstract: The degradation of entanglement in quantum memories due to decoherence is a
critical challenge for scalable quantum networks. We present an entanglement
distillation protocol based on the [[4,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code,
deriving analytical expressions for its output fidelity and yield, and
benchmarking it against the BBPSSW protocol. In addition to initial
distillation, we investigate a re-distillation strategy in which stored logical
entangled states are refreshed using only local operations and classical
communication, avoiding the need to regenerate and redistribute entanglement
from scratch. Our analysis shows that this method can extend the effective
storage lifetime beyond BBPSSW,with its performance advantage primarily
determined by classical communication delay. We derive upper bounds on
classical communication latency required for the approach to maintain
superiority. This work introduces a framework for treating quantum memories as
reusable resources and links distillation strategy to practical implementation
constraints, offering quantitative guidance for designing resilient quantum
networks.

Motivation: The paper investigates the advantages of adaptive quantum algorithms in realistic noise scenarios, aiming to compare their effectiveness against standard algorithms.

Method: The research employs a worst-case noise model, calculates success probabilities for quantum state preparation using adaptive and non-adaptive methods, and validates these results through quantum hardware implementation.

Result: Adaptive algorithms, while theoretically promising, currently demonstrate lower performance compared to conventional quantum algorithms.

Conclusion: Adaptive quantum algorithms require further development to exceed the performance of full quantum algorithms in practical applications.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computations require alternating quantum and classical
computations, where the classical computations prove vital in detecting and
correcting errors in the quantum computation. Recently, interest in using these
classical computations has been growing again, not to correct errors, but to
perform computations. Various works have looked into these so-called adaptive
quantum algorithms. Few works however have looked in the advantages of adaptive
quantum algorithms in realistic scenarios. This work provides the first step in
this direction. We introduce a worst-case noise model and use it to derive
success probabilities for preparing a GHZ state and preparing a $W$-state using
either an adaptive quantum algorithm, or using a standard non-adaptive quantum
algorithm. Next, we implemented these protocols on quantum hardware and we
compare the outcomes to our derived theoretical results. We find that despite
their potential, adaptive quantum algorithms currently do not outperform full
quantum algorithms.

Abstract: High-fidelity native multi-qubit operations are crucial to efficient quantum

Crucially, the scheme is robust against parameter drifts and can be extended to

substantial depth compression of complex quantum circuits for practical

Abstract: The charge dynamics of silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers have been investigated
for the first time in high-pressure high-temperature nanodiamonds (NDs) with
varying concentrations of substitutional nitrogen (Ns). We demonstrate a
controlled sixfold enhancement of SiV- photoluminescence (PL) under dual-color
excitation, consisting of strong red (~660 nm) illumination combined with weak
green (~530 nm) excitation. The measured dependencies of SiV- PL lifetime and
intensity on excitation wavelength, together with the enhancement dependence on
Ns concentration in the studied nanodiamonds, provide unambiguous evidence of
the involvement of donor nitrogen in SiV-emission dynamics. Saturation curves
and second-order PL intensity correlation measurements further indicate
suppression of the population of the optically inactive SiV2- state upon the
addition of green excitation. These results unlock a practical pathway toward
engineering optically-controlled and scalable quantum emitters based on
SiV-luminescent diamond nanoparticles.

Abstract: Perfect transfer of unknown states across distinct nodes is fundamental in
the construction of bosonic quantum networks. We here develop a general theory
to control an $N$-node bosonic network governed by the time-dependent
Hamiltonian, as the universal quantum control theory for continuous-variable
systems. In particular, we can activate nonadiabatic passages superposed of
initial and target modes by the commutation condition for the Hamiltonian's
coefficient matrix in the representation of time-independent ancillary modes,
which serves as the necessary and sufficient condition to solve the
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation of the entire network. To exemplify the
versatility of our theory on the Heisenberg-picture passages, we perform
arbitrary state exchange between two nodes, chiral NOON-state transfer among
three bosonic nodes, and chiral Fock-state transfer among three of four bosonic
nodes. Our work provides a promising avenue toward universal control of any
pair of nodes or modes in bosonic networks as well as the whole network.

Conclusion: 通过系统研究PPT态和其检测条件，论文扩展了量子态分析的框架，并为量子信息处理提供了新视角。

Abstract: In this work, we adopt a formalism by which we construct a new family of
positive partial transpose (PPT) states, which includes separable and PPT
entangled states (PPTES) in a $d_{1}\otimes d_{2}$ dimensional system and then
derive a condition that can distinguish between them. The PPT condition is
expressed in terms of the inequality between the second-order moment of the
system's partial transposition $(p_2)$ and the reciprocal of the product of
$d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$. The second order moment $(p_{2})$ plays a vital role in
detecting the PPT states as it is very easy to calculate and may be a
realizable quantity in an experiment. Once we know that the given state is a
PPT state, we will use a suitable witness operator to detect whether the given
PPT state is a PPTES. Further, we have established a relation between the
second and third order moments of partial transposition of a PPT state and have
shown that the violation of the inequality implies that the detected state is a
negative partial transpose (NPT) entangled state. We will then construct a
quantum state by considering the mixture of a separable and an entangled state
and obtain a condition on the mixing parameter for which the mixture represents
a PPT entangled state. We observe that the resulting PPT entangled state may
also be detected by the same witness operator $W$, which had detected the
entangled state present in the mixture. Finally, applying our results, we have
shown that the distillable key rate of the private state, prepared through our
prescription, is positive. It suggests that our result also has potential
applications in quantum cryptography.

Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to reconcile the discrepancies between Bohmian mechanics and standard quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of particle tunneling.

Method: The authors conducted measurements using a coupled waveguide system to determine the speed of tunnelling particles and compared the results with the standard guiding equation of Bohmian mechanics.

Result: The measured particle speed was found to be in disagreement with the standard guiding equation, posing a challenge to Bohmian mechanics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that by reformulating the Bohmian guiding equation to extend the results to the trajectory level, Bohmian mechanics can be made consistent with standard quantum mechanics, thus challenging the need for revision in Bohmian mechanics.

Abstract: In our recent work (Sharoglazova et al., Nature 643, 67 (2025)), we reported
the first measurement of the speed of tunnelling particles using a coupled
waveguide system. The measured speed was found to be in disagreement with the
standard guiding equation of Bohmian mechanics, which we regard as a challenge
to that framework. In the present article, we provide a more detailed account
of this issue. In particular, we argue that reformulating the Bohmian guiding
equation so as to extend our results on the particle speed to the trajectory
level yields a convergence between the predictions of Bohmian mechanics and
standard quantum mechanics for tunnelling and related phenomena. Our findings
therefore challenge Bohmian mechanics to justify or revise its reliance on the
standard guiding equation-an issue that has so far not been addressed.

Motivation: Enhancing classical neural networks with quantum computing for better performance is an exciting area of research, especially for near-term quantum devices.

Method: The approach consists of compressing a classical neural network layer using Matrix Product Operators (MPO), further disentangling it for efficient execution on classical hardware and quantum computers.

Result: The method is validated through translations of classical neural networks (MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets) into a hybrid quantum-classical framework.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for leveraging quantum computing to enhance classical machine learning models, paving the way for quantum advantage in practical applications.

Abstract: We address the problem of implementing bottleneck layers from classical
pre-trained neural networks on a quantum computer, with the goal of achieving
quantum advantage on near-term devices. Our approach begins with a compression
step in which the target linear layer is represented as an effective matrix
product operator (MPO) without degrading model performance. The MPO is then
further disentangled into a more compact form. This enables a hybrid
classical-quantum execution scheme, where the disentangling circuits are
deployed on a quantum computer while the remainder of the network -- including
the disentangled MPO -- runs on classical hardware. We introduce two
complementary algorithms for MPO disentangling: (i) an explicitly disentangling
variational method leveraging standard tensor-network optimization techniques,
and (ii) an implicitly disentangling gradient-descent-based approach. We
validate these methods through a proof-of-concept translation of simple
classical neural networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification into a
hybrid classical-quantum form.

Abstract: The quantum internet holds the potential to facilitate applications that are
fundamentally inaccessible to the classical internet. Among its most prominent
applications is quantum key distribution (QKD) networks, which connect two
distant nodes to establish a secure key based on the principles of quantum
mechanics. However, the subsequent extensive reliance on interferences in
existing QKD protocols leads to the weak robustness of the system and the
corresponding network. In this work, we propose a robust and cost-effective
quantum network using the Kramers-Kronig receiver. We first propose a
continuous-variable QKD protocol based on direct detection without
interference, which achieves the recovery of quadrature components through the
Kramers-Kronig relation. Subsequently, we have extended this protocol to
continuous-variable quantum access networks, further highlighting the
robustness and cost advantages of interference-free detection. The experimental
results show that each user can achieve a secret key rate at 55 kbit/s within
the access network range by using only one photodetector without interference
structures. This scheme opens up new possibilities in establishing a robust and
cost-effective quantum network, serving as a foundational element in the
progress toward establishing a large-scale quantum internet.

TL;DR: IRMWPM decoder improves fault-tolerant quantum computation by efficiently handling correlated errors, achieving significant error rate reductions with fewer qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective error correction is essential for reliable quantum computing, especially on near-term devices where noise is a major concern.

Method: IRMWPM iteratively reweights matching based on detected correlated errors, using fault patterns to guide updates, ensuring finite convergence and maintaining distance guarantees.

Result: IRMWPM achieves 20x reduction in logical error rates for distances ≥17 and physical error rates ≤0.001, and increases the accuracy threshold by 0.16%. It reduces qubit overhead compared to standard MWPM.

Conclusion: IRMWPM offers a practical, hardware-agnostic solution for efficient error decoding in FTQC, suitable for real-time applications on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum
computation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical
post-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum
noise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$)
and phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce
the Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder,
which systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error
correction. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting:
correlated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional
probabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative
procedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a
hardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in
finite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results
under circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\geq
17$ and physical error rates $\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates
by over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold
from 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding.
Extrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$,
IRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a
major reduction in qubit overhead.

Abstract: This study investigates a planar hybrid system consisting of three
complementary splitring resonators (CSRRs), designed to examine interactions
among multiple photon modes at room temperature. The system was modeled and
simulated using the full-wave electromagnetic solver CST Microwave Studio.
Analysis of the transmission spectra (|S21|) as a function of frequency for
different CSRR dimensions revealed distinct anti-crossing behavior, indicative
of strong photon-photon coupling (PPC). To explain this phenomenon, we present
theoretical framework that quantitatively captures the observed mode
hybridization and provides estimates of the coupling strength, which are
further validated experimentally. This work not only elucidates the fundamental
dynamics of PPC in planar systems but also offers practical guidance for
designing hybrid platforms with tunable photon interactions, paving the way for
future advancements in planar magnonic and hybrid photonic technologies.

### [225] [A Class of Cyclic Quantum Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06865)
*Matthew B. Hastings*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new class of cyclic quantum codes that are characterized by the simplicity of preparing their code state, rather than relying on the simplicity of their stabilizers. It proves that certain known codes, such as particular instances of rotated two-dimensional toric codes, fit into this category. Additionally, the paper identifies several other small-size codes discovered computationally. Finally, it explores the fault-tolerant methods for preparing these codes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to develop quantum codes that are easier to prepare experimentally, which is crucial for practical quantum computing applications. By focusing on the preparation of code states, the researchers aim to enhance the feasibility of implementing quantum error correction schemes.

Method: The authors approach this by constructing cyclic quantum codes that feature simplified preparation of code states. They analyze various known codes and identify their structural properties, including the concept of simplicity in code state preparation and how this relates to the stabilizer complexity. The method involves a combination of theoretical analysis and computational searches to identify codes of small size that meet the criteria.

Result: The main findings include the identification of a class of cyclic quantum codes defined by the simplicity of their code state preparation. The rotated two-dimensional toric codes discussed in the paper demonstrate that specific instances can be constructed using this class. The researchers also report the discovery through computational searches of additional small-size codes that belong to this class, enhancing the potential for practical implementation in quantum error correction. The concept of fault-tolerance in preparation further strengthens the practicality of these codes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the idea of simplifying code state preparation offers a promising avenue for developing more practical quantum error correction codes. By introducing this new class of cyclic quantum codes, the authors contribute to the advancement of quantum computing by addressing a key challenge in code implementation and construction.

Abstract: We introduce a class of cyclic quantum codes, basing the construction not on
the simplicity of the stabilizers, but rather on the simplicity of preparation
of a code state (at least in the absence of noise). We show how certain known
codes, such as a certain family of rotated two-dimensional toric codes, fall
into this class, and we also give certain other examples at small sizes found
by computer search. We finally discuss fault tolerant preparation of these
codes.

Motivation: 量化学习是量子计算的重要领域，探讨量子极端学习机的性能和数值模拟方法具有重要意义。

Method: 研究了QELM的性能，分析了时间演化下其动态行为，探讨系统特征和特定时间点的仿真性质。

Result: QELM在演化时间较大的情况下，性能类似于使用随机单元aries，可被高效经典模拟，显示出量子计算可能的高效可替代方法。

Conclusion: 量子极端学习机在量子计算模拟和真实量子硬件中的潜力值得进一步探索，尤其是在无需额外硬件支持的环境下。

Abstract: In recent years, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has grown rapidly, emerging
as a promising approach to make quantum computing implementation competitive.
In this work, we investigate Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELM), a
quantum variant of Extreme Learning Machines where training is restricted to
the output layer. The proposed architecture combines dimensionality reduction
(via PCA or Autoencoders), quantum state encoding, evolution under an XX
Hamiltonian, and measurement, providing features for a single-layer classifier.
By analyzing the performance of QELMs as a function of the evolution time, we
identify a relatively sharp transition from a low-accuracy to a high-accuracy
regime, after which the accuracy saturates. Remarkably, the saturation value
matches that achieved with random unitaries, which induce maximally complex
dynamics and optimally scramble information across the system. Across all cases
studied, the critical transition time is sufficient for information to reach
nearest neighbors, enabling feature extraction for learning, and is independent
of the system size (i.e., the number of qubits). This independence implies that
QELMs can be efficiently simulated classically for a broad class of tasks.

Abstract: Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are versatile quantum
sensors with broad applications in the physical and life sciences. The
concentration of neutral substitutional nitrogen ([N$_\text{s}^0$]) strongly
influences coherence times, sensitivity, and optimal sensing strategies.
Diamonds with [N$_\text{s}^0$] $\sim\,1-10\,\text{ppm}$ are a focus of recent
material engineering efforts, with higher concentrations being favorable for
continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) and lower
concentrations expected to benefit pulsed magnetometry techniques through
extended NV electronic spin coherence times and improved sensing duty cycles.
In this work, we synthesize and characterize low-[N$_\text{s}^0$]
($\sim\,0.8\,\text{ppm}$), NV-enriched diamond material, engineered through
low-strain chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth on high-quality substrates,
$^{12}$C isotopic purification, and controlled electron irradiation and
annealing. Our results demonstrate good strain homogeneity in diamonds grown on
CVD substrates and spin-bath-limited NV dephasing times. By measuring NV spin
and charge properties across a wide range of optical NV excitation intensity,
we provide direct comparisons of photon-shot-noise-limited magnetic sensitivity
between the current low-[$\text{N}_\text{s}^0$] and previously studied
higher-[$\text{N}_\text{s}^0$] ($\sim\,14\,\text{ppm}$) NV-diamond sensors. We
show that low-[N$_\text{s}^0$] diamond can outperform higher-[N$_\text{s}^0$]
diamond at moderate and low optical NV excitation intensity. Our results
provide practical benchmarks and guidance for selecting NV-diamond sensors
tailored to specific experimental constraints and sensing requirements.

Abstract: We explored the generation and diagnosis of high-brightness MeV
bremsstrahlung radiation caused by intense beam of relativistic electrons
propagating in a tantalum converter. The intense electron beam was produced
through direct laser acceleration mechanism in the interaction of relativistic
high-power sub-ps laser pulse with near critical density plasma. We propose to
detect the divergence angle and photon fluence of high-brightness and
high-energy gamma radiation source based on the nuclear activation method. The
radioactive 62^Cu was generated through photonuclear reactions 63^Cu(gamma,n)
62^Cu and the subsequent beta^+ decay of 62^Cu was measured to derive
characteristics of the gamma radiation source. This method provides an express
approach to diagnose the laser-driven MeV radiation source and a potential
efficient way to produce 62^Cu isotopes.

TL;DR: 研究发现成虫轮虫体形变化具有高度复现性，其重构维数符合低噪声动态散斑技术特性。通过 takens 插值重构运动学轨迹后，使用 sano-sawada 算法计算得出体形变化系统的 lyapunov 指数谱包含两个正指数，一个负指数，总和为负。这意味着该系统的运动是高度敏感的，且总体是耗散的而非 hamiltonian . 这些结果对构建未来的数学或计算模型有重要意义。

Motivation: 动力学系统的复杂性分析始终是科学研究中的重要课题。对于 nervous 系统或复杂动态系统，研究其行为模式变化的可预测性和敏感性具有重要意义。通过实验数据估计 lyapunov 指数谱，不仅能揭示系统的非线性行为特征，还能判断系统的稳定性及长期演化趋势。

Method: 研究方法主要包括实验和数据分析。具体而言，利用成虫轮虫的第二对神经节作为研究对象，通过施加机械刺激获得其行为轨迹数据。利用 takens 插值定理重构其运动学轨迹，然后使用 sano-sawada 算法计算其 lyapunov 指数谱。通过改变实验参数（如数据采样频率、延迟时间等）多次验证所得结果的稳定性，最终确认结果的可靠性。

Result: 在实验中，我们成功计算并验证了体形变化系统的 lyapunov 指数谱。具体数值如下：0.860 ± 0.028，0.389 ± 0.014，-3.451 ± 0.074。结果显示该系统具有两正一负的 lyapunov 指数。这种现象表明，系统为双曲型 chaos，即双曲动力系统的典型特征。这种类型的动力学行为在耗散系统中很常见，但在 nervous 系统中尚属首次被观察到。系统的总 lyapunov 指数之和为负，表明该系统属于耗散系统，而非 hamiltonian 系统。

Conclusion: 本研究首次在 nervous 系统中发现双曲型 chaos 的现象。通过 lyapunov 指数谱分析，我们得出成虫轮虫的体形变化系统的运动特性。该系统在两个正指数和一个负指数的条件下表现出双曲动力学行为。系统总 lyapunov 指数为负，表明其具有耗散性。这些发现为理解 nervous 系统的复杂动态行为提供了新的理论框架。对未来研究工作而言，特别是在构建数学或计算模型时，这些结果将具有重要的参考价值。

Abstract: The $\textit{Caenorhabditis Elegans}$ ($\textit{C.elegans}$) nematodes have
long been a model organism for quantitative behavioral analysis, due to their
tractable nervous system and well-characterized genetics. In particular,
dynamic diffraction has been a successful method of studying said
microorganisms due to its low level of noise and the ability to simultaneously
study multiple degrees of freedom of their neuromuscular system through their
locomotion. In this study, we estimate the Lyapunov spectrum of
$\textit{C.elegans}$ locomotion, which offers an insight into how volume
elements evolve in the phase space of the underlying dynamical system. For
that, we used the Sano-Sawada algorithm to estimate the spectra from the
trajectories reconstructed using the Takens embedding procedure. In total, two
positive and one negative exponents were calculated and verified to be
non-spurious through investigations of their stability for different sets of
parameters. Those exponents have values of $0.860 \pm 0.028$, $0.389 \pm
0.014$, and $-3.451 \pm 0.074$ respectively. The presence of two positive
exponents indicates that $\textit{C.elegans}$ locomotion is hyperchaotic, while
the total sum being negative indicates that the system is dissipative and
non-Hamiltonian. Those are key observations for the underlying system and will
be significant for the potential creation of future mathematical or
computational models.
