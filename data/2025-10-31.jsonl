This remarkable feat is attributed to the properties of the capsid\nsurface, which confer solubility within the NPC's phase-separated,\ncondensate-like barrier. In this context, we apply the classical framework of\nwetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and\ndiffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical\nunderpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key\nphenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from\nasymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid\npenetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to\nchanges in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous)\nrotational symmetry-breaking on energetics. These effects are all shown to\ndepend critically on capsid geometry, arguing for a physical basis for HIV's\ncharacteristic capsid shape."}

While the model\non the original tessellation has features reminiscent of the flat-space lattice\ncases, the generalized tessellations exhibit a far richer and more intricate\nstructure. The ground-state degeneracy and subsystem symmetries are generated\nrecursively layer-by-layer, through the inflation rule, but without a simple,\nuniform pattern. The fracton excitations follow exponential-in-distance and\nalgebraic-in-lattice-size growing patterns when moving outward, and depend\nsensitively to the tessellation geometry, differing qualitatively from both\ntype-I or type-II fracton model on flat lattices. Despite this increased\ncomplexity, the hallmark holographic features -- subregion duality via Rindler\nreconstruction, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for mutual information, and\neffective black hole entropy scaling with horizon area -- remain valid. These\nresults demonstrate that the holographic correspondence in fracton models\npersists in generic tessellations, and provide a natural platform to explore\nmore intricate subsystem symmetries and fracton physics."}

The method utilizes\ncounterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an\niterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward\nlow-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration\ncorrespond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By\naggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method\nreconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a\nscalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the\ntotal variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann\ndistribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random\ncouplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through\ntransfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass\nHamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that\nclassical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the\nstate-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to\nthree orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS,\ncorresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage.

Here we perform a non-perturbative circuit analysis in terms\nof dressed transmission-line modes for representative resonant coupling\ncircuits, going beyond the weak-coupling treatment. The strong frequency\ndependence of the resulting coupling coefficients implies that the Markov\napproximation commonly employed in cQED analysis is inadequate. By retaining\nthe full frequency dependence of the coupling, we arrive at a non-Markovian\nform of the quantum Langevin equation with the frequency-dependent\ncomplex-valued self-energy of the coupling in place of a single damping\nparameter. We also consistently generalize the input-output relations and\nunitarity conditions. Using the exact self-energies of elementary filter\nnetworks -- a series- and parallel-LC circuit and a simple representative\nbandpass filter consisting of their combination -- we calculate the generalized\nparametric gain factors.

The most\nintriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair\nformed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point\nout the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets,\ndubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\\nu=-2-x$, there is a\ntwo-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a\npaired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon,\nwhile additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to\nan intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative\nLuttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a\nrenormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal\nstate of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL\nphase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the\nsFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers.\nInterestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal\n$p_x$-pairing symmetry. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified\ntheory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap\nnematic superconductivity below it."}

Among them, embezzling catalysts stand out for achieving\nnear-perfect performance while tolerating only minimal disturbance, bridging\nthe gap between ideal and practical catalysis. Yet, this superior capability\ncomes at a cost: Each use slightly degrades the catalyst, leading to an\ninevitable accumulation of imperfection. This gradual decay defines their most\ndistinctive property -- reusability -- which, despite its fundamental\nimportance, remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish a quantitative\nframework to characterize the operational lifetime of embezzling catalysts,\nfocusing on their role in entanglement distillation and extending the analysis\nto quantum teleportation.
