While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS\ntwo-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact\npersists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large\nnumber of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and R\\'enyi entropies in\nordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a\nnecessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of\nblack holes.

Its principal limitation, however, is\nthat it yields only sheared phase-difference measurements rather than the\nabsolute phase, thereby requiring additional reconstruction step. In this work,\nwe introduce OSI-flex, a flexible, open-source computational framework for\nquantitative phase reconstruction from sheared phase-difference measurements.\nThe method leverages modern machine learning tools, namely automatic\ndifferentiation and the advanced ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer.\nThe method simultaneously estimates the phase and shear values, enabling it to\nadapt to experimental conditions where the shear cannot be precisely\ndetermined. Because defining shear value is inherently difficult in most\nsystems, yet crucial for effective phase reconstruction, this joint\noptimization leads to robust and reliable phase retrieval. OSI-flex is highly\nversatile, supporting arbitrary numbers, magnitudes, and orientations of shear\nvectors. While optimal reconstruction is achieved with two orthogonal shears,\nthe inclusion of regularization - specifically total variation minimization and\nsign constraint - enables OSI-flex to remain effective with nonorthogonal or\neven single-shear measurements. Moreover, OSI-flex accommodates a wide range of\nshear magnitudes, from subpixel (differential configuration) to several dozen\npixels (semi-total shear configuration).

The survival lifetimes of the ground and isomeric states of 94Ru44+\nwere measured to be s and s in the laboratory, respectively. Given that the\nground state of 94Ru44+ has a natural lifetime of approximately 75 min, its\nsurvival lifetime in the experimental setup was predominantly determined by the\nbeam-loss lifetime, including interactions with residual gas in the storage\nring and carbon foil of the detector.

The theory admits\na scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary\nscalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor\ntheory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the\nRicci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a\nradial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field\nequations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As\ncompared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution\ncontains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate,\nrespectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and\nobtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole\nat the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general\nrelativity (gravitational redshift, the E\\\"{o}tv\\\"{o}s parameter and the\nuniversality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion\nprecession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo\ndelay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole\nsolution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be\nfully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl\ngeometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic\ntests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution."}

The spin Hamiltonians of the\nelectron and hole hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins of lead and\nhalogen are derived. The hyperfine interaction of the halogen spins with charge\ncarriers is shown to be anisotropic and depending on the position of the\nhalogen nucleus in the cubic elementary cell. The quadrupole splitting is\nabsent for the lead spins, but plays an important role for the halogen spins\nand affects their dynamic polarization by charge carriers. The Overhauser\nfields of the dynamically polarized nuclei are calculated as functions of the\ntilting angle of an external magnetic field and compared with the\nexperimentally measured angular dependence of the Hanle effect. The comparison\nof the theoretical model with the experimental data reveals an enhanced spin\npolarization of the lead nuclei, whose mean spin exceeds several times the mean\nspins of localized electrons and holes. This unexpectedly strong spin\npolarization is explained by the interaction of the lead nuclei with excitons\nhaving a high degree of spin orientation due to their short lifetime after\nexcitation by circularly-polarized light. The dynamic polarization of the\nquadrupole-split halogen spins manifests itself via the magnetic field they\nproduce at the lead nuclei. This field maintains the magnetization of the lead\nnuclei at zero external magnetic field. The dynamics of the nuclear spin\npolarization is measured under optical pumping and in the dark, yielding a\nnuclear spin-lattice relaxation time on the order of 10 seconds."}

By\nidentifying and discarding faulty runs rather than correcting them, QED enables\nimproved reliability with significantly lower overhead. Applying QED to\narbitrary quantum circuits remains challenging, however, because of the need\nfor manual insertion of detection subcircuits, ancilla allocation, and\nhardware-specific mapping and scheduling.\n  We present QuantEM, a modular and extensible compiler designed to automate\nthe integration of QED codes into arbitrary quantum programs. Our compiler\nconsists of three key modules: (1) program analysis and transformation module\nto examine quantum programs in a QED-aware context and introduce checks and\nancilla qubits, (2) error detection code integration module to map augmented\ncircuits onto specific hardware backends, and (3) postprocessing and resource\nmanagement for measurement results postprocessing and resource-efficient\nestimation techniques. The compiler accepts a high-level quantum circuit, a\nchosen error detection code, and a target hardware topology and then produces\nan optimized and executable circuit. It can also automatically select an\nappropriate detection code for the user based on circuit structure and resource\nestimates. QuantEM currently supports Pauli check sandwiching and Iceberg codes\nand is designed to support future QED schemes and hardware targets. By\nautomating the complex QED compilation flow, this work reduces developer\nburden, enables fast code exploration, and ensures consistent and correct\napplication of detection logic across architectures."}

In this work, we explore a generalized\nmeasurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that\nvolume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet\nnon-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model\ncomprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where\ngeneralized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to\ndetector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law\nentanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the\nmain chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics.

Moreover, we show that measurements of\nnon-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement\ngeneration by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the\nstatistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the\napproach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady\nstates, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the\nmeasurement-only dynamics.

However, due to the\nunavoidable dark counts in single-photon detectors (SPDs), it has long been\nconstrained by the rapid increase of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) induced\nby empty signals at the receiver, which prevents it from extending to\narbitrarily long distances. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an\nempty-signal detection (ESD) strategy for quantum communication receivers,\nwhich integrates state preparation, controlled gates, and multi-copy analysis\ninto a single block. The core idea is to encode photon-existence information\nonto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) that is independent of the\nmessage-encoding DOF, allowing the receiver, through controlled gates on the\nauxiliary DOFs and subsequent measurements on the auxiliary copies, to verify\nthe non-emptiness of the received signal without disturbing the transmitted\nmessage. In this way, empty signals can be excluded from further communication\nprocessing, thereby resolving the QBER explosion problem caused by empty\nsignals. Moreover, the proposed design relies solely on practical, even\ncommercially available, devices, and can be realized under current\ntechnological conditions. Therefore, this study provides a framework for\nachieving arbitrarily long-distance quantum communication by allowing a lossy\nchannel to be asymptotically regarded as lossless in QBER estimations, and\noffers a proof-of-principle demonstration that secure quantum communications\ncan be extended to arbitrary distances under current technology."}

The model of non-local conductivity is developed on the basis of the\nKubo technique applied to the Dirac equation for pseudospins. As a result, the\neffective boundary conditions for the electromagnetic (EM) field on a CNT\nsurface are formulated. The dispersion relation for the eigenmodes of an\ninfinitely long CNT is obtained and analyzed. It is shown that due to\nnonlocality, a new type of eigenmodes are created that disappear in the local\nconductivity limit. These eigenmodes should be properly accounted for in the\ncorrect formulation of the CNT end conditions for the surface current, which\nare manifested in the EM-field scattering problem. Additional boundary\nconditions that consider nonlocality effects are also formulated based on the\nexact solution obtained for the surface current by means of using the\nWiener-Hopf (WH) technique for a semi-infinite CNT. The scattering pattern of\nthe EM-field is simulated by a finite-length model of a CNT, using a\nnumerically solved integral equation for the surface current density and its\napproximate analytical solution. Thus, the scattering field of a CNT prevailing\nin the wide frequency range from THz to infrared light is analytically solved\nand analyzed. The newly obtained results are then utilized for determining the\noptical forces exerted on a CNT of finite length. Potential applications for\nthe design of nanoantennas and other electronic devices, including pointing out\nsome future directions, are also discussed."}

While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS\ntwo-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact\npersists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large\nnumber of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and R\\'enyi entropies in\nordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a\nnecessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of\nblack holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement\nnegativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more\ngeneral non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative\ncontributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result\nfrom the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our\nanalysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in\nthe gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new\nsaddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue\ninstanton. Finally, we formulate a similar puzzle and its resolution using\nrandom tensor network techniques."}

Microwave pulses required to\nmanipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment,\nwhich unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate\nfidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by\nexperimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor\nfrequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal\nan electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the\nspin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of\nthe spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to\npinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that\nunfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal\nsusceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel\nout, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal\neffects.

The strength of the hybridization is driven by the Van Hove\nsingularity in the JDOS at the band gap: the stronger the singularity, the more\na photon is hybridized with the interband transitions. In order to increase the\nsingularity and thus the polariton hybridization without absorption, we propose\nto engineer a non-parabolic momentum dispersion of the bands around the gap in\norder to implement a high-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) in the JDOS.\nUltracold atoms in tunable optical lattices are an ideal platform to engineer\ntwo-dimensional gapped phases with non-trivial band dispersions at the gap.\nMoreover, the intrinsic non-interacting nature of polarized fermionic atoms\nprevents the emergence of sub-gap excitations, which are common in solid-state\nsystems and could otherwise spoil the absence of absorption below the gap.

The method proceeds by combining successive effective\nHamiltonian diagonalizations inspired by second-order Rayleigh-Schrodinger\nperturbation theory, with a Brillouin-Wigner correction applied to individually\noptimized states using an updated partitioning of the Hamiltonian. At each\nstep, a zeroth-order state is identified and progressively decoupled from the\nremaining higher-lying states, thereby enabling a well-conditioned\nBrillouin-Wigner expansion for the energy correction. In contrast to previous\napproaches, the method selectively targets a small number of low-lying states,\nsignificantly reducing the numerical overhead while maintaining spectroscopic\naccuracy. The robustness of the method is demonstrated on the LiH and H4\nmolecules, where accurate excitation energies are obtained for the lowest\nsinglet states using compact model spaces, confirming its potential for\nrealistic applications."}
