It can be computed by summing over the exchange of closed flux tubes winding around the thermal cycle. At short separations, the leading divergence is controlled by perturbation theory. Combining these two facts allows us to determine the asymptotic spectral density of string states contributing to the correlator. This sharply relates the weakly-coupled UV of the gauge theory to the dynamics of highly energetic flux tubes. Then, in a toy integrable setting, we explore how this can bound the scattering data of the Goldstone modes on top of a long string. We derive a bound on the asymptotic behavior of the reflection amplitude of Goldstones against the flux tube boundary sourced by the Polyakov line, and rule out an asymptotically linear phase shift for the S-matrix. Along the way, we discuss how causality can impose bounds on thermodynamic quantities, and show how the positivity of time delays follows from unitarity and analyticity of $2d$ massless elastic S-matrices. We include a review on reflection amplitudes, and their computation in the theory of long effective strings."}

These solutions are generically resonant, entailing both eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues, or, equivalently, both D-branes and negative-tension D-branes -- but are otherwise intricate to write down, having been previously addressed on a case-by-case approach. This work shows how there is a general and rather compact way to write down all these exact and fully nonperturbative transseries solutions in closed-form, immediately starting from the spectral geometry of the matrix model or string theory at hand, in the form of a discrete Fourier or Zak transform for their partition functions. This structure is inherently associated to the existence of anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes. The validity of these solutions is testable across all values of the parameters -- from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling, from small to large N; equivalently, from semi-classical to deeply quantum regimes -- and many such nonperturbative tests are performed against diverse examples ranging from matrix models to non-critical strings, fully validating our analytical and exact expressions. In particular, anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes are absolutely required to find sharp numerical matches. In order to study these solutions globally across their phase diagrams, however, complete non-linear Stokes data is still needed -- which will be addressed in a complementary follow-up paper."}

The filters feature ultra-wideband tunable center frequencies exceeding 400 GHz, ultra-low insertion loss, steep roll-off, and compact footprints, making them suitable for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave front-end applications. Using a set of design principles for multi-cavity high-order filters together with supporting nanofabrication techniques in a silicon nitride platform, the demonstrated filters achieve record-high figures of merit and advance the state of the art in integrated photonic filtering for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave systems. The resonator structures, which are the key building blocks enabling the reported performance, combine a large free spectral range of approximately 70 GHz with a high quality factor of 2.1 times ten to the power of seven. This performance is enabled by combining wide multimode waveguide segments with narrow single-mode regions connected through adiabatic tapers. To the best of our knowledge, the experimentally demonstrated bandwidth of 520 MHz, tuning range of one free spectral range, filter insertion loss of 2 dB, and out-of-band rejection ratios of up to 55 dB represent record performance metrics for integrated photonic filtering of radio-frequency, millimeter-wave, and terahertz signals."}

The average number of photons radiated by a charged particle passing through a plate made of this metamaterial is obtained. Given the positions of the transition radiation maxima in momentum space for different velocities of a charged particle, the method for reconstruction of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in metamaterials is proposed. Applying this method conversely, one can predict the radiation spectrum and polarization properties of transition radiation by means of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in the metamaterial known, for example, from the effective model. It is shown that the strong spatial dispersion alters qualitatively the properties of transition radiation from a charged particle traversing normally a plate made of the helical metamaterial along its symmetry axis in the paraxial regime, viz., there is a nonzero forward radiation in contrast to transition radiation in media without strong spatial dispersion. Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation and the anomalous Doppler effect in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion are described."}

Despite the tremendous progress enabled by technologies such as time-reversal propagation and wavefront shaping, the full control of transmission matrix remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a multi-scattering-based approach to design reflectionless complex media with a unitary transmission matrix of arbitrary structures. As such, the perfect transmission of waves through such a medium performs a unitary operation. Based on this principle, we experimentally demonstrated braiding of multiple waveguide modes in an acoustic waveguide via multiple scattering and showed non-Abelian characteristics arising from the concatenation of distinct complex media. Furthermore, we show that the principle can be extended for realizing arbitrary unitary operations beyond braiding. Our scheme uses generalized Wigner-Smith operators to design the optimal acoustic complex media with near-arbitrary targeted functionalities. The scheme is generally applicable beyond acoustics, with broad implications to other wave types. Our results demonstrate unprecedented control over multiple-scattering waves and are relevant to applications that require precise control over propagation, such as multiplexed communications, wave-based logic operations, and computations."}

We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties."}

It is proven that the unique set of eigenfunctions or preferred basis exists for any non-isolated sub-system. Applying the new eigenvalue equation to the relative motion of a hydrogen atom together with the derived relativistic Hamiltonian to quantify the impact of finite proton mass to the fine structure, correction to the fine structure is obtained as a result of the entanglement of the relative motion and the center-of-mass motion, which can be used to verify the correctness of the proposed eigenvalue equation. Applying the equation to the measurement of electron double-slit interference, it is analyzed that the photon packets with Lorentzian spectral lineshape, the domain and state density of the sub-system, and the energy of the incident electron together determines the spontaneous emission rate of the incident electron. Photons generated in this process excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the detector. Corresponding to any emitted or absorbed photon, the sub-system is found to be uniquely determined by maximizing the transition rate. This new principle is valid for atoms too. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the transition rates and example numerical results show good correlation between calculation and the position measurement experiment. The discovered common mechanisms that determine the sub-systems, the preferred bases, and transition rates form the foundation of a new, general, and consistent theory of quantum measurement."}

This enhancement is directly linked to the formation of subradiant collective modes.

The model predicts cluster positions and energies and provides a signal classification score, enabling a more flexible clustering strategy than the baseline trigger algorithm. Implemented on an FPGA and integrated into the Belle II trigger chain for synchronous operation, the system sustains the 8 MHz trigger throughput with an end-to-end latency of 3.168 $μ$s.

The energy resolution is comparable to the baseline trigger, while the position resolution for high-energy clusters improves by up to 18 percent in the central detector region. Cluster purity increases by up to 20 percent at low energies for isolated clusters, and cluster efficiency improves by up to 20 percent for overlapping clusters.

The analysis is carried out within the framework of the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach, which allows for a non-perturbative treatment of strong interspecies correlations while retaining analytical transparency. The BF interaction is modeled by a properly regularized attractive contact potential, enabling the exploration of both the attractive and repulsive energy branches. We determine the minimal BB repulsion required to ensure mechanical stability of the mixture by evaluating the inverse compressibility matrix over the full range of BF coupling strengths, within the domain of validity of the LOCV approximation. The interaction contribution to the energy is benchmarked against available experimental data and Quantum Monte Carlo results in the single-impurity limit, showing good agreement. Our analysis reveals how the critical BB coupling depends on interaction strength, density imbalance, and mass ratio. In particular, we find that mixtures with equal boson and fermion masses exhibit enhanced stability, requiring the smallest BB repulsion to prevent mechanical instability. In this case, a relatively small BB interaction is sufficient to stabilize attractive mixtures for all values of the BF interaction. These results provide a theoretical framework for assessing stability conditions in experimentally realizable two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions."}

The spacetimes considered are static, spherically symmetric, and nonsingular, and they include Bardeen-like, and Hayward-like regular black-hole limits as spacial cases. We characterize the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, and we compute key optical observables by determining the photon-sphere location and the corresponding shadow size as seen by distant observers, including controlled perturbative limits and full numerical solutions. Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters. On the quantum side, we develop the near-horizon reduction relevant for HBAR, showing that the dominant sector governing the detector response exhibits conformal behavior and leads to a thermal excitation spectrum governed by the horizon temperature. We formulate a Lindblad master-equation description of the radiation field, identify the thermal steady state, and derive an HBAR entropy-energy relation consistent with a Clausius-type first law. Finally, we establish a Wien-type displacement law for the HBAR spectrum, expressing the peak wavelength in terms of the horizon thermodynamics, thereby providing an additional observable link between nonlinear electrodynamics, regularity, and near-horizon quantum radiation."}

The critical theory represents a novel QED-Chern-Simons framework: a charged sector at a bosonic Laughlin-superfluid critical point is coupled, via emergent gauge fields and Chern-Simons mixing, to a neutral spinon Fermi surface. Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$. Gauge-mediated inelastic scattering removes the collisionless Drude singularity and produces a universal scaling function $Σ(ω/T)$ and finite DC conductivities $σ(0) \\approx 0.033 e^2/\\hbar$ ($ν=-1/2$) and $0.047 e^2/\\hbar$ ($ν=-3/4$).

Most existing approaches learn a direct map from molecular geometries, typically represented as graphs or encoded local environments, to molecular properties or use ML as a surrogate for electronic structure theory by targeting quantities such as Fock or density matrices expressed in an atomic orbital (AO) basis.\n  Inspired by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, in this work, we propose an operator-centered framework in which the external (nuclear) potential, expressed in an AO basis, serves as the model input. From this operator, we construct hierarchical, body-ordered representations of atomic configurations that closely mirror the principles underlying several popular atom-centered descriptors. At the same time, the matrix-valued nature of the external potential provides a natural connection to equivariant message-passing neural networks. In particular, we show that successive products of the external potential provide a scalable route to equivariant message passing and enable an efficient description of long-range effects. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to model molecular properties, such as energies and dipole moments, from the external potential, or learn effective operator-to-operator maps, including mappings to the Fock matrix and the reduced density matrix from which multiple molecular observables can be simultaneously derived."}

Using black-hole thermodynamics for static spherically symmetric horizons, we compare two implementations: (A) energy-independent background with local-frame MDR, and (B) energy-dependent rainbow metric.\n  When the same prescription is used for the deformation energy scale $E_\\star$, both approaches yield identical Hawking temperatures: \\begin{equation} T(E_\\star)=T_0\\,\\frac{g(E_\\star/E_{\\rm Pl})}{f(E_\\star/E_{\\rm Pl})}\\,,\\qquad T_0=\\frac{κ_0}{2π}\\,, \\end{equation} where $κ_0$ is the classical surface gravity.\n  This $g/f$ scaling holds for examples such as Amelino--Camelia-type MDRs (leading correction $\\propto E p^2/E_{\\rm Pl}$, giving $T(E_\\star)\\simeq T_0(1-\\fracη{2}E_\\star/E_{\\rm Pl})$ for $η>0$) and the Magueijo--Smolin invariant ($f=g$, so $T(E_\\star)=T_0$).\n  Further DSR effects on evaporation (thresholds, phase space, greybody factors, composition laws) are discussed.

Ba4Ir3O10 has a quasi-2D structure composed of buckled sheets, which constitute corner-connected Ir3O12 trimers containing three distorted face-sharing IrO6 octahedra. The Ir atoms are distributed over two symmetrically inequivalent sites: the center of the trimer (Ir1) and its two tips (Ir2). The Ir1 - Ir2 distance within the trimer is quite small and equals to 2.58 A at low temperature. As a result, the clear formation of bonding and antibonding states at the Ir1 site occurs. The large bonding-antibonding splitting stabilizes the dyz-orbital-dominant antibonding state of t2g holes and produces a wide energy gap at the Fermi level. However, the energy gap opens up only with taking into account strong Coulomb correlations at the Ir2 site. Therefore, we have quite a unique situation when the insulating state is driven by both the dimerization at the Ir1 site and Mott insulating behavior at the Ir2 one. We have investigated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Ir L3 edge. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum possesses several sharp features below 2.1 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir t2g levels. The excitation located from 2.1 to 4.6 eV is due to t2g to eg and O2p to t2g transitions. The wide structure situated at 6.2-12 eV appears due to charge transfer and O2p to eg transitions. We have also presented comprehensive theoretical calculations of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge."}

For twisted-pyramidalized ethylene, both SACIS and SAECIS qualitatively reproduce the correct conical intersection topology, in sharp contrast to conventional CIS and ECIS. Benchmark calculations on twelve MECXs demonstrate that both methods reproduce geometries with mean RMSDs below 0.1~Å relative to high-level reference methods. SACIS captures the essential degeneracy through variational orbital relaxation, which alleviates ground-state Hartree--Fock (HF) orbital bias and effectively incorporates static correlation through localization effects; notably, spin projection is found to be non-essential for the qualitative description of these intersections. Overall, SACIS and SAECIS provide qualitatively reliable CX descriptions at mean-field computational cost in a black-box manner. Given their comparable accuracy and the additional overhead associated with spin projection, SACIS offers a more favorable cost-performance balance for general applications, whereas SAECIS may become advantageous when higher excited states with significant double-excitation character are involved."}

Here, we investigate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the effective transition matrix and the scattering matrix of periodic metasurfaces within a parameter range where the metasurface sustains a BIC. Our analysis yields general and practically applicable conditions on the singular values and singular vectors that enable BIC formation. At the BIC eigenfrequency, the inverse of the largest singular value of both matrices vanishes, and the corresponding left (right) singular vector is orthogonal to outgoing (incoming) plane waves that propagate in the directions of open diffraction orders. Our SVD-based approach predicts the spectral position of the BIC and provides detailed information about its properties, including the expansion coefficients in the multipole and plane-wave bases, as well as its behavior under perturbations that transform the BIC into a quasi-BIC. The approach is numerically validated by considering both symmetry-protected and accidental BICs in arrays of scatterers supporting electromagnetic or acoustic multipole resonances.

This work extends previous studies, which have predominantly focused on models with either symmetric bounces or asymmetric bounces restricted to homogeneous dust configurations. Our analysis emphasises the phenomenological implications of the model through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, with particular attention to singularity resolution and the formation of trapped surfaces. As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase. No analogous critical mass restriction arises for the formation of the inner horizon in the post-bounce phase, highlighting a qualitative difference between the pre- and post-bounce dynamics."}

We report two consecutive electric-field-driven TPTs at half filling (nu = 1) in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moire heterobilayers. With increasing out-of-plane displacement field, a geometrically frustrated Mott insulator evolves into a ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) Mott insulator, i.e., a spin-polarized topological Mott insulator without an observable charge-gap closure, and subsequently into an antiferromagnetic, valley-coherent Mott insulator (VC-AFM) accompanied by a continuous charge-gap collapse and the emergence of a critical metallic state. Layer-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magneto-transport, and compressibility measurements jointly determine the phase diagram. The high-field evolution of the antiferromagnetic state reveals a metamagnetic-like transition at a critical field B*, above which a Chern insulating transport response reappears.

These observables allow for a quantitative characterization of the quantum correlations present in a top quark--antiquark system, thus enabling an interpretation of collider data in terms of quantum states and their properties. Discord is observed to be greater than zero with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations ($σ$). Evidence for steering is found with a significance of more than 3$σ$. This is the first evidence for steering, and the first observation of discord in a high-energy system. No Bell correlation is observed within the currently probed phase space, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These results experimentally corroborate the full hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quarks with discord being the most basic form of quantum correlation, followed by entanglement, steering and Bell correlation. The significance of nonzero magic, which is a complementary observable to the quantum-correlation hierarchy, is found to exceed 5$σ$ in several regions of phase space."}

In this work, we systematically investigate training strategies for shallow ensembles to balance calibration performance with computational cost. We first demonstrate that explicit optimization of a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss improves calibration with respect to approaches based on ensembles of randomly initialized models, or on a last-layer Laplace approximation. However, models trained solely on energy objectives yield miscalibrated force estimates. We show that explicitly modeling force uncertainties via an NLL objective is essential for reliable calibration, though it typically incurs a significant computational overhead. To address this, we validate an efficient protocol: full-model fine-tuning of a shallow ensemble originally trained with a probabilistic energy loss, or one sampled from the Laplace posterior. This approach results in negligible reduction in calibration quality compared to training from scratch, while reducing training time by up to 96%. We evaluate this protocol across a diverse range of materials, including amorphous carbon, ionic liquids (BMIM), liquid water (H$_2$O), barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$), and a model tetrapeptide (Ac-Ala3-NHMe), establishing practical guidelines for reliable uncertainty quantification in atomistic machine learning."}

However, the practical deployment of inverse-designed PICs is bottlenecked by manufacturability: their irregular, subwavelength geometries are highly sensitive to fabrication variations, leading to large performance degradation, low yield, and a persistent gap between simulated optimality and fabricated performance. Unlike electronics, photonics lacks a systematic, flexible mask optimization flow. Fabrication deviations in photonic components cause large optical response drift and compounding error in cascaded circuits, while calibrating fabrication models remains costly and expertise-heavy, often requiring repeated fabrication cycles that are inaccessible to most designers. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRISM, a photonics-informed inverse lithography workflow that makes photonic mask optimization data-efficient, reliable, and optics-informed. PRISM (i) synthesizes compact, informative calibration patterns to minimize required fabrication data, (ii) trains a physics-grounded differentiable fabrication model, enabling gradient-based optimization, and (iii) performs photonics-informed inverse mask optimization that prioritizes performance-critical features beyond geometry matching. Across multiple inverse-designed components with both electron-beam lithography and deep ultra-violet photolithography processes, PRISM significantly boosts post-fabrication performance and yield while reducing calibration area and turnaround time, enabling and democratizing manufacturable and high-yield inverse-designed photonic hardware at scale."}

Previously reported eOFD-based synthesizers generally have limited tunability due to feedback stabilization requirements. Here we demonstrate a feed-forward eOFD architecture in which the frequency tunability of a microwave source is preserved while optical spectral purity is divided through feed-forward cancellation, without any downstream electronic frequency synthesis. By canceling the phase noise of the microwave source without feedback, this eOFD approach removes loop bandwidth and source noise constraints observed in prior eOFD architectures. We achieve octave-spanning tunability, including the entire X-band, with phase noise below -140 dBc/Hz at kilohertz offsets and a high-frequency noise floor between -155 dBc/Hz and -145 dBc/Hz for carrier frequencies from 8 to 16 GHz. This performance corresponds to single-femtosecond integrated timing jitter, enabling, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of coherent, optically referenced microwave synthesis under wide tuning with this level of spectral purity."}

In the compound Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, the main electronic bands closely resemble those of pristine 2H-TaS$_2$, with no clear signs of band folding. However, a shallow electron pocket, referred to as the $β$-feature, was detected at the Fermi level near the corner of the superlattice Brillouin zone. The surface vs bulk origin of this feature is debated, as it cannot be reproduced using standard DFT calculations. To resolve this, we employed cluster perturbation theory (CPT) to incorporating an exact treatment of strong electron correlations (U) on the cobalt sites, going beyond DFT+U approximation. To further substantiate this, we studied an underdoped sample, Co$_{0.22}$TaS$_2$, where a reduced charge transfer leads to different Co orbital character near the Fermi level. We find that its electronic structure closely resembles that of undoped 2H-TaS$_2$, and crucially, lacks the $β$-feature. Our results demonstrate that the $β$-feature is of the bulk origin emerging from the strong electronic correlations where both the Co charge state and long-range crystallographic order play an important role. This work highlights the need for accurate treatment of electron correlations when studying intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides."}

In particular, we identify an SRE correlation length -- distinct from the standard correlation length -- which diverges at continuous phase transitions and governs the spatial response of the SRE to local perturbations. We derive exact SRE expressions for the bond dimension $χ=2$ MPS ''skeleton'' of the cluster-Ising model, and we numerically probe its universal scaling along the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ critical lines in the phase diagram.

Suspended TMD monolayers provide an effective route to minimizing substrate-induced disorder. Here we demonstrate the spatially uniform excitonic spectrum from high-quality WSe2 suspended monolayers fabricated by gold-assisted exfoliation directly onto an Au contact electrode of a gate-tunable device.

Ovcharenko and J. Podolsky, Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 064076]. We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\\mathrm{AdS}_2\\times\\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $Φ_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work.

In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states. These states are biphoton frequency combs, an example of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. Inspired by GKP codes, our protocol involves discretizing the continuous time and frequency degrees of freedom and encoding information by time-frequency displacements. This approach leverages the inherently large Hilbert space found in quantum frequency combs, with resilience against both temporal and spectral errors. In addition to describing the theoretical structure of the protocol, we propose an experimental implementation using standard telecommunication components, time-resolving single-photon detectors and a frequency beamsplitter. We also analyze the effect of experimental noise and errors on the channel capacity of the protocol. We demonstrate that for realistic experimental parameters, contemporary technologies satisfy the prerequisites for superdense coding with biphoton frequency combs, achieving a transmission rate of approximately 8.91 bits per transmitted photon (equivalent to 481 distinguishable messages with asymptotically vanishing errors). This more than doubles the previously highest transmission rate of 4 bits achieved by the Kwiat-Weinfurter scheme, while also having competitive optical loss. Furthermore, our results beat the rate achievable using a single-photon frequency comb with identical parameters by 4.6 times. Our protocol thus represents an experimentally feasible application of time-frequency grid states to entanglement-assisted communication, contributing to the active fields of continuous-variable and high-dimensional quantum information."}

Here we explore the variational formulation of classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity as initial value problem by constructing its Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley (SKG) action, including a careful treatment of boundary terms. The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms. The SKG approach to gravity offers a novel and complementary avenue to solve for the metric of spacetime directly from the action, bypassing the governing equations."}

In generalized LPFET (gLPFET), the embedding clusters are designed from a full-size gKS system where the (in-principle non-local) Hartree-Fock exchange potential is combined with a local (in the localized orbital representation) correlation potential. The latter is optimized self-consistently such that gKS and local embedding cluster's densities match. Unlike in DMET, which uses the same (global) chemical potential value in all clusters, each embedded orbital has its own chemical potential in gLPFET. We show analytically that, when electron correlation is strongly local, the latter potential becomes a simple functional of the correlation potential.

This establishes that a structural phase transition can be detected via a high-resolution measurement of the photoemission threshold. The melting temperature of nanoparticles with diameters of 7-9 nm is reduced by nearly 100 K relative to the bulk value.

These conditions restrict the curvature in such a way that the spacetime becomes conformally flat and belongs to the family of embedding class-I solutions. Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously. As these two geometric constraints alone are sufficient to determine the background spacetime uniquely, Karmarkar's condition might not be a suitable method for the development of realistic stellar models in a conformally flat spacetime unless one invokes other factors into consideration such as time-dependent metric potentials."}

We show that tuning the breathing asymmetry stabilizes extended quantum analogues of both rank-1 and rank-2 $U(1)$ Coulomb liquids within a single microscopic model, directly distinguished by their characteristic pinch-point morphologies in momentum space. This provides the first controlled quantum realization in three dimensions where gauge theories of different rank emerge within a single microscopic spin Hamiltonian.

Here, we show that an extended cluster-Ising model, despite belonging to the above category, exhibits super-extensive charging power over wide ranges of system sizes, reaching up to a thousand spins, in proper parameter regimes. This remarkable anomalous scaling is due to a corresponding super-extensive growth of the stored energy, implying that it occurs at large but finite size and cannot persist in the thermodynamic limit.

For any such symmetry group $G$, we construct explicit protocols composed of $G$-symmetric circuits and measurements with feedforward that transform symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states into the trivial phase and vice versa using a finite number of measurement rounds determined by the nilpotency class of $G$. Although these transformations are approximate, we prove that their success probability converges to unity in the thermodynamic limit, establishing asymptotically deterministic equivalence. Consequently, all SPT phases protected by finite nilpotent groups collapse to a single phase once symmetric measurements and feedforward are allowed. We further show that the same holds for non-normal MPS with long-range correlations, including GHZ-type states. The central technical ingredient is a hierarchical structure of irreducible representations of nilpotent groups, which enables a recursive reduction of non-abelian components to abelian ones.

Unlike two-photon interference, which requires only one parameter to quantify path-asymmetry, two independent parameters are needed in three-photon interference. This results in a broader class of nonclassical three-photon effects, including three-photon HOM-type effects. Our work provides the theoretical basis for existing and future three-photon interference experiments exploring the rich and complex quantum correlations associated with three-particle entanglement and potentially enabling the development of novel protocols for harnessing those correlations."}

We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $ζ$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations."}

As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase. No analogous critical mass restriction arises for the formation of the inner horizon in the post-bounce phase, highlighting a qualitative difference between the pre- and post-bounce dynamics."}

The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms.

In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $γ$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordström spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\\mathcal{M},g_{μν})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordström and Vaidya regions. Across $\\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{μν}\\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition."}

Our results demonstrate that both the charging energy and ergotropy of the quantum batteries can be significantly enhanced within the ultra-strong coupling regime and across a broader temperature range in transient time. A unidirectional energy flow is achieved by controlling the system's initial state through its two-mode squeezed ground state. Furthermore, we show that the steady-state stored energy, along with its corresponding ergotropy, can be enhanced at larger temperatures and stronger coupling strengths. Notably, a purely beam-splitter or two-mode squeezing interaction yields zero ergotropy. These findings indicate that the enhanced stored energy and ergotropy of the quantum battery arises principally from the combined effects of beam-splitter and parametric amplification (squeezing) couplings. In addition, the presence of the squared electromagnetic vector potential term can prevent a phase transition and achieve a significant charging energy and high ergotropy in the deep-strong coupling regime.

We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $ζ$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations."}

The explicit form of the double elementary braiding matrices (DEBMs) in these models are derived from the F-matrices and R-symbols obtained via the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2). Using these EBMs, standard single-qubit gates are synthesized up to a global phase by a Genetic Algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev Algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), achieving the accuracy required for fault-tolerant quantum computation with only 2-level decomposition. For two-qubit entangling gates, Genetic Algorithm (GA) yields braidwords of 30 braiding operations that approximate the local equivalence class [CNOT]. Theoretically, we demonstrate that performing double-braiding in a three-anyon (six-anyon) encoding of single-qubit (two-qubit) is topologically equivalent to a protocol requiring the physical manipulation of only one (three) anyons to execute arbitrary braids. Our numerical results provide strong evidence that double-braiding in SU(2)k anyons models is capable of universal quantum computation.

A key finding is that continuous coupling, unlike discrete coupling at finite points, breaks the constant phase difference condition, thereby weakening the interference effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. In addition, a key technical advantage of the SSE approach is that auto- and cross-correlation functions can directly reflect the complex photon emission/absorption processes and time-delay effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. Moreover, the SSE approach also naturally handles multiple excitations, without increasing equation complexity as the number of excitations grows. This feature enables the investigation of multi-excitation initial states of the waveguide, such as thermal and squeezed initial states. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to waveguide, particularly for continuous coupling and multi-excitation systems."}

To be specific, we derive the dynamical equations of an optomechanical system and demonstrate that the non-linearity (cause of chaos) in the equations arises entirely from the time-domain convolutions (TDCs) induced by non-Markovian corrections. Under Markovian conditions, these TDCs are reduced into constants, thereby losing the nonlinearity and ultimately leading to the disappearance of chaos. Furthermore, we also observe chaos generation in the absence of optomechanical couplings, which further confirms that the non-Markovian effect is the sole inducement of chaos and the environmental parameters play important roles in the generation of chaos. We hope these results may open a new direction to investigate chaotic dynamics purely caused by non-Markovian environments."}

The mechanism of the environment induced cat state transfer is analyzed both analytically and numerically to demonstrate that the transfer is a unique phenomenon in non-Markovian regime. From this example, the non-Markovian environment is shown to be qualitatively different from the Markovian environment reflected by the finite versus zero residue coherence. Besides, we also show the influence of environmental parameters are crucial for the transfer.

Our results reveal striking differences between state exclusion and the more familiar task of state discrimination. In particular, we show that LOCC antidistinguishability of multipartite product states is symmetric with respect to the initiating party but this symmetry breaks down for higher-order $x$-antidistinguishability. Most notably, we establish a manifestation of \\emph{nonlocality without entanglement} in the context of state exclusion: we prove that three bipartite product states can be globally antidistinguishable while failing to be LOCC antidistinguishable, demonstrating that three is the minimal number of states required for this phenomenon. We further extend this separation to $2$-antidistinguishability and present example exhibiting the same type of nonlocality.

Here, we show that an extended cluster-Ising model, despite belonging to the above category, exhibits super-extensive charging power over wide ranges of system sizes, reaching up to a thousand spins, in proper parameter regimes. This remarkable anomalous scaling is due to a corresponding super-extensive growth of the stored energy, implying that it occurs at large but finite size and cannot persist in the thermodynamic limit.

We show that although a generalized two-alternative three-photon interference setup based on CPDC or TOPDC involves eight different length parameters, the interference can be fully characterized in terms of only three independent parameters.

In particular, the role of the self-generated magnetic field arising from electron motion and the feasibility of coherent spin control without disrupting diffraction coherence have not been quantitatively investigated. In this article, a self-consistent Maxwell-Pauli framework is developed to study spin-resolved electron diffraction from nanogratings in the presence of magnetic fields. The model incorporates geometric confinement, image-charge interactions, self-generated magnetostatic fields, and externally applied magnetic fields. Numerical simulations show that the intrinsic magnetic self-field produced by the electron probability current is several orders of magnitude too weak to induce measurable spin mixing, demonstrating that nanogratings act as spin-conserving beam splitters under field-free conditions. When a uniform magnetic field is applied upstream of the nanograting, coherent Larmor precession enables controlled spin rotation without modifying the diffraction geometry or degrading coherence. The magnetic field required for a $π$ spin rotation scales inversely with the interaction length and electron de Broglie wavelength $λ_{dB}$. Furthermore, a downstream nonuniform magnetic field applied after the nanograting imparts a spatially varying Zeeman phase, producing opposite transverse momentum shifts for the two spin components. The spin-dependent transverse dynamics is analyzed using Husimi Q-function phase-space maps, which visualize spin-dependent population redistribution and momentum separation.

However, successful networked entanglement swapping relies on generating indistinguishable pairs of photons and preserving them over deployed fibers. This has limited most previous demonstrations to laboratory settings or relied on sophisticated methods to maintain the necessary indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a scalable entanglement swapping experiment using naturally indistinguishable entanglement sources based on warm atomic vapor cells. Without sharing lasers or optical frequency references between nodes, nor the need for pulsing the sources, we achieve a swapping rate of nearly 500 pairs/s while maintaining the CHSH parameter above 2. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by maintaining the quality of the entanglement swapping on 17.6-km of deployed fibers in NYC, relying on commercially available SPADs at the spoke nodes, SNSPDs at the hub and standard time-synchronization techniques. Our work paves the way for the practical deployment of large-scale hub-and-spoke quantum networks within cities and data centers."}

In photonic architectures, considerable energy overheads stem from using lasers, whose high coherence was long considered indispensable for quantum state preparation. Here, we demonstrate that natural, incoherent sunlight can successfully produce quantum-entangled states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We detect polarization-entangled photon pairs with a concurrence of $0.905\\pm0.053$ and a Bell state fidelity of $0.939\\pm0.027$. Importantly, the system violates Bell's inequality with $S=2.5408\\pm0.2171$, exceeding the classical threshold of 2, while maintaining generation rates comparable to laser-based setups. These findings pave the way for sustainable quantum applications in resource-limited environments like interplanetary missions."}

This work demonstrates how an LSTM-FC meta-initialization module can extend the practical reach of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) in both chemistry and physics domains. In the chemical regime, the framework predicts ground-state energies of molecular Hamiltonians derived from PySCF, achieving near FCI accuracy while maintaining favorable O(N^2) scaling with molecular size. In the physical counterpart, we applied the same model to quantized Simple Harmonic Motion systems (SHM), successfully reproducing its ground and excited states through VQE and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) methods. Benchmark results on NVIDIA GPUs reveal significant speedups over CPU-based implementations, validating CUDAQ's capability to handle large-scale variational workloads efficiently. Overall, this study establishes VQE-LSTM as a viable and scalable approach for GPU accelerated quantum simulation, bridging quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics through a unified, meta-learned initialization strategy."}

Based on a field theoretical approach we reanalyse the issue within a Redfield description. We find that the Redfield approach in accordance with \\cite{Guarnieri18} yields steady state coherences but violating the properties of a quantum map also gives rise to negative populations. The issue is resolved by applying the Lindblad equation which is in accordance with a proper quantum map. The Lindblad equation, however, also implies the absence of steady state coherence. We conclude that steady state coherence in a a qubit is incompatible with a quantum map."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "In this paper, we provide a complete mathematical theory for the entanglement of mixtures of Dicke states. These quantum states form an important subclass of bosonic states arising in the study of indistinguishable particles. We introduce a tensor-based parametrization where the diagonal entries of these states are encoded as a symmetric tensor, enabling a direct translation between entanglement properties and well-studied convex cones of tensors. Our results bridge multipartite entanglement theory with semialgebraic geometry and the theory of completely positive and copositive tensors. This dictionary maps separability to completely positive tensors, the PPT property to moment tensors, entanglement witnesses to copositive tensors, and decomposable witnesses to sum of squares tensors. Using this framework, we construct explicit PPT entangled states in three or more qutrits. In this class of states, we establish that PPT entanglement exists for all multipartite systems with three qutrits or more, disproving a recent conjecture in [J. Math. Phys. 66, 022203 (2025)]. We also show that, for mixtures of Dicke states, the PPT condition with respect to the most balanced bipartition implies PPT with respect to any other bipartition. We further connect bosonic extendibility of mixtures of Dicke states to the duals of known hierarchies for non-negative polynomials, such as the ones by Reznick and Polya. We thus provide semidefinite programming relaxations for separability and entanglement testing in the Dicke subspace."}

It provides a user-friendly interface for constructing, evolving, and analyzing quantum states and operators, facilitating studies in quantum physics and quantum information with waveguide QED systems. This approach enables efficient, scalable simulations by focusing computational resources on the most relevant parts of the quantum system. Thus, one can study a wide range of complex dynamical interactions, including time-delayed feedback effects in the non-Markovian regime and deeply non-linear systems, at a highly reduced computational cost compared to full Hilbert space approaches, making it both practical and convenient to model a variety of open waveguide-QED systems (in Markovian and non-Markovian regimes), treating quantized atoms and quantized photons on an equal footing."}

We show that atoms arranged in chiral geometries can instead exhibit a strong collective chiroptical response mediated entirely by electric-dipole interactions. Using a coupled-dipole framework, we identify a regime of pronounced chiroptical response emerging at subwavelength interatomic separations, which can be tuned by the probe frequency. This enhancement is directly linked to the formation of subradiant collective modes. Our results establish a fundamental connection between geometric chirality and collective light-matter interactions, opening new pathways for engineering and exploiting chiral optical responses in atomic systems."}
