This regime includes moderately\nconductive materials--such as carbon-based composites, conductive polymers, and\ndoped dielectrics--that are increasingly used in real-world radio-frequency\napplications, including wearable electronics, electromagnetic interference\nshielding, and biomedical sensors.

However, for most\nresearchers, access to compute time on quantum hardware is limited. This\nnecessitates the need to build simulators that mimic the execution of quantum\ncircuits on noisy quantum hardware accurately and scalably.\n  In this work, we propose TUSQ - Tracking, Uncomputation, and Sampling for\nNoisy Quantum Simulation. To represent the stochastic noisy channels\naccurately, we average the output of multiple quantum circuits with fixed noisy\ngates sampled from the channels. However, this leads to a substantial increase\nin circuit overhead, which slows down the simulation. To eliminate this\noverhead, TUSQ uses two modules: the Error Characterization Module (ECM), and\nthe Tree-based Execution Module (TEM).\n  The ECM tracks the number of unique circuit executions needed to accurately\nrepresent the noise. That is, if initially we needed $n_{1}$ circuit\nexecutions, ECM reduces that number to $n_{2}$ by eliminating redundancies so\nthat $n_{2} < n_{1}$. This is followed by the TEM, which reuses computation\nacross these $n_{2}$ circuits. This computational reuse is facilitated by\nrepresenting all $n_{2}$ circuits as a tree. We sample the significant leaf\nnodes of this tree and prune the remaining ones. We traverse this tree using\ndepth-first search. We use uncomputation to perform rollback-recovery at\nseveral stages which reduces simulation time. We evaluate TUSQ for a total of\n186 benchmarks and report an average speedup of $52.5\\times$ and $12.53\\times$\nover Qiskit and CUDA-Q, which goes up to $7878.03\\times$ and $439.38\\times$\nrespectively.
