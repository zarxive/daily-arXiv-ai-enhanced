The analysis of ion transport in these systems forms the foundation for understanding more complex electrochemical systems that are becoming increasingly present in the broader societal energy infrastructure. From a pedagogical perspective, the ``balance sheets\" introduced in Chapter 4 of Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications by Alan J. Bard, Larry R. Faulkner and Henry S. White (hereafter referred to as BFW) provides a first-pass approach to analyze ion transport in electrochemical cells. However, the balance sheet approach lacks first-principles justifications from the underlying equations that describe the transport processes in electrochemical cells. In this work, we compare a first-principles approach via the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations to describe ion transport in electrochemical cells to that of the balance sheet approach. By re-working the examples presented in BFW, we illustrate that the balance sheet approach is only valid in limited scenarios. Furthermore, we show that the PNP equations provide a more physical route to analyze ion transport in electrochemical systems. We hope the approach outlined here will be adopted by electrochemical engineering researchers and instructors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Poisson-Nernst-Planck\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u6bd4\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5206\u6790\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u79bb\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Poisson-Nernst-Planck \u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u800c PNP \u65b9\u7a0b\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u91c7\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790"}}

Here, we introduce and implement a new XDM variant that uses a one-parameter damping function based on atomic numbers, recently proposed by Becke.

This study investigates the validity of the commutation relation between the variational operator and the time derivative, which is a geometric identity in holonomic manifolds but becomes problematic when dealing with velocity-dependent constraints. By analyzing the transposition rule, we define a formal relationship between the Chetaev variation and the total variation of the constraints. We show that the simultaneous requirement of kinematically admissible variations and the fulfillment of the Chetaev condition is generally incompatible with the standard commutation rule, unless a specific geometric condition - encoded through a skew-symmetric algebraic structure and the Lagrangian derivative of the constraints - is satisfied. Furthermore, this work extends the analysis to systems with multiple constraints introducing the concept of dynamic compensation. While Frobenius' Theorem provides a static criterion for integrability based on individual vector fields, our results suggest that dynamic consistency according to Chetaev's principle emerges as a collective phenomenon. We demonstrate that even when individual constraints are intrinsically non-integrable, their interactions can cancel out deviations from holonomy, maintaining global consistency. Notably, we show that for systems with high constraints this property is satisfied regardless of the constraints' form. These findings broaden the class of analyzable physical systems, suggesting that dynamic consistency is a resilient property that persists even in the absence of simple geometric integrability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states.

Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case.

Conventional hydrogen sensors often rely on catalytic materials and face limitations such as the need of oxygen purging when operated in fuel cell environments. Here, we report the discovery of a novel hydrogen-sensing mechanism based on organic molecules, without the use of catalytic metals. The sensor is based on a typical vertical stack geometry, containing $\\mathrm{Alq_3}$ as active organic material. Upon exposure to hydrogen, the device shows an increase in resistivity, yielding a reliable sensor signal that varies linearly with hydrogen concentration, temperature, and humidity, and exhibits a relative response of up to 3.5 % at 100 %vol hydrogen.

Using specific heat and free-energy analysis, we show that small-horizon configurations are locally thermodynamically stable but never globally favored.

Generally speaking however, higher order integrable mappings may have non-confined singularities and it is important to understand if, and how, deautonomisation should work for such mappings. In this paper we explore different deautonomisation scenarios on a series of carefully constructed higher order mappings, integrable as well as non-integrable, that possess non-confined singularities and we challenge some common assumptions regarding the co-dimensionality of the singular loci that might play a role in the deautonomisation process.

This review emphasizes link-relevant evaluation and reporting: realized gain referenced to a stated impedance plane, clearly stated bandwidth definitions (impedance and performance), and robustness to fabrication spread and platform/environmental loading. Two practical implementation routes are surveyed. The first uses resonant, tightly coupled arrays, including fully driven arrays and single-chain designs based on parasitic or reactively loaded elements. The second uses single-body radiators that enforce a targeted mixture of multipoles or resonant/characteristic modes with one or a few feeds, including symmetry-broken dielectric resonators and mixed electric--magnetic designs. Across RF, microwave, and optical regimes, the same penalties recur as superdirectivity is pushed: reduced radiation resistance, rapid impedance variation, narrow usable bandwidth, and strong sensitivity to small perturbations. Beyond geometric synthesis and multi-resonant stacking, the review highlights emerging levers that can shift these trade-offs in specific system contexts: low-loss materials and cryogenic operation to improve efficiency and frequency stability, and time-varying loading and matching (Floquet/parametric approaches) that can relax linear time-invariant bandwidth constraints, at the cost of added control complexity and spectral conversion.", "AI": {"tldr": "supergain antennas achieve narrow main beams through strong coupling and near-field energy storage rather than physical size. this review covers evaluation aspects, implementation methods, and trade-offs with examples in rf, microwave, and optical regimes. emerging technologies like low-loss materials and time-varying loading show potential to enhance performance.", "motivation": "there is a growing need to develop compact and highly directive antennas, particularly in applications requiring supergain performance, making this research relevant for both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.", "method": "the paper reviews two implementation approaches: resonant, tightly coupled arrays and single-body radiators with multi-resonant structures. it also discusses trade-offs and emerging technologies such as low-loss materials and time-varying loading.", "result": "the paper identifies key challenges such as reduced radiation resistance and narrow bandwidth, while highlighting innovative solutions in materials and operation methods.", "conclusion": "this review provides a comprehensive analysis of superdirective antennas, offering insights into their potential and limitations, with a focus on practical implementation and future research directions."}}

In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior.

Starting from a local Taylor expansion around the fixed point and the bifurcation parameter, we derive a reduced description that captures the convergence towards stationary state both at and near criticality. At the bifurcation point, three universal critical exponents are obtained, characterising the short-time behaviour, the asymptotic decay, and the crossover between these regimes. Away from criticality, a fourth exponent governing the relaxation time is identified.

Such behavior has been attributed to substantial bond-dependent Kitaev interactions in combination with single-ion anisotropy, placing Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ among honeycomb compounds of interest for unconventional magnetic phases. Motivated by these observations, we present a first-principles-based analysis of the magnetic interactions in Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$. By combining density-functional calculations with microscopic modeling, we extract the relevant exchange parameters and construct an effective spin model that quantitatively reproduces both the elastic neutron-scattering spectra and the magnetization curve. The model captures the experimentally observed zero-field zigzag magnetic order, and proposes a $\\textit{double-zigzag}$ state at intermediate magnetic fields, realizing the 1/3-magnetization plateau in a simpler way than suggested in previous works. Crucially, we show that the one-third magnetization plateau does not require Kitaev interactions; instead, it arises from the interplay of strong out-of-plane single-ion anisotropy and competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and antiferromagnetic third-neighbor ($J_3$) Heisenberg couplings.

In particular, harmonic response simulations of vibroacoustic fluid-structure coupled systems used to compute transfer functions from an input force to either structural acceleration or pressure in the heavy fluid domain are of high interest. To achieve this, the most common MOR techniques based on modal methods and Krylov subspace methods are compared for multi-material systems. To assess the feasibility and accuracy of these techniques for different system sizes, a scalable benchmark model of a water-filled Plexiglass cylinder is developed, with mesh sizes from 10,000 to 1,000,000 Degrees of Freedom (DOF). The quality of the models is assured by validation against experimental data. The geometry, model data, and experimental results are made available so that they can be used as a benchmark for further studies. For systems larger than 100,000 DOF, the investigated modal methods become impractical due to memory limitations, even on powerful workstations.

Poje"], "title": "Semiclassical Structure of the Advection--Diffusion Spectrum in Mixed Phase Spaces", "comment": null, "summary": "We examine the spectral structure of the two-dimensional advection-diffusion operator in flows with mixed phase space at very large Peclet number. Using Fourier discretization combined with symmetry reduction and Krylov-Arnoldi methods, we compute on the order of one hundred leading eigenpairs reliably in the asymptotic, weak-diffusion regime. While the principal eigenvalue is asymptotically diffusive and localized on the largest regular region, the broader spectrum exhibits a rich organization controlled by local Lagrangian phase-space geometry. In particular, exponential mixing in chaotic regions rapidly suppresses correlations, whereas algebraic mixing in integrable regions generates long-lived coherent structures that dominate the slow and intermediate parts of the spectrum. We identify three distinct classes of eigenmodes: advective modes associated with transport on invariant tori, diffusive modes and, within the duffusive branch, tunneling modes arising from weak coupling between dynamically separated regular regions. Drawing on a semiclassical analogy, we assign quantum-number-like labels to these families and predict the appearance, scaling, and ordering of their sub-spectra directly from the Hamiltonian phase-space structure. The coexistence of these families implies that no uniform control of the spectral gap exists across the full spectrum: although the slowest mode is diffusive, arbitrarily small gaps arise between competing families at higher mode numbers. As a result, finite-time advection-diffusion dynamics is generically governed by persistent modal competition rather than single-mode dominance, even at asymptotically large Peclet number.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6d41\u7387\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7f29\u51cf\u548cKrylov-Arnoldi\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u548c\u5bbd\u6269\u6563\u4e0b\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6d41\u7387\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u548cKrylov-Arnoldi\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6d41\u573a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u95f4\u9694\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7f29\u51cf\u548cKrylov-Arnoldi\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u4e3b\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6e10\u8fd1\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u6b63\u5219\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u66f4\u5bbd\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u533a\u57df\u8868\u660e\u5c40\u90e8\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9891\u8c31\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u6307\u6570\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u6df7\u6c8c\u533a\u57df\u8fc5\u901f\u6d88\u9664\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53d8\u73af\u9762\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8fd0\u8f93\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5f31\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6d41\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784 Liaqian\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0e\u60ef\u6027\u73af\u9762\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a00\u6709\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e3b\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6307\u6570\u4e0e\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6d41\u7387\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ade\u4e89\u6240\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5728\u67d0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5360\u4f18\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6d41\u7387\u7684\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u3002"}}

In the framework of SymTFT Mille-feuille, which captures the Lorentz-invariance breaking subsystem symmetries, these models are dual to foliated versions of Maxwell theory. We show first that the XY-plaquette model admits a $\u03b8$-term. Then, we show these condensation defects realize non-invertible self-duality symmetries at any value of the coupling. In the XYZ-cube model such symmetry is discrete. On the other hand, we find that the XY-plaquette has a non-invertible continuous $SO(2)$ symmetry, thus extending the results in the current literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Continuing with the unified implementation of non-relativistic and relativistic wave functions methods within the MetaWave platform (J. Phys. Chem. A. 2025, 129, 5170), we present here a unified MPI parallelization of the methods by abstracting ever computational step of a method as a dynamically-scheduled loop via ghost process, followed by a global reduction of local results from each node. The algorithmic abstraction enables the use of a single MPI template in various steps of different methods. Taking iCIPT2 [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021, 17, 949] as a showcase, the parallel efficiencies achieve 94% and 89% on 16 nodes (1024 cores) for the perturbation and whole calculations, respectively. Further combined with an improved algorithm for the matrix-vector product in the matrix diagonalization and an orbital-configuration-based semi-stochastic estimator for the perturbation correction, this renders large active space calculations possible, so as to obtain benchmarks for the automerization of cyclobutadiene, ground state energy of benzene and potential energy profile of ozone. It is also shown that the error of iCIPT2 follows a power law with respect to the number of configuration state functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd \u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f \u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MetaWave\u5e73\u53f0\u7684MPI\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86ghost\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u5f52\u7ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4ee5iCIPT2\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u8fbe\u523094%\u548c89%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u534a\u968f\u673a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u5408\u6210 cyclobutadiene\u3001\u82ef\u5206\u5b50\u6700\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ed\u6c27\u52bf\u80fd\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5747\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86iCIPT2\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u914d\u7f6e\u72b6\u6001\u51fd\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5206\u5b50\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u4e3a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u5e76\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e MPI \u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b65\u9aa4\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a ghost \u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u5f52\u7ea6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5229\u7528 ghost \u8fdb\u7a0b\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u90fd\u80fd\u540c\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5f52\u7ea6\u5c06\u5404\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u679c\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572816\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\uff081024\u4e2aCPU\u6838\u5fc3\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0ciCIPT2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6548\u7387\u8fbe\u523094%\u548c89%\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u534a\u968f\u673a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u5408\u6210 cyclobutadiene\uff0c\u82ef\u5206\u5b50\u6700\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ed\u6c27\u52bf\u80fd\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684MPI\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728iCIPT2\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Addressing this question requires a framework that treats fractionalization and crystallization on equal footing, especially in strong Landau-level mixing regime. Here, we introduce MagNet, a self-attention neural-network variational wavefunction designed for quantum systems in magnetic fields on the torus geometry.

Beginning with the explicit equations of motion of a massive particle in the regular spacetime, we achieve the equation of the particle sphere and thus the radius of the unstable timelike circular orbit. It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated.

However, a significant challenge remains in generating and distributing coherent light from a single on-chip source with high phase stability across multiple channels. Integrated lasers typically operate independently, and conventional splitters (e.g., multi-mode interferometers) do not guarantee the phase coherence required for advanced applications. Here, we report a purely geometric scheme for achieving massive equipartition of coherent light on a photonic chip by leveraging the geometric phases of a null space spanned by degenerate states with zero eigenvalue.

Transport measurements in lightly doped and oxygen-enriched LSCO reveal a strongly insulating normal state governed by variable-range hopping, accompanied by pronounced nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and, at low temperatures, current-induced negative differential resistance. With increasing carrier concentration, these features evolve into regimes characterized by granular and percolative superconductivity near the threshold of bulk superconductivity and, eventually, into a homogeneous strange-metal state close to optimal doping. Throughout this evolution, the transport response shows marked sensitivity to disorder, electronic inhomogeneity, and external control parameters, such as bias current and magnetic field. Rather than reflecting a sequence of sharply distinct phases, the observed transport regimes form a continuous crossover from a localization-dominated insulating state to granular superconductivity and further to a coherent metallic state. This crossover is driven primarily by the progressive enhancement of electronic screening, inter-region coupling, and superconducting connectivity, rather than by abrupt changes in the underlying microscopic scattering mechanisms. Taken together, the available transport data provide a coherent experimental basis for understanding how disorder and mesoscale electronic inhomogeneity organize charge transport and superconductivity across the LSCO phase diagram, underscoring the central role of percolation and nonequilibrium effects in underdoped cuprates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using exact diagonalization, we characterize the transition from weakly- to strongly-correlated dimer and tetramer states along the one- to two-dimensional crossover in coupled-chain geometries by combining local correlation signatures with global diagnostics such as the binding energy and interspecies entanglement entropy. We show that transverse connectivity between chains qualitatively reshapes the phase diagram, substantially enlarging the tetramer region and, in particular, stabilizing weakly bound tetramers when compared to the one-dimensional chains. By tuning the interchain hopping, we identify a transition from a degenerate manifold of spatially separated dimers to a localized tetramer ground state, driven by the lifting of one-dimensional configurational degeneracies and an associated kinetic-energy gain. Finally, we demonstrate interaction and geometric quench protocols to dynamically prepare these complexes with high fidelity.

For this subclass, we show that the punctures can be effectively characterised by two sets of integers: the $s$-labels and the $m$-labels. The $s$-labels, or ``Kac-type labels'', serve as the D-type analogues to the Kac labels used in A-type theories; we establish their correspondence with ``modified excess numbers'' in the associated 3d mirror theories (magnetic quivers). The $m$-labels are further introduced to streamline the mapping from 6d generalised quivers to their class $\\mathcal{S}$ descriptions. Furthermore, we analyse physical distinctions arising from 6d $\u03b8$ angles and explore the hierarchy of Higgs branch flows.

Unlike the BSM and the PBM, a recently proposed two-qubit joint measurement called the elegant joint measurement (EJM) exhibits novel tetrahedral symmetry in its single-qubit reduced states. In [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401], a parameterized two-qubit iso-entangled basis was proposed, with concurrence between 1/2 and 1, perfectly spanning the original EJM and conventional BSM. We present a two-qubit symmetric joint measurement having concurrence from 0 to 1/2, which is complementary to [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401] and contains the PBM and the original EJM. We investigate the symmetry of the current structure and its application in triangular networks. The results indicate that the reduction vectors of the current basis states exhibit rotational symmetry, rather than the aforementioned mirror symmetry; moreover, the output probability distributions of three parties in the network explicitly demonstrate the expected permutation symmetry.

The optical superlattice, with odd or even number of unit cells, can exhibit either a trivial or a non-trivial underlying topology, characterized by the corresponding Zak phase. We focus on a distinct localization mechanism in the intermediate harmonic trapping frequency regime. Specifically, the four lowest-lying eigenstates in this regime form an effective four-level system in the topologically non-trivial configuration. Larger trapping frequency values drive the system into a harmonic trap dominated regime, featuring classical pairing and localization of all states of the lower band, as in a usual optical lattice. For the lower trapping frequency regime, the fate of topological edge states is discussed. Our results are based on exact diagonalization and on a tight-binding approximation that maps the continuous to a discrete system.

However, its practical application is limited by the steep scaling of its non-terminating Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We introduce an active space UCCSD(4)/MP2 approach that leverages a fourth-order many-body perturbation theory truncation of UCCSD within a selected active space, while treating external excitations at the MP2 level. We explore two variants: a composite method that sums separate internal and external contributions and an interacting method that couples the amplitudes for greater accuracy. We test our approach on the GW100 dataset, a metaphosphate hydrolysis reaction, and the strongly correlated torsion of ethylene. Our results suggest that the interacting method with canonical orbitals is robust for weakly and moderately correlated systems and accurately reproduces the full UCCSD(4) potential energy curves using only 15-25% of the virtual orbitals in its active space. In comparison, the composite formulation exhibits greater sensitivity to the orbital basis and active space size, leading to less systematic behavior across the benchmark set. For ethylene torsion, a system dominated by strong static correlation, both composite and interacting formulations employing canonical orbitals closely track the full UCCSD(4) reference but do not alleviate the unphysical features inherited from the underlying single-reference UCCSD(4) description. This active space framework offers a tractable approach for modeling correlated molecules and reactions on classical computers and provides a viable path for scaling UCC calculations for resource-constrained quantum hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "Active space UCCSD(4)/MP2 with canonical orbitals can efficiently model weak to moderately correlated systems, like molecules and reactions, but fails for strongly correlated systems like ethylene torsion.", "motivation": "Understanding and improving UCC methods is crucial for accurate electronic structure calculations, especially for quantum applications.", "method": "The proposed approach uses UCCSD(4)/MP2 within an active space, with two variants: a composite method and an interacting method, employing either separate or coupled amplitudes.", "result": "The interacting method shows better performance with shortened active spaces, accurately replicating UCCSD(4) results, but both formulations struggle with strong static correlation, like in ethylene torsion.", "conclusion": "This framework provides an efficient method for classical computing but needs further adaptation for quantum hardware to handle strong correlations."}}

Metallic antiferromagnets with BTRS provide an ideal platform to study this effect through transport measurements, yet experimental demonstrations are limited. Van der Waals (vdW) nanomagnets, with their mechanical flexibility, are particularly promising for realizing large piezomagnetic responses and effective transport control. Here we demonstrate piezomagnetic control of electronic transport in nano-devices of the vdW antiferromagnets CoNb$_3$S$_6$ and CoTa$_3$S$_6$, archetypal vdW metals with BTRS that exhibit a spontaneous Hall effect. Applying uniaxial strain linearly modulates both the antiferromagnetic transition temperature and coercive field, consistent with strain-driven tuning of exchange coupling, key signatures of the piezomagnetic effect. Moreover, spontaneous Hall effect is controllable via strain, evidencing piezomagnetic tuning of Berry curvature and its associated geometric transport. These findings establish piezomagnetism as a powerful route to manipulate antiferromagnetic transport, opening avenues for straintronic and spintronic applications in vdW magnetic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Her Villas\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u5e94\u53d8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u78c1\u6027\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5982\u78c1\u5bfc\u7387\u3001\u5de8\u78c1\u7535\u963b\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u526a\u5207\u7535\u52bf\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e94\u53d8\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u78c1\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8c03\u63a7\u78c1\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u78c1\u6027\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u5668\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1aHer Villas\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5fae\u7eb3\u7535\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0cHer Villas\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u632f\u5149\u548c\u7535\u5149\u6548\u5e94\u7b49\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e94\u53d8\u5bf9Her Villas\u4e2d\u78c1\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u7eb5\u5411\u5e94\u53d8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7Her Villas\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u78c1\u5bfc\u7387\u3001\u5de8\u78c1\u7535\u963b\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u526a\u5207\u7535\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "Her Villas\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5176\u78c1\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u5e94\u53d8\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u78c1\u6027\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u5668\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Here, we demonstrate that optical topologies in the form of skyrmions are highly resilient to the effects of real-world atmospheric turbulence. We create and transmit these particle-like topologies of light through a 270~m free-space optical link, revealing their robustness across a wide variety of conditions and turbulence strengths. While we observe severe distortion in the states' underlying degrees of freedom, we show that the topological numbers are preserved in all cases. We account for fast changes to the medium, where the channel produces statistically averaged outcomes, by probing the state's decoherence, showing that while the degree of polarisation consequently decays, the topology remains intact. Using topology, we show information can be transmitted through the channel with almost perfect fidelity (>98%) in most cases, only decreasing to 86% in the most severe conditions tested.

Quntur was designed following three main strategies: i) elimination of hard-coded procedural policies in favour of reasoning-driven decisions, ii) construction of general and composable actions that facilitate generalization and efficiency, and iii) implementation of guided deep research to integrate abstract quantum-chemical reasoning across subdisciplines and a detailed understanding of the software's internal logic and syntax. Although instantiated in ORCA, these design principles are applicable to research agents more generally and easily expandable to additional quantum chemistry packages and beyond. Quntur supports the full range of calculations available in ORCA 6.0 and reasons over software documentation and scientific literature to plan, execute, adapt, and analyze in silico chemistry experiments following best practices.

Here, we report the optical detection of a v = -1/3 FQAH state in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Using photoluminescence (PL) and reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) techniques, we identify ferromagnetic states at filling factors v = -1, -2/3, and -1/3, all tunable by a vertical electric field.

By introducing the two field quadratures $X,Y$ of TEM (transverse electric-magnetic), but also of TM (transverse magnetic) and TE (transverse electric) traveling modes, we identify for each a characteristic one-dimensional scalar field (a generalized flux $\\varphi$) governed by a Klein-Gordon type equation. The associated Hamiltonian is derived explicitly from Maxwell's equations, allowing the construction of bosonic ladder operators. The generalized flux is directly deduced from the electromagnetic potentials $A,V$ by a proper gauge choice, generalizing Devoret's approach [2]. Our analysis unifies the treatment of cylindrical and Cartesian guided modes under a consistent and generic framework, ensuring both theoretical insight and experimental relevance.

Two DHM prototypes were developed; an initial lens-based system serving as the foundation for algorithm development, and experimental validation of the approach, achieving 89.6% classification accuracy on a 3-part differential, and a subsequent lensless system for simplified design and increased field-of-view (FoV). Both prototypes employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cell classification. With further optimizations, the lensless system achieved classification accuracies of 92.65% and 89.44% on the 3-part and 5-part differential, respectively. With the lensless system, the derivation of the monocyte distribution width (MDW), a biomarker for sepsis, was also demonstrated.\n  Additionally, pixel super-resolution and multi-wavelength DHM approaches were investigated to enhance the obtained cell information.

This study provides a comprehensive real- and momentum-space analysis of topological phases in two-dimensional d-wave altermagnets. By employing a tight-binding Hamiltonian, we characterize the topological phase transition occurring at a critical intra-sublattice hopping strength ($t_a^C$). We examine the emergence of Dirac nodal points and the resulting Berry curvature singularities, supported by a visual analysis of pseudospin texture winding. Crucially, we analize spin splitting, effective altermagnetic strength, and investigate the transport implications of these phases, uncovering giant conductivity anisotropy and spin-dependent \"steering\" effects driven by group velocity distribution across the Fermi surface. Beyond bulk properties, we analyze the edge state topology in ribbon geometries through the lens of information-theoretic markers like fidelity-susceptibility and inverse participation ratio, offering an alternative to traditional Chern number calculations. Our results demonstrate that the hybridization of edge states in ultra-narrow nanoribbons opens a controllable energy gap, a feature we exploit to propose a novel topological altermagnetic field-effect transistor design where ballistic and spatially spin-polarized transport can be electrostatically gated.

On the other hand, the entanglement of a system with its environment is closely related to the entropy of the system. However, does this imply that the entropy of systems with larger internal entanglement will grow stronger? We study the issue using the simplest model as an example: a system of qubits interacts with the environment described by the quantum harmonic oscillator. The answer to the posed question is ambiguous. However, the study of the situation on average (using the simulation of a set of random states) reveals certain patterns and we can say that the answer is affirmative.

However, several ultra stable laser systems observed additional noise sources that hinder the realization of the expected improvements in frequency stability. These additional noise sources are related to the birefringence of the coatings and its modification by intracavity light. The origin of the birefringence is not yet well understood and its modification via illumination remains unexplained. Here we present an extensive study on the steady-state and transient modification of the birefringence by intracavity light and by uniform illumination at various wavelengths using an optical cavity at room temperature. We find a unified description that suggests a primary two-photon process for photon energies below the bandgap of GaAs, or a single-photon process at higher energies. Adding external illumination allows to reduce noise induced by laser power fluctuations by balancing the photo-thermal-optic response of the mirrors and the photo-birefringent effect at a more favorable low intracavity power.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ad8\u6676GaAs/AlGaAs\u6d82\u5c42\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u6709\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u6fc0\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5e94\u7b54\u7279\u6027\u6709\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u578b\u5149\u6805\u5bf9\u6fc0\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u610f\u4e49\u91cd\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8154\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e94\u7b54\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5916\u7167\u5149\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u6fc0\u5149\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u548c\u77ac\u6001\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u6b67\u5149\u6805\u5bf9\u5149\u5f3a\u6ce2\u52a8\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6291\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u8154\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7b54\u7279\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6fc0\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Self-dual models for a vector field (${\\cal N}=0$) and for ${\\cal N}=1$ and ${\\cal N}=2$ vector supermultiplets are naturally formulated on general (super)gravity backgrounds. For all other (super)spin values, the corresponding self-dual systems are realised on arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds. Every $\\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant model is demonstrated to be self-dual with respect to a Legendre transformation. Methods are proposed to generate such self-dual models including superconformal ones. We show that every model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics admits a higher-spin extension.

In this work, we investigate the design and optimization of Space-Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs) using a hybrid quantum-classical approach. We formalize three key combinatorial optimization problems: the Satellite Selection Problem (SSP), the Gateway Selection Problem (GSP), and the Spectrum Assignment Problem (SAP), each capturing critical aspects of network deployment and operation. Leveraging neutral-atom quantum processors, we map the SSP onto a Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, embedding it onto the Aquila platform and solving it via the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAA). Postprocessing ensures feasible solutions that guide downstream GSP and SAP optimization. Benchmarking across 165 realistic remote regions shows that QAA solutions closely match classical exact solvers and outperform greedy heuristics, while subsequent GSP and SAP outcomes remain largely robust to differences in initial satellite selection. These results demonstrate that quantum optimization achieves performance broadly comparable to classical approaches for end-to-end STIN design, with rare instances where it can even surpass state-of-the-art solvers. This suggests that, while not yet consistently superior, quantum methods may offer competitive advantages for larger or more complex instances of the underlying combinatorial subproblems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u536b\u661f-\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u7edc'\u65e0\u7f1d\u5bf9\u63a5'\uff0c\u6548\u76ca\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5168\u7403\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5730\u9762\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u536b\u661f\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u67a2\u7ebd\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u914d\u3002\n\u4ed6\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u4e2d\u6027\u539f\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u536b\u661f\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Aquila\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7edd\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728165\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ecf\u5178\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u67a2\u7ebd\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u536b\u661f\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

First, we use a precision-manufactured random multi-focal lenslet (RML) phase mask to produce improved measurements with reduced multiplexing. Next, we implement a ConvNeXt-based reconstruction architecture, which provides up to 6.68 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio over state-of-the-art attention-based architectures. Finally, we establish a parallel imaging setup that simultaneously images a scene with RML, diffuser and lens systems, with which we collect datasets with 100,000 measurements for each system, to be used for reconstruction model training and evaluation. Using this standardized system, we quantify the improved measurement quality of the RML compared to a diffuser using the modulation transfer function and mutual information.

Here, we propose a platform that exploits the delocalised nature of a high-Q, non-local mode supported by a dielectric metasurface (a so-called bound-state-in-the-continuum or BIC) to induce superradiant behaviour within an extended two-dimensional array of distant quantum emitters. We show that these BIC-mediated emitter interactions can span several wavelengths, thus overcoming the traditional subwavelength separation between emitters required in free space.

We introduce a formal extension of the principle to such unitarily transformed thermal states. By defining an effective Hamiltonian, we rigorously establish a generalized Landauer inequality, which naturally reduces to the standard case for an ordinary thermal reservoir as a special instance. The framework further yields a consistent definition of entropy production and a proof of its non-negativity. We illustrate its utility by studying an arbitrarily moving Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a quantum field initially prepared in the STS. Using perturbation theory, we compute the entropy production explicitly, confirming its positivity. As a result of the symmetry breaking induced by the unitary transformation, it depends on both the proper time interval and the absolute spacetime position. Our work resolves the apparent violation of Landauer's principle with STSs. It also provides a robust tool for analyzing quantum thermodynamics in non-equilibrium and relativistic settings, with potential implications for quantum thermal machines and information protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6307\u51faLandauer\u539f\u7406\u5728\u7528\u53d7 squeezing \u53d8\u6362\u7684\u70ed\u6001\uff08STS\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8be5\u539f\u7406\u5230\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d7Unitary\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u70ed\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49Landauer\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u975e\u8d1f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u7684UdW\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728STS\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u673a\u5668\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "Landauer\u539f\u7406\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u7740\u6838\u5fc3\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u8fdd\u53cd\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e00\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u70ed\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53d7Unitary\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u70ed\u6001\uff08STS\uff09\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6709\u6548Hamiltonian\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e7f\u4e49Landauer\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6444\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u7684UdW\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728STS\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u975e\u8d1f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u53d7Unitary\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u70ed\u6001\uff08STS\uff09\uff0cLandauer\u539f\u7406\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u4fee\u6b63\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Landauer\u539f\u7406\u5728\u53d7Unitary\u53d8\u6362\u70ed\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u673a\u5668\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u534f\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

It is, however, widely recognized that this classical framework is inadequate for random phenomena involving quantum effects, and more generally for \\emph{quantum-like} situations. A broader formulation is provided by an algebraic viewpoint: one starts from an algebra of random variables equipped with a distinguished linear functional -- the \\emph{state} -- interpreted as expectation. In this sense, the approach can also be viewed as a modern reading of ideas already implicit in early probability (e.g., the Bernoullis), while its contemporary form has been developed and used extensively in quantum physics.\n  The algebraic framework accommodates both classical and quantum-like behaviours, yet it remains underused in classical probability and uncertainty quantification, where it can nevertheless open new perspectives and clarify structural features. Although the language carries a physics flavor, the subject is purely probabilistic. The key distinction between classical and quantum-like behaviour is \\emph{commutativity}: its failure produces the characteristic effects of quantum-like situations. The rise of quantum computing is a prominent setting in which such behaviour may become relevant even for practitioners in computational science. Here we focus on the purely algebraic core of the approach.

The theoretical modeling of these processes often applies an approximate phase-space expansion of the nonclassical driving field in terms of coherent states, which has been shown to accurately predict the harmonic spectrum. However, its accuracy for the computation of quantum optical observables like the degree of squeezing and photon statistics has not been thoroughly considered. In this work, we introduce this approximative phase-space description and discuss its accuracy, and we find that it mischaracterizes the quantum optical properties of the driving laser by making it an incoherent mixture of classical states. We further show that this error in the driving field description maps onto the light emitted from HHG, as neither sub-Poissonian photon statistics nor quadrature squeezing below vacuum fluctuations can be captured by the approximative phase-space description. Lastly, to benchmark the approximative phase-space description, we consider the quantum HHG from a one-band model, which yields an exact analytical solution. Using the approximative phase-space representation with this specific model, we find a small quantitative error in the quadrature variance of the emitted field that scales with pulse duration and emitter density.

In particular, while the infinite sum over multipolar number l converges in the black hole exterior, it diverges in the interior, necessitating the subtraction of a so-called intermediate divergence which includes introducing an additional \"small\" split in the direction of the polar angle. This procedure is outlined and justified, along with the standard PMR method's counterterms subtraction. We apply this method to calculate the renormalized energy-momentum fluxes $\\langle T_{uu}\\rangle^U_\\text{ren}$, $\\langle T_{vv}\\rangle^U_\\text{ren}$ (where u and v are the standard Eddington coordinates) and the renormalized field square $\\langle \u03a6^2\\rangle^U_\\text{ren}$ throughout the black hole interior, spanning from (just off) the event horizon to (just off) the inner horizon. Special emphasis is placed on the inner horizon vicinity, where our t-splitting results for the fluxes asymptote to those obtained directly at the inner horizon using a different method in a previous work. In an Appendix, we develop an alternative t-splitting PMR variant which does not include the intermediate divergence subtraction. We utilize it for independent computations that are used to verify the standard t-splitting variant presented in the main text.", "AI": {"tldr": "Renormalized quantities for scalar fields in Kerr black hole interiors are computed using tailored t-splitting PMR, addressing divergent sums by intermediate subtraction, with results validated against an appendix method.", "motivation": "Extending PMR for Kerr black hole interiors to handle unique divergent issues, especially near the inner horizon, using t-splitting method with intermediate divergence subtraction.", "method": "Modified t-splitting PMR method with intermediate divergence subtraction tailored for Kerr interior, considering minimally-coupled massless scalar fields in Unruh state.", "result": "Computed renormalized fluxes \u27e8Tuu\u27e9, \u27e8Tvv\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03a6\u00b2\u27e9 across Kerr interior from just outside event horizon to inner horizon, with results near inner horizon matching previous work.", "conclusion": "The method successfully handles Kerr black hole interior field renormalization with intermediate divergences subtracted, verified through independent computations."}}

Conventional optimal control designs typically requires numerical calculations of the system dynamics. Recent studies have demonstrated that long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM-NNs) can accurately predict the time evolution of open quantum systems. Based on LSTM-NN predicted dynamics, we propose an optimal control framework for rapid and efficient optimal control design in open quantum systems. As an exemplary example, we apply our scheme to design an optimal control for the adiabatic speedup in a two-level system under a non-Markovian environment. Our optimization procedure entails two steps: driving trajectory optimization and zero-area pulse optimization. Fidelity improvement for both steps have been obtained, showing the effectiveness of the scheme.

In this work, we develop a continuous-variable quantum protocol for estimating the angular velocity of a rotating surface via the rotational Doppler effect. Our approach exploits squeezed and displaced Laguerre-Gaussian modes as quantum resources, which interact with a rotating metallic disc with surface roughness. The frequency shift induced by the rotational Doppler effect is then measured using a homodyne detection scheme. By analyzing the Fisher information, we demonstrate that the proposed squeezing-enhanced protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling in the ideal noiseless regime. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of noise and consider different surface models to assess their impact on the protocol's performance.

Crucially, we find that the sample size penalty incurred by enforcing $\u03b1$-gentleness scales linearly with the Hilbert-space dimension $d$ rather than the number of parameters $d^2-1$ typical for high-dimensional private estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7834\u574f\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u8da3\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5229\u7528\u7684\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6d4b\u8ddd\u4e3a\u03b1\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3gentleness\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5668\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5728\u533a\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u03c1\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u6001\u03c10\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u03a9(d^3/(\u03b5^2 \u03b1^2))\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dd\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u03b5\u662f\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff0c\u03b1\u662f\u6d4b\u8ddd\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53d\u589e\u5927\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u5b83\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u7834\u574f\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Quantum entanglement offers fundamentally stronger correlations than classically achievable without communication. Crucially, these correlations manifest instantaneously upon measurement, irrespective of the physical distance separating the systems. We investigate the application of shared entanglement to a dual-work optimization problem in a distributed system comprising two servers. The system must process both a continuously available, preemptible baseline task and incoming customer requests arriving in pairs. System performance is characterized by the trade-off between baseline task throughput and customer waiting time. We present a rigorous analytical model demonstrating that when the baseline task throughput function is strictly convex, rewarding longer uninterrupted processing periods, entanglement-assisted routing strategies achieve Pareto-superior performance compared to optimal communication-free classical strategies. We prove this advantage through queueing-theoretic analysis, non-local game formulation, and computational certification of classical bounds.

This paper proposes a formulation of single-query quantum decision trees as weighted graphs. This formulation has the advantage that it facilitates the analysis of the $L_1$ spectral norm of the algorithm output.

Among its most compelling applications is digital quantum simulation, where quantum computers are used to replicate the behavior of other quantum systems. This could enable the study of problems that are otherwise intractable on classical computers, transforming fields such as quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science. Despite this potential, realizations of practical quantum advantage for relevant problems are hindered by imperfections of current devices. This also affects quantum hardware based on superconducting circuits which is among the most advanced and scalable platforms. The envisaged long-term solution of fault-tolerant quantum computers that correct their own errors remains out of reach mainly due to the associated qubit number overhead. As a result, the field has developed strategies that combine quantum and classical resources, exploit hardware-native operations, and employ error mitigation techniques to extract meaningful results from noisy data.

The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian.

Finally, we will discuss the nature and review the studies of two-level system defects, which are currently the limiting factor of qubit coherence time. DiVincenzo's criteria are only the necessary conditions for a technology to be eligible for quantum computing. To have a useful quantum computer, large-scale integration is required. We will review proposals and developments for the large-scale integration of superconducting qubit devices. By comparing with the application of electronic design automation (EDA) in semiconductors, we will also review the use of EDA in superconducting qubit quantum computer design, which is necessary for its large-scale integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, existing proposals require low-noise quantum communication and long-lived quantum memory, capabilities which remain challenging to realize in practice. In this work, we introduce a quantum digital signature scheme that operates with only classical communication, using the classical shadows of states produced by random circuits as public keys. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence supporting the conjectured hardness of learning the private key (the circuit) from the public key (the shadow). A key technical ingredient enabling our scheme is an improved state-certification primitive that achieves higher noise tolerance and lower sample complexity than prior methods. We realize this certification by designing a high-rate error-detecting code tailored to our random-circuit ensemble and experimentally generating shadows for 32-qubit states using circuits with $\\geq 80$ logical ($\\geq 582$ physical) two-qubit gates, attaining 0.90 $\\pm$ 0.01 fidelity. With increased number of measurement samples, our hardware-demonstrated primitives realize a proof-of-principle quantum digital signature, demonstrating the near-term feasibility of our scheme.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Specifically, we identify the minimal improvements required beyond the state-of-the-art to achieve an end-to-end expected teleportation fidelity of $2/3$, which represents the classical limit. To this end, we formulate the hardware requirements computation as optimisation problems, where the hardware parameters representing the underlying device capabilities serve as decision variables. Assuming a simplified noise model, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the teleportation fidelity and rate when the network is realised using heterogeneous quantum hardware, including a quantum repeater chain with a memory cut-off. Our derivations are based on events defined by the order statistics of link generation durations in both the metropolitan networks and the backbone, and the resulting expressions are validated through simulations on the NetSquid platform. The analytical expressions facilitate efficient exploration of the optimisation parameter space without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We then apply this framework to a representative realisation in which the metropolitan nodes are based on trapped-ion processors and the backbone is composed of ensemble-based quantum memories. Our results suggest that teleportation across metropolitan distances is already achievable with state-of-the-art hardware when the data qubit is prepared after end-to-end entanglement has already been established, whereas extending teleportation to intercity scales requires additional, though plausibly achievable, improvements in hardware performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our key observation is that high-temperature states can be sparse in the Pauli or Majorana bases, approaching the identity at infinite temperature. By formulating imaginary-time evolution directly in these operator bases and evolving from the maximally mixed state, we access a continuum of temperatures where the state remains efficiently representable. We provide analytic guarantees for small-coefficient truncation and Pauli-weight (Majorana-length) truncation strategies by quantifying the error growth and the impact of backflow.
