Abstract: Low pressure gaseous Negative Ion Time Projection Chambers (NITPCs) have been used previously by the DRIFT experiment to search for a directional Dark Matter (DM) signature. The main challenge with using a Negative Ion Drift (NID) gas target is the significantly lower gas gains to which they are typically limited. Recently, a MMThGEM device has been successfully demonstrated as an excellent gain stage device in the NID gas SF$_6$; capable of producing gas gains comparable with the electron drift gas CF$_4$. The next major challenge is to extend this high gain capability to multi-dimensional readout for the purpose of particle track reconstruction. The MMThGEM is therefore ideal for coupling to a strip readout detector like a Micromegas to achieve a high gain multi-dimensional Negative Ion (NI) readout plane, which is potentially suitable for the scale up required by future searches proposed by the CYGNUS consortium. In this paper, the first high gain demonstration of such a MMThGEM-Micromegas detector in low pressure SF$_6$ is described. This includes detector characterisation in a small test vessel resulting in the largest NI gas gain ever reported, 1.22 $\pm$ 0.08 $\times$ 10$^5$ , and directionality with alpha particles. Finally, this gain characterisation and tracking capability is leveraged to measure the energy and range of events, and identify those consistent with Nuclear Recoils (NRs), in a large cubic metre scale volume of SF$_6$ for the first time.

Abstract: We present new measurements of 27 gamma ray energies ranging from 14 keV to 136 keV, obtained using high-energy-resolution magnetic microcalorimeters for energy-dispersive spectrometry. The spectrometer has eight pixels and achieves an energy resolution between 15 and 30 eV across the entire energy range. It faces a cryogenic source sampler with four movable sources. Each source contains a mixture of radionuclides, including Yb-169 and Co-57 used to calibrate the spectrometer and correct its non-linearity. The gamma-ray energies, emitted through the decay of Co-57, Cd-109, Ba-133, Gd-153, Eu-154, Eu-155, Yb-169, Tm-170, Pb-210, Np-239, Am-241 and Am-243, have been reassessed. The lowest absolute uncertainty achieved is 0.13 eV at 105.3 keV, which corresponds to a relative uncertainty of 1.3 ppm. Of the 27 measured gamma rays, the uncertainties of 19 energies were improved with respect to the available literature: 10 by a factor of 5 and 4 by more than one order of magnitude. Good agreement is observed with energies obtained elsewhere by wavelength-dispersive spectrometry. This work significantly improves upon previously reported gamma energies obtained by energy-dispersive spectrometry using semiconductor detectors, thanks to the ultra-high energy resolution of magnetic microcalorimeters.

Motivation: Understanding the dRICH detector's performance under various conditions is essential for improving particle identification in high-energy physics experiments.

Method: Geant4 simulations were used to model the dRICH detector's behavior with different aerogel configurations and varying sensor noise levels.

Result: The aerogel with n=1.026 showed superior performance, improved π-K separation, and higher refractive index, while increased sensor noise limited the separation threshold.

Conclusion: The current dRICH design is validated, and efforts should focus on mitigating sensor noise to enhance separation capabilities.

Abstract: The dual-radiator Imaging Cherenkov detector (dRICH) is a key component of the forward particle identification system for the ePIC experiment at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This study evaluates the dRICH performance using Geant4 simulations in the context of the global ePIC simulation stack, focusing on the optimization of the aerogel radiator and the impact of sensor noise. We compare two aerogel configurations: the initial design (n=1.019) and the current default (n=1.026). The latter, characterized by improved optical properties and a higher refractive index, demonstrates enhanced $π-K$ separation at high momenta, effectively extending the operational overlap with the $\mathrm{C_2F_6}$ gas radiator. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) dark noise, showing that a 300 kHz noise rate per channel leads to a moderate reduction (approximately 1.5 GeV/c) in the $3σ$ separation threshold. These results validate the current dRICH design and quantify the purity levels achievable for both radiators under expected experimental conditions.

Conclusion: 这一方法为减少测量电路的成本和复杂性提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-correlation is an established tool to reduce the background in resistance noise measurements. However, the conventional method requires the amplifier, demodulator and digitizer channels to be duplicated, increasing the cost and complexity of the measurement circuit. We propose an alternating-current technique that allows cross-correlation with only a single channel by modulating the device under test with two carrier frequencies simultaneously. Using multiple software-based demodulators, we show that this method produces accurate amplitude measurements and noise spectra. The signal-to-noise-ratio is improved by 7 dB, and longer measurement durations increase this improvement.

Abstract: We present the development and characterization of a compact low-energy ion beam diagnostic for the WISArD (Weak Interaction Studies with $\mathrm{^{32}Ar}$ Decay) experiment at ISOLDE/CERN. The microchannel plate (MCP) detector, which is configured in a Z-stack and has a resistive position sensitive anode, was tested with both stable and radioactive beams. This work focuses on the image reconstruction method, which corrects the pincushion distortion inherent to the square-shaped resistive anode, and investigates the influence of the magnetic field on the detector performance. Our results demonstrate that the detector achieves beam profile measurements with sub-millimeter accuracy, while coping with the spatial and high-magnetic field (4 T) constraints of the experiment. These capabilities meet the precision requirements of the WISArD experiment for extracting the modified beta-neutrino angular correlation coefficient, ã$_{βν}$, with an uncertainty of 0.1%.

Abstract: The frictionless motion of an object through a fluid medium is commonly viewed as a hallmark of superfluidity. According to Landau, kinematic constraints prohibit superfluid behavior in one-dimensional (1D) bosonic systems. Here, using ultracold atoms, we show how a microscopic impurity can propagate through a strongly interacting 1D Bose gas without any friction, at odds with conventional expectations. We inject the impurity with initial velocities ranging from the subsonic to supersonic regime, and subsequently track its dynamics. For supersonic initial velocities, we observe the formation of a shock wave and a remarkably fast relaxation to a stationary regime, on a time scale that increases with decreasing impurity velocity. After reaching the stationary state, the impurity continues its motion through the system with a finite velocity. Our findings demonstrate how quantum effects can conspire to eliminate dissipation of a microscopic object immersed in a quantum fluid, thereby bringing novel insights into the propagation of matter and information in the quantum realm.

Abstract: Atomic interactions play an important role in the properties of ultracold atomic gases. In single component bosonic systems, its effect is already present at the critical point for the Bose-Einstein condensate phase transition by shifting it to lower temperatures as a consequence of effective repulsion between the atoms. When considering atomic bosonic mixtures, interesting effects arise from the competition between intra- and interspecies interactions such as the miscible-immiscible phase transition and the particular case of self-bounded quantum droplets. In such a scenario, it is natural to expect that these interactions will also affect the critical point of each species composing the mixture. In this paper, we obtain analytical expressions for the critical temperature shift of the phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of a second species. We treat differently the cases in with the second species is above or below its own critical temperature and apply the obtained relations to the case of a $^{23}$Na-$^{39}$K bosonic mixture which can be realized in current running experimental setups. Our findings can be easily extended to other atomic mixtures trapped by arbitrary conservative traps.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the ground-state and low-lying metastable phases of repulsive binary Bose-Einstein condensates confined in twisted, spin-dependent periodic optical lattices. For balanced mixtures, weak intercomponent interactions yield a fourfold momentum-space symmetry dictated by the lattice geometry. Increasing the coupling strength leads to the emergence of additional momentum peaks that combine with the lattice-induced structure to produce an eightfold rotationally symmetric pattern, signaling quasicrystalline order. At intermediate interactions, global phase separation suppresses this quasicrystalline state; however, at stronger coupling, local phase separation gives rise to a long-lived metastable phase in which the eightfold symmetry is restored. In this regime, a secondary ring of dominant momentum peaks appears at smaller wave vectors, indicating longer-wavelength density modulations and a crossover from lattice-dominated to interaction-driven quasicrystalline order. In contrast, imbalanced mixtures form partially miscible density clusters with eightfold-symmetric aperiodic patterns only at intermediate coupling, while stronger interactions drive global phase separation and permanently destroy quasicrystalline order. Real-time simulations demonstrate that these aperiodic structures are dynamically stable and experimentally accessible. Our results show that quasicrystalline order can emerge in binary condensates without explicitly aperiodic lattices and reveal population balance as a key ingredient for stabilizing quantum quasicrystals.

Abstract: We introduce an absorption imaging technique for ultracold gases that suppresses interference fringes and coherence-induced artifacts by reducing the transverse spatial coherence of the imaging light. The method preserves the narrow spectral bandwidth required for resonant absorption imaging and is implemented as a modular extension to standard imaging setups using a rotating diffuser. We demonstrate tunability of the illumination light's coherence without modifying the imaging optics. Using this approach, we achieve reliable imaging of ultracold atomic clouds in micron-scale proximity to complex surfaces, where standing waves, edge diffraction, and speckle severely limit conventional absorption imaging.

Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying confinement, topological order, and exotic quantum matter. In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.

Abstract: Transformation optics uses coordinate mappings to emulate curved geometries and control electromagnetic fields. However, existing approaches primarily focus on geometric deformation while offering limited control over the global topology of the resulting optical space. Here we introduce a torus projection combined with a conformal mapping to construct a wormhole-like virtual optical geometry, providing a controllable route to manipulate optical-space topology within transformation optics. By tuning a single torus parameter, the virtual-space refractive index switches between isotropic and anisotropic forms, transforming point-like singularities in a disconnected geometry into extended transport channels that connect the optical space. This topology transition manifests as the opening or closure of an electromagnetic wormhole and is accompanied by pronounced changes in ray dynamics and cavity modes. Our results demonstrate how refractive-index anisotropy governs singularity structure and topology in transformation optics, providing a route to photonic systems with tunable optical geometry and connectivity.

Abstract: Gallium antimonide (GaSb) is a key material for near- and mid-infrared photonics, enabling high-performance laser architectures and detectors. Design and simulation of such devices depend on accurate optical material data, especially the complex refractive index $n^*_{\text{GaSb}} = n_{\text{GaSb}} +ik_{\text{GaSb}}$, consisting of the real part $n_{\text{GaSb}}$ (refractive index) and the imaginary part $k_{\text{GaSb}}$ (extinction coefficient). However, GaSb refractive index values are based either on theoretical models, typically informed by legacy experimental data, or on experimental measurements without quantified uncertainties. This limits their reliability for state-of-the-art devices. Here, we present measurement results of $n^*_{\text{GaSb}}$ in the near- to mid-infrared range from \SIrange{1}{3.1}{\micro \metre} with a relative uncertainty <\num{7.8e-5} for $n_{\text{GaSb}}$, and <\num{2.0e-3} for $k_{\text{GaSb}}$. As a side result of our method, we also report $n_{\text{AlAsSb}}$ for aluminium arsenide antimonide ($\mathrm{AlAs_{0.08}Sb_{0.92}}$) with a relative uncertainty <\num{3.9e-4}. Our results are based on two complementary measurements on a GaSb/AlAsSb-based heteroepitaxial structure under controlled environmental conditions: photometric transmission and layer-thickness analysis by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy. We simultaneously retrieve the refractive indices of the two materials by fitting a Sellmeier equation and a theoretical dispersion model by Djurišić \textit{et al.}~\cite{djurisic_modeling_2000}. The uncertainties of $n^*_{\text{GaSb}}$ and $n_{\text{AlAsSb}}$ are quantified using a Monte Carlo-based approach. Our results provide accurate complex refractive index values for GaSb, which are vital to advance photonics-related technologies in the near- and mid infrared spectral region.

Abstract: Refractometric biosensing is a vital label-free tool for the real time detection and interaction analysis of biological and chemical substances. Nanophotonic platforms like Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) have played a critical role in providing refractometric sensing capabilities for clinical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. However, traditional systems operating in a single-polarization state cannot fully characterize complex optical properties such as birefringence, which is crucial to resolve many complex biological interactions. Although Bloch Surface Wave (BSW) sensors can support both TE and TM modes, a key capability SPR lacks, they have historically been implemented in single-mode configurations. In this paper, we present a polarization multiplexed BSW refractometric sensing system, simultaneously tracking the resonant wavelength shifts of both TE and TM BSW modes through time. Our technique was applied to investigate single-strand DNA growth during rolling circle amplification (RCA). To accurately recover the time-dependent birefringence, capturing dynamics of the DNA growth and orientation of its chains, we implemented a two-stage modeling approach based on the TMM. First, we utilized a wavelength-dependent surface sensitivity model, confining refractive index changes to the immediate layer above the crystal, to distinguish isotropic background dynamics from birefringent signals. Following the onset of RCA, we transitioned to a model that accounted for the vertical growth of the DNA layers in time. By fitting this model to the TE and TM resonant shifts, we monitor the growth rate of the single-strand DNA layer as well as the refractive index along the two polarization components. Our findings demonstrate the platform's ability to resolve the structural evolution of complex bimolecular interactions associated with conformational changes.

Abstract: Interacting bosonic quasiparticles are the cornerstone for exploring many-body physics and nonlinear quantum phenomena in correlated light-matter systems. Strongly interacting dipolar excitons in van der Waals heterostructures have attracted significant interest due to their out-of-plane electric dipole moments and high tunability via the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE). However, leveraging these tunable dipolar excitons in strongly coupled exciton-photon systems to explore exotic many-body physics and macroscopic quantum phenomena remains experimentally elusive. Here, we report the strong coupling of dipolar excitons in a gated bilayer MoS2 device integrated with a one-dimensional photonic crystal hosting bound-states-in-continuum (BIC). The resulting polaritons hybridize cavity photons with a coherent superposition of two electrically tunable anti-aligned dipolar excitons, effectively binding them into composite quasiparticle states. By tuning the dipolar excitons into non-degenerate states via the QCSE, we realize in situ reconfiguration of the polariton wavefunction and observe an emergent polariton branch exhibiting non-monotonic Stark shifts. Notably, these tunable polaritons allow for customized control over nonlinear interactions through distinct excitonic hybridization and dipolar configurations. This in situ tunability offers a scalable pathway toward electrically programmable quantum fluids of light and correlated polariton phases in on-chip photonic integrated circuits.

TL;DR: Hybrid femtosecond laser and Au implantation for precise optical component fabrication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of surface feature control and efficiency in femtosecond laser processing of fused silica, the paper proposes a hybrid approach combining localized Au implantation with femtosecond laser irradiation.

Method: Hybrid method using femtosecond laser irradiation with 515 nm and 1030 nm wavelengths and Au implantation with 1.8 MeV Au2+ ions at 1 μm.

Result: Results show that this combination achieves cylindrical craters with sharp edges and flat bottoms, a constant ablation depth of 550 nm, and high processing efficiency.

Conclusion: The hybrid method offers a way to improve the quality and efficiency of optical component fabrication while preserving the high transmission properties of fused silica.

Abstract: Femtosecond laser modification of fused silica enables precise surface tailoring for the fabrication of micro-optical components such as microlenses and diffractive elements. However, the process is governed by laser-matter interactions where the local fluence determines the processing depth, often limiting control over feature geometry and efficiency. Here, we present a hybrid approach combining localized Au implantation (1.8 MeV Au2+ ions) into SiO2 samples with femtosecond laser irradiation (250 fs), effectively tuning the laser-matter interaction and resulting morphology. At both 515 nm and 1030 nm irradiation wavelengths, single-shot femtosecond pulses produce cylindrical craters with sharp edges and flat-bottom profiles. Independently of the fluence, these craters exhibit a constant depth of 550 nm, corresponding to the region of maximum Au concentration. The effect manifests already at moderate fluence (app. 4 J/sq.cm) and yields high ablation efficiency, up to 15 cubic micrometers per microjoule. The hybrid method also works effectively at lower implantation doses that preserve the excellent transmission of fused silica, offering a promising pathway for the high-quality fabrication of flat optical components such as binary phase masks, phase lenses, or fused-silica micromolds.

TL;DR: NGR cannot describe physically meaningful black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore the existence of non-trivial black holes within the context of New General Relativity.

Method: The authors examine static, spherically symmetric configurations with a local black hole horizon in both vacuum and non-vacuum scenarios, solving the field equations under these conditions.

Result: The analysis reveals that the constraints imposed by NGR limit the parameter space to models that are physically pathological.

Conclusion: Therefore, NGR fails to provide a viable framework for describing physically meaningful black holes.

Abstract: New general relativity (NGR) possesses a region in the \((c_{a},c_{v},c_{t})\)-parameter space corresponding to physically acceptable models. However, when solving the field equations for vacuum and non--vacuum static and spherically symmetric configurations under the assumption of the existence of a local black hole horizon, we find that the mere existence of such solutions imposes algebraic constraints that fix the parameters to values associated with known pathological models. As a consequence, we conclude that NGR is unable to describe physically meaningful non-trivial black holes.

Abstract: The spins of merging binary black holes (BBHs) inferred from gravitational-wave (GW) observations provide key insights into their formation channels. However, spin parameters are typically weakly constrained from data, and their inferred values are often strongly influenced by the assumed prior in Bayesian analyses. A commonly used prior, uniform in spin magnitudes and isotropic in spin directions, assigns vanishing probability density to spin-orbit-aligned configurations, potentially biasing inferences for BBH parameters. The prior choice can also affect population-level analyses by degrading the convergence of Monte Carlo integrations used to evaluate the likelihood in hierarchical Bayesian inference. In this work, we propose a novel spin prior that is uniform in the effective spin parameters Xeff and Xp, two spin combinations that can be relatively well measured from GW data, conditioned on the mass ratio. Using simulated BBH populations, we show that the inferred spin population can depend on the choice of prior, and that the proposed prior more accurately recovers the underlying spin population, particularly when the true distribution favors aligned-spin configurations. Because mass and spin measurements are correlated, our prior also enables a more accurate recovery of the underlying mass distribution.

Abstract: We investigate the stability and gravitational waves (GWs) in the four-dimensional general Einstein-vector theory in a cosmological background. The theory accommodates up to six propagating degrees of freedom, comprising two tensor, two vector, and two scalar modes, in addition to matter perturbations. In certain regions of the parameter space, the number of scalar degrees of freedom is reduced to one or even zero. To investigate the stability, we systematically analyze ghost, Laplacian, and tachyonic instabilities at the linear perturbative level. The stability conditions are easily satisfied for tensor perturbations, but impose nontrivial constraints on the parameter space for vector perturbations. Furthermore, in the presence of a nonvanishing background vector field, the scalar sector becomes unstable at small wavenumbers $|\vec{k}|$. In the small-scale limit ($|\vec{k}|\rightarrow\infty$), we further investigate the GW properties of the general Einstein-vector theory within the stable parameter space, including the number of independent modes, their propagation speeds, and observational constraints from GW experiments. We find that there are at most two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode. Notably, vector GWs propagate superluminally, yet they are forbidden if tensor GWs travel exactly at light speed. This distinctive feature provides a key observational signature for testing the theory.

Abstract: This study systematically investigates the cosmological dynamics of two well-motivated functional forms in $f(T,B)$ gravity within a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. Here $T$ denotes the torsion scalar and $B$ the boundary term, with the special choice $f(T,B) = - T + B$ recovering General Relativity. We focus on a multiplicative power-law model $f(T,B) = c_1 T^αB^β$ and an additive mixed power-law model $f(T,B) = c_2 T^α+ c_3 B^β$. Using dynamical system techniques, we construct autonomous systems and identify de Sitter attractors that naturally explain late-time cosmic acceleration. Analytical stability conditions for these fixed points are derived, and numerical simulations reveal characteristic evolutionary patterns, such as spiral trajectories and damped oscillations in the additive mixed power-law model. Furthermore, statefinder diagnostics are applied to quantitatively distinguish these models from the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm and other dark energy scenarios. The results indicate that $f(T,B)$ gravity offers a theoretically consistent and observationally distinguishable geometric framework for explaining cosmic acceleration, presenting a compelling alternative to conventional dark energy models.

Abstract: Time series analysis from gravitational-wave detectors often relies on the assumption that time chunks, or frequency bins, are uncorrelated. We discuss the validity of this approximation in the context of searches for stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds. We examine the impact of averaging over time and frequency, a reduction technique commonly employed to minimize the computational expense of likelihood evaluations. We introduce an analytical tool based on Fisher information to quantify the error in parameter inference arising from ignoring these effects. Finally, we address the issue of locally stationary processes and optimal time chunking.

Abstract: We consider the most general parity symmetric effective scalar tensor theory in four dimensions containing terms up to fourth derivative order in the Lagrangian. It has been shown [H.S. Reall, Phys. Rev. D 103 (2021), 084027] that this theory has three polarizations generically goverened by different (nested) propagation cones, neither of which in general coincides with the lightcone as defined by the metric. Consequently, the notion of black hole horizon must be defined relative to the widest propagation cone, and not with respect to the metric. We provide two theorems stating that, nevertheless, the horizon of a \emph{stationary} black hole is null with respect to the metric, and that, in fact, all three propagation cones touch on the horizon. The conditions in these theorems allow for rotating black holes. Our theorems thereby suggest that the notion of Killing horizon, central in most discussions of black hole thermodynamics, retains its fundamental status, and that certain thermodynamic paradoxes associated with multiple propagation cones are evaded.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog, GWTC-4.0, reports 153 binary black hole mergers with false-alarm rates $<1,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Chirp masses are typically measured well, with the smallest fractional uncertainty being $2%$ at the $90%$ credible level. Spins, on the other hand, are poorly constrained: the median of the best-measured spin component of the population, the effective spin, is $χ_{\rm eff}=0.04$, with a typical $90%$ credible uncertainty of $Δχ_{\rm eff}=0.44$. The large majority -- $90%$ of the observed black holes -- are consistent with spin magnitudes $χ<0.57$ and are weakly aligned with the orbits. At $90%$ credibility, the peaks of the inferred posteriors for spin magnitude are found to lie in the range $0.01$--$0.23$.
  We show that this ``near-zero spins'' conclusion may be prior-driven, and that uniform-in-magnitude spin priors lead to under-exploration of the moderate-to-high spin region of parameter space. Adopting a physically agnostic prior that is uniform in spin-vector configuration space (i.e., spin states uniform within a unit sphere) yields similar constraints on $χ_{\rm eff}$, but substantially different spin-magnitude inferences than GWTC-4.0. The resulting shift in spins directly impacts tests of general relativity, constraints on near-extremal Kerr remnants, and astrophysical conclusions, including diagnostics of formation channels and hierarchical growth. In short, the data do not require vanishing spins -- the prior does, and accounting for this is essential for robust GR tests and population inferences.

Abstract: While conformal transformations in metric scalar-tensor theories recover General Relativity, this feature is notably absent in standard non-metricity-based theories. We demonstrate that by introducing the boundary term C, a non-metricity scalar-tensor theory can recover Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) in the Einstein frame. Motivated by this, we propose a novel gravity model where a scalar field couples nonminimally to both the non-metricity scalar Q and the boundary term C. We focus in the cosmological scenario where we present the covariant formulation and a unified autonomous system framework that treats generic affine-connection choices, including coincident and non-coincident gauges, on an equal footing. Our dynamical analysis across three connection branches reveals standard thermal histories and stable de Sitter attractors. These results show that boundary-term couplings provide a well-posed, geometrically flexible route to addressing late-time cosmic acceleration.

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the linear perturbation (including the comoving curvature perturbation and field perturbation) dynamics in the SR-USR-SR inflation with instantaneous transitions. Using the junction method and asymptotic expansions of Hankel functions, we derive accurate asymptotic expressions for the time evolution of mode functions and the resulting power spectrum, based on three systematic rules for identifying the dominant terms across transitions. Our results reveal that a finite dip of the final power spectrum arises from the cancellation between two growing modes within the linear perturbation theory, rather than between constant and growing terms as previously suggested. We also provide analytical descriptions of the amplitude enhancement and oscillatory features in the linear power spectrum, in agreement with numerical computations. These simple, tractable formulas not only facilitate theoretical calculations but also yield testable predictions for future CMB observations.

*Mahmoud Saad Abouamer,Jaron Skovsted Gundersen,Søren Pilegaard Rasmussen,Petar Popovski*

TL;DR: This paper proposes using punctured quantum error correction codes to improve teleportation reliability without requiring hardware-level code switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum teleportation is a fundamental protocol for quantum communication, and the paper addresses the challenge of maintaining reliability under imperfect EPR pairs by proposing novel error correction methods.

Method: The authors introduce punctured QEC codes combined with entanglement purification, proving that their approach allows for adaptive error correction across varying purification conditions and reliability targets.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that punctured codes perform better than fixed-rate codes in different operating regimes, reducing logical error probabilities and lowering the required initial EPR fidelity and purification levels for target reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed method simplifies the implementation of adaptive error correction, enhancing the practicality and efficiency of quantum teleportation protocols.

Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a foundational protocol for sending quantum information through entanglement distribution and classical communication. Assuming ideal classical communication, the reliability of quantum teleportation is limited by the fidelity of the shared EPR pairs. This reliability can be improved through two mechanisms: entanglement purification and quantum error correction (QEC). Using both techniques in concert requires flexible QEC rates, since purification alters the structure of errors induced by imperfect-EPR teleportation, and fixed-rate codes cannot be uniformly effective across purification regimes or reliability targets. In this work, we supplement purification with punctured QEC codes, providing a family of code variants that can be adapted to error-channel characteristics and reliability targets. Punctured codes improve teleportation reliability across a broader range of purification regimes, enabling target reliability to be met without hardware-level code switching. This is corroborated by numerical results, showing that different punctured codes achieve the lowest logical error probability in different operating regimes, and that selecting among them reduces logical error relative to fixed-rate encoded teleportation. This reduction relaxes the requirement on the initial EPR fidelity or purification needed to achieve a target reliability. Overall, puncturing enables adaptation to varying entanglement conditions and reliability requirements while reusing a single stabilizer structure.

Conclusion: 量子混沌是实现量子增强灵敏度传感器的关键资源，即使在测量可访问性极低的情况下，也能显著提升系统性能。这为实际应用提供了理论依据和指导。

Abstract: Most quantum metrology protocols harness highly entangled probe states and globally accessible measurements to surpass the standard quantum limit. However, it is challenging to satisfy these requirements in realistic many-body sensors. We demonstrate that both of these constraints can be overcome in quantum chaotic sensors. Crucially, we establish that even in the presence of partial measurement accessibility, chaotic dynamics enables initial unentangled states to exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information, $I_α$ with time. In the weakly chaotic regime, we identify spin-coherent states placed at the edge of the regular islands in the mixed classical phase space as optimal initial states for enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, in the strongly chaotic regime, $I_α$ is insensitive to the choice of the initial state. Notably, quantum-enhanced sensitivity is achieved even when a very low fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the qubits are accessible. These results establish quantum chaos as a robust resource for quantum-enhanced sensing under realistic accessibility constraints on accessibility.

Abstract: Quasi-probabilities appear across diverse areas of physics, but their conceptual foundations remain unclear: they are often treated merely as computational tools, and operations like conditioning and Bayes' theorem become ambiguous. We address both issues by developing a principled framework that derives quasi-probabilities and their conditional calculus from structural consistency requirements on how statements are valued across different universes of discourse, understood as finite Boolean algebras of statements.We begin with a universal valuation that assigns definite (possibly complex) values to all statements. The central concept is Syntactic Locality: every universe can be embedded within a larger ambient one, and the universal valuation must behave coherently under such embeddings and restrictions. From a set of structural principles, we prove a representation theorem showing that every admissible valuation can be re-expressed as a finitely additive measure on mutually exclusive statements, mirroring the usual probability sum rule. We call such additive representatives pre-probabilities. This representation is unique up to an additive regraduation freedom. When this freedom can be fixed canonically, pre-probabilities reduce to finite quasi-probabilities, thereby elevating quasi-probability theory from a computational device to a uniquely determined additive representation of universal valuations. Classical finite probabilities arise as the subclass of quasi-probabilities stable under relativisation, i.e., closed under restriction to sub-universes. Finally, the same framework enables us to define a coherent theory of conditionals, yielding a well-defined generalized Bayes' theorem applicable to both pre-probabilities and quasi-probabilities. We conclude by discussing additional regularity conditions, including the role of rational versus irrational probabilities in this setting.

Abstract: We present a technique for measuring ion temperature using cavity-based electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) applicable for cavity-qed systems in the strong coupling regime. This method enables efficient extraction of the ion's phonon occupation number following sub-Doppler cooling close to the motional ground state. The proposed method relies on monitoring the cavity probe transmission while scanning the probe laser frequency once cavity EIT is established using the control beam, significantly simplifying the measurement procedure. We theoretically establish a model that demonstrates influence of thermal state of the trapped ion vis a vis the EIT linewidth measured. We show how the cavity EIT transmission may be used as a thermometry tool to deduce the ion temperature as well as the motional state for an ion in the sub-Doppler cooling regime. The current method can only be used for operation in the resolved-sideband regime, where individual motional states can be selectively addressed for all relevant transitions either by selecting appropriate energy levels for the three-level system or by employing strong confinement with high secular frequencies ($\sim 10 MHz$).

Motivation: Improving the efficiency and convergence of QAOA for solving combinatorial optimization problems like MAX-CUT is a key challenge in quantum computing. This work addresses this challenge by proposing a hybrid method combining QLC with gradient estimation.

Method: The method combines Quantum Lyapunov Control (QLC) with per-layer gradient estimation to select near-optimal control parameters. It leverages feedback-driven control laws that guarantee monotonic non-decreasing objective values and utilizes layer-wise gradient information for faster convergence.

Result: The proposed hybrid method achieves significantly faster convergence and improved robustness compared to traditional QLC approaches. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness across various problem instances and settings.

Conclusion: This work advances the field of quantum optimization by providing a practical and efficient method to enhance QAOA performance, particularly in scenarios where training overhead is a concern.

Abstract: Feedback-based methods have gained significant attention as an alternative training paradigm for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in solving combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT. In particular, Quantum Lyapunov Control (QLC) employs feedback-driven control laws that guarantee monotonic non-decreasing objective values, can substantially reduce the training overhead of QAOA, and mitigate barren plateaus. However, these methods might require long control sequences, leading to sub-optimal convergence rates. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that incorporates per-layer gradient estimation to accelerate the convergence of QLC while preserving its low training overhead and stability guarantees. By leveraging layer-wise gradient information, the proposed approach selects near-optimal control parameters, resulting in significantly faster convergence and improved robustness. We validate the effectiveness of the method through extensive numerical experiments across a range of problem instances and optimization settings.

Abstract: Packages capable of supporting large arrays of high-coherence superconducting qubits are vital for the realisation of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the necessary high-throughput metrology required to optimise fabrication and manufacturing processes. We present a wafer-scale packaging architecture supporting over 500 qubits on a single 3-inch die. The package is engineered to suppress parasitic RF modes, and to mitigate material loss through simulation-informed design while managing differential thermal contraction to ensure robust operation at millikelvin temperatures. System-level heat-load calculations from a large wiring payload show this package may be operated in commercial dilution refrigerators. Measurements of the qubits loaded into the package show median $T_1$, $T_{2e} \sim 100~μ$s ($\sim$100 qubits) alongside readout with median fidelity of 97.5% (54 qubits) and a median qubit temperature of 36 mK (54 qubits). These results validate the performance of these packages and demonstrate that large-scale integration can be achieved without compromising device performance. Finally, we highlight the utility of these packages as a tool for high throughput feedback on qubit figures of merit over large sample sizes, allowing identification of performance outliers in the tails of the coherence distribution, a critical capability for informing fabrication and manufacture of high-quality quantum qubits and quantum processors.

### [33] [Temporal Framework for Causality-Preserving Scheduling of Measurements in Quantum Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12459)
*Jakob Kaltoft Søndergaard,René Bødker Christensen,Petar Popovski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of ambiguous causality in quantum measurement outcomes due to ambiguous timing in distributed quantum protocols. By proposing a time-division architecture, the authors ensure that quantum measurements can be processed in a predictable and reliable manner, bridging the gap between classical network timing and quantum measurement processing for scalable quantum networking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed quantum protocols face issues with ambiguous causality when timing is uncertain. This paper aims to resolve such ambiguities for reliable quantum networking.

Method: The authors propose a time-division architecture where nodes perform measurements in pre-assigned slots. They formalize this temporal framework and derive constraints for preserving measurement causality. For simple network topologies, they present an algorithm to optimize measurement schedules.

Result: The proposed time-division model ensures a unique causal interpretation of measurement outcomes, enabling reliable and scalable quantum networking despite ambiguous timing.

Conclusion: By introducing a structured temporal approach, the paper provides a practical solution for coordinating quantum measurements with classical network timing, enhancing the reliability and scalability of quantum networking systems.

Abstract: Distributed quantum protocols rely on classical feedforward information to process measurement outcomes, but heterogeneous hardware and uncertain local timing can make the causal order of measurements ambiguous when inferred solely from arrival times. Even in simple line networks with only Pauli measurements, end nodes cannot distinguish whether a missing outcome is caused by slow measurement or by delayed classical propagation. To resolve this ambiguity, we propose a time-division architecture for quantum networks in which nodes perform measurements in pre-assigned slots, ensuring a unique causal interpretation of outcomes. We formalize this temporal framework and derive the feedforward and adjacency constraints required to preserve measurement causality. For simple network topologies, we present an algorithm that yields optimal measurement schedules. Overall, the proposed time-division model provides a practical coordination layer that bridges the classical network timing with quantum measurement processing, enabling reliable and scalable measurement-based quantum networking.

Abstract: Polar molecules, with their rich internal structure, offer immense potential for fundamental physics, quantum technology, and controlled chemistry. However, their utilization is currently limited because of slow and imperfect state detection and weak dipolar interaction, limiting fast and large-scale entanglement generation. We propose and analyze a scheme for quantum logic control and measurement-based state preparation in a hybrid platform of polar molecules and neutral atoms. The method leverages fast, high-fidelity atom-molecule gates and high-fidelity atomic ancilla measurements to overcome the common challenges in molecule-only platforms, while preserving their diverse structural advantages. The proposed atom-molecule controlled-phase gate is based on resonant dipole-dipole exchange between a molecular rotational transition and an atomic Rydberg transition, rendering it three orders of magnitude faster than any direct molecule-molecule entangling gate. We further study several applications of our scheme including the preparation of molecular GHZ states for quantum enhanced precision measurements, the preparation of exotic molecular qudit states with topological order, and measurement-altered criticality. Our scheme is applicable to any polar molecule. It expands the paradigm of quantum logic control and paves the way to large-scale molecular entangled states. More generally, it highlights a concrete hybrid quantum system in which each qubit is utilized in an optimal way and where the measurement-based approach can yield a significant advantage in near-term devices.

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising research direction that integrates quantum information processing into reinforcement learning frameworks. While many existing QRL studies apply quantum agents to classical environments, it has been realized that the potential advantages of QRL are most naturally explored in environments that exhibit intrinsically quantum characteristics, where the agent's observations and interactions arise from quantum processes. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning environment formulated as a challenge-response task with hidden information. In the proposed environment, Alice encodes a classical bit into the parameters of a quantum circuit, while Bob, with a trained reinforcement learning agent, interacts with a limited number of quantum state copies to infer the hidden bit. The agent must select measurement strategies and decide when to terminate the interaction under explicit resource constraints. To study the solvability of the proposed environment, we consider three agents: a purely classical agent, a lightweight hybrid agent and a deep hybrid agent. Through experiments, we analyze the trade-off between inference accuracy and quantum resource consumption under varying interaction penalties. Our results show that the lightweight hybrid agent achieves reliable inference using as few as two quantum state copies, outperforming both the classical baseline and the deep hybrid agent in highly resource-constrained regimes. We further evaluate robustness under realistic quantum noise models and discuss the relevance of the proposed environment for security-oriented applications, including quantum-assisted authentication.

*Grier M. Jones,Aviraj Newatia,Alexander Lao,Aditya K. Rao,Viki Kumar Prasad,Hans-Arno Jacobsen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evolution-inspired heuristic algorithm, Local Quantum Architecture Search (LQAS), for optimizing parametrized quantum circuit architectures. It evaluates LQAS on quantum machine learning tasks, including regression problems and quantum chemistry, demonstrating improved circuit architectures that can be deployed on quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing interest in quantum machine learning (QML) has brought attention to the development of efficient parametrized quantum circuits. However, the design of these circuits is often highly dependent on specific tasks, which can be challenging and time-consuming. To address this, the paper explores the use of automated methods, specifically quantum architecture search (QAS), to simplify the process of discovering task-specific circuits.

Method: The proposed Local Quantum Architecture Search algorithm operates by performing a local, probabilistic search over a fixed set of gate-level actions applied to existing quantum circuits. The algorithm systematically modifies these circuits by applying a series of quantum gates (e.g., rotation gates) in a probabilistic manner, aiming to optimize the circuit's performance for a given task.

Result: The study evaluates the LQAS algorithm on two synthetic regression tasks and two quantum chemistry datasets. Through state-vector simulation, the results indicate that LQAS is effective in identifying circuit architectures that achieve competitive performance metrics, such as lower mean squared error and improved generalization capabilities. The algorithm successfully discovers circuits that are both efficient and effective for quantum machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: This work represents a step forward in automating the design of parametrized quantum circuits, particularly for quantum machine learning applications. By demonstrating the effectiveness of LQAS on both synthetic and quantum chemistry datasets, the paper shows that automated architecture search can be a powerful tool in advancing quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Within quantum machine learning, parametrized quantum circuits provide flexible quantum models, but their performance is often highly task-dependent, making manual circuit design challenging. Alternatively, quantum architecture search algorithms have been proposed to automate the discovery of task-specific parametrized quantum circuits using systematic frameworks. In this work, we propose an evolution-inspired heuristic quantum architecture search algorithm, which we refer to as the local quantum architecture search. The goal of the local quantum architecture search algorithm is to optimize parametrized quantum circuit architectures through a local, probabilistic search over a fixed set of gate-level actions applied to existing circuits. We evaluate the local quantum architecture search algorithm on two synthetic function-fitting regression tasks and two quantum chemistry regression datasets, including the BSE49 dataset of bond separation energies for first- and second-row elements and a dataset of water conformers generated using the data-driven coupled-cluster approach. Using state-vector simulation, our results highlight the applicability of local quantum architecture search algorithm for identifying competitive circuit architectures with desirable performance metrics. Lastly, we analyze the properties of the discovered circuits and demonstrate the deployment of the best-performing model on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: An effective potential is presented to estimate quantum thermal expectation values as a classical ensemble average.

The potential is exact in classical and harmonic limits, with benchmarks showing good agreement for potentials supported by harmonic approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study provides a novel method for estimating quantum expectation values using classical ensemble averaging, which could simplify computational efforts in quantum statistical mechanics.

Method: The authors extend Feynman and Hibbs' approach by treating quantum fluctuations about the path centroid differently and introduce approximate functional forms to improve numerical stability. The exactness in specific limits suggests analytical tractability.

Result: Numerical benchmarks for one-dimensional potentials with harmonic support validate the approach, demonstrating good agreement with exact distributions.

Conclusion: This work offers a promising alternative for efficient computation of quantum thermal properties using classical methods. Future work may explore the method's applicability beyond one-dimensional systems and refine the approximate functional forms for broader use.

Abstract: We present an effective potential that allows quantum thermal expectation values of a position-dependent observable to be estimated as a classical ensemble average of the corresponding function. We follow the approach of Feynman and Hibbs, but perform the mean-field treatment of quantum fluctuations about the path starting point rather than the path centroid. Furthermore, rather than performing a full variational optimization of the potential, we explore approximate functional forms that yield a numerical robustness. The resulting closed-form potential is exact in the classical and harmonic limits; benchmarks against exact position distributions for one-dimensional quartic, Morse, and double-well potentials, show good agreement for potentials with harmonic support.

Abstract: Estimating many local expectation values over time is a central measurement bottleneck in quantum simulation and device characterization. We study the task of reconstructing the Pauli-signal matrix $S_{ij}=\text{Tr}(O_i ρ(t_j))$ for a collection of $M$ low-weight Pauli observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^M$ over $N$ timesteps $\{t_j\}_{j=1}^N$, while minimizing the total number of device shots. We propose a Compressed Sensing Shadow Tomography (CSST) protocol that combines two complementary reductions. First, local classical shadows reduce the observable dimension by enabling many Pauli expectation values to be estimated from the same randomized snapshots at a fixed time. Second, compressed sensing reduces the time dimension by exploiting the fact that many expectation-value traces are spectrally sparse or compressible in a unitary (e.g., Fourier) transform basis. Operationally, CSST samples $m\ll N$ timesteps uniformly at random, collects shadows only at those times, and then reconstructs each length-$N$ signal via standard $\ell_1$-based recovery in the unitary transform domain. We provide end-to-end guarantees that explicitly combine shadow estimation error with compressed sensing recovery bounds. For exactly $s$-sparse signals in a unitary transform basis, we show that $m=O \left(s\log^2 s \log N\right)$ random timesteps suffice (with high probability), leading to total-shot savings scaling as $\widetildeΘ(N/s)$ (i.e., up to polylogarithmic factors) relative to collecting shadows at all $N$ timesteps. For approximately sparse signals, the reconstruction error decomposes into a compressibility (tail) term plus a noise term. We present numerical experiments on noisy many-qubit dynamics that support strong Fourier compressibility of Pauli traces and demonstrate substantial shot reductions with accurate reconstruction.

Abstract: Estimating thermal expectation values of observables is a fundamental task in quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. While recent quantum algorithms have enabled efficient quantum preparation of thermal states, observable estimation via sampling remains costly: a straightforward implementation separates successive measurements by a full mixing time in order to ensure samples are approximately independent. In this work, we show that the sampling cost can be substantially reduced by using a single Gibbs-sampling trajectory. After a single burn-in period, we interleave coherent measurements that satisfy detailed balance with respect to the target Gibbs state. The efficiency of this approach rests on the fact that, in many settings, the autocorrelation time can be significantly shorter than the mixing time. For energy estimation (and more generally for observables commuting with the Hamiltonian), we implement the required measurements using Gaussian-filtered quantum phase estimation with only logarithmic overhead. We also introduce a weighted operator Fourier transform technique to mitigate measurement-induced disturbance for general observables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding multipartite entanglement is crucial for quantum information theory and quantum computing.

Method: They introduce Sperner states, which are based on antichain hypergraphs, and define a Multi-entanglement Measure Space (MEMS) to quantify and classify entanglement structures.

Result: A comprehensive framework for classifying multipartite entanglement is established, providing a unified basis for future research.

Conclusion: This framework using antichain hypergraphs and MEMS offers a powerful tool for analyzing and categorizing multipartite entanglement.

Abstract: We establish a systematic classification scheme for multipartite entanglement structures. We define Sperner states -- a broad class of states where apparent multipartite entanglement decomposes into fewer-partite entanglement among subsystems of each party. Each class of Sperner states is associated with one antichain hypergraph and each hypergraph encodes the maximal entanglement structure permissible under its constraints. We introduce a Multi-entanglement Measure Space (MEMS) where each Sperner class corresponds to a linear subspace defined by the vanishing of specific linear combinations of bipartite and multipartite measures. The nonvanishing of such combinations signals multipartite entanglement beyond the associated hypergraph, thereby distinguishing entanglement structures. We build a two way connection between each hypergraph entanglement structure and a distinct set of combinations, thereby quantifying the entanglement pattern and providing a unified basis for classifying all multipartite entanglement.

Abstract: Floquet quantum error-correcting codes provide an operationally economical route to fault tolerance by dynamically generating stabilizer structures using only two-body Pauli measurements. But while it is well established that stabilizer codes in higher spatial dimensions gain additional levels of intrinsic robustness, higher-dimensional Floquet codes have hitherto been explored only in limited scope. Here we introduce a 3d generalization of a Floquet code whose instantaneous stabilizer group realizes a 3d fermionic toric code, while crucially preserving all three logical qubits throughout the entire measurement sequence. One central ingredient is the identification of a 3d lattice geometry that generalizes the features of the Kekulé lattice underlying the 2d Hastings-Haah code - specifically, a structure where deleting any one edge color yields a two-color subgraph that decomposes into short, closed loops rather than homologically nontrivial chains. This loop property avoids the collapse of logical information that plagues naive sequential two-color measurement schedules on many 3d lattices. Although, for our lattice geometry, a simple 3-round cycle that sequentially measures the three types of parity checks does not expose the full error syndrome set, we show that one can append a measurement sequence to extract the missing syndromes without disturbing the logical subspace. Beyond code design, 3d tricoordinated lattice geometries define a family of 3d monitored Kitaev models, in which random measurements of the non-commuting parity checks give rise to dynamically created entangled phases with nontrivial topology. In discussing the general structure of their underlying phase diagrams and, in particular, the existence of certain quantum critical points, we again make a connection to the general preservation of logical information in time-ordered Floquet protocols.

Abstract: A quantum backflow state refers to a quantum state exhibiting negative probability density flux albeit a completely positive momentum spectrum. Extending earlier work that uses single laser pulse to prepare quantum backflow state in an ultracold atomic BEC [1], we theoretical investigated flexible quantum backflow state preparation via large momentum transfer technique, which to our knowledge, has not been studied before. By combining atom interferometry theory and non-interacting BEC wave function, we solve for the evolution of a BEC wavepacket under atom interferometry sequence. Simulation results show a highly tunable backflow flux and critical density under our scheme, and can be manipulated to go beyond existing numbers.

TL;DR: A quantum probe's temperature sensitivity can be improved by designing its energy spectrum carefully, especially when it's near-degenerate. A multilevel system coupled to a cavity exhibits enhanced thermometric performance under certain conditions involving population transfer between bright and dark states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying the thermometric properties of quantum systems is crucial for applications in precision metrology and quantum information processing.

Method: The analysis uses the multilevel quantum Rabi model and derives an approximate closed-form expression for the thermal quantum Fisher information (QFI). Two limits are considered: dark-manifold saturation and bright-manifold saturation.

Result: Dark-manifold saturation enhances sensitivity with a robust peak, while bright-manifold saturation provides a broad temperature range stability.

Conclusion: The model shows promise as a versatile and sensitive equilibrium thermometer for various applications in quantum thermometry.

Abstract: The temperature sensitivity of a probe in equilibrium can be gauged by its thermal quantum Fisher information (QFI). It is known that probes exhibiting degeneracy in their energy-level structure can achieve larger sensitivities, while probes with a more uniform spectrum may remain sensitive over a broader temperature range. Here, we study the thermometric performance of a multilevel quantum Rabi model in which two well-separated atomic manifolds of near-degenerate levels couple to a single cavity mode. We generalise the standard quantum Rabi treatment in the adiabatic regime to find an approximate closed-form expression for the thermal QFI. We then characterise two complementary limits. On the one hand, a large dark-state manifold (dark-manifold saturation) produces a robust peak in thermal sensitivity due to bright--dark population transfer. Such increase in sensitivity is further maximised at an intermediate light--matter coupling strength. Maximising instead the number of bright states (bright-manifold saturation) generates a broadband thermal response that becomes increasingly stable under random light--matter couplings as the number of levels is increased. The rich spectral structure of our cavity-QED model thus makes it a versatile and sensitive equilibrium thermometer over a broad range of temperatures.

*Alexander Popov,Nico Meyer,Daniel D. Scherer,Guido Dietl*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: An efficient method for compiling quantum circuits into fault-tolerant quantum computing primitives. Uses [[n,n-2,2]] codes to compare and improve compilation strategies, showing reduced error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient quantum computing requires reliable and fault-tolerant methods for translating high-level circuits into actionable code. Current methods often result in deep circuits with high overhead, limiting their practicality. The study aims to address this gap by proposing a new compilation strategy focusing on quantum simulation primitives.

Method: This study focuses on the [[n,n-2,2]] code family, exhaustively comparing potential compilation primitives on small circuit instances. A methodology is introduced to lift these primitives into size-invariant, depth-efficient compilation strategies. This approach recovers known methods for circuits with moderate Hadamard counts and improves realizations for both sparse and dense placements.

Result: Simulations demonstrate significant reductions in error rates in the compiled circuits, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed approach represents a valuable contribution to the field of quantum compiling, offering a flexible and low-handling burden method that can be extended to other circuit structures and code families.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing hinges on efficient logical compilation, in particular, translating high-level circuits into code-compatible implementations. Gate-by-gate compilation often yields deep circuits, requiring significant overhead to ensure fault-tolerance. As an alternative, we investigate the compilation of primitives from quantum simulation as single blocks. We focus our study on the [[n,n-2,2]] code family, which allows for the exhaustive comparison of potential compilation primitives on small circuit instances. Based upon that, we then introduce a methodology that lifts these primitives into size-invariant, depth-efficient compilation strategies. This recovers known methods for circuits with moderate Hadamard counts and yields improved realizations for sparse and dense placements. Simulations show significant error-rate reductions in the compiled circuits. We envision the approach as a core component of peephole-based compilers. Its flexibility and low hand-crafting burden make it readily extensible to other circuit structures and code families.

Abstract: Quantum metrology exploits quantum mechanical effects to increase the precision of measurements of physical quantities. A wide variety of applications are currently being developed for scientific and technological purposes, however, most research relies on the use of highly entangled resource states that are challenging to generate and control in a given physical system. Here, we study the use of weighted graph states as more accessible resources for quantum metrology, which yield a favorable precision beyond the classical limit, approaching the Heisenberg limit. We find a notable robustness to variation in weights and less challenging weight requirements compared to standard graph states, which require a maximal weight at all edges. Both of these aspects reduce the practical demands in a physical setup, with the latter implying significantly less entanglement is required to gain a quantum advantage in metrology. We study the quantum Fisher information and optimized estimator variance of two identified sub classes of weighted graph states for an arbitrary number of N qubits, providing analytical forms and investigating their scaling. Our work opens up opportunities for using weakly entangled states in quantum-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: We present a quantum reservoir computing (QRC) framework based on a small-scale quantum system comprising at most six interacting qubits, designed for nonlinear financial time-series forecasting. We apply the model to predict future daily closing trading volumes of 20 quantum-sector publicly traded companies over the period from April 11, 2020, to April 11, 2025, as well as minute-by-minute trading volumes during out-of-market hours on July 7, 2025. Our analysis identifies optimal reservoir parameters that yield stock trend (up/down) classification accuracies exceeding $86 \%$. Importantly, the QRC model is platform-agnostic and can be realized across diverse physical implementations of qubits, including superconducting circuits and trapped ions. These results demonstrate the expressive power and robustness of small-scale quantum reservoirs for modeling complex temporal correlations in financial data, highlighting their potential applicability to real-world forecasting tasks on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: We present a rigorous and comprehensive classification of the asymptotic behavior of time-quasiperiodic Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equations under the assumption of Hermitian jump operators. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of steady states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the algebra generated by the GKSL generators and provides a necessary and sufficient condition when the generators are analytic functions of time. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion through prototypical examples, including quantum many-body spin chains. Second, we extend the concept of strong symmetry for time-dependent GKSL equations by introducing two distinct forms, strong symmetry in the Schrödinger picture and that in the interaction picture, and completely classify the asymptotic dynamics with them. More concretely, we rigorously uncover that the strong symmetry in the interaction picture is responsible for non-trivial time-dependent steady states, such as coherent oscillations, whereas that in the Schrödinger picture controls the existence of time-independent steady states. This classification not only encompasses established mechanisms underlying non-trivial oscillatory steady states, such as strong dynamical symmetry and Floquet dynamical symmetry, but also reveals symmetry-predicted, time-dependent asymptotic dynamics in a novel class of open quantum systems. Our framework thus provides a rigorous foundation for controlling dissipative quantum systems in a time-dependent manner.

Conclusion: 该研究深入研究了 Welch界限在有限纯量子态分布在 Hilbert空间中的应用，并为理解这些界限的适用性和限定条件提供了新的见解。该结论对未来研究量子态分布的精确性和应用具有重要参考价值。

Abstract: A fundamental question asks how uniformly finite sets of pure quantum states can be distributed in a Hilbert space. The Welch bounds address this question, and are saturated by $k$-designs, i.e. sets of states reproducing the $k$-th Haar moments. However, these bounds quickly become uninformative when the number of states is below that required for an exact $k$-design. We derive strengthened Welch-type inequalities that remain sharp in this regime by exploiting rank constraints from partial transposition and spectral properties of the partially transposed Haar moment operator. We prove that the deviation from the Welch bound captures the average-case approximation error, hence characterizing a natural notion of minimum achievable error at fixed cardinality. For $k=3$, we prove that SICs and complete MUB sets saturate our bounds, making them optimal approximate 3-designs of their cardinality. This leads a natural variational criterion to rule out the existence of a complete set MUBs, which we use to obtain numerical evidence against such set in dimension $6$. As a key technical ingredient, we compute the complete spectrum of the partially transposed symmetric-subspace projector, including multiplicities and eigenvectors, which may find applications beyond the present work.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pauli channels are widely used to describe errors in quantum computers, particularly when noise is shaped via Pauli twirling. A common assumption is that such channels admit a Markovian generator, namely a Pauli-Lindblad model with non-negative rates, but the validity of this assumption has not been systematically examined. Here, using CP-indivisibility as our criterion for non-Markovianity, we study multi-qubit Pauli channels from a single snapshot of the dynamics. We find that while the generator always has the same structure as the standard Pauli-Lindblad model, the rates may be negative or complex. We show that random Pauli channels are almost always non-Markovian, with the probability of encountering a negative rate converging doubly exponentially to unity with the number of qubits. For physically motivated noise models shaped by Pauli twirling, including single-qubit over-rotations and two-qubit amplitude damping errors, we find that negative rates are generic, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. We generalize probabilistic error amplification and cancellation to non-Markovian generators, and quantify the sampling overhead introduced by negative and complex rates. Experiments on superconducting qubits confirm that allowing negative rates in the learned noise model yields more accurate predictions than restricting to non-negative rates.

Abstract: The Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) provides the standard starting point for strong-coupling thermodynamics, yet explicit operator forms are known only in restricted settings. We present a quenched density framework that uses the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to rewrite the reduced equilibrium state as an average over local propagators in imaginary time. This approach rigorously separates the statistical definition of the environment from the algebraic structure of the system response. We apply this framework to the minimal case of a harmonic environment with a coupling commuting with the system Hamiltonian. In this scenario the correction to the HMF has an exact, closed-form expression. We validate this result against finite-bath trace-out calculations and stochastic imaginary-time sampling in a five-level projector-coupled model.

Abstract: We establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing the infrared (IR) phases of a fermionic quantum theory in three spatial dimensions, based on its quantum anomalies associated with a finite symmetry. We uncover a fundamental dichotomy among these anomalies: the first class of anomalies can always be realized by symmetric gapped states, while the second class can never be realized by gapped states without breaking the given symmetry, establishing the phenomenon of symmetry-enforced gaplessness in these settings. Moreover, using the construction of symmetry extension, we construct the candidate gapped states that theories with the first class of anomalies can flow to in the IR. As an application, we provide concrete predictions of the candidate IR phases of (3+1)-dimensional gauge theories based on our results. Our results also suggest that systems with discrete chiral anomalies cannot be gapped out by adding arbitrary bosonic degrees of freedom.

Abstract: Any quantum state is fully specified by the expectation values of a complete set of Hermitian operators. For a system of Majorana fermions, such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, this set of observables can be taken to be all possible strings of Majorana fermion operators. The expectation values of these fermion strings in a thermal state depend erratically on the microscopic couplings that specify the SYK Hamiltonian, and we study their statistical properties directly in the thermodynamic limit using path integral techniques. When the underlying SYK Hamiltonian is chaotic, we find that these expectation values are well-modeled as real Gaussian random variables with zero mean and a variance that we compute. In contrast, for the integrable variant of SYK, we find that the expectation values are actually non-Gaussian. We then use these results to study measures of magic in the SYK thermal state, including the robustness of magic and the stabilizer Rényi entropy. We also show that our results can be quantitatively reproduced with a dual gravity calculation in the chaotic case at sufficiently low temperature. In this dual gravity model the variance of a given microscopic operator string is related to a wormhole geometry stabilized by a massive particle which is dual to the operator string. Our results thus provide a concrete and quantitative setting in which to study the relationship between randomness, wormholes, and closed universes as well as a holographic dual of quantum magic.

Abstract: Critical points of classical and quantum lattice models are often described by scale-invariant Lifshitz theories which are anisotropic in the continuum limit, as characterized by a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq1$. This type of critical behavior can in principle be studied by deforming ordinary $z=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) by relevant vector operators breaking the rotational/Lorentz symmetry. In this short note, we consider a two-dimensional system of coupled minimal model CFTs $\mathcal{M}_{m,m+1}$ which realizes this perspective in a controlled fashion via Zamolodchikov's large $m$ expansion. The model turns out to exhibit interesting properties, including a manifold of interacting Lifshitz fixed points and emergent rotational symmetry in the infrared.

Abstract: Axion models often face the domain wall problem, which threatens the standard big-bang cosmology. The Lazarides-Shafi mechanism attempts to resolve this by identifying degenerate vacua through a continuous gauge symmetry. We formulate a topological quantum field theory to isolate the essential structure of the mechanism and analyze its generalized symmetry structure, including higher-form symmetries and higher-group. This framework yields a master formula for computing the domain wall number and clarifies the higher-form symmetry conditions required for complete vacuum identification in a model independent way. Moreover, while a domain-wall-number-one scenario eliminates all higher-form global symmetries, the theory nevertheless exhibits a nontrivial four-group structure and realizes a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase.

Abstract: We consider a composite system where AdS$_3$ gravity is coupled to a flat heat bath and investigate the mutual information between two subregions on the intersection of the AdS$_3$ and bath, referred to as the boundary mutual information (BMI). The corresponding entanglement entropy is captured via quantum extremal surfaces (QES), which holographically be computed by a surface optimization algorithm based on ``Surface Evolver''. We focus on both connected and disconnected configurations of the quantum entanglement wedge (Q-EW) in the AdS$_3$ bulk and analyze the finite corrections to the BMI. Our numerical results reveal a phase transition of the BMI as the separation between two subregions increases. Furthermore, we find that the BMI can naturally be decomposed into two distinct components: a geometric term arising from the areas of the quantum extremal surfaces, and a correction term resulting from bulk quantum fields within the Q-EW. Interestingly, the geometric contribution always exceeds the total BMI, indicating a negative correction from the bulk matter fields. This negativity can be understood as the result of subtracting a greater contribution from quantum fields in the connected Q-EW than in the disconnected one. We also reproduce the negative contribution of bulk quantum fields to BMI within a random tensor network (RTN) toy model of double holography. Modeling the bulk as a highly mixed state entangled with a large bath leads to a volume-law bulk entropy. In the large bond-dimension limit, the geometric part of the BMI remains non-negative, while the bulk entropy contribution becomes non-positive when the Q-EWs merge.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the higher-group symmetry structure of a five-dimensional topological theory, which is described by a 3-crossed module. The model is obtained by an five-dimensional extension of topological axion electrodynamics in four dimensions. To study the symmetry structure, we couple background gauge fields to the symmetry currents via Stueckelberg couplings. We show that background gauge invariance requires modified gauge transformation laws, indicating the existence of a higher-group structure. Furthermore, we identify the underlying mathematical structure as a 3-crossed module by regarding the modified Stueckelberg couplings as curvatures of a higher-group gauge theory. We demonstrate that the gauge transformation laws derived from this algebraic structure are consistent with the analysis based on the gauge invariance. While our previous work introduced the concept of a 3-crossed module motivated by higher-group symmetries, this work provides concrete verification that this framework correctly captures the symmetry structure of physical theories.

Abstract: We discuss the open/closed version of the Gromov-Witten/Hurwitz correspondence. The duality equates the relative Gromov-Witten invariants and the count of covers of the target space with prescribed holonomies at boundaries. We clarify the projective large N limit as well as the role of the completed versus the ordinary cycles associated to the bulk and the boundary vertex operators respectively. We provide an example check of both the correspondence and the fact that cycles dual to closed strings need to be completed. Moreover, we identify the connected world sheets that contribute to an equivariantly localized amplitude in the bulk that is solely due to a completion term. We also propose a picture for the completed cycle combinatorics that involves a localization diagram glued to a cut-and-join string interaction.

Abstract: We show that string theory on the geometry $BTZ\times S^3\times M$ supported with either Neveu-Schwarz flux or Ramond flux admits states which obey identical dispersion relations to those of classical solutions like circular strings, giant magnons, or plane wave excitations in the geometry $ AdS_3 \times S^3 \times M$. Here, $M$ can be $T^4$, $K3$, or $S^3\times S^1$. This is made possible by the map, which takes the particle at the origin of $AdS_3$ with angular momentum along one of the angles of $S_3$ to a particle falling into the BTZ horizon. We use this map to construct circular strings, magnons, as well as plane waves in the BTZ geometry. We show that the $SL(2, R)$ charges of these states on $AdS_3$ and that of the corresponding states in the BTZ geometry are related by a boost. The dual description of these states in the BTZ geometry are local quench in the thermal CFT. These quenches carry energy density, $R$-charges, non-trivial expectation value of the marginal operator dual to the dilaton and move on the light cone in CFT. In general, the left and the right moving quenches are not symmetric.

Abstract: Within the light-front approach in flat space, we study the closure of the Poincare algebra at the quartic order, specifically the nonholomorphic constraint involving both MHV and anti-MHV vertices. We first recover some well-established results: the existence of Yang-Mills theory and gravity, as well as the inconsistency of interacting multi-graviton theories. We explicitly construct several lower-derivative and lower-spin quartic vertices. We then turn to theories involving massless higher-spin fields. It becomes evident that the quartic constraint does not allow many cubic interactions to survive, in accordance with the well-known no-go results. Nevertheless, once higher-derivative cubic vertices are included, we find nontrivial solutions to the full quartic constraint and determine the corresponding quartic vertices. On this basis, we conjecture the complete set of quartic vertices that solve the light-cone consistency conditions. Exploiting this, we find all allowed unitary local higher-spin theories and identify new families of local quasi-chiral higher-spin theories. We then determine all local higher-spin four-point amplitudes using the spinor-helicity formalism together with locality. We conclude with a short discussion on non-locality and propose a ``local'' (at the amplitude level) higher-spin theory in flat space.

Abstract: Thermal correlators in holographic CFTs on a sphere exhibit bulk-cone singularities at points connected by null geodesics in the bulk. The operator product expansion analysis of the stress-tensor sector of the correlator shows that there are analogous singularities at spacelike separation for thermal CFTs on a plane. We show that these are associated with complex null geodesics. There is a phase transition between the real and complex spacelike geodesics underpinning this picture. We also provide a phase-shift calculation of the position of these generalised bulk-cone singularities.

Abstract: In these lecture notes, a group-theoretical introduction to BMS symmetries is provided in a self-contained manner. More precisely, all definitions and structures are purely based on geometrical and group-theoretical notions defined at null infinity and valid in any dimension, in a way that circumvents its traditional bulk realisation as asymptotic symmetries. The topics which are reviewed are: the definition of BMS transformations as conformal Carrollian isometries of null infinity, the semidirect structure of the BMS group, the holographic reconstruction of Minkowski spacetime in terms of good cuts, the one-to-one correspondence between good cut subspaces and Poincaré subgroups (aka vacua), as well as a basic introduction to unitary representations of the BMS group.

Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.

Abstract: Codimension-two vortex solutions are important solitonic objects in both quantum field theory and gravity. In this paper, we construct a class of codimension-two Alice-vortex solutions in axio-dilaton gravity, in which monodromy around the vortex enacts the axion transformation $C_0 \mapsto -C_0$. In IIB supergravity, this furnishes a class of R7-brane backgrounds of the sort predicted by the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture. Such configurations generically carry an intrinsic dipole moment. We extract additional properties of such branes from scattering probes. These results provide further evidence that the worldvolume theory of an R7-brane is an 8D non-supersymmetric interacting quantum field theory.

Abstract: We present a rotationally invariant viscous vertex model that accounts for both cortical and bulk dissipations of cells. The vanishing substrate-friction limit is enforced via Lagrange multipliers, which also provide a route to strongly constrained boundary conditions such as fixed boundaries and prescribed tractions. Building on this formulation, we introduce a slab-shear rheology protocol to extract an effective, coarse-grained tissue shear viscosity. Under polar or nematic activity, viscosity regulates the formation of elongated, spatially correlated cell-shape textures and stabilizes well-defined topological defects. Because the model remains well-posed at zero substrate friction, it is naturally suited to describing free-floating epithelia and organoids.

Abstract: We develop a geometric and analytic framework for polynomial partial differential equations posed on thin annuli in the plane. Using renormalized Sobolev inner products, we construct Sobolev orthogonal polynomial bases adapted to the thin geometry and use them to define stable Galerkin approximations.
  We prove a general dimension-reduction theorem for polynomial Hamiltonian and dissipative PDEs, showing that solutions converge to effective one-dimensional dynamics on the limiting circle. Beyond the leading-order limit, we identify transverse defect correctors and derive cell problems describing anisotropic dispersive and homogenized effects.
  Our framework applies uniformly to integrable models (KdV, modified KdV, nonlinear Schrödinger, sine--Gordon), anisotropic dispersive systems such as Zakharov--Kuznetsov, and non-integrable perturbations including dissipation, forcing, and rapidly oscillating coefficients. We establish stability of the effective dynamics under changes of Sobolev order and of polynomial Hilbert geometry, and show robustness of the associated Galerkin schemes.
  The results provide a unified geometric perspective on dimension reduction, homogenization, and integrability in thin geometries, and introduce Sobolev orthogonal polynomial methods as a constructive tool for multiscale PDE analysis.

Abstract: We investigate an interacting Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator with a Landau-Ginzburg type interaction term and analyse its classical dynamics from a geometric and numerical point of view. We show that the resulting fourth-order equation of motion admits a conformal bi-Hamiltonian formulation, possesses a non-trivial set of Lie symmetries and we demonstrate the existence of bounded and regular trajectories in representative parameter regimes. By establishing an explicit correspondence with an integrable generalised Hénon-Heiles system, we show that the interacting higher-derivative dynamics inherits the integrability properties of the latter. This connection allows us to construct a second conserved Hamiltonian, to clarify the geometric origin of separability, and to obtain explicit classical solutions in terms of elliptic functions. Our results provide a concrete example of an interacting higher-derivative system for which integrability and periodic classical solutions can be established in a fully explicit manner.

Abstract: We theoretically study the effects of magnonic Kerr nonlinearity on magnon-polaritons (MPs) with a soft-mode in easy-axis ferromagnets coupled to a microwave cavity. Using an effective circuit model capable of describing MPs up to the nonperturbative strong-coupling regime, we show that chaotic and frequency-comb-like behaviors of MPs emerge at the original modes crossing point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity induces a finite excitation gap in the soft-mode, particularly in the strong-coupling regime.

Abstract: We report the results of magnetotransport experiments carried out on low-disorder 2D hole gases (2DHG) in the strongly correlated liquid regime, hosted in dopant-free (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunctions. Over a wide range of 2DHG densities (from 0.7 $\times$ 10$^{15}$/m$^2$ to $2 \times 10^{15}$/m$^2$), Fourier analysis of low-field (B < 1 T) Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole (HH) subbands with distinct effective masses contributing to transport. Surprisingly, the lighter-mass HH subband exhibits a parabolic dispersion with Fermi wavevector below the anticrossing between the heavy-hole and light-hole subbands, while the heavier HH subband is non-parabolic throughout. Quantitative comparison with numerical calculations based on the Luttinger model reveals that both effective masses are enhanced by a common factor ($\approx$ 2.3), which we attribute to many-body interactions. This common scaling factor has a very weak dependence on the 2DHG density, likely due to band hybridization. Our measured hole masses are compared with published cyclotron resonance and magnetotransport values. We propose a cohesive framework reconciling the long-standing three-way discrepancy between Luttinger theory, magnetotransport, and cyclotron resonance measurements of density-dependent effective masses in partially spin-orbit-polarized heavy-hole systems in GaAs.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the nonlinear magneto-optical shift conductivity in the surface states of the prototypical topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ under a perpendicular quantizing magnetic field. By describing the electronic states as Landau levels and using a perturbative approach, we derive the microscopic expression for the shift conductivity $σ^{(2);αβγ}(-ω,ω)$, where $α,β,γ=\pm$ stand for the circular polarization of light and $ω$ is the light frequency; the spectra are further decomposed into contributions from the interband and intraband optical transitions, for which the selection rules are identified. Considering that the system possesses $C_3$ point group of symmetry, the nonzero components of the conductivity tensor are $σ^{(2);-++}=[σ^{(2);+--}]^\ast$. Therefore, a pure circularly polarized light generates zero shift current. In the clean limit, the conductivities are nonzero only for discrete photon energies because of the discrete Landau levels and energy conservation, and they become Lorentzian lineshapes with the inclusion of damping, which relaxes the condition of energy conservation. The dependence of the spectra on the damping parameters, the magnetic fields, and the chemical potentials is investigated in detail. Our results reveal that the shift current is highly tunable by the chemical potential and the magnetic field. These results underscore the potential of topological insulators for tunable, strong nonlinear magneto-optical applications.

Abstract: We study crossed Andreev reflection occurring in quantum dots connected to one superconducting lead and two normal leads at low temperatures $T$. Specifically, we derive an exact formula for the conductance up to order $T^2$ in the large superconducting gap limit, which is expressed in terms of the transmission probabilities of Cooper pairs and interacting Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our formulation is based on the latest version of Fermi-liquid theory for the Anderson impurity model, which has clarified the quasiparticle energy shifts of order $ω^2$ and $T^2$ -- that is, corrections of the same order as those arising from the finite lifetime of quasiparticles -- can be exactly taken into account through three-body correlations of impurity electrons. We also demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve and affect the Cooper-pair tunneling as the Andreev level moves away from the Fermi level, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The results demonstrate that the Cooper-pair contribution to the $T^2$ term of the nonlocal conductance becomes comparable to the Bogoliubov-quasiparticle contribution in the parameter region where superconducting proximity effects dominate over the Kondo effect.

Abstract: Strong light fields have unlocked previously unthinkable possibilities to tailor coherent electron trajectories, engineer band structures and shape emergent phases of matter all-optically. Unravelling the underlying quantum mechanisms requires a visualisation of the lightwave-driven electron motion directly in the band structure. While photoelectron momentum microscopy has imaged optically excited electrons averaged over many cycles of light, actual subcycle band-structure videography has been limited to small electron momenta. Yet lightwave-driven elementary processes in quantum materials often occur throughout momentum space. Here, we introduce attosecond-precision, subcycle band-structure videography covering the entire first Brillouin zone (BZ) and visualize one of the most fundamental but notoriously elusive strong-field processes: non-adiabatic Landau-Zener-Majorana (LZM) tunnelling. The interplay of field-driven acceleration within the Dirac-like band structure of graphene and periodic LZM interband tunnelling manifest in a coherent displacement and distortion of the momentum distribution at the BZ edge. The extremely non-thermal electron distributions also allow us to disentangle competing scattering processes and assess their impact on coherent electronic control through electron redistribution and thermalization. Our panoramic view of strong-field-driven electron motion in quantum materials lays the foundation for a microscopic understanding of some of the most discussed light-driven phenomena in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: The discovery of critical points that can host quantized nonlocal order parameters and degenerate edge modes relocate the study of symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs) to gapless regions. In this letter, we reveal gapless SPTs (gSPTs) in systems tuned out-of-equilibrium by periodic drivings and non-Hermitian couplings. Focusing on one-dimensional models with sublattice symmetry, we introduce winding numbers by applying the Cauchy's argument principle to generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), yielding unified topological characterizations and bulk-edge correspondence in both gapped phases and at gapless critical points. The theory is demonstrated in a broad class of Floquet bipartite lattices, unveiling unique topological criticality of non-Hermitian Floquet origin. Our findings identify gSPTs in driven open systems and uncover robust topological edge modes at phase transitions beyond equilibrium.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the plasmon modes of alternating-twist multilayer graphene. In multilayer systems, interlayer coupling gives rise to distinctive plasmon modes, but calculations in moiré systems remain challenging due to their complex tunneling structures. Using the Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz formalism, we derive that the in-phase mode exhibits the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, while the out-of-phase modes acquire plasmon gaps determined by specific interband transitions between Dirac cones with different velocities in the long-wavelength limit. We demonstrate that these out-of-phase modes remain undamped in the weak Coulomb-interaction limit when the twist angle exceeds a critical value ($θ\gtrsim 2.75^\circ$ for the alternating-twist trilayer case), regardless of the carrier density as long as the low-energy effective Dirac Hamiltonian remains valid. Furthermore, we consider the effect of a perpendicular electric field, and demonstrate how plasmon modes can be tuned by a gate voltage.

Abstract: We provide a systematic framework to investigate the magnetoplasmons of multilayer two-dimensional electron systems by using the Kac--Murdock--Szegő (KMS) Toeplitz matrix to consider interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of interlayer tunneling, we show that the single-layer magnetoplasmon branch splits into $N$ collective modes -- one in-phase mode and $N-1$ out-of-phase modes -- and derive their asymptotic behaviors in the long-wavelength limit, as well as in the limit of large layer separation and strong magnetic fields. When interlayer tunneling is present, we clarify the magnetoplasmon dispersion, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by identifying the magnetoplasmon mode associated with each interband transition, as well as tunneling magnetoplasmons arising from interband transitions with the same Landau level index. Our study presents the hybridization between the modes governed by underlying symmetries, along with an enhanced tunneling magnetoplasmon gap exceeding the associated interband gap. The KMS-based analytic formalism thus provides a comprehensive physical understanding of magnetoplasmons in multilayer structures.

Motivation: Understanding the existence and properties of charge bound states in PbTe quantum dots is crucial for advancing quantum device applications.

Method: Through a series of PbTe nanowires with varying cross-sectional areas, the evolution of the charge confined state energy gap was systematically investigated using transport measurements.

Result: The material exhibits measurable charge confined state energy gaps only when the cross-sectional area drop below 500 nm$^2$, with the energy gaps reaching up to 210 μeV. Furthermore, local gates based on tunable surface gates were demonstrated for PbTe quantum devices operating from quantum dot transport to ballistic transport regimes.

Conclusion: PbTe可以作为具有 giant dielectric constant、 Berry曲率驱动电荷束缚态和高度可调电子传输特性的量子点材料，为高电容率材料和量子点器件开发提供了新的思路和研究方向。

Abstract: Charging energy ($E_C$) is essential in quantum dot (QD) devices. Previous studies on PbTe QDs have reported both the presence and absence of $E_C$. To resolve this ambiguity, we vary the QD size, i.e. the cross-sectional area of PbTe nanowires, and track the evolution of $E_C$. For large crosssectional areas ($\sim$ 16000 nm$^2$), the PbTe QDs exhibit no measurable $E_C$, while quantized levels are well resolved. Decreasing this area successively to 5000, 1500, and 500 nm$^2$, $E_C$ becomes finite and increases to 80, 160, and 210 $μ$eV, respectively. We further demonstrate the strong tunability of local gates, which can tune the PbTe device from the QD regime to the regime of ballistic transport. These results address concerns regarding the large dielectric constant of PbTe and provide key insights in engineering advanced PbTe quantum devices.

Abstract: The dispersion curves for the electrons and holes in CsPbI$_3$ in the orthorhombic phase are calculated using the density functional theory (DFT), with the spin-orbit coupling taken into account. The effective masses of the charge carriers are obtained using the parabolic approximation of the dispersion curves in different directions in the $k$-space. It is found that the dispersion curves demonstrate strong nonparabolicity at energies above 0.2 eV for electrons and above 0.1 eV for holes, available for experimental study by the means of optical spectroscopy. We propose a model that describes the dispersion dependences of charge carriers at those energies, where the effective masses of the quasiparticles depend quadratically on the wave vector. An expression is obtained according to the model, which can accurately approximate the dispersion curves for the electron and the hole in all symmetric directions from the center to the boundary of the Brillouin zone.

Abstract: We proof the non-renormalization of the Hall viscosity by Coulomb interactions for integer and fractional quantum Hall Jain states building on previous results obtained for the Hall conductivity. We employ Wigner-Weyl calculus in order to represent the Hall viscosity in terms of a topological invariant comprised of Green functions and work within the composite fermion field theory model of Jain states of the fractional quantum Hall fluid presented by Lopez and Fradkin. The topological expression is first derived within the free field theory of electrons and explicitly calculated for this case as well as in the mean field approximation of the composite fermion theory Jain states. The topological orbital spin of composite fermions distinguishes their mean field treatment from that of electrons resulting in an additional topological contribution. We then argue that the introduction of Coulomb interactions does not lead to perturbative corrections of the Hall viscosity in both integer and fractional quantum Hall fluids. The proof relies on the assumptions of homogeneity and rotational invariance of an underlying sample modulo the vector potential giving rise to the homogeneous external magnetic field. These conditions imply a Hall viscosity per emergent quasiparticle number density quantized in units of one half times the average quasiparticle orbital spin or one quarter times the Wen-Zee shift. The latter features a contribution from the composite fermion topological orbital spin relative to that of electrons.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are influenced by their size is crucial for advancing graphene-based nanotechnology applications, such as electronics and sensing.

Method: The authors used computational modeling of electric fields and conductance in GNRs with an AFM tip to explore the size-dependent electrical properties, and then employed high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) to confirm their findings experimentally.

Result: The computational modeling revealed that the CNP shifts towards lower values as the GNR width decreases due to enhanced edge electric fields, but a sign change is not expected. Experimental results using SGM showed no significant differences between the edges and bulk of GNRs, suggesting that the CNP change is not due to differential doping but rather variations in the band structure with size.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into the size-dependent electrical properties of GNRs, particularly the CNP behavior, which is influenced by edge effects and band structure variations. The findings have implications for the design and application of GNR-based nanoscale devices.

Abstract: Recent works have shown how the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) show a size-dependence in terms of resistivity, charge neutrality point (CNP) and band structure once their widths drop below approximately 50 nm. It has been observed that the CNP switches sign below a certain GNR width, and in this article, we explore this via computational modelling of the electric field and the conductance of GNRs in the presence of an AFM tip. We show that CNP is expected to shift towards lower values as GNR width reduces as a result of the significantly enhanced electric field around edges, but that a change in sign is not expected. We also show experimentally via high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) that there does not appear to be any significant difference between the edges and the bulk of a GNR, indicating that the switch in CNP is not due to differential doping, and may instead be due to variations in the band structure as a function of size.

*Aditi A. Prabhudesai,H. S. Chhabra,Suraj S. Hegde*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper studies a non-reciprocal Haldane model with time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings (ERs) in its spectrum. The system on a cylinder with zig-zag boundaries exhibits non-chiral edge states at $k_x = oldsymbol{	op}$ with zero group velocity. These edge states bifurcate at exceptional points (EPs) in the Brillouin zone (BZ) and delocalize into the bulk. Non-reciprocal hoppings lead to EP-cascades as the bulk states near EPs convert into pairs due to non-Hermiticity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper expands the understanding of non-Hermitian topological phases by introducing a non-reciprocal Haldane model, which exhibits exceptional rings (ERs) in the spectrum. These ERs act as Berry curvature flux tubes, and their associated edge states provide a unique platform for studying topological phase transitions and non-Hermitian skin effects. The paper also explores the EP-cascade phenomenon, where non-reciprocal hoppings lead to nested proliferation of EPs, creating a step-like structure in EP-pair density. The tunable regime where non-chiral edge states remain stabilized over long times is particularly interesting, as it offers a novel approach to controlling edge-state dynamics in such systems.

Method: The authors analyze the system using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. They derive the Hamiltonian for the non-reciprocal Haldane model on a torus and a cylinder with zig-zag boundaries. They identify the conditions for time-reversal symmetry protection and the emergence of ERs. Using wave packet dynamics, they demonstrate the stability of non-chiral edge states and the transition to delocalization at EPs. They also perform a detailed study of the EP-cascade phenomenon, identifying regions of parameter space where the proliferation of EPs is nested.

Result: The paper reveals several key findings: (i) the non-reciprocal Haldane model on a torus hosts time-reversal symmetry-protected ERs, which are Berry curvature flux tubes; (ii) on a cylinder with zig-zag boundaries, the system exhibits non-chiral edge states that bifurcate at EPs in the BZ; (iii) as non-Hermiticity increases, the bulk states approaching EPs convert into pairs of EPs; (iv) a nested proliferation of EP pairs occurs at specific non-Hermiticity values, leading to an EP-cascade; (v) wave packet dynamics show that non-chiral edge states can be dynamically stabilized for large timescales under weak non-Hermiticity, but become delocalized at larger times if the non-Hermiticity parameter exceeds a critical value; (vi) the study identifies the conditions for these phenomena and provides a step-like structure in the EP-pair density as a function of non-Hermiticity.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for exploring non-Hermitian topological phases in Kitaev honeycomb-like models and other related systems. The identification of EP-cascades, tunable edge-state stabilization, and their implications for the stability of edge modes under non-Hermitian perturbations are significant contributions to the understanding of non-Hermitian skin effects and topological phase transitions in 2D lattice models.

Abstract: We study a variant of the Haldane honeycomb model that has non-reciprocal hoppings between the next-nearest neighbours. The system on a torus hosts time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings(ER) in the spectrum. The ERs act as Berry-curvature flux tubes i.e the Berry curvature is non-zero only inside the ERs. The system on a cylinder having zig-zag boundaries (and transverse momentum $k_x$) hosts edge-states that have zero group velocity at $k_x=π$ and are therefore `non-chiral'. The edge states undergo a bifurcation transition at an exceptional point(EP)in the BZ and delocalise into the bulk. As the non-reciprocity is increased, the bulk states that are approaching each other are converted into pairs of EPs due to non-Hermiticity. As the non-reciprocity is further increased, there is a `Russian doll'-like nested proliferation of pairs of EPs, leading to an EP-cascade. The proliferation of EPs takes place only at specific values of the non-hermiticity parameter, leading to a step-like structure in the EP-pair density when plotted as a function of non-Hermiticity. Further, using wave packet dynamics, we find a tunable regime where the non-chiral edge states can be dynamically stabilised for large timescales. The `self-acceleration' term in the equations of motion tends to diffuse the wave packets into the bulk, thus making them `ephemeral edge states'. But we find that for small non-hermiticity, the edge localisation is stabilised until late times for sufficiently wider wave packets. Thus, we have brought forth an intriguing phenomenology of the exceptional phase of the non-reciprocal Haldane model, which may bear direct relevance for systems such as disordered Kitaev honeycomb model, wherein such ERs have been predicted.

### [83] [Consistent inclusion of triple substitutions within a coupled cluster based static quantum embedding theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12330)
*Avijit Shee,Fabian M. Faulstich,K. Birgitta Whaley,Lin Lin,Martin Head-Gordon*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPCCSDT(pt) and MPCCSDT(it) methods, which improve upon the CCSD(T) method by incorporating fragment and environment triples amplitudes with perturbative corrections. Feedback from environment triples to fragment amplitudes is included in the iterative MPCCSDT(it) method. A modified low-level approach is also presented, which accounts for long-range effects. The methods are tested on challenging systems. Results indicate that triples at the fragment level alone are insufficient, necessitating perturbative corrections in the environment. Feedback from the environment is beneficial, particularly for difficult molecules. An improved perturbative method is required for some challenging cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the accuracy of electron correlation methods for challenging systems like large or long-range correlated molecules by introducing a novel embedding approach with perturbative corrections to triples amplitudes.

Method: Centers-including fragment (CC-in-F) methods are enhanced by incorporating perturbative corrections to the fragment and environment triples amplitudes. The iterative MPCCSDT(it) method is developed to account for feedback between fragments and the environment. A new low-level method includes a perturbation for selected long-range effects, such as spin fluctuations and charge polarization.

Result: MPCCSDT(it) provides significant accuracy improvements over MPCCSDT(pt) for challenging test cases. Perturbative corrections to triples amplitudes are essential for accurate calculations, particularly for large systems in non-covalent interactions. The iterative correction between fragment and environment triples is critical for certain difficult molecules. An improved molar-level correction is needed for some challenging cases.

Conclusion: The presented methods advance CC-in-F theory by introducing perturbative corrections to the triple amplitudes and iterative corrections between fragment and environment triples. The modified low-level method adds an effective treatment of selected long-range correlations. Exciting findings include the necessity of a second-order perturbation for challenging cases and the effectiveness of MPCCSDT(it) for non-covalent interactions in large systems.

Abstract: We incorporate a solver for the fragment problem with accuracy beyond coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) into the previously proposed static embedding framework, MPCC. To this end, we employ a CCSDT solver for the fragment subsystem. For the environment subsystem, we construct a perturbative estimate of the triples amplitudes, explicitly accounting for feedback from all fragment amplitudes. The resulting approach is denoted MPCCSDT(pt). We further introduce a more complete formulation in which feedback from the environment amplitudes to the fragment amplitudes is also included. This scheme involves an iterative treatment of the environment triples amplitudes and is denoted MPCCSDT(it). In addition, we assess the accuracy of the previously proposed low-level method by introducing a modified low-level approach that incorporates a lowest-order treatment of selected long-range effects, including spin fluctuations and charge polarization. All resulting approaches may be viewed as post-CCSD(T) methods. We therefore consider test cases for which CCSD(T) exhibits substantial deviations from CCSDT. Our results demonstrate that inclusion of triples amplitudes at the fragment level alone is insufficient; a perturbative treatment of the environment triples amplitudes is required. For many energy-difference applications, feedback from the environment triples amplitudes to the fragment amplitudes, is not essential, but it does play a role in the very challenging molecules. A very interesting finding from our study is that in some challenging cases, we need an improved (second-order) perturbative method for the SD amplitudes, going beyond the first-order one used in our earlier work.

Conclusion: k-CIAH算法提供了计算外心轨道的一种高效方法，显著提升了材料模拟的性能。

Abstract: We report a $k$-point extension of the second-order co-iterative augmented Hessian (CIAH) algorithm, termed $k$-CIAH, for Pipek-Mezey (PM) localization of Wannier functions (WFs). By exploiting an efficient evaluation of the Hessian-vector product, $k$-CIAH achieves $O(N_k^2 n^3)$ scaling in both CPU time and memory, matching that of previously reported first-order $k$-space approaches while improving upon the $O(N_k^3 n^3)$ scaling of $Γ$-point CIAH, where $N_k$ denotes the number of $k$-points sampling the first Brillouin zone and $n$ characterizes the unit-cell size. Benchmark calculations on a diverse set of solids -- including insulators, semiconductors, metals, and surfaces -- demonstrate the fast and robust convergence of $k$-CIAH-based PMWF optimization, which yields an overall computational efficiency approximately 2-3 -fold higher than first-order $k$-space methods and orders of magnitude higher than $Γ$-point CIAH for localizing 1000-5000 orbitals. The quality of the resulting PMWFs is further validated by accurate electronic band structures obtained via PMWF-based Wannier interpolation.

Abstract: Quantum-chemical calculations often make use of point-group theory to exploit molecular symmetry, resulting in a reduction of the computational cost and in insights into the electronic structure. This exploitation is often limited to subgroups of $D_{2h}$ which are Abelian with real characters. Here, we extend the symmetry exploitation to Abelian point groups with complex characters. Such point groups are often encountered in calculations that involve finite magnetic fields, though their occurrence is not limited to these cases alone. We present the evaluation of integrals over symmetry-adapted orbitals using the double-coset decomposition, as well as the use of these symmetries in the contractions needed within post Hartree Fock calculations in the context of block tensors. Efficiency gains are discussed for four simple hydrocarbons that exhibit a complex Abelian point group in the presence of a magnetic field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper evaluates the capabilities of two quantum state parameterization methods, NQS-VMC and NQS-SC, for electronic structure calculations. It highlights the limitations of current approaches and suggests the need for new methods that can better handle dynamical correlation.

Method: A systematic comparison was conducted between NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems with static and dynamic correlation. The study assessed both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients.

Result: NQS-SC outperformed NQS-VMC in energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients for molecules with static correlation. Both methods demonstrated limitations in capturing dynamical correlation, suggesting the need for hybrid approaches.

Conclusion: NQS-SC is a more effective method than NQS-VMC for capturing correlation in electronic ground states, particularly static. Future research should focus on methods capable of handling dynamic correlation, such as multiconfigurational perturbation theories.

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide a flexible and highly expressive parameterization of wave functions for strongly correlated problems in quantum chemistry. Despite rapid advances in network architectures, the evaluation of electronic energies remains almost exclusively based on variational Monte Carlo (VMC). While VMC is effective for structured systems such as spin chains, its accuracy and efficiency for electronic Hamiltonians are hindered by sharply peaked distributions, stochastic gradient noise, and slow convergence with sample size. In this letter, we assess the capability of NQS-VMC to efficiently capture correlation in electronic ground states by comparing it to a recently developed NQS-based selected configuration (NQS-SC) approach. We set up a systematic comparison of the ground-state optimizations obtained with NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems dominated by either static or dynamical correlation. The comparison demonstrates a clear advantage of NQS-SC over NQS-VMC in both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients, particularly for statically correlated molecules. Moreover, NQS-SC exhibits robust systematic improvability, whereas NQS-VMC does not. These findings position NQS-SC as the new default approach over NQS-VMC for electronic structure calculations. We further observe that neither NQS-SC nor NQS-VMC can efficiently capture dynamical correlation, highlighting the need for future hybrid methods, such as multiconfigurational perturbation theories built on top of NQS solutions.

Conclusion:  提出了通用的预测方法，可用于分析各种 nonequilibrium 生长系统中的初期不稳定现象。

Abstract: Transitions between distinct dynamical regimes are ubiquitous in nonequilibrium systems. As a prototypical example, deposition growth is often accompanied by irreversible morphological instabilities. Forecasting such transitions from pre-transition configurations remains fundamentally challenging, as early precursors are weak, spatially heterogeneous, and masked by inherent fluctuations. Here, we investigate compact-to-dendritic transitions (CDTs) in a two-dimensional particle-based electrodeposition model and formulate a horizon-based early-warning task using trajectory-resolved transition points. We demonstrate that anticipating the CDT is intrinsically a spatiotemporal problem: neither static morphological descriptors nor temporal learning applied to predefined features alone yields reliable predictive signals. In contrast, end-to-end learning of jointly optimized spatial and temporal representations from growth images enables robust anticipation across a wide range of prediction horizons. Analysis of the learned latent dynamics reveals the emergence of a low-dimensional surrogate variable that tracks progressive morphological destabilization and undergoes reorganization near the transition. We further show that the learned spatiotemporal representation exhibits limited but systematic transferability across reaction-rate conditions, with predictive performance degrading as the inference condition departs from the training condition, consistent with changes in the latent-state dynamics. Overall, our results establish a general formulation for forecasting incipient instabilities in nonequilibrium interfacial growth, with implications for the predictive monitoring and control of pattern-forming driven systems.

The accuracy of the method is validated against finite difference calculations, showing excellent agreement. We then explore several machine learning (ML) strategies for learning noisy AFQMC data. These ML potentials are subsequently used to perform geometry optimizations and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, successfully identifying the transition state of the formamide-formimidic acid tautomerization. The resulting transition state geometry and barrier heights are in close agreement with coupled-cluster reference values. This work paves the way for highly accurate geometry optimization, molecular dynamics, or reaction path calculations.

Abstract: Superconducting high field magnets have the capability to generate over 40 T, with multiple existing practical applications globally. However, at such high magnetic fields, these magnets are prone to rapid electrothermal quench which can affect the continuous operation of such magnets.

We have performed detailed multiphysics quench analysis of such a nested stack high field magnet design under SuperEMFL project using our in-house software, which considers screening currents. Through various case studies, we have identified various weak spots in such a magnet, where thermal quench can be the most detrimental for magnet operation, and various ways are suggested to overcome this important issue.

Abstract: Large-scale energy storage has become an inevitable solution for integrating stochastically available renewable energy sources into the electric grid. Vanadium redox flow batteries offer a viable option among other technologies, due to their long lifetime and independently scalable output power and capacity. The electrolyte temperature should be maintained within the range of 5-40 Celsius for safe operation; therefore, a thermal management system is necessary, which affects battery efficiency. The study presents a detailed, containerized battery model with a hybrid thermal management system that considers thermal radiation and real ambient temperatures. A total of 180 configurations were investigated in 10 cases, ranging from 4 to 400 kW, with 18 different discharging current-cell number ratios in each case, including multistack arrangements. Current-dependent ohmic losses influence the electric efficiency, which increases from a minimum of 68% to 89% in low-current configurations. However, the net system efficiency ranges between 43% and 66% due to the self-consumption of pumps, the inverter, and the thermal management system. In addition to the detailed efficiency analysis, a comprehensive investigation of thermal processes is provided in terms of the current-cell number ratio and output power, which is crucial for designing thermal management systems and sizing batteries.

Abstract: Physical reservoir computing (RC) utilizes the intrinsic dynamical evolution of physical systems for efficient data processing. Emerging optoelectronic RC platforms,such as light-driven memristors, merge the benefits of electronic and photonic computation. However, conventional designs are often limited by the unipolar photoresponse of optoelectronic devices, which restricts reservoir state diversity and reduces computational accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an all-optically controlled RC system employing an oxide memristor array that demonstrates exceptional uniformity and stability. The memristive devices exhibit wavelength-dependent bipolar photoresponse, originating from light-induced dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies. Tuning the power density and irradiation mode of dual-wavelength light pulses enables dynamic control of photocurrent relaxation and nonlinearity. By leveraging these unique device properties, we develop bipolar and parallel coding strategies to significantly enrich reservoir dynamics and enhance nonlinear mapping capability. In word recognition and time-series prediction tasks, the bipolar coding demonstrates markedly improved accuracy compared to unipolar coding. The parallel coding supports multi-source signal fusion within a single reservoir, maintaining high computational accuracy while significantly reducing hardware consumption. This work provides a high-performance approach to physical RC, paving the way for intelligent edge computing.

Abstract: The Medium temperature (mid-T) baking of niobium superconducting radio-frequency cavities at 300 350&#8239; C in a vacuum furnace is known to enhance the quality factor (Q&#8320;). However, despite this improvement, cavities treated with this process often exhibit premature quench at relatively low accelerating fields. This limitation is suspected to arise from the formation of surface contaminants, such as niobium carbides, during the furnace bake at 350 C for 3 h. To investigate the influence of potential surface contamination, this study applied an ultralight chemical removal to 1.3&#8239;GHz and 650&#8239;MHz single-cell cavities that had undergone medium-temperature baking. The removal of the top RF surface layer led to a notable improvement in the quench field and Q&#8320;, indicating a beneficial effect of eliminating possible surface residues introduced during the bake.

Abstract: We propose and investigate a novel two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding model defined on a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry that hosts multiple flat bands (FBs) and supports topological phase transitions driven by a magnetic flux. This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport. Our findings put forward the diamond-dodecagon lattice as a robust and tunable platform for studying the flat-band physics and magnetic flux-controlled topological phenomena, offering promising experimental feasibility in photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems.

Abstract: Correlation functions and correlation lengths are frequently used to describe phase transitions in quantum systems, but they require an explicit choice of observables. The recently introduced information lattice instead provides an observable-independent way to identify where and at which scale information is contained in quantum lattice models. Here, we use it to study the difference between the metallic and insulating regime of one-dimensional tight-binding chains. We find that the information per scale follows a power law in metals at low temperature and that Friedel-like oscillations are visible in the information lattice. At high temperature or in insulators at low temperature, the information per scale decays exponentially. Thus, the information lattice is a useful tool for analyzing the metal-insulator transition.

Abstract: Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped Néel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.

Using state-of-the-art variational wavefunctions based on neural networks, we confirm the presence of robust magnetization plateaus at $m=1/3$, $5/9$ and $7/9$ of the saturation value, stabilized by a spontaneous symmetry breaking of lattice translations with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell. Regarding the more challenging $m=1/9$ plateau, we find two competing valence bond crystals depending on the system size, both breaking translation as well as point group symmetries and with a larger $3\times 3$ unit cell. Such quantum states with local modulations of the magnetization average values could be observed experimentally in the near future.

Abstract: The earlier theory [1] of the quantum phase transitions related to the change of the Fermi Surface Topology (FST) is advanced. For such transitions the Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold determined by the Lee-Yang zeros, the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ as the $d$-volume of the Fermi sea, and the special FST universality class were introduced in [1]. The exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) $d$-dimensional ($d=1,2,3$) model of interacting fermions is analyzed. We explore the relation between the Lee-Yang zeros, the Luttinger and the plateau (Oshikawa) theorems. The validity of the Luttinger theorem in the HK model is confirmed. It is shown that the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ and the FST universality class describe the transitions between metal and band/Mott insulators, as well as the Lifshitz and van Hove gapless-to-gapless transitions. The gapless phases are established to be the Landau Fermi liquids (metals). In addition to the conventional paradigm with a continuous order parameter, we apply the homology theory to analyze the FST transitions. They are critical points of the Morse function. To quantify FST we use the Euler characteristic, which is calculated for each phase of the HK model. We claim that the FST universality class is robust with respect to interactions and other model details, under the condition that the critical points are non-degenerate.

Abstract: Energy flows among coupled subsystems are essential for ultrafast dynamics and high-speed technologies. In magnetic materials, spin fluctuations -- magnons -- mediate these flows in ultrafast magnetism. Yet momentum-resolved access to low-energy magnons governing the microscopic dynamics has been lacking. Using time-resolved resonant diffuse scattering alongside complementary time-resolved X-ray techniques and quantum-kinetic simulations, we unveil the hierarchical energy pathways among correlated systems in the photoexcited antiferromagnet CuO. Above-bandgap excitation triggers near-instantaneous spin disorder, generating non-thermal magnons throughout reciprocal space within femtoseconds. Real-time momentum-resolved tracking reveals picosecond magnon quasi-thermalization, followed by nanosecond recovery via momentum-selective magnon-phonon scattering. The quasiparticle dispersion mismatch creates recovery bottlenecks that control non-equilibrium lifetimes. This microscopic framework transcends phenomenological models and generalizes across materials, establishing design principles for ultrafast control of material properties.

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a resonant level model coupled to a strongly interacting electron bath modeled by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Different from the well-investigated case of a structureless non-interacting Fermi gas bath leading to a temperature-independent exponential decay of the impurity orbital occupation, we find a temperature-dependent oscillatory decay. We attribute this difference to the lack of quasiparticles in the SYK model, which is reflected in its singular density of states at the Fermi level. Our results are exact and can be obtained analytically by mapping to a suitably structured Fermi gas bath as an ancillary model for the SYK bath.

Abstract: We present a rigorous derivation of the orbital magnetization for interacting electrons within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. Our method also allows us to derive formulas for the orbital magnetic susceptibility. The results are expressed entirely in terms of the self-consistent wavefunctions and the Hartree-Fock energy spectrum at zero magnetic field. We find that the formula for the orbital magnetization is the same as in the non-interacting case, provided that the Hamiltonian and Bloch wave functions are replaced by their Hartree-Fock counterparts. By contrast, the orbital magnetic susceptibility contains an additional interaction-induced contribution that cannot be obtained by such a replacement. We test the formulas on an interacting Rashba model, finding an agreement with calculations performed at a small but non-zero external magnetic field.

Abstract: We present comprehensive determinations of the diffusion coefficients $D$ at $T=24\,\degree$C for trace amounts of naturally abundant Rb atoms in inert, naturally abundant He, Ne, N$_2$, Ar, Kr, and Xe buffer gases using a single measurement technique. We establish a spatially periodic population grating in the Rb sample using two laser beams that intersect at a small angle $θ$ of a few milliradians. The atomic population grating decays exponentially in time due to diffusive motion induced by momentum-changing elastic collisions between Rb and buffer gas atoms or molecules, and is monitored by observing the scattered field from a read-out beam. We distinguish the contribution of diffusion from other collisional processes by measuring the characteristic $θ^2$ dependence of the decay rate. We also measure the systematic dependence of the decay rate on the buffer gas pressure over a range of $7\,000$ Pa to $90\,000$ Pa. In this manner, we obtain diffusion coefficients at standard atmospheric pressure of $101\,325$ Pa and at a temperature of 24.0(5)~$^\circ$C. We obtain weighted averages of $0.33(5)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.214(14)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.132(7)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.123(9)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.093(9)$ cm$^2$/s, and $0.073(4)$ cm$^2$/s for Rb in He, Ne, N$_2$, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively. We compare this data with diffusion coefficients obtained using quantum, classical, and semi-classical theoretical methods based on the most accurate interatomic interaction potentials from the literature. Our computed diffusion coefficients based on the quantum theory agree with the experimental determinations when systematic effects are taken into account. Our measurements and modeling are relevant to the optimization of magnetometers, imaging using spin-polarized noble gases, tests of collision models based on interatomic potentials, and the development of pressure sensors.

Abstract: We present a new technique for cooling arbitrary charged particles in a Penning trap by utilizing self-cooled electrons stored in a separate, macroscopically distant Penning trap as the cooling medium. The electrons decay predominantly to their motional ground state by emission of cyclotron radiation, which results in extremely low temperatures in the realm of single-digit quantum numbers in the motional degrees of freedom of the sympathetically cooled particle species. This opens up an exciting new frontier of tests of fundamental physics in Penning traps. This article provides a conceptual overview as well as a quantum-mechanical description of the involved cooling dynamics. The first implementation of this technique is currently being realized at the dedicated ELCOTRAP experiment at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, which introduces special features for a quick iterative technical development cycle. Its current status, first results from commissioning, and future prospects will be presented.
