However, their luminescent performance is often\nattenuated by pi-pi stacking-driven excimer formation and molecular oxygen\nquenching. To mitigate these undesirable effects, a novel class of\n7-tert-butylpyren-2-ol derivatives with extended 'arm-like' substituents at the\n1,3-positions have been synthesized and their luminescent properties in\nsolution have been thoroughly investigated. While the 2- and 7-positions of the\npyrene core are frequently modified with hydroxyl and tert-butyl groups, this\nwork presents the first introduction of 'arm-like' substituents at the\n1,3-positions. The stretched-out 'arm-like' substituents not only introduce\nsteric bulk to suppress excimer formation but also change the symmetry class of\npyrene and modulate electron density at its 1,2,3,7-positions. These effects\ntune pyrene's energy levels, demonstrating moderate (0.4) to high (0.7)\nfluorescence quantum yields and shorter-lived fluorescence lifetimes ranging\nfrom ca. 20 to 40 ns. These shorter lifetimes lead to a reduction of the pyrene\nderivatives' susceptibility to energy scavenging by molecular oxygen. In\naddition, the specific form of the 'arms' are important. Alkyl-containing arms\nand alkenyl-containing arms exhibit different decay pathways, which is\nreflected by their disparate nonradiative rates. Thus, the introduction of\n'arm-like' modifications represents a promising approach to modulate the\nphotophysical behaviours of annulenes, highlighting their applicability in\nnext-generation electronic and optoelectronic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However,\nrecent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled\nstates can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and\nmulti-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized\nmeasurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that\nvolume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet\nnon-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model\ncomprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where\ngeneralized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to\ndetector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law\nentanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the\nmain chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find\nthat such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the\nmeasurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of\nnon-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement\ngeneration by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the\nstatistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the\napproach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady\nstates, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the\nmeasurement-only dynamics.

Since the protein scaffold is rather\nflexible, the resulting energetic and structural disorder gives rise to a\ncomplex excited-state energy level structure that fluctuates on all time\nscales. Although the impact of such fluctuations on relaxation processes is\nknown, the precise exciton states involved in relaxation as well as the nature\nof the vibrational modes driving relaxation are under debate. Here single\npigment-protein complexes from a photosynthetic purple bacterium are excited\nwith two identical ultrashort phase-locked pulses producing two exciton wave\npackets that can interfere.

The recently\nintroduced single-boson exchange decomposition of the vertex presents an\nalternative set of equivalent equations in terms of screened interactions,\nHedin vertices, and rest functions. This formulation has garnered much\nattention for several reasons: opening the door to new approximations, for\navoiding vertex divergences associated with local moment formation plaguing the\ntraditional parquet decomposition, and for its interpretative advantage in its\nbuilt-in diagrammatic identification of bosons without resorting to\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformations. In this work, we show how the fermionic\ndiagrams of the particle-particle and particle-hole polarizations can be mapped\nto diagrammatics of a bosonic self-energy of two respective bosonic theories\nwith pure bosonic constituents, solidifying the identification of the screened\ninteraction with a bosonic propagator. Resorting to a spin-diagonalized basis\nfor the bosonic fields and neglecting the coupling between singlet and triplet\ncomponents is shown to recover the trace log theory known from\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformations. Armed with this concrete mapping, we\nrevisit a conjecture claiming that universal aspects of the parquet\napproximation coincide with those of the self-consistent screening\napproximation for a bosonic $O(N)$ model.

By tuning the doping level $\\delta$ and hopping ratio $t'/t$, we\nuncover six distinct quantum phases, several of which go far beyond the\nconventional paradigm of phase-coherent superfluidity (SF) expected for bosonic\nsystems. In particular, in the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, doped\nholes are tightly bound into pairs, giving rise to a pair density wave (PDW)\nphase at low doping and small $|t'/t|$, which is suppressed on the $t'<0$ side,\nresulting in a disordered PDW state that lacks coherence of either individual\nbosons or pairs. Upon further doping, bosons can regain phase coherence and\nform a SF* state, characterized by condensation at emergent incommensurate\nmomenta concurrent with an incommensurate magnetic order. On the $t'>0$ side,\nthe sign-induced kinetic frustration inherently disfavors local AFM\ncorrelations, leading to a phase separation in which doped holes cluster into\nferromagnetic (FM) domains spatially separated by undoped AFM regions.

In Bose-Einsten\ncondensates of ultracold atoms, SO coupling can be implemented and precisely\ncontrolled experimentally; photonic systems, on the other hand, possess an\nintrinsic SO interaction due to the longitudinal-transverse splitting of the\nphoton modes. In this work, we focus on such spinor, SO-coupled\nexciton-polariton condensates on a ring, where the strength of the synthetic\nmagnetic field is controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the structure.\nInspired by recent experiments, we investigate the dynamics of a\nweakly-nonlinear four-mode bosonic Josephson junction within this geometry. We\ndiscover a narrow parameter range in which the interplay of the tunneling\ndynamics with polariton-specific SO coupling leads to a new regime, with\ndynamical switching of the fluid's circular polarization degree to the\nopposite, along the entire ring or on just one of its halves.

The\nalgebra encodes all physical operations in the closed universe, and, in\nprinciple, all physical observables are obtainable from the pair $({\\cal\nM},\\omega)$. Along the way, we propose a resolution to a puzzle raised by\nAntonini and Rath (AR) and reinforced by recent arguments of Engelhardt and\nGesteau and a no-go theorem of Gesteau: that a semiclassical baby universe in\nthe AS$^2$ cosmology cannot be understood from the boundary in the usual\nmanner. Our analysis motivates an averaged large-$N$ limit as part of the\nAdS/CFT dictionary and points toward a unified treatment of spacetimes of all\nasymptotics in terms of operator algebras.

In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first\nmirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the\nradiation pressure. We show that the right- and left-circular polarization\ncomponents of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle\nbecome spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of\nincidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the\noptomechanical interaction, cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as\nG-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE\nare equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity\nfield and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity\nfield and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe\nfield to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic\nstate interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe\nfield detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into\nthree windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through\ncavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state\ninteraction when probe field detuning is non-zero.

Experimentally,\nsuch control can be achieved by pulsed modifications of the optical potential\nconfining the nanoparticle. Most frequently, the applied potential pulses are\nparabolic in nanoparticle position, and they expand/squeeze or displace the\ninitial Gaussian state of motion to a modified Gaussian state. The\ntime-dependent mean values and covariance matrix of the phase-space variables\ncan fully characterize such a state. However, quasi-parabolic optical\npotentials with added weak Duffing-type nonlinearity, encountered in real-world\nexperiments, can generally distort the state of motion to a non-Gaussian one,\nfor which the description based solely on the mean values and covariance matrix\nfails. Here, we introduce a nonlinear transformation of the phase-space\ncoordinates using the concept of Fermat's spiral, which effectively removes the\nstate distortion induced by the Duffing-type nonlinearity and enables\ncharacterization of the state of motion by the standard Gaussian-state metrics.\nComparisons of the experimental data with theoretical models show that the\nproposed coordinate transformation can recover the ideal behavior of a harmonic\noscillator even after extended evolution of the system in the nonlinear\npotential. The presented scheme enables the separation of the effects of the\napplied state manipulation, the system's gradual thermalization, and the\nnonlinearity of the confinement on the experimentally observed dynamics of the\nsystem, thereby facilitating the design of advanced protocols for levitated\noptomechanics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d39\u9a6c\u87ba\u65cb\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5149\u5f39 Nanoparticle \u5728\u975e\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u52bf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u5f39 nanoparticle \u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5bc6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u7269\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u878d\u5408\u7ecf\u5178-\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d39\u9a6c\u87ba\u65cb\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u53d8\u6362\u53ef\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664 Duffing \u7c7b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5149\u5f39 optomechanics \u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5148\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

Using time-resolved\npump-probe Faraday ellipticity measurements, we systematically study single-,\ntwo-, and four-layer quantum dot (QD) configurations to quantify how vertical\ncoupling affects key spin-coherence parameters. Our measurements reveal\ndistinct layer-dependent effects: (1) Adding a second QD layer flips the\nresident charge from electrons to holes, consistent with optically induced\nelectron tunneling into lower-energy dots and resultant hole charging. (2)\nStarting from the four-layer sample, the pump-probe signal develops an\nadditional non-oscillating, decaying component absent in single- and two-layer\nsamples, attributed to multiple layer growth changing the strain environment,\nwhich reduces heavy-hole and light-hole mixing.

The hole spin\ndephasing times $T_2^*$ remain relatively constant (2.26-2.73\\,ns) across layer\ncounts, while longitudinal relaxation times $T_1$ decrease with increasing\nlayers (from 1.03\\,$\\mu$s for single-layer to 0.31\\,$\\mu$s for four-layer\nsamples).

We start with a Lagrangian of a generic form that\ndepends on the particle's velocity, its material frame and its absolute\nderivative, and the background geometry consisting of a metric and an\nindependent affine connection. Performing variations of the path and the\nmaterial frame, we derive the equations of motion for the particle that govern\nthe evolution of its momentum and hypermomentum in this generic background.

To appear in European Journal for Philosophy of Science", "summary": "Bell's inequality is derived from three assumptions: measurement\nindependence, outcome independence, and parameter independence. Among these,\nmeasurement independence, often taken for granted, holds that hidden variables\nare statistically uncorrelated with measurement settings. Under this\nassumption, the violation of Bell's inequality implies that either outcome\nindependence or parameter independence fails to hold, meaning that local hidden\nvariables do not exist. In this paper, we refer to this interpretive stance as\nthe nonfactorizable position. In contrast, superdeterminism represents the view\nthat measurement independence does not hold. Despite its foundational role,\nthis assumption has received relatively little philosophical scrutiny. This\npaper offers a philosophical reassessment of measurement independence through\nthree major frameworks in the philosophy of science: de Regt's contextual\ntheory of scientific understanding, Kuhn's criteria for theory choice, and\nLakatos's methodology of scientific research programmes. Using these lenses, we\nevaluate the two major responses to the violation of Bell's inequality, the\nnonfactorizable position and superdeterminism, and argue that the\nnonfactorizable position currently fares better across all three criteria.\nBeyond this binary, we introduce a spectrum of intermediate positions that\nallow for partial violations of measurement independence, modeled via mutual\ninformation. These positions modify the ``positive heuristic'' of\nsuperdeterminism, a crucial component in Lakatos's definition of research\nprogrammes, offering avenues for progressive research.

The particle that relays the spatial information about the object\nremains completely non-interacting, while the particle used to probe the object\nis not spatially resolved. While ghost imaging has been primarily implemented\non photonic platforms, it becomes particularly intriguing when applied to\nparticles with fundamentally different properties, such as massive, charged\nelectrons and massless, neutral photons, especially considering the role of\nboth particles as cornerstones of highly advanced microscopic platforms. In\nthis work, we investigate coincidence imaging using\nelectron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission\nelectron microscope. Utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence\nsetup, we demonstrate ghost imaging of complex patterns.

Krylov complexity is computed from the moments of the\ntwo-point function within the standard master equation framework. For the\ndamped harmonic oscillator, the results reveal clear dissipative features in\nKrylov complexity. In the Caldeira--Leggett model, in the high-temperature\nlimit, we find that Krylov complexity saturates in the full system and\nreproduces the expected dissipative behavior when the decoherence term is\nsuppressed in the master equation.

Lastly, we provide, for the first time, the cubic\norder multi-gravity potential around a generic background spacetime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6765\u7814\u7a76dRGT\u578b\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u80cc\u666f\u65f6\u7a7a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u7ef4\u4f26\u5e03\u57fa\u6069\u7406\u8bba\u7684 vielbein \u5f62\u5f0f\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u91c7\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9isson \u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4ee5\u5f80\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bf9isson\u6cd5\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u5e7b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u91cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7b49\u80cc\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u9636\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5f97\u5230\u4e09\u9636\u7684\u591a\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "Massive gravity\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5176\u5b83\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c06dRGT\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u80cc\u666f\u65f6\u7a7a\u65f6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u9636\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u975e\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ef4\u4f26\u5e03\u57fa\u6069\u7406\u8bba\u7684vielbein\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed5\u5f00\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u9636\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u5e7b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u91cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u80cc\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86dRGT\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u9636\u6270\u52a8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u660e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u80cc\u666f\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76dRGT\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6270\u52a8\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u9636\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This\nframework strictly generalizes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD/Bures)\ncase and includes, as special examples, the Wigner-Yanase and\nBogoliubov-Kubo-Mori metrics among many others. Our first main theorem proves a\nuniversal three-channel decomposition for every Petz monotone metric on any\nsmooth two-parameter slice in terms of the population, coherence, and\nconcurrence of the one-qubit reduction. Second, we show that neither the slice\nGaussian curvature nor the ambient scalar curvature of the support-projected\nmetric can, on any nonempty open set, be written as functions solely of\nconcurrence or of the one-qubit entropy. Third, an entanglement-orthogonal\ngauge isolates the pure entanglement derivative channel and provides intrinsic\ncurvature diagnostics. These results rigorously disprove the expectation that\nscalar or Gaussian curvatures of finite-dimensional monotone metrics could\nserve as universal entanglement monotones, extending the counterexamples\npreviously known for the SLD/Bures metric, and complementing recent analyses in\nGaussian quantum states. They also furnish a Petz-metric foundation for\ncurvature-aware natural-gradient methods in variational quantum algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr":

Here we study quantum realizations of extremal correlations in\narbitrary contextuality scenarios and prove that, for all such scenarios, no\nextremal indeterministic correlation can be achieved using projective quantum\nmeasurements, i.e., there exists no quantum state and no set of projective\nmeasurements, for any contextuality scenario, that can achieve such\ncorrelations. This no-go result follows as a corollary of a more general no-go\ntheorem that holds when the most general set of quantum measurements (i.e.,\npositive operator-valued measures, or POVMs) is taken into account.

This work develops Riemannian optimization\nmethods to establish significantly tighter, computable two-sided bounds on\nthese fundamental quantities. For upper bounds, our method systematically\nsearches for state and channel extensions that minimize known\ninformation-theoretic bounds. We achieve this by parameterizing the space of\nall possible extensions as a Stiefel manifold, enabling a universal search that\novercomes the limitations of ad-hoc constructions. Combined with an improved\nupper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined\ncontinuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new\nstate-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing\nchannel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the\npreviously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian\noptimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish\nlower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum\ninstruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by\nparameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical\nresults for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our\nmethods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results.\nTogether, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and\npowerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication\nlimits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel\ncoherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity\nlower bounds in general.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This work introduces and systematically studies a new\nconvex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual\nto the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a\ncomplete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant\nmaps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the classical cone of COP to PCOP,\nthereby creating a powerful bridge between the well-studied theory of\ncopositive forms and the structure of positive maps. We develop an analogous\nframework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary\napplication of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps\n$\\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive\nexact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or\ndecomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic\nparameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive\nindecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from\ninfinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as\nPaley graphs.\n  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes\nof symmetric states, such as the Dicke states. We prove that the sum-of-squares\n(SOS) hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of\ncopositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for\ndifferent levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy. Leveraging this\nduality, we provide an explicit construction of bipartite (mixture of) Dicke\nstates that are simultaneously entangled and $\\mathcal{K}_r$-PPT bosonic\nextendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \\geq 2$ and local dimension $n\n\\geq 5$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
