The spin ladder is described\nby an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange\ninteractions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary\nsituations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In\nthe strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2\nchain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and\nproviding a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that\neffective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM\ninteractions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM\ninteractions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be\nrealized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we\nemploy Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a\nmultitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven\nby both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs\n(chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in\nthe DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in\nthe experiments.

We observe QD\ndensities of $\\sim 0.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, FSS values as small as $3\\\n\\mu\\mathrm{eV}$, and short radiative lifetimes of $\\sim 300\\ \\mathrm{ps}$,\nwhile extending the achievable emission range to $\\sim 920\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ at\ncryogenic temperatures.

Data-driven ROMs are typically built with a two-step\nstrategy: data compression in a lower-dimensional latent space, and prediction\nof the temporal dynamics on it. To achieve real-time prediction, however, there\nare two challenges to overcome: (i) ROMs of chaotic systems can become\nnumerically unstable; and (ii) sensors' data are sparse, i.e., partial, and\nnoisy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a three-step strategy: (i) a\nconvolutional autoencoder (CAE) compresses the system's state onto a\nlower-dimensional latent space; (ii) a latent ROM (echo state network, ESN),\nwhich is formulated as a state-space model, predicts the temporal evolution on\nthe latent space; and (iii) sequential data assimilation based on the Ensemble\nKalman filter (EnKF) adaptively corrects the latent ROM by assimilating noisy\nand sparse measurements.

The DA-CAE-ESN is tested on spatio-temporally chaotic partial\ndifferential equations: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a\ntwo-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation (Kolmogorov flow). We show that the\nmethod provides accurate and stable forecasts across different levels of noise,\nsparsity, and sampling rates. As a by-product, the DA-CAE-ESN acts as a\nlocalization strategy that mitigates spurious correlations, which arise when\napplying the EnKF to high-dimensional systems. The DA-CAE-ESN provides a\nnumerically stable method to perform real-time predictions, which opens\nopportunities for deploying data-driven latent models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CAE\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u6ede\u5185\u9690\u5f0f\u725b\u987f\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u79e9\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u6821\u6b63\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cKolmogorov\u6d41\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5e76\u63d0\u5230\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u6ede\u5185\u9690\u5f0f\u725b\u987f\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u79e9\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b66\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u6ede\u5185\u9690\u5f0f\u725b\u987f\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u4f4e\u79e9\u8868\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u6ede\u5185\u9690\u5f0f\u725b\u987f\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cKolmogorov\u6d41\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

On\nthe other hand it has been shown that Steady State Free Precession (SSFP)\nexperiments which depart from this scheme can, under certain conditions, endow\n13C and 15N small molecule NMR with comparable sensitivity and resolution. SSFP\nis one of the earliest and most widely used NMR pulse sequences, yet its\nanalyses have focused on isolated spin-half ensembles such as water. The\npresent study demonstrates that significant deviations from such isolated\nspin-half behavior may occur when SSFP is applied in the presence of spin-spin\ncouplings. Even in the simplest case supporting such couplings, a single 13C J\ncoupled to a 1H, departures from the isolated spin-half behavior arise in the\n13C SSFP response, both in the absence and in the presence of 1H spin\ndecoupling. In the former case deviations are produced by the differential\nrelaxation of antiphase two-spin terms generated by the pulse train; in the\nlatter case, magnified interferences may arise between the SSFP pulses and the\ncoherent perturbation arising upon 1H decoupling. Although both phenomena are\nalso known in FT NMR, the spectral distortions that they will originate may be\nmuch larger in the SSFP case, particularly if interpulse delays in large flip\nangle SSFP pulse trains resonate with the coupling perturbations. The origins\nof these effects are here analyzed for heteronuclear spin-half systems and\ncorroborated with 13C NMR SSFP experiments recorded under different conditions.\nAdditional considerations aimed at magnifying or suppressing these effects, as\nwell as extensions to more complex scenarios, are also briefly discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb-\u534a\u6574\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684SSFP\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SSFP\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0eFT\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57281H\u91cd spin decoupling\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "SSFP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-\u534a\u6574\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u5982\u6c34\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u81ea\u65cb-\u81ea\u65cb\u8026\u5408\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86SSFP\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u752813C NMR SSFP\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "13C SSFP\u54cd\u5e94\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u548c\u67091H\u53bb\u8026\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0eFT\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u7ffb\u8f6c\u89d2SSFP\u8109\u51b2\u4e32\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e72\u6270\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "SSFP\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u6709\u81ea\u65cb-\u81ea\u65cb\u8026\u5408\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0eFT\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u67091H\u53bb\u8026\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4ea7\u751f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Additionally, its magnetic\ncooling performance remains robust up to at least 4.5 K, making GdZnPO a\npromising candidate for magnetic refrigeration down to $\\sim$36 mK through\ncycling the applied magnetic field within a narrow range.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u62a5\u9053\u4e86_ordered GdZnPO\u5728\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u81f4\u51b7\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u78c1\u81f4\u51b7\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6e29\u5ea6\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u7ea636\u6beb\u5f00\uff0c\u5177\u6709 promising\u7684\u78c1\u5236\u51b7\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u78c1\u81f4\u51b7\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u50a8\u5b58\u548c\u8fdd\u6cd5\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u81f4\u51b7\u6548\u5e94\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u6e29\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528GdZnPO\u6676\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u78c1\u81f4\u51b7\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u78c1\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "GdZnPO\u5728\u4f4e\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u78c1\u81f4\u51b7\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u81f336\u6beb\u5f00\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u78c1\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u78c1\u5236\u51b7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GdZnPO\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u6e29\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u78c1\u5236\u51b7\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Although these\nfunctions can be expressed as a Fourier series using the geodesic fundamental\nfrequencies, reconstructing them in coordinate time is challenging due to the\ncoupling of the radial and polar motions. In this paper, we compare two\nstrategies for performing such reconstructions and their ability to estimate\nhigh-order coordinate-time derivatives of the orbital functional. The first\nmethod maps Fourier coefficients from Mino to coordinate time; the second\nmethod fits a sampled time series of the function to a truncated\ncoordinate-time Fourier series. While the latter method is prone to\noverfitting, it yields more accurate reconstructions and derivatives than the\nmapping, but completely misrepresents the harmonic content of the orbital\nfunctional. For the purpose of accurate coordinate-time derivative estimation,\nwe propose a hybrid method: fit for the Mino-time coefficients, differentiate\nwith respect to Mino time, then convert to coordinate time. Applied to the mass\nquadrupole of a generic Kerr geodesic, this hybrid method recovers the sixth\nderivative with a fractional residual $\\sim10^{-6}$ using only two harmonics.\nFor orbital functionals that depend explicitly on the geodesic orbit expressed\nin Boyer--Lindquist coordinates, we also provide a recursive procedure for\ncomputing coordinate-time derivatives using exact analytic expressions.

A typical solution to\nendogenous security problems is the quantum key distribution (QKD), where\nunconditional security can be achieved thanks to the inherent properties of\nquantum mechanics. Continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enjoys\nhigh secret key rate (SKR) and good compatibility with existing optical\ncommunication infrastructure. Traditional CV-QKD usually employ coherent\nreceivers to detect coherent states, whose detection performance is restricted\nto the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we employ a generalized Kennedy\nreceiver called CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the detection performance of\ncoherent states in turbulent channels, where equal-gain combining (EGC) method\nis used to combine the output of CD-Kennedy receivers. Besides, we derive the\nSKR of a post-selection based CV-QKD protocol using both CD-Kennedy receiver\nand homodyne receiver with EGC in turbulent channels. We further propose an\nequivalent transmittance method to facilitate the calculation of both the\nbit-error rate (BER) and SKR. Numerical results show that the CD-Kennedy\nreceiver can outperform the homodyne receiver in turbulent channels in terms of\nboth BER and SKR performance. We find that BER and SKR performance advantage of\nCD-Kennedy receiver over homodyne receiver demonstrate opposite trends as the\naverage transmittance increases, which indicates that two separate system\nsettings should be employed for communication and key distribution purposes.\nBesides, we also demonstrate that the SKR performance of a CD-Kennedy receiver\nis much robust than that of a homodyne receiver in turbulent channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a new CD-Kennedy receiver for CV-QKD, which shows improved performance in turbulent channels, particularly in terms of error rate and key rate compared to homodyne receivers.", "motivation": "Endogenous security in wireless communications and the use of CV-QKD with generalized receivers to enhance security and compatibility in realistic channel conditions.", "method": "Used CD-Kennedy receiver with EGC and analytically derived SKR and BER for CV-QKD in turbulent channels compared to homodyne receivers.", "result": "CD-Kennedy outperforms homodyne receivers in both BER and SKR, with opposite trends as average transmittance increases, and robust SKR performance in turbulence.", "conclusion": "CD-Kennedy receiver is effective for CV-QKD in turbulent channels, improving both BER and SKR with optimized settings for separate purposes."}}

In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a\nblack-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing\n(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization\nMachine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled\nfrom a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).\nAccording to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on\nexploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced\nperformance of exploration and exploitation which we call\nexploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests\nto compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA\ncertainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms\nFMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further\nimproved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes\nsuch that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the\nformer. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration\nperformance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low\ncomputational cost even for a large-scale problem.

For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score\nmatching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the\nreverse process.

The critical point of the superradiant phase\ntransition in the infinite-size Dicke-Stark model was analytically derived\nusing the mean-field approach and confirmed with numerical calculation. Under\nthermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay\ntwo-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the\nfinite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases,\nthe light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching\nand then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and\nminimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding\ncoupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and\nspin squeezing.

Using Gaussian function models, we\nidentify three distinct types of BPs.

The\nsecond type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the\nlocalized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called\neverywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with\nalmost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.\nAfter illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend\nthe analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems\nas thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian\nconstructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges\nconstructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned\nalgorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including\nthose constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect\none-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.\nFinally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as\nalternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed\ntemperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these\nencoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical\nqubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u6bd4\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7801\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u6bd4\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7801\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7801\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
