Moreover, W/AlN structure\nexhibits over 96% average absorption up to 50 degree incident angles\nirrespective of polarizations. The thermal stability was evaluated using the\nfinite element method (FEM) by determining von Mises stress at elevated\ntemperatures. Thermal analysis revealed that only W/AlN can withstand around\n1700 K temperature and 1500 times the incident power before permanent\ndeformation. A temperature-dependent Drude-Lorentz model was used to further\nanalyze the effect of absorption on the optical performance of the highly\nabsorptive and thermally stable W/AlN structure.

This finding not only offers new theoretical insights but also\nsuggests experimental opportunities for probing charged black hole parameters\nvia quantum interferometric techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u7535\u504f\u79fb\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u65bd\u52a0\u7535\u8377\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u81ea\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u6781\u7aef\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7535\u8377\u4e0e\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u03b1\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u4f4d\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u7535\u8377\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6781\u7aef\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u65b0\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u6781\u5316\u7535\u8377\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7279\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7535\u504f\u79fb\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u65bd\u52a0\u6216\u6d88\u53bb\u7535\u8377\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u968f\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7535\u8377\u548c\u03b1\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u8bba\u6709\u65e0\u7535\u8377\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u7535\u8377\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u03b1\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u6781\u5927\u7535\u8377\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u653e\u5927\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u8377\u5f71\u54cd\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u7684\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u03b1\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u653e\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this study, we\ncompare the emission reductions benefit, and direct heating penalty of two\nclasses of roof envelopes, traditional and adaptive radiative coolers (TRCs and\nARCs). Calculations for buildings in different urban climates show that\nrelative to TRCs like cool roofs, ARCs like smart roofs may have a net heating\nimpact on earth well past this century. Thus, despite their relative energy\nsavings and CO2 emissions reductions benefits, adaptive envelopes on roofs have\na negative climate impact relative to traditional cooling designs.

Further, we perform spectral\nstatistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with\nperturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson\nstatistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\\langle r\n\\rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute\nthe ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\\langle S\n\\rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the\nlimit $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some\npotential experimental realizations of our model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The recently discovered hexagonal altermagnet manganese telluride\n($\\alpha$-MnTe) is a prime example. It has a compensated $A$-type\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state where the in-plane ferromagnetic (FM)\nmoments in each layer are stacked antiferromagnetically along the $c$ axis, yet\nexhibits a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that breaks the $T$-symmetry\nwith a vanishingly small $c$-axis FM moment. However, the presence of three\n120$^\\circ$ separated in-plane magnetic domains presents a challenge in\nunderstanding the origin of AHE and the effective control of the altermagnetic\nstate. Here we use neutron scattering to show that a compressive uniaxial\nstrain along the next-nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn bond direction detwins\n$\\alpha$-MnTe into a single in-plane magnetic domain, aligning the in-plane\nmoments along the same direction. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial strain\n(-0.2% to 0.1%) significantly sharpens the magnetic hysteresis loop and\nswitches the sign of the AHE near room temperature. Remarkably, this is\nachieved without altering the AFM phase-transition temperature, which can only\nbe explained by a strain-induced modification of the electronic band structure.\nOur work not only unambiguously establishes the relationship between the\nin-plane moment direction and the AHE in $\\alpha$-MnTe but also paves the way\nfor future applications in highly scalable, strain-tunable magnetic sensors and\nspintronic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

NOCS could meet the programming speed requirements of the AI\nbackend network, or supports nonreciprocal optical switching applications\nwithout multiplexing technology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5149\u5c06\u8fd1\u7ed3\u5f0f\u4ea4\u6362\u5668\uff08OCS\uff09\u5728\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u56e0\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5149\u79ef\u5206OCS\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bf8\u5982\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7aef\u53e3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7845\u5149\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4e92\u6613\u5171\u8f6d\u5f02\u6784\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u5149\u4ea4\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8282\u70b9\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5149\u5c06\u8fd1\u4ee3\u4ea4\u6362\u6280\u672f\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7845\u5149\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4e92\u53d8\u5171\u8f6d\u975e\u4e92\u53d8\u5149\u4ea4\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u4e92\u6613\u548c\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u76f8\u79fb\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709OCS\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cNOCS\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96c6\u6210\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u53cc\u5206\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u7aef\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3AI\u540e\u7aef\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u8f6c\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u6216\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u6280\u672f\u7684\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u5149\u4ea4\u6362\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u5c06\u8fd1\u7ed3\u5f0f\u4ea4\u6362\u5668\u53d6\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u56e0\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56e0AI\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8ba1\u5212\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u8282\u70b9\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7845\u5149\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e92\u5f02\u5171\u6784\u975e\u4e92\u4ea4\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u6613\u548c\u975e\u4e92\u76f8\u79fb\u5668\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\uff0cNOCS\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u4e92\u7f16\u7a0b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96c6\u6210\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u53cc\u5206\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u7aef\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3AI\u540e\u7aef\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u8f6c\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u6216\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u6280\u672f\u7684\u975e\u4e92\u4ea4\u6362\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

An example is its\nexceptionally high heat capacity, which plays an important role in storing and\ntransporting thermal energy, with implications for many processes from\nregulating the body temperature of living organisms to moderating our climate\nat the global scale. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the heat capacity\nof water from first principles, highly accurate computer simulations are\nrequired. Apart from a reliable description of the atomic interactions, the\npresence of light hydrogen atoms necessitates the explicit consideration of\nnuclear quantum effects through path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD)\nsimulations. The high computational costs of PIMD simulations, which are even\nfurther increased by the need for an extensive statistical sampling of energy\nfluctuations to determine the heat capacity, can be strongly reduced by\nreplacing first principles calculations with machine learning potentials to\nrepresent the atomic interactions. In this study, we use high-dimensional\nneural network potentials (HDNNPs) constructed from density functional theory\ncalculations employing the RPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 functionals. To further\nenhance the computational performance, we introduce a highly efficient PIMD\nalgorithm computing in parallel not only the energies and forces but also the\ncoordinate and thermostat time evolutions. Using this approach, we are able to\ndetermine converged data for the heat capacity from a 4 ns simulation employing\n128 beads.

Herein, we focused on\nthe effect of changing the surface ionic charge of nanopores with comparable\npore size (3.5-3.8 nm) on the dynamics of confined liquid water. The control of\nthe pore surface ionicity was achieved by using two periodic mesoporous\norganosilicas (PMOs) containing either neutral or charged forms of a chemically\nsimilar bridging unit. The effect on the dynamics of water at the nanoscale was\ninvestigated in the temperature range of 245 -300 K, encompassing the glass\ntransition by incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS), For both types\nof PMOs, the water dynamics revealed two distinct types of molecular motions:\nrapid local movements and translational jump diffusion. While the neutral PMO\ninduces a moderate confinement effect, we show that the charged PMO drastically\nslows down water dynamics, reducing translational diffusion by a factor of four\nand increasing residence time by an order of magnitude.

This paper describes InterQnet, a multidisciplinary\nproject that advances scalable quantum communications through a comprehensive\napproach that improves devices, error handling, and network architecture.\nInterQnet has a two-pronged strategy to address scalability challenges:\nInterQnet-Achieve focuses on practical realizations of heterogeneous quantum\nnetworks by building and then integrating first-generation quantum repeaters\nwith error mitigation schemes and centralized automated network control\nsystems. The resulting system will enable quantum communications between two\nheterogeneous quantum platforms through a third type of platform operating as a\nrepeater node. InterQnet-Scale focuses on a systems study of architectural\nchoices for scalable quantum networks by developing forward-looking models of\nquantum network devices, advanced error correction schemes, and entanglement\nprotocols.

These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice\nmodels, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in\ncritical free-fermion systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5224\u636e\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u81ea\u7531\u8d39\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u8d85\u8d8a\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790 bulk entanglement spectrum \u548c boundary energy spectrum \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5224\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ece bulk entanglement spectrum \u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u8fb9\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7b80\u5e76\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e34\u754c\u62d3\u6251\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The 1D version of this model can be solved using the Bethe ansazt. It\nhas been shown that hybridization between itinerant and frozen localized\nelectrons results in an effective on-site interaction between itinerant\nelectrons. The magnitude and sign of this interaction depend on the position of\nthe level relative to the Fermi energy (the energy of this level corresponds to\nthe two-particle state of localized electrons at a site). It is shown that when\nthe energy of an localized electron in the two-particle state lies above the\nFermi energy, the effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons is\nattractive. A repulsive interaction between itinerant electrons occurs when\nthis energy lies below the Fermi energy.

In particular, maintaining high\nteleportation fidelity in open quantum systems is hindered by decoherence,\nwhich disrupts quantum coherence and entanglement. Traditional noise mitigation\ntechniques often neglect the rich temporal correlations present in realistic\nenvironments. This raises a key question: can non-Markovian memory effects be\nharnessed to improve the performance of quantum teleportation? In this work, we\naddress this problem by analyzing how non-Markovian dynamics influence\nteleportation fidelity. We employ a statistical speed approach based on the\nHilbert Schmidt norm to witness information backflow and monitor the system's\ninstantaneous evolution rate. Our study focuses on two measurement-based\nstrategies: weak measurement (WM) combined with quantum measurement reversal\n(QMR), and a hybrid protocol integrating environment-assisted measurement (EAM)\nwith post selection and QMR. Through analytical expressions and detailed\nnumerical simulations, we demonstrate that both strategies can enhance\nteleportation fidelity under non-Markovian noise. Notably, the EAM-based scheme\nexhibits superior robustness, achieving high fidelity even without fine-tuned\nparameters.

Finally, an analysis of the null-geodesics reveals the existence of\nat least one unstable light ring at the wormhole throat.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u5f71\u5b50\u573a\u548c\u8f74\u5fc3\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6784\u6210\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u827e\u666e\u5c14\u578b\u866b\u6d1e\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f74\u5fc3\u661f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8f74\u5fc3\u573a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u53c2\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1a\u52bf\u8870\u51cf\u5e38\u6570\u3001\u8f74\u5fc3\u573a\u9891\u7387\u548c\u866b\u6d1e\u7684throat\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u866b\u6d1e\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u900f\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u6807\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u89e3\u3002\u5d4c\u5165\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u866b\u6d1e\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u5355throat\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u53ccthroat\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8d64\u9053\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u9762\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u96f6\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81f3\u5c11\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f7b\u5b50\u73af\u4f4d\u4e8e\u866b\u6d1ethroat\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f wormhole\uff08\u866b\u6d1e\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u578b\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u9020\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u66f2\u7387\u6807\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u866b\u6d1e\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u900f\u6027\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u56fe\u548c\u96f6\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u866b\u6d1e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u7a7f\u900f\u7684\u866b\u6d1e\uff0c\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u866b\u6d1e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5177\u6709\u53ccthroat\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8d64\u9053\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u9762\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f7b\u5b50\u73af\u4f4d\u4e8e\u866b\u6d1ethroat\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u603b\u7ed3\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5982\u63a2\u7d22\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u866b\u6d1e\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5c0f\u578b\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we rewrite any given Clifford+T circuit using a Clifford block followed\nby a sequential Pauli-based computation, and introduce a nontrivial and\nancilla-free equivalent transformation rule, the multi-product commutation\nrelation (MCR). This rule constructs gate sequences based on specific\ncommutation properties among multi-Pauli operators, yielding seemingly\nnon-commutative instances that can be commuted. To evaluate whether existing\ncompilers account for this commutation rule, we create a benchmark circuit\ndataset using quantum circuit unoptimization.

By leveraging the\nknown structure of the original circuit before unoptimization, this method\nenables a quantitative evaluation of compiler performance by measuring how\nclosely the optimized circuit matches the original one.

In the\nsecond case, we set the nonunitary dynamics to be described by the noisy\noperations: depolarizing channel, phase damping channel, and generalized\namplitude damping channel. We provide analytical results for the two entropic\nmeasures, present numerical simulations to support our results on the speed\nlimits, comment on the tightness of the bounds, and provide a comparison with\nprevious QSLs. Our results may find applications in the study of quantum\nthermodynamics, entropic uncertainty relations, and also complexity of\nmany-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236(QSL)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5e73\u65b9\u6839Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u91cf\u5b50Jeffreys\u6563\u5ea6\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u95ed\u5408\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7684Schatten\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u521d\u6001\u53ca\u77ac\u6001\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u7684\u5e7a\u6b63\u548c\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5f97\u5230\u4e86Mandelstam-Tamm\u578b\u901f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7531\u566a\u58f0\u64cd\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6563\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709QSL\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u65b9\u6839Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u91cf\u5b50Jeffreys\u6563\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6f14\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u5e7a\u6b63\u548c\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "1. \u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6839Jensen-Shannon\u6d4b\u5ea6\u4e3a\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u7684Schatten\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5176\u5f53\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u968f\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u800c\u5448\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u52a0\u5173\u7cfb\u30022. \u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u672cJeffreys\u6d4b\u5ea6\u4e3a\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u7684Schatten\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u6001\u548c\u77ac\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u30023. \u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u754c\u9650\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u672cJeffreys\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u754c\u9650\u968f\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u5f97\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u65b9\u4e0d\u540c\u6563\u5ea6\u6d4b\u5ea6\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u672cJeffreys\u6563\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\u6700\u597d\u3002"}}

Motivated by the limitations of current quantum devices,\nwe study self-testing in the high-noise regime, where the two players are\nrestricted to sharing many copies of a noisy entangled state with an arbitrary\nconstant noise rate. In this setting, many existing self-tests fail to certify\nany nontrivial structure. We first characterize the maximal winning\nprobabilities of the CHSH game [CHSH69], the Magic Square game [Mer90a], and\nthe 2-out-of-n CHSH game [CRSV18] as functions of the noise rate, under the\nassumption that players use traceless observables. These results enable the\nconstruction of device-independent protocols for estimating the noise rate.\nBuilding on this analysis, we show that these three games--together with an\nadditional test enforcing the tracelessness of binary observables--can\nself-test one, two, and n pairs of anticommuting Pauli operators, respectively.\nThese are the first known self-tests that are robust in the high-noise regime\nand remain sound even when the players' measurements are noisy.
