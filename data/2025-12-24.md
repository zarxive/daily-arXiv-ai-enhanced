### [1] [Nonlocal decoding of positional and correlational information during development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20536)
*Alex Chen Yi Zhang,Pablo Mateu Hoyos,David Brückner,Gašper Tkačik*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores how developmental systems can improve cell differentiation precision by utilizing nonlocal information, like cell-cell communication. They developed a theoretical framework showing that utilizing morphogen spatial correlations and cellular lattice structure can significantly enhance positional information, which could mean better developmental accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how developmental systems enhance precision through various mechanisms is crucial. This paper aims to explore the potential of leveraging nonlocal information within cellular systems.

Method: The authors used a Bayes-optimal framework to analyze positional inference in developmental systems. They focused on deriving upper bounds for information gain, studying signal processing algorithms, and proposing chemical reaction schemes to approximate optimal inference.

Result: The study reveals that nonlocal information can significantly enhance positional information precision through: 1) utilizing morphogen spatial correlations, 2) structural priors encoding cellular lattice geometry, and 3) signal processing algorithms and chemical reactions approximating optimal inference.

Conclusion: This research suggests that leveraging correlational information can lead to substantial improvements in developmental precision, offering insights into biological development and potentially aiding synthetic biology applications.

Abstract: In many developmental systems, cells differentiate into a tissue by reading out morphogen concentration fields, a process fundamentally limited by noise. How much can the precision of this process be improved by nonlocal information, e.g., via cell-cell communication? Using a Bayes-optimal framework, we show that positional inference depends crucially on morphogen spatial correlations and on the ``structural prior'' that encodes the geometry of the cellular lattice performing the readout. We derive upper bounds on positional information gain due to nonlocal readout and identify signal processing algorithms that approximate optimal positional inference, as well as simple chemical reaction schemes which implement such algorithms. Our theory suggests that correlational information can be exploited to significantly enhance developmental precision.

### [2] [Observation of flat-band skin effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19745)
*Xulong Wang,Dongyi Wang,Congwei Lu,Ruo-Yang Zhang,Ching Hua Lee,Kun Ding,Guancong Ma*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 发现非哈密顿性 skin效应可以在一维Hermitian晶格中的平坦带上出现，弗拉赫 band在非哈密顿参数有限范围内出现，并且可以通过在开放或周期性边界条件下闭合带有平坦 band的色散 band之间的间隙来实现。实验观察了这一效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非哈密顿性效应（NHSE）在光子学、冷原子和声学中的研究近年来变得越来越重要，尤其是在理解非命名系统中的独特拓扑属性和能带行为方面。

Method: 通过在理论模型中分析非哈密顿性参数下的晶格特性，推导出相互作用项，研究了平坦 band中的 NHSE 出现的条件。利用数值模拟和实验验证观察到的现象。

Result: 在非哈密顿性参数有限的范围内，非哈密顿性诱导了平坦 band中的皮肤效应。通过在开放和周期性边界条件下研究色散关系，发现平坦 band与色散 band之间的间隙在高阶奇点处闭合。实验结果验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 非哈密顿项为晶格中的平坦 band引入了特殊的局部化波函数。非哈密顿性诱导了平坦 band中的皮肤效应，这种效应在晶格边界附近出现，当非哈密顿性足够强时，皮肤效应消失。这样的非哈密顿特性为控制拓扑相变和光诱导 skin效应提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Symmetry-protected ideal flat bands in one-dimensional (1D) Hermitian lattices are populated by compact localized states (CLS) - a special class of localization with wavefunctions confined within a small region. In this work, we discover that the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can appear in a flat band. Unlike conventional NHSEs for dispersive bands that are protected by nontrivial point-gap topology, the flat band remains a point on the complex-energy plane and is therefore always topologically trivial. We found that, intriguingly, the flat-band skin effect (FBSE) is associated with the non-trivial spectral topology of the dispersive bands enclosing the flat band on the complex-energy plane, so it only emerges within a finite range of non-Hermitian parameters and can counterintuitively disappear at large non-Hermiticity. Moreover, the gaps between the flat and the dispersive bands can close at higher-order exceptional points under both periodic and open boundary conditions. The flat-band wavefunctions are discontinuous in quantum distance across these exceptional points, signifying that the gap-closing is singular. The FBSE was experimentally observed in a non-Hermitian mechanical lattice. Our work reveals flat-band phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems and highlights new possibilities in quantum geometry and localization control.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the fact that power-law interactions occur in a plethora of physical systems, their many-body dynamics is far less understood than that of nearest-neighbor interacting systems. Here, we study information scrambling in strongly disordered spin systems with power-law interactions via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). Numerically, we find pronounced differences in the dynamical spreading of OTOCs between nearest-neighbor and power-law interacting systems. This deviation persists even for short-range interactions, opposing the common view that these interactions produce dynamics equivalent to the nearest-neighbor case. In a detailed experimental proposal, tailored but not limited to Rydberg tweezer setups, we present a protocol to extract OTOCs in XXZ Heisenberg spin systems with tunable anisotropy and programmable disorder based on currently available techniques.

TL;DR: 研究分析了量子通信中的不同信道类型及其对密钥独立协议的影响，提出了多个探索方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无密钥协议的安全性及其潜在应用，如量子互利协议的潜力。

Method: 结合量子信息理论和编码技术，通过分析错误率和 Holevo 信息评估安全性和增益。

Result: 通过编码和后处理优化，成功降低了 Holevo 总和，提升保密性。

Conclusion: 为未来量子协议开发提供了新方法。

Abstract: We examine public broadcast, forward conceptual, and backward conceptual, Quantum channels in the context of communication protocols that are independent of secret keys. Given research directions of interest previously identified in arXiv: 1804.01797, besides converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate obtained by the author in recent work (arXiv: 2507.03035), additional possibilities remain, including: (1) determining whether aspects of QKD dependent protocols can be incorporated into steps of QKD independent protocols; (2) whether there would be any amplification to the Quantum-classical performance gap that Alice and Bob can exploit towards prospective Quantum advantage; (3) formulating the conditions under which secrecy and authentication can be simultaneously achieved. To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder. Furthermore, through post-processing of the outputs of a Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) map, we also demonstrate how to decrease Holevo sum quantities with data-processing and entropy-continuity bounds.

Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of a non-interacting two-dimensional quantum gas in a weak random potential with long-range correlations. Any peaked initial momentum distribution will eventually become isotropic and broaden due to scattering events with the random potential.

### [6] [Theory of Scalable Spin Squeezing with Disordered Quantum Dipoles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19781)
*Avi Kaplan-Lipkin,Philip J. D. Crowley,Jonathan N. Hallén,Zilin Wang,Weijie Wu,Sabrina Chern,Chris R. Laumann,Lode Pollet,Norman Y. Yao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses scalable spin squeezing in a disordered dipolar spin system, showing that while disorder disrupts spin squeezing near the Ising limit, it is preserved near the Heisenberg limit through rare, tightly-coupled dimers. They propose a strategy involving nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to achieve scalable metrological precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are pushing the boundaries of quantum metrology, aiming to surpass classical limits through innovative use of spin systems and quantum simulations.

Method: Theoretical approach using quantum Monte Carlo simulations to develop and analyze a two-dimensional diluted lattice model of quantum dipoles.

Result: Scalable spin squeezing is preserved in the vicinity of the Heisenberg point despite disorder, but not near the Ising point. An experimental strategy for nitrogen-vacancy centers successfully mitigates disorder effects to enable spin squeezing.

Conclusion: Disordered dipolar spin systems can achieve scalable spin squeezing under certain conditions. The findings are experimentally relevant, particularly for nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.

Abstract: Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.

Result: 该方法通过CZ_p模型实例展示了其有效性。编码量子位以两两形式存在，支持一组逻辑门，避免了通过Eastin-Knill定理可能的量子错误修正。此外，考虑了对称强化和Hilbert空间分裂在量子记忆中的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一种新的保护量子位的方法，结合了离散对称性和拓扑的Hilbert空间分裂。通过实例验证了其有效性和潜在的应用。

Abstract: We show how combining a discrete symmetry with topological Hilbert space fragmentation can give rise to exponentially many topologically stable qubits protected by a single discrete symmetry. We illustrate this explicitly with the example of the $\mathsf{CZ}_p$ model, where the encoded qubits are stable to arbitrary symmetry-respecting perturbations for parametrically long times, substantially enhancing the robustness of a recently proposed construction based on nontopological fragmentation. In this model, the encoded qubits naturally come in pairs for which a universal set of transversal logical gates can be performed, ruling out (by the Eastin-Knill theorem) the possibility of using them for quantum error correction. We also comment on the combination of symmetry enrichment and topological fragmentation more generally, and the implications for use of systems exhibiting Hilbert space fragmentation as quantum memories.

Conclusion: 测量选择对量子态保持和信息传递至关重要，需在不同角度下进行权衡。

Abstract: For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...

Conclusion: 该方法通过提高了可扩展性和加载效率，为量子计算提供了强有力的技术支持。

Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum computation, simulation, and metrology. Among them, alkaline-earth-like atoms exhibit distinct advantages, including long coherence time and high-fidelity Rydberg gates. However, their scalability has lagged behind that of the alkali atoms. Here, we report 2,400 Ytterbium-174 atoms trapped in an optical tweezer array with enhanced single-atom loading efficiency of 83.5(1)%. Notably, the loading efficiency is largely maintained for array sizes ranging from dozens to thousands, exhibiting excellent scalability. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the enhanced loading method by showing that the enhancement exists robustly across a range of interatomic potentials, suggesting its utility for other atomic species. To establish the capability of the 174Yb arrays toward universal quantum computation, we propose to encode the qubit in the ground-clock state manifold and estimate a 99.9% two-qubit gate fidelity with experimentally feasible parameters. Our work advances the prospects for realizing large-scale quantum computers using alkaline-earth-like atoms.

Motivation: Understanding how to engineer time-crystalline states in complex quantum systems is crucial for exploring novel phases of matter and potential applications in quantum information processing.

Method: The research employs the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, applying a semi-classical analysis and considering the effects of quantum fluctuations to validate the stability of the observed time-crystalline orders.

Result: Distinct DTC orders can coexist in different spatial regions with tailored drive protocols, leading to sub-harmonic responses. The thermodynamic stability of these orders is confirmed both classically and in the presence of quantum fluctuations.

Conclusion: This study opens new avenues for controlling and engineering time-crystalline states in quantum systems through spatially structured driving, showcasing the potential for future applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: We examine the distinct discrete time crystals (DTCs) that emerge in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, subjected to spatially nonuniform periodic driving. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that by appropriately tailoring the drive protocol, distinct DTC orders can be realized in different spatial regions of the system. Consequently, the system exhibits spatially varying sub-harmonic responses with distinct frequencies. We employ a semi-classical analysis to establish the stability of these co-existing DTC orders in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we establish the stability of the stability of these co-existing DTCs in the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our results establish spatially structured driving as a powerful route to engineer novel forms of time-crystalline order.

Abstract: We find a necessary condition for subsystems to become entangled after a quantum reference frame transformation. By distinguishing between quantum systems suitable to act as reference frames and physical systems described relative to these frames, we define passive quantum reference frames and show that transformations between these cannot produce entanglement between physical systems.

Conclusion: 该系统展示了复杂多样的能级结构和相变，揭示了非哈密尔顿系统的潜在特性。

Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian extension of the Creutz ladder with generic non-reciprocal hopping. By mapping the ladder onto two decoupled non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (SSH) chains, we uncover a rich structure in parameter space under different boundary conditions. Under periodic boundary conditions, the spectrum admits a fine-tuned line in parameter space with entirely real eigenvalues, while deviations from this line induce a real--complex spectral transition without crossing exceptional points. In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions. We further show that flat bands in this system can occur both as Hermitian diabolical points and as non-Hermitian exceptional points, known as exceptional flat bands, where the dynamics is more stringent than in the Hermitian case, leading to distinct spectral and dynamical signatures.

TL;DR: Quantum many-body scars, though rare, can store energetic information, offering a promising avenue for quantum batteries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding if and how scar states can store and release energy is crucial for leveraging them in practical quantum technologies.

Method: Analyzed the PXP model's states, comparing ergotropy in many-body scars vs. thermal states.

Result: Extensive ergotropy found in interpolating states between scars and thermal, suggesting practical energy storage potential.

Conclusion: Quantum many-body scars can be harnessed for energy storage, indicating their value in quantum batteries and beyond.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars break ergodicity and evade thermalization, resulting in area law entanglement entropy even with high energy density. While their quantum correlations and entanglement have been elaborated previously, their capacity in storing extractable energy, quantified by the notion ergotropy, remains an open question. Here we focus on the representative PXP model, and unveil the extensive ergotropy scaling of a family of states interpolating between quantum many-body scars and thermal states, the latter of which are known to be passive with vanishing ergotropy. A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario. The ergotropy in a dynamical protocol shows that a reset with a global uniform coherent rotation can inject extractable energy, as a proof of principle way to charge a quantum "battery". Our protocol is tailored for near term Rydberg neutral atoms array, while also being feasible for other quantum processors. Our results establish that quantum many-body scars, despite the tiny fraction of the Hilbert space they occupy, can be efficiently exploited for storing extractable energy, and "scarring" a many-body system as a promising route for engineering quantum many-body battery.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum information has become a powerful tool for probing the structure of quantum field theories, yet its application to gauge theories remains subtle. On the one hand, quantum information theory assumes subsystem locality, i.e.~the factorization of the total Hilbert space into subsystems. On the other hand, gauge constraints prevent the total Hilbert space to decompose into a spacetime-local tensor product structure. Because the Hilbert space structure of gauge theories does not accommodate the subsystem decomposition used in quantum information theory, standard information-theoretic results, such as the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theorem, cannot be used straightforwardly in the context of gauge theories. In this work, we bridge this gap in the case of a two-dimensional lattice gauge model that captures key features of electromagnetism. In particular, we construct gauge-invariant local algebras and derive a physically meaningful decomposition of the Hilbert space, providing an operationally consistent notion of locality in the absence of a local tensor-product structure. We apply this framework to field-mediated entanglement protocols relevant to proposed tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We show that the discretized version of electromagnetism satisfies an analogue of the LOCC theorem: entanglement cannot be generated without genuine quantum field interactions, even in the absence of a spacetime-local tensor product factorization of the Hilbert space. This may point towards an operational way to define a subsystem structure for gauge theories.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning.

Abstract: Quantum measurements, alongside quantum states and processes, form a cornerstone of quantum information processing. However, unlike states and processes, their efficient characterisation remains relatively unexplored. We resolve this asymmetry by introducing a comprehensive framework for efficient detector estimation that reveals the fundamental limits to extractable parameter information and errors arising in detector analysis - the \emph{detector quantum Fisher information}. Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements.

Abstract: Optical skyrmions are topological structures of light whose defining property, the skyrmion number, is robust against perturbations. This makes them attractive for applications in quantum information storage, where resilience to decoherence is paramount. However, their preservation during coherent storage remains unexplored. We report the first experimental demonstration of storing and retrieving optical skyrmions in a cold $^{87}$Rb vapor using a dual-path electromagnetically induced transparency memory. Crucially, we show that the skyrmion number remains invariant for storage times up to several microseconds, even when subjected to imbalanced loss between the two paths and substantial perturbations in control beam power. Our work demonstrates the survival of a non-trivial topological invariant in a quantum memory, marking a significant step towards topologically protected photonic technologies.

Abstract: This article presents an analysis of the practical challenges and implementation perspectives of point-to-point continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems over optical fiber. The study addresses the physical layer, including the design of transmitters, quantum channels, and receivers, with emphasis on impairments such as attenuation, chromatic dispersion, polarization fluctuations, and coexistence with classical channels. We further examine the role of digital signal processing (DSP) as the bridge between quantum state transmission and classical post-processing, highlighting its impact on excess noise mitigation, covariance matrix estimation, and reconciliation efficiency. The post-processing pipeline is detailed with a focus on parameter estimation in the finite-size regime, information reconciliation using LDPC-based codes optimized for low-SNR conditions, and privacy amplification employing large-block universal hashing. From a hardware perspective, we discuss modular digital architectures that integrate dedicated accelerators with programmable processors, supported by a reference software framework (CV-QKD-ModSim) for algorithm validation and hardware co-design. Finally, we outline perspectives for the deployment of CV-QKD in Brazil, starting from metropolitan testbeds and extending toward hybrid fiber/FSO and space-based infrastructures. The work establishes the foundations for the first point-to-point CV-QKD system in Brazil, while providing a roadmap for scalable and interoperable quantum communication networks.

Abstract: Starting from square-integrable wave functions on a Lie group, we build an invertible Fourier transform mapping them on wave functions on the dual of the Lie algebra. This is a group-theoretic version of the map from position space to momentum space, with generally noncommuting momenta owing to the group structure. As a result, the multiplication of momentum-dependent functions involves star products, which makes the construction of noncommutative Fourier series much more involved than that of their commutative cousin. We show that our formalism provides an isometry of Hilbert spaces, and use it to derive a noncommutative Poisson summation formula for any compact Lie group. This is a key preliminary for the computation of Wigner functions and path integrals for quantum systems on group manifolds.

Abstract: We analyze emission trajectories from a driven-dissipative two-qubit system and a classical telegraph model with matched rates. Using Lempel-Ziv complexity, mutual information, and temporal correlations, we show that both models undergo a transition from independent to synchronized dynamics as coupling increases, but only the quantum trajectories develop enhanced complexity and sustained information sharing at large drive-to-decay ratio. Classical correlations are short-lived and quickly suppressed by strong drive. A strong complexity-information correlation appears uniquely in the quantum case, providing a clear trajectory-level signature of quantum effects. These results show that complexity and information measures extracted directly from jump records provide an efficient way to distinguish quantum and classical dynamics in open systems.

Abstract: Electronic excited states are central to a vast array of physical and chemical phenomena, yet accurate and efficient methods for preparing them on quantum devices remain challenging and comparatively underexplored. We introduce a general dissipative algorithm for selectively preparing ab initio electronic excited states. The key idea is to recast excited-state preparation as an effective ground-state problem by suitably modifying the underlying Lindblad dynamics so that the target excited state becomes the unique steady state of a designed quantum channel. We develop three complementary strategies, tailored to different types of prior information about the excited state, such as symmetry and approximate energy. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of these schemes through numerical simulations of atomic and molecular spectra, including valence excitations in prototypical planar conjugated molecules and transition-metal complexes. Taken together, these results provide a new pathway for advancing quantum simulation methods for realistic strongly correlated electronic systems.

### [23] [Gate-Based Microwave Quantum Repeater Via Grid-State Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19896)
*Hany Khalifa,Matti Silveri*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 稹_ROTated the tldr. The paper proposes a second-generation gate-based microwave quantum repeater (GBMQR) with encoded bosonic grid states. Each repeater station comprises a transmon and two bosonic resonators: one resonator as a stationary quantum memory utilizing autonomous error correction, and the other as an information bus for entanglement generation. The method enables deterministic entanglement generation. The performance is evaluated by calculating the secret key rate. Under realistic lab environments, at a stationary damping rate of κ^{-1}_{damp}=~40 ms, the GBMQR achieves success probabilities of ~0.75 for entanglement generation and ~0.58 for swapping, surpassing the benchmark probability of 1/2. The proposed device can be implemented using current superconducting microwave technology for secure chip-to-chip communication and distributed quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work advances the field of quantum repeaters by proposing an improved design that eliminates mode-mismatch losses associated with traditional methods. It utilizes autonomous quantum error correction for extended logical qubit lifetimes and implements an all-bosonic Bell-state measurement to enhance performance.

Method: The method divides the repeater station into two bosonic resonators. One resonator is used as a quantum memory with autonomous error correction, while the other serves as an information bus. Entanglement generation is achieved through sequential absorption of microwave photons and successful absorption enables entanglement generation. The protocol employs an all-bosonic Bell-state measurement via a bosonic controlled-Z gate and X-basis projective homodyne measurements. The success probabilities of entanglement generation and swapping are analyzed under realistic laboratory conditions, showing that they surpass a critical benchmark. The approach avoids mode-mismatch losses and confines losses to stationary storage.

Result: The proposed GBMQR achieves success probabilities of approximately 0.75 for entanglement generation and 0.58 for swapping. These probabilities surpass the benchmark of 1/2, indicating a significant improvement over traditional methods. The repeater design is evaluated under realistic lab conditions and shows promising results for secure communication and distributed quantum computing.

Conclusion: The GBMQR represents a breakthrough in quantum repeater technology by eliminating mode-mismatch losses and reducing reliance on heralding signals, which are prone to inefficiency. The success of entanglement generation and swapping surpasses benchmarks, making it a viable solution for secure quantum communication and distributed quantum computing applications.

Abstract: In autonomous quantum error correction the lifetime of a logical bosonic qubit can be extended beyond its physical constituents without feedback measurements. Leveraging autonomous error correction, we propose a second-generation gate-based microwave quantum repeater (GBMQR) with encoded bosonic grid states. Each repeater station comprises a transmon and two bosonic resonators: one resonator serving as a stationary quantum memory utilizing autonomous error correction, and the other as an information bus for entanglement generation. Entanglement is generated sequentially through the successful absorption of a microwave photon wavepacket. This method enables deterministic entanglement generation, in contrast to a probabilistic mixing of two heralding signals on a balanced beamsplitter. Furthermore, our GBMQR employs an all-bosonic entanglement swapping Bell-state measurement. This is implemented via a bosonic controlled-Z gate and two separate X-basis projective homodyne measurements on the stationary stored codewords. Our approach circumvents mode-mismatch losses associated with routing and interfering of heralding modes on a beamsplitter, and confines losses to those arising from stationary storage. We evaluate the performance of the proposed quantum repeater by calculating its secret key rate under realistic lab environments. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate that at stationary damping rate of $κ^{-1}_{\text{damp}}=$~\SI{40}{\milli\second}, GBMQR can achieve entanglement generation and swapping success probabilities approx.~$0.75$, and $0.58$ respectively, surpassing the hallmark success probability of $1/2$ set by ideal linear beamsplitter-based Bell-state measurements. The proposed device can be implemented using currently available superconducting microwave technology and is suited for secure chip-to-chip communication and distributed quantum computing.

Motivation: 随着量子处理器的发展，量子位的读出变得越来越重要。为实现量子最优信噪比，需要使用量子受限放大器。然而，传统的量子受限放大器由于依赖泵波的下转换，存在硬件负担和扩展性差的问题。因此，开发无需泵波基础设施的高效宽频量子受限放大器具有重要意义。

Abstract: Fast, high-fidelity, single-shot readout of superconducting qubits in quantum processors demands quantum-limited amplifiers to preserve the optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, quantum-limited amplification is achieved with parametric down-conversion of a strong pump tone, which imposes significant hardware overhead and severely limits scalability. Here, we demonstrate the first DC-powered broadband amplifier operating within 0.2 photons of the quantum limit. Our impedance-engineered Inelastic Cooper-pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA)-a voltage-biased SQUID in which Cooper pairs tunnel inelastically by emitting signal-idler photon pairs-operates in reflection, delivering 13 dB of average gain across a 3.5 GHz bandwidth in a single stage. Semiclassical simulations accurately predict the gain and saturation power, enabling further design improvements. By eliminating the pump-tone infrastructure, the broadband ICTA promises to dramatically reduce the hardware complexity of quantum-limited amplification in superconducting quantum processors.

Conclusion: 发现 Platforms 可以超越传统拓扑学分类，'Stokes不变量'成为下一阶段的量子数，用于描述超越常规拓扑极限的相。

Abstract: Standard topological invariants, such as the Chern number and Berry phase, form the bedrock of modern quantum matter classification. However, we demonstrate that this framework undergoes a \textbf{catastrophic failure} in the presence of essential singularities -- ubiquitous in open, driven, and non-Hermitian systems ("Wild" regime). In these settings, the local geometric tensor diverges, rendering standard invariants ill-defined and causing perturbative predictions to deviate from reality by order unity ($\sim 100\%$). We resolve this crisis by introducing the \textbf{Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy (FMS)} protocol, a pulse-level control sequence, which experimentally extracts the hidden \textit{Stokes Phenomenon} -- the "missing" geometric data that completes the topological description. By mapping the singularity's Stokes multipliers to time-domain observables, FMS provides a rigorous experimental bridge to \textbf{Resurgence Theory}, allowing for the exact reconstruction of non-perturbative physics from divergent asymptotic series. We validate this framework on a superconducting qudit model, demonstrating that the "Stokes Invariant" serves as the next-generation quantum number for classifying phases of matter beyond the reach of conventional topology.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Very fast quantum gates surpassing decoherence limits can be achieved by using strong driving, but this requires suppressing multi-photon leakage errors while respecting time-ordering effects. Analytical formulas for error suppression and optimal parameter calibration are derived, achieving near-perfect gate fidelity for 7ns π-rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quantum gate speed and reliability, particularly in the face of decoherence, is a key challenge in quantum computing. This paper addresses this by exploring advanced error suppression techniques in the strong driving limit, which is essential for high-fidelity gate operations.

Method: The authors employ analytical derivations and numerical simulations to model multi-photon leaks, derive formulas for error suppression (R1D and R2D methods), and optimize time-dependent driving parameters to maximize gate performance while accounting for realistic decoherence rates.

Result: The proposed methods effectively suppress gate errors, achieving infidelity below 1e-5 for 7ns π-rotations, which is a substantial improvement over previous approaches. This quantitatively demonstrates the practicality of the methods in reducing gate errors in quantum computing platforms.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive framework for achieving ultra-fast, decoherence-protected gates by incorporating advanced modeling of multi-photon transitions and optimal parameter tuning. The demonstrated gate fidelity is a breakthrough in fast gate implementation with current decoherence rates.

Abstract: Achieving very fast gates that undercut the natural limits set by decoherence requires going into the strong driving limit. Realizing single-qubit control predicted beyond semi-classical, time-dependent modeling has yet to be experimentally realized on superconducting and most other computing platforms. In this regime, the common model of dynamics within a three-level manifold breaks down, and instead, we see new quantum error channels growing abruptly with decreasing time. To identify these error processes we systematically calculate the effect of multi-photon transitions that occur out of the computational space. We then derive analytical formulas to suppress these effects, as well as amplitude and phase errors on the qubit space; we term these R1D for suppressing the $|0\rangle-|2\rangle$ transition and R2D when also suppressing $|1\rangle-|3\rangle$ leakage. We also answer long-standing questions about the optimal values of the DRAG prefactor as well as constant detuning, when accounting for time-ordering, and also show how to calibrate other prefactors for further performance improvement. Upon correcting these varied sources of error, we numerically demonstrate gate infidelities below $10^{-5}$ for a 7ns $π$-rotation when incorporating existing decoherence rates.

Motivation: This paper presents ORT measure calculations for mixed states with photon number coherence, offering exact formulas and numerical solutions to advance understanding in quantum metrology and nonclassicality.

Method: Exact formulas for rank-two mixed states and numerical techniques for higher-rank states were developed to compute ORT measures, comparing nonclassicality with metrological power.

Result: Nonclassicality and metrological power behaviors under bosonic dephasing are analyzed, revealing saturation of ORT bounds while sometimes allowing higher useful states with reduced photon number coherence.

Conclusion: This bridge between ORT measure and metrological power can aid in designing metrologically useful states for quantum information processing and metrology.

Abstract: The operational resource theory (ORT) measure is a nonclassicality measure for bosonic states, notable for its resource-theoretic properties and connection to metrology. However, it can be difficult to evaluate, being linked to an optimization problem for mixed states. Here, we present the first ORT measure calculations for mixed states with photon number coherence. We give exact formulas governing the ORT measure of a broad class of rank-two mixed states, and numerical solutions for some higher-rank states. We also compare the nonclassicality of these states to their metrological power, thus showing in what regimes the metrological power manages to saturate the ORT bound. Throughout, we consider the role of coherence. In particular, we show that nonclassicality and metrological power never increase under bosonic dephasing, but may plateau in a manner similar to entanglement sudden death. Nevertheless, lowering photon number coherence more freely can sometimes yield more nonclassical and metrologically useful states.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new Boolean-based methodology for constructing Segment Display Problems (SDPs) in the quantum domain and solving them using Grover's quantum search algorithm. In the classical domain, the SDPs are typically solved using various techniques, such as human deduction, heuristic search, and methods for solving Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) that are based on different problem design models. In this paper, our newly introduced methodology proposes a quantum-based approach for solving such SDPs, by building their quantum oracle using binary reversible circuits and our previously proposed step-decreasing structures shaped operators (Stesso). To demonstrate the usability of this proposed method, we experimentally solve an SDP instance of the matchstick problem using Grover's algorithm with a noisy simulated quantum computer implemented in Qiskit.

Abstract: We introduce Quantum Index Algebra (QIA) as a finite, index-based algebraic framework for representing and manipulating quantum operators on Hilbert spaces of dimension $2^m$. In QIA, operators are expressed as structured combinations of basis elements indexed by Boolean codes, allowing products, commutators, and conjugations to be computed through finite rules on discrete indices rather than through dense matrix arithmetic. This representation unifies combinatorial index structure, explicit matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms within a single formalism. Using QIA and its associated block-matrix realization, we reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani hidden-string problem in its phase-oracle form entirely within a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting. We show that, under structured oracle access, the QIA procedure reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly and achieves the same asymptotic query complexity and circuit depth as the standard quantum algorithm. In particular, the hidden string is recovered by symbolic manipulation of a sparse algebraic representation of the oracle rather than by numerical simulation of quantum amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the apparent quantum speed-up in this setting is a consequence of operator structure rather than Hilbert-space dimensionality alone. QIA thus provides a precise language for separating genuinely quantum resources from those arising from algebraic and combinatorial structures and offers a new perspective on the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits.

Abstract: The performance of quantum neural network models depends strongly on architectural decisions, including circuit depth, placement of parametrized operations, and data-encoding strategies. Selecting an effective architecture is challenging and closely related to the classical difficulty of choosing suitable neural-network topologies, which is computationally hard. This work investigates automated quantum-circuit construction for regression tasks and introduces a genetic-algorithm framework that discovers Reduced Regressor QNN architectures. The approach explores depth, parametrized gate configurations, and flexible data re-uploading patterns, formulating the construction of quantum regressors as an optimization process. The discovered circuits are evaluated against seventeen classical regression models on twenty-two nonlinear benchmark functions and four analytical functions. Although classical methods often achieve comparable results, they typically require far more parameters, whereas the evolved quantum models remain compact while providing competitive performance. We further analyze dataset complexity using twelve structural descriptors and show, across five increasingly challenging meta-learning scenarios, that these measures can reliably predict which quantum architecture will perform best. The results demonstrate perfect or near-perfect predictive accuracy in several scenarios, indicating that complexity metrics offer powerful and compact representations of dataset structure and can effectively guide automated model selection. Overall, this study provides a principled basis for meta-learning-driven quantum architecture design and advances the understanding of how quantum models behave in regression settings--a topic that has received limited exploration in prior work. These findings pave the way for more systematic and theoretically grounded approaches to quantum regression.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement enables secure group key distribution among multiple users while providing immunity against hacking attacks targeting source devices, thereby realizing source-independent quantum conference key agreement (SI-QCKA). However, previous experimental demonstrations of SI-QCKA have encountered substantial technical challenges, primarily due to the low efficiency and scalability limitations inherent in the generation and distribution of multipartite entanglement. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable and efficient SI-QCKA protocol using polarization-entangled photon pairs in a three-user star network, where Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger correlations are realized via a post-matching method. We achieve a secure group key rate of $2.11 \times 10^{4}$ bits/s under the single-user channel transmission of 1.64 $\times$ $10^{-1}$ in a symmetric channel loss network. Additionally, we conduct six sets of experiments to investigate the impact of varying channel transmission and random basis selection probabilities on secure key rates. Our work establishes an efficient pathway for SI-QCKA and demonstrates potential scalability for future large-scale multi-user quantum networks.

Abstract: High-fidelity state transfer is fundamentally limited by time-reversal symmetry: one qubit emits a photon with a certain temporal pulse shape, whereas a second qubit requires the time-reversed pulse shape to efficiently absorb this photon. This limit is often overcome by introducing active elements. Here, we propose an alternative solution: by tailoring the dispersion relation of a waveguide, the photon pulse emitted by one qubit is passively reshaped into its time-reversed counterpart, thus enabling perfect absorption. We analytically derive the optimal dispersion relations in the limit of small and large qubit-qubit separations, and numerically extend our results to arbitrary separations via multiparameter optimization. We further propose a spatially inhomogeneous waveguide that renders the state transfer robust to variations in qubit separations. In all cases, we obtain near-unity transfer fidelity (>= 98%). Our dispersion-engineered waveguide provides a compact and passive route toward on-chip quantum networks, highlighting engineered dispersion as a powerful resource in waveguide quantum electrodynamics.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to the use of quantum information methods for investigating the interface between quantum theory and gravity. To this end, we discuss the basic principles of two current research streams that use this approach. The first one explores a phenomenon known as gravitationally induced entanglement, which aims to infer whether the gravitational field responsible for the interaction between two massive bodies must be quantized or not. The second stream investigates causal structures, thereby providing indirect evidence that spacetime may exhibit non-classical behavior. Before presenting these topics, we briefly review some fundamental concepts and experiments from quantum information theory, such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the Stern-Gerlach experiment, Bell inequalities and entanglement, and the language of quantum circuits.

Abstract: An augmented system model provides an effective way to model non-Markovian quantum systems, which is useful in filtering and control for this class of systems. However, since a large number of ancillary quantum oscillators representing internal modes of a non-Markovian environment directly interact with the principal system in these models, the dimension of the augmented system may be very large causing significant computational burden in designing filters and controllers. In this context, this paper proposes an $\mathscr{H}_2$ model reduction method for the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. We first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the physical realizability of the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems, which are more stringent than those for Markovian quantum systems. However, these physical realizability conditions of augmented system model pose non-convex constrains in the optimization problem of model reduction, which makes the problem different from the corresponding classical model reduction problem. To solve the problem, we derive necessary conditions for determining the input matrix in the reduced model, with which a theorem for designing the system matrix of the ancillary system in the reduced system is proved. Building on this, we convert the nonlinear equality constraints into inequality constraints so that a semidefinite programming algorithm can be developed to solve the optimization problem for model reduction.
  A numerical example of a two-mode linear quantum system driven by three internal modes of a non-Markovian environment validates the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Optically addressable spin defects are excellent candidate platform for quantum sensing and quantum network. Nuclear spins coupled to color centers naturally enable long lived quantum memories and local qubits registers. To fully leverage this potential precise characterization of the surrounding nuclear-spin environment augmented with refined DFT models is required. In this work, we report angstrom-level 3D localization of 25 nuclear spins around a single V2 center in 4H Silicon Carbide. Utilizing specially placed robust nuclear memory as a highly efficient readout ancilla for readout, we apply correlation based spectroscopy and by selecting multi-spin chains up to length four, we access and characterize extended nuclear spin cluster.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement routing in dynamic Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks is important for achieving scalable and high-fidelity quantum communication. However, the dynamic characteristics of satellite network topology, limited quantum resources, and strict coherence time constraints pose significant challenges to reliable entanglement routing. An entanglement distribution analysis model for this unique environment is critical and helpful for entanglement routing research. We address the fundamental challenge of establishing and maintaining quantum entanglement links between satellites operating in free space, where links are subject to both transmission losses and quantum memory decoherence. This paper presents a comprehensive Markov chain model with a state space defined by link storage age and physical distance for analyzing entanglement distribution in noisy dynamic LEO satellite quantum networks. We construct transition matrices that capture system dynamics under varying request arrival rates, and derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including request satisfaction rate, average waiting time, link utilization efficiency, and average consumed link fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the critical trade-offs of higher request rates lead to faster link consumption with higher fidelity but potentially lower satisfaction rates, while lower request rates allow longer storage times at the cost of lower fidelity of increased decoherence effect. Moreover, this paper proves it is reasonable to leave out polarization rotation when the transmission distance is very short (40-50 km). In summary, this work provides theoretical foundations for designing and optimizing quantum entanglement distribution strategies in satellite networks, with applications to global-scale quantum communications.

Abstract: We show that Hall's exact uncertainty relation acquires a simple geometric form in the Krylov basis generated by the Liouvillian. In this canonical operator frame, the uncertainty equality implies that the operator amplitude vector evolves on the unit Krylov sphere with constant speed fixed solely by the first Lanczos coefficient. This yields an exact linear bound on geometric operator evolution, independent of higher Lanczos coefficients and valid for arbitrary Hamiltonians, integrable or chaotic. Our results provide the first unified geometric interpretation of exact quantum speed limits and operator growth, identifying the first Lanczos coefficient as the intrinsic speed scale of quantum dynamics.

### [38] [Fault Injection Attacks on Machine Learning-based Quantum Computer Readout Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20077)
*Anthony Etim,Jakub Szefer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the resilience of machine learning-based quantum computer readout systems to physical faults, specifically voltage glitching. Through experiments on a 5-qubit readout error correction model, the authors identify that the susceptibility of the ML classifiers varies significantly across different layers of the system. Early layers are more prone to mispredictions, while later layers exhibit reduced sensitivity to faults. Additionally, the analysis reveals that single-shot glitches cause structured readout corruption, which should be considered in the security and reliability of quantum computing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As quantum computing systems become more integrated into critical applications, ensuring the security and reliability of their readout mechanisms is paramount. ML classifiers are increasingly used for readout correction, but their vulnerability to physical faults like voltage glitches poses a risk. Understanding and mitigating such vulnerabilities is essential for robust quantum computing systems.

Method: The authors employ the ChipWhisperer Husky tool to perform physical voltage glitching. An automated algorithm is used to scan the fault injection parameter space, targeting all layers of a 5-qubit ML model. The process involves multiple trials to collect data on fault susceptibility, misprediction rates, and readout corruption patterns.

Result: The study demonstrates that fault susceptibility is significantly layer-dependent. Early layers exhibit higher misprediction rates, and later layers are less affected. Additionally, single-shot glitches induce structured readout corruption, as evidenced by Hamming-distance and per-bit flip statistics. These findings underscore the need for enhanced security measures and fault detection mechanisms in quantum readout pipelines.

Conclusion: ML-based quantum computer readout and correction mechanisms must be treated as security-critical components. The research highlights the importance of lightweight and deployment-friendly fault detection and redundancy mechanisms to ensure the reliability and robustness of quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) classifiers are increasingly used in quantum computing systems to improve multi-qubit readout discrimination and to mitigate correlated readout errors. These ML classifiers are an integral component of today's quantum computer's control and readout stacks. This paper is the first to analyze the susceptibility of such ML classifiers to physical fault-injection which can result in generation of incorrect readout results from quantum computers. The study targets 5-qubit (thus 32-class) readout error-correction model. Using the ChipWhisperer Husky for physical voltage glitching, this work leverages an automated algorithm for scanning the fault injection parameter search space to find various successful faults in all the layers of the target ML model. Across repeated trials, this work finds that fault susceptibility is strongly layer-dependent: early-layers demonstrate higher rates of misprediction when faults are triggered in them, whereas later layers have smaller misprediction rates. This work further characterizes the resulting readout failures at the bitstring level using Hamming-distance and per-bit flip statistics, showing that single-shot glitches can induce structured readout corruption rather than purely random noise. These results motivate treating ML-based quantum computer readout and readout correction as a security-critical component of quantum systems and highlight the need for lightweight, deployment-friendly fault detection and redundancy mechanisms in the quantum computer readout pipelines.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate quantum measurement noise in a hybrid optomechanical system, focusing on radiation pressure back action and its impact on force sensing. The setup consists of an optomechanical cavity with a movable mirror, a fixed semi transparent mirror, an ensemble of quantum dots (QD) coupled to the cavity mode, and an intracavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We show how the QD induced response, together with the system nonlinearity, modifies the noise spectral density and thereby improves the force measurement sensitivity. In this setup, coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) can completely remove the back action noise. In addition, increasing the OPA pump gain enables sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) at reduced laser power. These combined effects allow weak force sensing beyond the SQL.

Abstract: A dynamical bulk-edge relation in quantum walks has been theoretically proposed and experimentally observed, in which a power-law dependence of the bulk loss probability is associated with a pronounced peak of loss probability at the edge. This behavior has been proven to arise from imaginary gap closing and the non-Hermitian skin effect in the infinite limit without boundary effects. However, in a finite-size chain, we find that boundary scattering can suppress this edge burst. Meanwhile, imaginary gap opening together with the non-Hermitian skin effect, can also induce a large loss probability at the edge. Our results provide insights into finite-size quantum dynamics.

Abstract: The optimal control of population transfer for multi-level systems is investigated from the perspective of quantum geometry. Firstly, the general theoretical framework of optimizing the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) scheme based on the dynamical quantum geometric tensor is given, and then the dynamical quantum geometric tensor and the nonadiabatic transition rate are calculated by taking the detuned $Λ$-type three-level system and tripod-type four-level system for example. Secondly, the transfer dynamics of the particle population of the system are investigated in detail. For a three-level system, the optimal STIRAP scheme has an efficiency of over 98\% in transferring the population to the final state, while the transfer efficiency of traditional STIRAP is about 72\%. The superposition states with arbitrary proportions can be efficiently prepared for a four-level system due to the decoupling of the degenerate dark states. Finally, the influences of system parameters, such as the operation time of the Rabi pulses, the amplitude fluctuation and the single-photon detuning, on the transfer process are discussed. Especially, the phenomenon of the adiabatic resonance transfer is revealed. Choosing the pulse parameters in the resonance window can reduce the infidelity of the population transfer to below $10^{-3}$. It is found that the optimal STIRAP scheme by the dynamical quantum geometric tensor provides faster and more efficient transfer than the traditional STIRAP scheme.

Based on that, we establish a systematic method for determining UDA states and provide a complete characterization of the additivity of UDA bipartite and three-qubit product states. We show the application of mixed UDA states and their characterization from the perspectives of tomography and other tasks.

Abstract: Silicon quantum dot spin qubits have become a promising platform for scalable quantum computing because of their small size and compatibility with industrial semiconductor manufacturing processes. Although Si/SiGe heterostructures are commonly used to host spin qubits due to their high mobility and low percolation density, the SiGe spacer creates a gap between the qubits and control electrodes, which limits the ability to tune exchange coupling. As a result, residual coupling leads to unwanted single-qubit phase shifts, making multi-qubit control more difficult. In this work, we explore swapping the roles of overlapping nanogates to overcome this issue. By reconfiguring the gate voltages, we demonstrate in situ role switching while maintaining multi-qubit control. Additionally, this method significantly improves the tunability of exchange coupling by several orders of magnitude over the traditional approach. This strategy reduces unintended single-qubit phase shifts and minimizes the complexity of multi-qubit control, supporting scalable growth with minimal experimental overhead.

Abstract: The systematic discovery of effective drug combinations is a challenging problem in modern pharmacology, driven by the combinatorial growth of potential pairings and dosage configurations. Network medicine, modeling diseases and drugs as interconnected modules of the human protein-protein interactome, has emerged as a new paradigm for understanding disease mechanisms and drug action. In this work, we propose a quantum annealing-based algorithm for identifying effective drug combinations. Underlying our approach is the biologically motivated principle of `Complementary Exposure', which posits that therapeutic drug combinations target distinct yet complementary regions of a disease module. We translate this into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation problem. We test our method for Diabetes Mellitus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Asthma, and Brain Neoplasms, relying on experimentally validated drug combinations for these diseases. Our simulated quantum annealing experiments reveal that low-energy configurations align with biologically plausible combinations, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to generate novel predictions for drug combinations.

TL;DR: This paper investigates spin-active colour centres in 4H silicon carbide for quantum information applications. By integrating these colour centres into nanophotonic structures with photonic crystals, they achieve high photon count rates at cryogenic conditions. The proposed waveguide structures show promising results with high reflectivity and improved count rates through advanced measurement techniques, paving the way for scalable quantum information processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage spin-active colour centres in 4H silicon carbide for quantum information applications, which requires high photon emission rates and effective integration into photonic structures and cryogenic environments.

Method: The method involves designing and fabricating waveguide structures with photonic crystals, integrating colour centres, and characterising the devices under cryogenic conditions. Techniques such as reflectometry and charge-resonance check measurements are used to maximise photon count rates.

Result: The devices exhibit broadband high-reflection characteristics with peak reflectance exceeding 80% and a significant improvement in photon count rates from approximately 10^4 kcps to 125 kcps. Theoretically, these results support optical single-shot readout with high fidelity, a key requirement for quantum information processing.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a scalable approach for room-temperature operation of colour-centre-based quantum machines, highlighting the potential of spin-active centres in quantum information applications.

Abstract: Spin-active colour centres in 4H silicon carbide are promising candidates as building blocks for quantum information applications. To increase the photon count rate of the emitters at low temperatures, the colour centres must be integrated into nanophotonic structures and characterised under cryogenic conditions. Here, we design and fabricate waveguide structures attached with an efficient Dinosaur photonic crystal reflector at one side. The devices show broadband reflection over a range of 60 THz with a peak reflectance above 80 %. Additionally, colour centres were integrated into these structures and characterised at cryogenic conditions. The emission was collected by a tapered-waveguide-tapered-fibre interface. Although the spectral stability of the emitters must be further improved for high excitation powers, the saturation intensity in standard PLE measurements is about 104 kcps. The count rate can be further improved to about 125 kcps with a charge-resonance check measurement scheme. To highlight the relevance of our devices, we theoretically show that these count rates enable optical single-shot readout with a fidelity exceeding 98 %.

Abstract: Extending corresponding results for matrix product states [Verstraete and Cirac, PRB 73, 094423 (2006); Schuch et al.

Conversely, one obtains bounds on TTNS bond dimensions needed to achieve a specific approximation accuracy. For tree lattices, the result implies that efficient TTNS approximations exist if $α<1$ Rényi entanglement entropies for single-branch cuts obey an area law, as in ground and low-energy states of certain gapped systems.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is an essential resource for quantum technologies, and the controlled swap test provides a versatile tool for its detection and quantification.

The method is resource-efficient, robust to noise, and platform-independent. As an example, we validate the approach on a room-temperature photonic chip, where the swap test is carried out using only linear and well-established integrated optical components. The robustness of the method against photonic-hardware noise is also analysed. Our results establish a simple and reliable tool for entanglement witnessing.

Abstract: This work studies a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian spin--boson model, consisting of a non-Hermitian two-level system coupled to a continuous bosonic bath. The static properties of the system are analyzed through a projection method derived from the displacement operator. We find that only a single exceptional point (EP) emerges, in contrast to non-Hermitian spin--boson models with finite modes, which typically exhibit multiple EPs. Notably, only a single real eigenvalue is found before the EP, which differs markedly from typical non-Hermitian systems where a pair of real eigenvalues precedes the EP. The time evolution of observables is further investigated via the Dirac--Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. Compared to its Hermitian counterpart, the non-Hermitian model exhibits distinct dynamical signatures, most notably the emergence of oscillations with periodic amplified amplitude. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken phase, the system exhibits sustained oscillatory dynamics with suppressed decoherence, whereas in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, additional dissipative channels accelerate decoherence and drive rapid convergence toward a stable steady state. These results shed light on how $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry protects coherent light--matter interactions in non-Hermitian quantum systems.

Abstract: The nonintegrable transverse-field Ising model is a common platform for studying ergodic quantum dynamics. In this work, we introduce a simple variant of the model in which this ergodic behaviour is suppressed by introducing a spatial inhomogeneity in the interaction strengths. For this we partition the chain into two equal segments within which the spins interact with different coupling strengths. The ratio of these couplings defines an inhomogeneity parameter, whose variation away from unity leads to constrained dynamics. We characterize this crossover using multiple diagnostics, such as the long-time saturation of out-of-time-ordered correlators, level-spacing statistics, and the spectral form factor. We further examine the consequences for operator growth in Krylov space and for entanglement generation in the system's eigenstates. Together, these results demonstrate that introducing a macroscopic inhomogeneity in coupling strengths provides a minimal, disorder-free route to breaking ergodicity in this specific model of interacting spins.

Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation for a quantum system with complex mass subjected to a complex Morse potential in the extended complex phase space. The normalized eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenspectra are derived within a non-Hermitian framework, ensuring consistent probability densities. Conditions for the reality of the spectra are established and used to analyze the dependence of eigenvalue behaviour on potential parameters. The study reveals distinct regimes of spectral characteristics arising from the interplay of complex mass, the Morse parameter, and eigenvalues, leading to the emergence of five intrinsic matter types. By analysing the energy eigenspectra, normalization conditions, and probability density profiles across parameter space, we identify regimes corresponding to real-spectrum Hermitian-like matter, quasi-stable or resonant states, purely complex quantum matter, non-physical, non-normalizable states, and a quasi-classical determinate regime in which the probability density becomes spatially static. One of these system exhibits a non-dissipative, collisionless state with long-range gravitational-like characteristics, suggesting a theoretical analogue for dark matter within a non-Hermitian quantum framework. Further, the five identified classes of matter may be interpreted as distinct phases of a single quantum system governed by complex mass and Morse parameters This classification elucidates the boundary between physical and non-physical regimes in complex quantum systems and provides a unified approach for interpreting stability, resonance, and emergent classicality arising from complex parameters.

Abstract: We study in this paper the quantum phase transition (QPT) from normal phase (NP) to superradiant phase (SP) for $N$ three-level atoms in a single-mode optical cavity for both Hermitian and non Hermitian Hamiltonians, where the $Ξ$-type three-level atom is described by spin-$1$ pseudo-spin operators. The long standing gauge-choice ambiguity of $\mathbf{A\cdot p}$ and $\mathbf{d\cdot E}$ called respectively the Coulomb and dipole gauges is resolved by the time-dependent gauge transformation on the Schrödinger equation. Both $\mathbf{A\cdot p}$ and $\mathbf{d\cdot E}$ interactions are included in the unified gauge, which is truly gauge equivalent to the minimum coupling principle. The Coulomb and dipole interactions are just the special cases of unified gauge. Remarkably three interactions lead to the same results under the resonant condition of field-atom frequencies, while significant difference appears in red and blue detunings. The QPT is analyzed in terms of spin coherent-state variational method, which indicates the abrupt changes of energy spectrum, average photon number as well as the atomic population at the critical point of interaction constant. Crucially, we reveal the sensitive dependence on the initial optical-phase, which is particularly useful to test the validity of three gauges experimentally. The non-Hermitian atom-field interaction results in the exceptional point (EP), beyond which the semiclassical energy function becomes complex. However the energy spectrum of variational ground state is real in the absence of EP, and does not become complex. The superradiant state is unstable due to the non-Hermitian interaction induced photon-number loss. Thus only the NP exists in the non-Hermitian Dicke Model Hamiltonian.

Abstract: The evolution of a quantum system under time-dependent driving exhibits phenomena that are absent in its stationary counterpart. However, the high dimensionality and non-commutative nature of quantum dynamics make this a challenging problem. The Magnus expansion provides an analytic framework to approximate the effective dynamics on short time-scales, but computing high-order terms with existing methods is computationally expensive. We introduce a scalable approach that reduces the computational effort to depend only on the degrees of freedom defining the time-dependent control function. We focus specifically on Hamiltonians consisting of a constant drift term and a controllable term. Our method provides a polynomial expression for the Magnus expansion which can be evaluated several orders of magnitude faster than previous techniques, enabling broad applications in the realms of quantum simulation and quantum optimal control. We showcase an application of the method by designing control pulses for the 5-qubit phase gate on a neutral-atom platform utilizing Rydberg atoms.

Abstract: Quantum metrology aims to exploit many-body quantum states to achieve parameter-estimation precision beyond the standard quantum limit. For unitary parameter encoding generated by local Hamiltonians, such enhancement is characterized by superlinear scaling of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) with system size. Despite extensive progress, a systematic understanding of which many-body quantum states can exhibit this scaling has remained elusive. Here, we develop a general framework that connects metrological performance to long-range entanglement, state-preparation complexity, and quantum error-correction properties. We prove that super-linear QFI scaling necessarily requires long-range entanglement by deriving rigorous complexity-dependent upper bounds on the QFI. We further show that, for two broad classes of quantum error-correcting codes, nondegenerate codes and Calderbank--Shor--Steane quantum low-density parity-check codes, a nonconstant code distance precludes super-linear QFI scaling for a wide class of local Hamiltonians, revealing a fundamental incompatibility between metrological sensitivity and protection against local noise. Finally, we identify constructive routes that evade this obstruction by exploiting asymmetric code structures. In particular, we show that states associated with classical low-density parity-check codes, as well as asymmetric toric code states, both having asymmetric logical distances, can achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling. Together, our results establish long-range entanglement and asymmetric error correction as the essential resource underlying quantum metrology and clarify the interplay among state complexity, error correction, and metrological power.

Abstract: We present a footprint study for the scaling of modular quantum error correction (QEC) protocols designed for triangular color codes, including a lattice-surgery-based logical teleportation gadget, and compare the performance of various possible architectures based on trapped ions. The differences in these architectures arise from the technology that enables the connectivity between physical qubits and the modularity required for the QEC gadgets, which is either based on laser-beam deflectors focused to independent modules hosting mid-size ion crystals, or integrated photonics guided to segmented modules of the trap and allowing for the manipulation of smaller ion crystals. Our approach integrates the transpilation of the QEC gadgets into native trapped-ion primitives and a detailed account of the specific laser addressing and ion transport leading to different amounts of crosstalk errors, motional excitation and idle qubit errors. Combining a microscopically-informed noise model with an efficient Pauli-frame simulator and different scalable decoders, we assess the near-term performance of the color-code memory and teleportation protocols on these architectures. Our analysis demonstrates that modular color-code teleportation is achievable in these near-term trapped-ion architectures, and identifies the integrated-photonics connectivity as the most promising route for longer-term scaling.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-inspired heuristic for automatically tuning the Lorenz-96 model -- a simple proxy to describe atmospheric dynamics, yet exhibiting chaotic behavior. Building on the history matching framework by Lguensat et al. (2023), we fully automate the tuning process with a new convergence criterion and propose replacing classical Gaussian process emulators with quantum counterparts. We benchmark three quantum kernel architectures, distinguished by their quantum feature map circuits. A dimensionality argument implies, in principle, an increased expressivity of the quantum kernels over their classical competitors. For each kernel type, we perform an extensive hyperparameter optimization of our tuning algorithm. We confirm the validity of a quantum-inspired approach based on statevector simulation by numerically demonstrating the superiority of two studied quantum kernels over the canonical classical RBF kernel. Finally, we discuss the pathway towards real quantum hardware, mainly driven by a transition to shot-based simulations and evaluating quantum kernels via randomized measurements, which can mitigate the effect of gate errors. The very low qubit requirements and moderate circuit depths, together with a minimal number of trainable circuit parameters, make our method particularly NISQ-friendly.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical diffusion model called QCU-Net for generating synthetic labeled Earth Observation imagery, achieving superior results compared to classical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth Observation (EO) relies on labeled data, which is often costly and scarce, making generative models like diffusion models particularly valuable for tasks like data augmentation and image reconstruction. The limitation of classical diffusion models, such as requiring many inference steps and struggles with capturing EO data's complex spatial and spectral correlations, motivated the development of quantum-enhanced approaches.

Method: The QCU-Net is a hybrid architecture that integrates quantum operations into a conditioned diffusion framework using a novel mechanism called quanvolutional feature extraction. It applies quantum operations conditionally, enhancing the model's ability to capture EO data's intricacies.

Result: QCU-Net demonstrates significant improvements over classical methods, as evidenced by a 64% reduction in Fréchet Inception Distance, a 76% decrease in Kernel Inception Distance, and higher semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: This study pioneers the application of class-conditioned quantum diffusion models in Earth Observation, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced remote sensing imagery synthesis.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of diffusion models (DMs) in the Earth Observation (EO) domain has unlocked new generative capabilities aimed at producing new samples, whose statistical properties closely match real imagery, for tasks such as synthesizing missing data, augmenting scarce labeled datasets, and improving image reconstruction. This is particularly relevant in EO, where labeled data are often costly to obtain and limited in availability. However, classical DMs still face significant computational limitations, requiring hundreds to thousands of inference steps, as well as difficulties in capturing the intricate spatial and spectral correlations characteristic of EO data. Recent research in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), including initial attempts of Quantum Generative Models, offers a fundamentally different approach to overcome these challenges. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce the Quanvolutional Conditioned U-Net (QCU-Net), a hybrid quantum--classical architecture that applies quantum operations within a conditioned diffusion framework using a novel quanvolutional feature-extraction approach, for generating synthetic labeled EO imagery. Extensive experiments on the EuroSAT RGB dataset demonstrate that our QCU-Net achieves superior results. Notably, it reduces the Fréchet Inception Distance by 64%, lowers the Kernel Inception Distance by 76%, and yields higher semantic accuracy. Ablation studies further reveal that strategically positioning quantum layers and employing entangling variational circuits enhance model performance and convergence. This work represents the first successful adaptation of class-conditioned quantum diffusion modeling in the EO domain, paving the way for quantum-enhanced remote sensing imagery synthesis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rapid advancements in quantum computing and machine learning threaten the long-term security of classical blockchain systems, whose protection mechanisms largely rely on computational difficulties. In this study, we propose a quantum blockchain protocol whose protection mechanism is directly derived from quantum mechanical principles. The protocol combines high-dimensional Bell states, time-entanglement, entanglement switching, and high-dimensional superdense coding. Encoding classical block information into time-delimited qudit states allows block identity and data verification to be implemented through the causal sequencing of quantum measurements instead of cryptographic hash functions. High-dimensional coding increases the information capacity per quantum carrier and improves noise resistance. Time-entanglement provides distributed authentication, non-repudiation, and tamper detection across the blockchain. Each block derives its own public-private key pair directly from the observed quantum correlations by performing high-dimensional Bell state measurements in successive time steps. Because these keys are dependent on the time ordering of measurements, attempts to alter block data or disrupt the protocol's timing structure inevitably affect the reconstructed correlations and are revealed during validation. Recent advances in the creation and detection of high-dimensional time-slice entanglement demonstrate that the necessary quantum resources are compatible with emerging quantum communication platforms. Taken together, these considerations suggest that the proposed framework can be evaluated as a viable and scalable candidate for quantum-secure blockchain architectures in future quantum network environments.

Abstract: We introduce an end-to-end optimization strategy for quantum machine learning that directly targets performance under finite measurement resources, where learning objectives are defined directly at the level of task performance. The method is applied on a Bayesian quantum metrology task since it provides a natural testbed with known fundamental limits and scaling with system size. The sampling-aware hybrid algorithm achieves a single-shot risk within 1 dB of the -20 dB Bayesian limit using 32 qubits. We extend the Bayesian framework from parameter estimation to global function inference, where the task is to infer a target function of the sensor input drawn from an arbitrary prior, and we demonstrate a clear computational-sensing advantage for direct functional inference over indirect reconstruction. We relate the corresponding Bayesian risk to the Capacity metric and argue that the Resolvable Expressive Capacity provides a natural measure of the space of functions accessible in a single shot. The resulting eigentask analysis identifies noise-robust feature combinations that yield compact estimators with improved accuracy and reduced optimization cost in resource-limited or real-time on-device settings.

Abstract: We investigate the concept of macroscopically distinguishable superpositions within an infinite array of boson sites. Our approach is rigorous within the frame of Hilbert space theory. In this context, it is natural to differentiate between states -- and corresponding dynamics -- that involve only finitely many degrees of freedom, referred to as local, and those that are inherently nonlocal. Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons. Finally, we propose that if the generalized boson framework can be physically realized in engineered quantum systems, the phenomena described here may hold significant relevance for both physics and materials science.

Abstract: Famously, the quantum Fisher information -- the maximum Fisher information over all physical measurements -- is additive for independent copies of a system and the optimal measurement acts locally. We are left to wonder: does the same hold when the set of accessible measurements is constrained? Such constraints are necessary to account for realistic experimental restrictions. Here, we consider a fully Gaussian scenario focusing on only Gaussian measurements. We prove that the optimal Gaussian measurement protocol remains local, if the information is encoded in either the displacement or the covariance matrix. However, when the information is imprinted on both, this no longer holds true: we construct a simple global Gaussian measurement where the Fisher information becomes super additive. These results can improve parameter estimation tasks via feasible tools. Namely, in quantum optical platforms our proposed global operation requires only passive global operations and single mode Gaussian measurements. We demonstrate this in two examples where we estimate squeezing and losses. While in the former case there is a significant gap between the Fisher information of the optimal Gaussian measurement and the quantum Fisher information for a single copy, this gap can be reduced with joint Gaussian measurements and closed in the asymptotic limit of many copies.

Abstract: We introduce an efficient algorithm for the systematic design of shallow-depth quantum circuits capable of preparing many-body quantum states represented as Matrix Product States (MPS). The proposed method leverages Schmidt spectrum optimization (SSO) to minimize circuit depth while preserving the entanglement structure inherent to MPS representations, thereby enabling scalable state preparation on near-term quantum hardware. The core idea is to \textit{disentangle} the target MPS using a sequence of optimised local unitaries, and then reverse this process to obtain a state preparation circuit. Specifically, we define a loss function directly on the Schmidt spectra of intermediate states and use automatic differentiation to optimise each circuit layer so as to systematically reduce entanglement entropy. Once a disentangling sequence has been learned, we take the adjoints of the optimised unitaries to obtain a shallow-depth circuit that approximately reconstructs the target MPS from the computational all-zero state. We benchmark SSO across a range of MPS approximations to the ground states of local Hamiltonians and demonstrate state-of-the-art shallow-depth performance, improving accuracy by up to an order of magnitude over existing methods. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that SSO mitigates the adverse time-complexity scaling observed in previous disentangling-based approaches.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of reconstructing noisy eigenvalues using Channel Spectrum Benchmarking (CSB) and introduces an Extended CSB model and Fidelity Estimate Interval (FEI) to address these issues. FEI provides narrow and unbiased estimates, validated through numerical simulation and trapped-ion experiments, showing that qutrit-based implementations of the Toffoli gate are superior to qubit-based ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the reliability of quantum computing through advanced gate characterization methods like CSB is crucial for reducing errors and advancing quantum technologies.

Method: The authors propose an extended CSB model and introduce the Fidelity Estimate Interval (FEI), a set of interval-based fidelity estimates. They validate their method through numerical simulations of a trapped-ion quantum processor benchmarking a three-qubit Toffoli gate implementation, comparing qubit and qutrit-based approaches.

Result: The study finds that qutrit-based Toffoli gate implementations outperform qubit-based ones, and the FEI method substantially enhances the accuracy of fidelity estimation compared to traditional point estimates. Numerical simulations and experiments confirm the effectiveness of these improvements, particularly in the presence of noise and spectral degeneracies.

Conclusion: By addressing noise-induced challenges and providing more precise and reliable fidelity estimation, the proposed FEI method and extended CSB model establish robust frameworks for evaluating and improving quantum gate operations. The success of FEI in trapped-ion experiments supports its potential in other quantum systems, offering a practical solution for mitigating measurement and state preparation errors in quantum computing applications. The clear advantage of qutrit-based implementations highlights the benefits of using higher-dimensional systems for quantum computing, paving the way for future advancements in fault-tolerant quantum systems.

Abstract: Channel spectrum benchmarking (CSB) provides a robust framework for characterizing quantum gate fidelities while remaining insensitive to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Yet, current CSB implementations encounter fundamental challenges when reconstructing noisy eigenvalues, particularly in the presence of spectral degeneracies and off-diagonal noise components in the target gate's eigenbasis. These issues become especially pronounced in the strong noise regime for gates with fidelities around $90\%$. To address these limitations, we introduce an extended CSB model together with a fidelity estimate interval (FEI) -- an interval-valued estimate of the target gate fidelity. Numerical simulation demonstrates that FEI remains sufficiently narrow, with its midpoint reliably approximating the true fidelity. We further validate the protocol on a trapped-ion quantum processor by benchmarking two implementations of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. The results reveal a clear advantage of the qutrit-based implementation over its qubit-based counterpart.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of quantum cloud services has led to long job queues due to single-tenant execution models that underutilize hardware resources. Quantum multi-programming (QMP) mitigates this by executing multiple circuits in parallel on a single device, but existing methods target superconducting systems with limited connectivity, high crosstalk, and lower gate fidelity. Trapped-ion architectures, with all-to-all connectivity, long coherence times, and high-fidelity mid-circuit measurement properties, presents itself as a more suitable platform for scalable QMP. We present CircPack, a hardware-aware circuit packing framework designed for modular trapped-ion devices based on the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture. CircPack formulates static circuit scheduling as a two-dimensional packing problem with hardware-specific shuttling constraints. Compared to superconducting-based QMP approaches, CircPack achieves up to 70.72% better fidelity, 62.67% higher utilization, and 32.80% improved layer reduction. This framework is also capable of scalable, balanced scheduling across a cluster of independent QCCD modules, highlighting trapped-ion systems' potential in improving the throughput of quantum cloud computing in the near future.

Using this approach, synthetic examples are introduced which allow for proof of concept on interpolation and classification applications. Quantum kernels have primarily been applied to support vector machines (SVMs), however the quantum kernel RBF network offers potential benefit over quantum kernel based SVMs due to the RBF networks ability to perform multi-class classification natively compared to the standard implementation of the SVM.

Abstract: We show how representations of finite-dimensional quantum operators can be constructed using nondeterministic rewriting systems. In particular, we investigate Wolfram model multiway rewriting systems based on string substitutions. Multiway systems were proposed by S. Wolfram as generic model systems for multicomputational processes, emphasizing their significance as a foundation for modeling complexity, nondeterminism, and branching structures of measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $π/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits.

Abstract: The minimum accuracy heuristic evaluates quantum feature maps without requiring full quantum support vector machine (QSVM) training. However, the original formulation is computationally expensive, restricted to balanced datasets, and lacks theoretical backing. This work generalizes the metric to arbitrary binary datasets and formally proves it constitutes a certified lower bound on the optimal empirical accuracy of any linear classifier in the same feature space. Furthermore, we introduce Monte Carlo strategies to efficiently estimate this bound using a random subset of Pauli directions, accompanied by rigorous probabilistic guarantees. These contributions establish minimum accuracy as a scalable, theoretically sound tool for pre-screening feature maps on near-term quantum devices.

Conclusion: 综上所述，该论文通过引入随机斯 pins 假设通道，解决了量子通道学习的最优查询复杂度问题，该复杂度与输入维数 $d_A$、输出维数 $d_B$ 和 Choi秩 $r$ 成正比，具体为 $Θ(d_A d_B r)$。这表明随机斯 pins 假设通道是学习量子通道的最优方法。

Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ copies of an arbitrary mixed quantum state into $n$ copies of the same uniformly random purification, has emerged as a powerful tool in quantum information theory. Motivated by this development, we introduce a channel-level analogue, which we call the random Stinespring superchannel. This consists in a procedure to transform $n$ parallel queries of an arbitrary quantum channel into $n$ parallel queries of the same uniformly random Stinespring isometry, via universal encoding and decoding operations that are efficiently implementable. When the channel is promised to have Choi rank at most $r$, the procedure can be tailored to yield a Stinespring environment of dimension $r$. As a consequence, quantum channel learning reduces to isometry learning, yielding a simple channel learning algorithm, based on existing isometry learning protocols, that matches the performance of the two recently proposed channel tomography algorithms. Complementarily, whereas the optimality of these algorithms had previously been established only up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension, we close this gap by removing this logarithmic factor from the lower bound. Taken together, our results fully establish the optimality of these recently introduced channel learning algorithms, showing that the optimal query complexity of learning a quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ is $Θ(d_A d_B r)$.

Abstract: Through their ability to achieve `cryogenic' levels of noise performance while operating at room temperature, optically-pumped, solid-state (OPSS) masers show great promise as quantum sensors, oscillators, and amplifiers. We here demonstrate maser oscillation in a microwave cavity containing a crystal of pentacene-doped \textit{para}-terphenyl (ptc:ptp) pumped by a single, chip-scale LED. Here, unlike previous work, the size of the pump source no longer dominates the size of the maser system as a whole. This miniaturization is achieved through invasive optical pumping in the form of a waveguide, the tip of which is embedded into the maser crystal. Combining experimental measurements with ray-tracing analysis, we find that our approach offers at least a factor of 2 enhancement in the cooperativity over end-on optical excitation.

### [72] [Microstructured Electrode-Piezopolymer Interface for Ultrasound Transducers with Enhanced Flexibility and Acoustic Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20400)
*Spencer Hagen§,Dulcce A Valenzuela§,Parag V Chitnis,Shirin Movaghgharnezhad*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the influence of electrode-polymer interface on piezoelectric, dielectric, and acoustic behavior in piezopolymer-based ultrasound transducers. Different electrode materials such as Ag, Au, graphene flakes (GF), laser-induced graphene (LIG), and Au-decorated LIG were compared. LIG-based transducers showed the best performance due to partial infiltration of piezopolymer into the porous structure. Au-based transducers performed adequately. Ag and GF layers showed limited coupling. LIG-based devices demonstrated the highest flexibility and durability. This highlights the importance of interface engineering for wearable ultrasound applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for flexible and conformal ultrasound transducers suitable for wearable devices. Piezopolymer-based transducers offer practical advantages but have not been extensively studied due to challenges in their fabrication and performance analysis. This paper addresses these gaps by investigating the impact of electrode interface quality on overall device performance.

Method: The study involved fabricated and tested flexible ultrasound transducers using various electrode materials. The devices were characterized in terms of piezoelectric, dielectric, and acoustic properties. The measurements were taken after performing bending and aging tests to assess long-term durability.

Result: LIG-based transducers exhibited the best performance, with higher acoustic and piezoelectric outputs. Au-based devices performed similarly to LIG, while Ag and GF-based ones showed less efficient coupling. LIG-based devices demonstrated exceptional durability, with stable performance after extensive bending and aging.

Conclusion: This research underscores the critical role of electrode-polymer interface quality in achieving high-performance piezopolymer-based ultrasound transducers. The findings suggest that LIG-based transducers are particularly promising for wearable applications due to their superior flexibility, durability, and consistent performance under various stresses.

Abstract: Ultrasound transducers made from rigid piezoceramics are difficult to adapt for wearable or conformal applications. Piezopolymer-based transducers offer a practical alternative; however, most existing studies focus on piezoelectric materials, while the influence of electrode material and electrode-polymer interface remains underexplored. This study leverages different interface-engineering strategies to examine the influence of electrode-piezopolymer interface morphology on piezoelectric, dielectric, and acoustic behavior in flexible transducers. Devices were fabricated using silver (Ag), gold (Au), graphene flakes (GF), laser-induced graphene (LIG), and Au-decorated LIG electrodes, enabling comparison across interfacial architectures. LIG-based transducers showed strong acoustic and piezoelectric output due to partial infiltration of the piezopolymer into the porous LIG network, which enhances interfacial contact and stress transfer. Au-based transducers achieved comparable acoustic output. In contrast, dense Ag electrodes and layered GF films provided limited coupling, resulting in reduced electromechanical response. LIG-based transducers exhibited the highest flexibility and durability, retaining stable performance after 10,000 bending cycles and an eight-week aging study, whereas GF, Ag, and Au devices degraded under bending, and Ag electrodes declined over time. These findings demonstrate that engineering the electrode-polymer interface is critical for high-performance flexible ultrasound transducers and identify LIG as a strong candidate for wearable imaging applications.

Abstract: Surfaces and structures capable of multiple stable configurations have attracted growing interest for on-demand shape morphing. In this work, we consider an elastic compliant plate coupled to a two-dimensional foundation comprising an array of bistable elements, a system that can form and retain complex continuous morphologies without sustained actuation via creation of stable domain walls separating regions in different stable states. These domain walls exhibit three distinct behaviors: expansion, shrinking, and metastable pinning. These arise from two limits of foundation discreteness. In the continuum limit, where bistable units are strongly coupled, domain walls undergo global phase transitions analogous to first-order phase transitions. In the anti-continuum limit, discreteness introduces Peierls-Nabarro-type energy modulations that lead to metastable pinning. To quantify these behaviors and the transition between the two limits, we develop a reduced-order model that captures the total potential energy of configurations with domain walls and validate it using finite element analysis (FEA). For axisymmetric domain walls, the model yields phase diagrams identifying the regimes of expansion, shrinking, and pinning as functions of bistable-potential asymmetry, relative foundation discreteness, and domain-wall size. We then extend the analysis to non-axisymmetric geometries and establish local geometric criteria that predict the stability of convex and concave polygonal domain walls, confirmed by simulations. Together, these results clarify how discreteness enables stability through energy-landscape modulation, provide predictive design rules for multistable reconfigurable surfaces, and offer insights into domain-wall stability more generally in elastically coupled multistable metamaterials.

Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials enhance traditional material properties through microstructure engineering, providing new opportunities to shape sound fields in applications ranging from biomedical imaging, clinical therapy to non-destructive testing. However, at the MHz frequency ranges, only a few metamaterial architectures exist. They are often highly attenuating or difficult to manufacture, and generally provide limited 3D control over sound propagation. Here, we introduce a MHz-frequency ultrasonic metamaterial based on laser-engraved glass. By structuring meta-voxels with different engraving patterns, we define a fully-3D, anisotropic metamaterial exhibiting local variations in the sound speed of up to 20% compared to unstructured glass, and losses 100x lower than in comparable 3D printed metamaterials. We use this metamaterial to define a library of standard elements that can be modularly combined to create and shape complex-patterned ultrasonic fields. Our experiments are supported by a theoretical model, which provides additional insights into the microstructural origin of the metamaterial behavior and opens the door to designing tailored ultrasound fields and responses.

Motivation: Spin-qubit control in semiconductors offers a promising route for post-quantum computing.

Result: Electric and magnetic fields, along with electric field or gate modulation, enable single-qubit rotations within 1 ns.

Conclusion: The proposed DQD qubit control doesn't need micromagnets, making it scalable for semiconductor制造.

Abstract: We study a vertical double quantum dot (DQD) in a Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double-well heterostructure for full electrical control of electron Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, using realistic device modeling and numerical simulations. Due to the emerging spin-orbit interaction in the DQD, as well as strain from the gate electrodes, small (percentage range) but finite $g$ tensor variations emerge. In addition, we find a large valley splitting, on the order of $E_v{\sim}250\,μ$eV. As a result, multiple avenues for fast electrical single qubit rotations emerge. An ac electric field gives rise to electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), while electron spin resonance (ESR) in the presence of an ac magnetic field can be electrically controlled by local gates due to varying $g$ factors in DQDs. We also show that shuttling between neighboring dots, in vertical and horizontal direction, results in ultrafast single qubit gates of less than a nanosecond. Remarkably, this DQD architecture completely eliminates the need for micromagnets, significantly facilitating the scalability of LD spin qubits in semiconductor foundries.

Abstract: Since the prediction and observation of topological Weyl semimetals (chiral TSMs), there have been enormous efforts to characterize further condensed matter realizations of chiral fermions. These efforts were dramatically accelerated by the subsequent discovery of a profound link between low-energy topological and lattice chirality in structurally chiral crystals. Though TSMs are well understood in the limit of perfect translation symmetry, real solid-state materials host defects and disorder, and may even be rendered amorphous down to all but the smallest system length scales. Previous theoretical studies have concluded that chiral TSMs transition into trivial diffusive metals at moderate disorder scales, raising concerns that chiral TSM states may only be accessible in highly crystalline samples. In this work, we in contrast identify large families of chiral TSMs that persist under strong structural disorder - even into the amorphous regime. We show that amorphous chiral TSM phases can in particular be stabilized by the presence of long-range order in the local structural chirality. We present extensive analytic and numerical calculations demonstrating the existence of both Weyl and higher-charge chiral fermions in amorphous metals whose topology and spin and orbital angular momentum textures are tunable via the interplay of average symmetry and geometry. To distinguish and generate new realizations of strongly disordered chiral fermions, we introduce an analytic approach grounded in symmetry group theory. We then introduce an amorphous Wilson loop numerical method to characterize chiral fermions with quantized Berry curvature fluxes in metals with 3D structural disorder. Our findings bridge the crystalline and strongly disordered regimes of chiral TSMs, and indicate a clear route towards engineering geometry-enforced topology in non-crystalline materials and metamaterials.

Abstract: Superconducting resonators integrated with Ge quantum wells (QWs) offer a promising platform for hybrid quantum devices. Yet, in the most common heterostructure architectures, they have so far been limited by sizable photon losses. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of microwave resonators patterned in the Al thin film of an in-situ grown superconductor/semiconductor hybrid heterostructure (HS). The semiconductor part of this hybrid HS is grown on a commercial Ge substrate. We consistently achieve internal quality factors $Q_i>1000$, surpassing previous results on Ge QW heterostructures grown using the concept of a virtual Ge substrate on Si substrates. We reach $Q_i \approx 49000$ at single-photon occupation and a plateau of $Q_i \approx 20000$ at sub-one photon, an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported value of resonators on Ge QW structures at low power. We further characterize the thin Al film forming the resonator, extracting its kinetic inductance and superconducting gap, and studying its magnetic field dependence. Notably, the resonance remains well-defined up to in-plane magnetic fields of 850 mT. A hysteresis emerges in the out-of-plane magnetic field dependence, for both the resonance frequency and the quality factor, indicating an interesting interplay between vortex- and quasiparticle loss mechanisms.

Using the first technique, we measure a remarkably large Overhauser field of 3.1 T in a geometry close to the Faraday configuration for a 19.7 nm wide quantum well at a temperature of 1.6 K. A nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 $μ$K is measured at an external magnetic field of 0.006 T following an adiabatic sweep from 0.6 T. Despite the quadrupole-induced nuclear spin splitting inherent to nanostructures, the nuclear spin system is found to follow the predictions of spin temperature theory. Using the optical orientation of the photoluminescence, we investigated nuclear spin dynamics at millikelvin temperatures down to 300 mK. At a temperature of 500 mK, an Overhauser field of 160 mT is generated in an oblique but nearly Voigt magnetic field using low optical power to avoid heating. The nuclear polarization build-up time is of 150 s, consistent with earlier reports at higher temperatures, where hyperfine scattering on free photoexcited electrons governs relaxation. At 500 mK, the onset of dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, which becomes more pronounced as the lattice temperature is further reduced to 300 mK. The estimated nuclear spin temperature in the dynamic self-polarization regime can be as low as 200 nK.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the structural and electronic properties of Sn intercalated buffer layers on SiC using LT-STM/STS, SPA-LEED, and DFT. Sn intercalation decouples the buffer, supports QFMLG, but introduces lattice distortions. STM and STS imaging show coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains, influenced by Sn(1x1) reconstruction. DFT results align with measurements, but achieving homogeneous Sn(1x1) domains is challenging due to Sn strain and Kekule distortions in graphene. The research emphasizes the importance of intercalant homogeneity and strain in controlling graphene's properties.

Method: The methods used include LT-STM/STS, SPA-LEED, and DFT calculations to study the structural and electronic properties of Sn intercalated SiC buffer layers.

Result: The study reveals that Sn intercalation can yield QFMLG but also introduces lattice distortions. STM and STS imaging showed coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains, which are influenced by the underlying Sn(1x1) reconstruction. DFT results agreed with the experimental findings, highlighting the challenges in achieving homogeneous Sn(1x1) domains due to strain and Kekule distortions in graphene.

Conclusion: The research underscores the significant role of intercalant homogeneity and strain in tuning the structural and electronic properties of graphene.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural and electronic properties of Sn intercalated buffer layers on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS), spot-profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Sn intercalation effectively decouples the buffer layer, yielding quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) while introducing local lattice distortions. Bias-dependent STM imaging revealed the coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains, governed by the underlying Sn(1x1) reconstruction at the SiC interface. The measured STS spectra exhibit good agreement with DFT results. However, achieving homogeneous Sn(1x1) domains remains challenging, apparently, due to strain within the Sn monolayer, which drives the emergence of Kekule distortions and the associated electronic band-gap opening omogeneously in graphene. These findings highlight the crucial role of intercalant homogeneity and strain in tuning graphene`s structural and electronic properties.

Abstract: Flat bands in graphitic materials emerged as a platform for realizing tunable correlated physics. As a nodal-line semimetal, rhombohedral graphite features flat drumhead surface states in the vicinity of the Dirac points, which carry a nontrivial topological charge. We present a comprehensive study on rhombohedral graphite with twist stacking faults. Using both the continuum models and the realistic tight-binding models, we show that the twist angle between the graphene layers can tune the interface states at such stacking faults. The evolution of interface states originates from the interplay between the moiré periodicity and Zak phase topology, predicting the occurrence of nearly flat bands throughout the moiré Brillouin zone. We further investigate the disorder-induced layer polarization and tunable Chern number for flat band, and characterize the relationship between the disorder strength and Chern number in twisted rhombohedral graphite.

Abstract: Moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials have revolutionized the study of electronic and excitonic systems by creating periodic electrostatic potentials. Extending this concept to magnetic materials promises new pathways in merging spintronics with photonics. While moiré magnetism has been revealed with near-field probes and nonlinear optical techniques, the coupling of these magnetic textures to optical excitations - magneto-moiré excitons - remains unexplored. Here, we report the observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moiré spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2°. The nanoscale moiré spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field. First-principles calculations corroborate that these signatures arise from one-dimensional spin textures governed by the balance of exchange interactions and domain wall energy. Our results demonstrate that moiré magnetism can be used to engineer nanoscale excitonic energy landscapes, providing a new platform for magneto-optical sensing, quantum transduction, and control of non-collinear magnetism and topology through light.

Abstract: The spin dynamics of localized electrons in bulk semiconductors is governed by the interplay of effective nuclear field fluctuations, spin exchange between electrons, and spin transitions into the conduction band. Using spin noise spectroscopy, we reveal this interplay for donor-bound electrons in a CdTe/CdMgTe quantum well and spectrally separate electron spin relaxation and dephasing in zero magnetic field. We identify a specific regime of the electron spin dynamics, where temperature-induced activation of spin-independent hopping leads to a monotonic acceleration of electron spin relaxation. This behavior contrasts with bulk CdTe crystals, where the motional narrowing effect is observed. We attribute this difference to the significantly larger inhomogeneous broadening of the donor-related trion resonance in our quantum well compared to bulk samples. The theoretical analysis of the spin noise power and the strength of the spin exchange interaction provides the estimation of the donor concentration in our unintentionally doped structure.

Abstract: Layered magnetic and strongly correlated materials present a rich platform for condensed matter physics with intrinsic properties intertwined by magnetism and low-dimensionality. A suspended light-emitting 2D antiferromagnetic membrane forms a highly controllable hybrid system in which the interplay between spin ordering, optical and mechanical degrees of freedom can be uniquely explored. NiPS$_3$ hosts excitons responsible for a puzzling luminescence down to a few atomic layers, linked to its zigzag antiferromagnetic order. The nature of these excitons remains unclear. Here we report on the magnetic excitons of a suspended few-layer NiPS$_3$ membrane. We reveal nematic zigzag states and study the optical transitions induced by the magnon-mediated motion of the excitation in the magnetic lattice, resulting in magnon-dressed excitons. We observe a strain tuning of these emission lines, dependent on their microscopic origin, with rates that sign a strong localization of the magnetic excitons, fading with the number of magnon-mediated hops.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We demonstrate that the charge value of transport mechanisms heavily impacts the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism.

Abstract: Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: The paper extends the squared-eigenfunctions-based perturbation theory for the scalar defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation on a nonzero background to accurately predict the slow-time evolution of dark soliton parameters and the radiation shelf.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perturbation theories are widely used to analyze the behavior of nonlinear systems under small disturbances. This paper aims to improve the understanding of soliton dynamics in the context of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which is fundamental in various physical systems such as optics and fluid dynamics.

Method: The authors revisit the squared-eigenfunctions-based perturbation theory and develop it to account for the slow-time evolution of dark soliton parameters. They provide a proof of the completeness of the squared eigenfunctions and address singularities in the scattering data at the branch points of the continuous spectrum. By employing the one-soliton closure relation and its discrete eigenmodes, they derive the slow-time evolution equations for the soliton parameters. They also analyze the first-order correction integral for singularities.

Result: The paper successfully predicts the height, velocity, and phase gradient of the radiation shelf and determines the slow-time dependence of the soliton's phase and center. These predictions are corroborated by direct numerical simulations and compared with earlier results.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive and accurate framework for analyzing the slow-time evolution of dark solitons and their associated radiation shelves, enhancing our understanding of soliton dynamics in nonlinear systems.

Abstract: The goal of this work is to revisit the squared-eigenfunctions-based perturbation theory of the scalar defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation on a nonzero background, and develop it so that it can correctly predict the slow-time evolution of the dark soliton parameters, as well as the radiation shelf emerging on the sides of the soliton. Proof of the completeness of the squared eigenfunctions is provided. Our closure relation accounts for the singularities of the scattering data at the branch points of the continuous spectrum, which leads to the correct discrete eigenfunctions of the closure relation. Using the one-soliton closure relation and its discrete eigenmodes, the slow-time evolution equations of the soliton parameters are determined. Moreover, the first-order correction integral to the dark soliton is shown to contain a pole due to singularities of the scattering data at the branch points. Analysis of this first-order correction integral leads to predictions for the height, velocity and phase gradient of the shelves, as well as a formula for the slow time evolution of the soliton's phase, which in turn allows one to determine the slow-time dependence of the soliton center. All the results are corroborated by direct numerical simulations, and compared with earlier results.

Abstract: We present a dynamical framework for modeling the motion of point-like charged particles, with or without mass, in general external electromagnetic fields. A key feature of this formulation is the treatment of the time coordinate as a dynamical variable. The framework applies to the relativistic regime while consistently admitting a nonrelativistic limit. We also present a representation of particle trajectories in velocity space, which provides a clear insight into the nature and asymptotic behavior of the dynamics. As an application, we compare the motion of massive and massless particles in a constant electromagnetic field and find that, for identical field configurations, their asymptotic behavior is independent of both mass and initial conditions. Finally, we explore the computational advantages of the dynamical-time formulation over the conventional uniform-time approach in two study cases: an uniform electromagnetic field and an elliptically polarized wave propagating along a uniform magnetic field. In both scenarios, the proposed scheme exhibits improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We build a minimal theoretical model to describe the opening of a gap in the dispersion of the collective excitations of a driven-dissipative condensate when the condensate phase is fixed by an additional coherent phase-locking drive. We map out the phase diagram as a function of the frequency and the strength of the coherent drive. We identify regions where the gap is purely imaginary or has a finite real part. When the coherent drive is unable to lock the condensate phase, a gapless Goldstone mode is recovered in the Floquet-Bogoliubov dispersion of collective modes. We finally characterize regions of finite-wavevector dynamical instability, where the condensate tends to develop a supersolid-like spatial modulation. While our theoretical framework is directly related to recent experiments with exciton-polariton condensates, it can be applied to describe the effect of external injection also in a variety of spatially extended optical parametric oscillators or laser devices.

Abstract: The study of cosmological correlators, and more generally Feynman integrals, is greatly aided by considering them as solutions to differential equations. Often, such systems of differential equations are reducible, which, broadly speaking, implies that the differential system is composed of various subsystems. Studying such decompositions and subsystems can greatly aid in solving the full differential system, as well as bring to light a substantial amount of structure. In this PhD thesis, we study reducibility for a particular system of differential equations known as GKZ (Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky) systems. We show how reducibility manifests itself in the differential equations through the existence of certain special operators, reduction operators, and explain their properties. Furthermore, we apply this framework to cosmological correlators, exemplifying how these reduction operators can be used to obtain and understand the structure within the system. Here the amount of structure seems remarkably large, and we leverage this structure to obtain many algebraic and permutative identities within the space of solutions to the differential equations. Interestingly, these include various cut and contraction relations between diagrams. We show how to obtain all such relations and how they reduce the full solution set to a certain, remarkably small, subset. Finally, we explain how such simplifications can be understood through the lens of o-minimality and Pfaffian complexity, as well as some of the limitations of this perspective.

Abstract: We consider higher-point generalizations of the "octagon" large-charge four-point function in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. These n-point polygon correlators are defined as ten-dimensional null limits of generating functions of n-point correlators of protected scalar operators with arbitrary R-charge, and are conjecturally dual to massive scattering amplitudes of W-bosons on the Coulomb branch of the theory. We present a twistor-based direct computation of the polygon loop integrands, and determine the two-loop integrands for any number of external operators. The result is expressed as a linear combination of conformal integrals, with coefficients that are rational functions of the spacetime distances and operator polarizations. We obtain an exact match with a one-loop integrability computation, and study the near-massless limit of the pentagon function.

Abstract: We analytically construct families of type IIB supergravity backgrounds in ten dimensions in which the four-dimensional metric is time dependent, while the six-dimensional internal space is an arbitrary compact Calabi-Yau manifold (with no restriction on holonomy) up to an overall time-dependent scale factor. Our solutions include cases with all fluxes (three-form and self-dual five-form) switched on, as well as cases with subsets of these fluxes, together with a time-dependent axiodilaton in most cases. These constructions require no local sources. We show that the associated energy-momentum tensors (both 10D and the resulting 4D effective) satisfy the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. In our explicit constructions, the Ricci scalar of the four-dimensional Einstein frame metric is negative; such backgrounds may find applications to anisotropic or FLRW cosmologies in the early universe. We also revisit the Maldacena--Nuñez no-go analysis, incorporating new elements that appear in our constructions, namely an overall noncompact spacetime-dependent scale factor multiplying the internal metric, and field strengths with components partially covering the noncompact directions. We argue that, with these generalizations, a four-dimensional Einstein-frame metric with positive Ricci scalar cannot be ruled out by such an analysis.

Abstract: In this work we explore the relation between orbifold singularities and higher form symmetries. Using the geometric engineering dictionary, we argue that the discrete higher symmetries of 5d SCFTs constructed from M-theory on a non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold can be related to a quantum symmetry of the associated BPS quiver. Through un-orbifolding the quantum symmetry we obtain a new theory without higher form symmetry, providing a notion of ''minimality'' for a theory. This procedure is carried out via algebraic manipulations of the BPS/McKay quiver describing the crepant resolution of the singular geometry. This technique can also be reverted and thus, starting from any ''minimal'' theory, one can orbifold it and generate new theories with the desired higher form symmetries. We test our technology on classes of 5d SCFTs that arise from M-theory geometric engineering on Calabi-Yau threefolds that are non-toric non-complete intersections, which have historically been challenging to tackle.

Abstract: We construct new half-BPS line defects in 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories whose Higgs branches are complete flag manifolds $X = {\rm Fl}(n)$. Upon circle compactification, the bulk theory flows to a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with target space $X$ and the line defects flow to objects supported on Schubert varieties $X_w \subseteq X$. These Schubert line defects form an important basis of the quantum K-theory of $X$. They are realized as $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SQM) quivers coupled to the 3d gauge theory. We show that the insertion of the Schubert line defect restricts the target space of the 3d gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) to the Schubert variety $X_w$, with the 1d degrees of freedom physically realizing a Bott--Samelson resolution of $X_w$. Moreover, we verify in examples that the 1d flavored Witten index of the quiver SQM reproduces the (equivariant) Chern character of the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{X_w}$ as a (double) quantum Grothendieck polynomial, generalizing previous results for $X$ a Grassmannian manifold. Our construction thus provides a more direct realization of the 3d GLSM/quantum K-theory correspondence for complete flag manifolds. Finally, in the small-circle limit, we obtain a 0d-2d coupled system that realizes the Schubert classes $[X_w]$ in the quantum cohomology ring of $X$.

Abstract: We compute the running of the mass of a neutral boson and of its self-coupling in a simple model describing the self-interaction of three scalars, one of them neutral and the other two electrically charged, subject to the effects of a magnetic field, as functions of the field strength, at one-loop order. We resort to the Environmentally Friendly Renormalization Group approach, where the flow variable is taken as that describing the environmental conditions, in this case the strength of the magnetic field. We find the magnetic field dependent mass and coupling beta functions and use them to set up the differential equations satisfied by the neutral scalar mass and coupling. We solve the resulting system of coupled equations both numerically, and also analytically in the small-mass approximation. We find that the neutral scalar mass increases, while the coupling decreases with increasing field strength. The study is intended to set up the ideas to later use them in more sophisticated theories such as QED and QCD.

Abstract: Entanglement cohomology assigns a graded cohomology ring to a multipartite pure state, providing homological invariants that are stable under local unitaries and characterize inequivalent patterns of entanglement. In this work we derive exact expressions for the dimensions of these cohomology groups in two canonical entanglement classes, generalized GHZ and W states on an arbitrary number of parties and local Hilbert space dimensions, thus proving conjectures of arXiv:1901.02011. Using the additional structure of the Hodge star and wedge product operations, we propose two new classes of local unitary invariants: the spectrum of the natural Laplacian acting on entanglement $k$-forms, and the intersection numbers obtained from wedge products of representatives for cohomology classes. We present numerical experiments which investigate these invariants in particular states, suggesting that they may provide useful quantities for describing multipartite entanglement.

Abstract: Using supersymmetric localization, we show that the partition function of four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories -- computed as a trace over BPS states without the insertion of $(-1)^F$ -- is protected and independent of the gauge coupling $g_{YM}$. We derive a matrix-integral representation of this observable for generic four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories. For $U(N)$ maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, we study such matrix integral and show that it localizes to ensembles of superconformal indices near its essential singularities. The latter asymptotic localization explains why a single microcanonical index reproduces the growth of the total number of BPS states in a large-$N$ expansion at charges of order $N^2$, despite exhibiting large sign-oscillations due to the insertion of $(-1)^F$. To compute quantum corrections to entropy, at finite $N$, the correct observable is the protected partition function which by definition is a positive quantity.
  To study this protected observable, we propose and test an improvement of the Cardy-like method that allows us to identify and compute perturbatively exact expressions for the leading large-$N$ onshell action of eigenvalue-configurations that we call orbifold, dressed orbifold, and eigenvalue-instanton saddles.

Abstract: We develop a unified framework for computing Rényi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.

Abstract: We study aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence for $\mathcal{N}=4$ $U(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory on $S^3/Γ$, where $Γ\subset SU(2)$ is a finite subgroup, leading to an ADE singularity in the bulk AdS geometry. We show that a large vacuum degeneracy arises from the choice of gauge holonomy on $S^3/Γ$. On the gravity side, we argue that the bulk ADE singularity supports topological degrees of freedom responsible for this degeneracy. We then provide a holographic derivation of a corresponding large vacuum degeneracy for class S theories of type $U(N)$, showing that these topological degrees of freedom admit an effective description in terms of a three-dimensional level-$N$ Chern-Simons theory, whose gauge group $\mathsf{G}$ is determined by $Γ$. Finally, we discuss how the one-form symmetries of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory are realized on the Chern-Simons theory side.

Abstract: Supertranslations are usually defined as asymptotic symmetries associated with spacetime boundaries, such as null infinity and black hole horizons. In this Letter, we show that supertranslations admit a natural, coordinate-independent extension into the bulk of spacetime, realized as transitions between families of null hypersurfaces. This construction applies to generic spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions and unifies the realizations of supertranslations at null infinity and black hole horizons. The associated symmetry algebra can be realized by light-ray operators defined on the null hypersurface. Within this framework, the gravitational wave memory effect corresponds to a shift of null hypersurfaces in the bulk. As explicit examples, we compute bulk supertranslations in Minkowski spacetime in arbitrary dimensions and in four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, where we uncover a novel curvature-induced memory effect with observable consequences for light propagation.

Abstract: We explore the nature of higher dimensional operators generated by quantum gravity. Calculating the tree-level and one-loop effective operators generated by graviton exchange between fields of the standard model and those of a hidden sector, we show that the leading order operators generated by quantum gravity are non-local dimension 6 operators. Dimension 5 operators are not generated by perturbative (weak field) effects, although they might be generated by strong field effects such as Planck-scale fluctuations in spacetime. We investigate the consequences of our findings for models of ultralight scalar dark matter.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: IR geometry modifications in holography can significantly impact multipartite entanglement, with spherical modifications enhancing it and hyperbolic ones reducing it. This contrasts with measures like entanglement entropy and EWCS, which saturate their bounds in these limits. The findings offer a practical framework to explore extremal entanglement and quantum marginal problems, providing insights into the sensitivity of different entanglement measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between bulk geometry and boundary entanglement is a fundamental question in holography. IR modifications provide a controlled way to probe these effects, with applications ranging from quantum information physics to quantum gravity.

Method: We utilize various multipartite entanglement measures, including entanglement entropy, multi-entropy, entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS), and multi-EWCS, to analyze the effects of spherical and hyperbolic modifications on the bulk geometry and their corresponding boundary entanglement structures. By computing these measures in the extremal limits of the two geometric modifications, we can compare and contrast the resulting entanglement structures.

Result: In the extremal limits of the IR modifications, the multipartite entanglement measures saturate either their theoretical upper or lower bounds. This demonstrates that IR deformations provide a practical holographic framework for realizing extremal entanglement regimes. Furthermore, these results reveal that different measures are sensitive to distinct types of multipartite entanglement, offering a nuanced understanding of the relationship between bulk geometry and boundary entanglement.

Conclusion: Our findings provide new insights into the role of IR geometry modifications in shaping boundary entanglement and offer a systematic framework for studying the behavior of multipartite entanglement in holographic settings. This work strengthens the connection between entanglement measures and bulk geometry, highlighting the potential for future research in quantum information, quantum gravity, and related fields.

Abstract: We investigate how IR modifications of the bulk geometry reshape long-range multipartite entanglement on the boundary in holography. We modify the IR geometries in two opposite directions: spherical modifications that enhance long-range entanglement and hyperbolic modifications that suppress them. We utilize various multipartite entanglement measures/signals to analyze the multipartite entanglement structures. These measures/signals are combinations of entanglement entropy, multi-entropy, entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and multi-EWCS. Our results reveal that in the extremal limits of these two geometric modifications, the multipartite entanglement structures exhibit starkly contrasting behaviors: various measures saturate either their theoretical upper or lower bounds in the respective geometries. This demonstrates that IR deformations provide a practical holographic framework for realizing extremal entanglement regimes. Moreover, it serves as an effective tool for studying quantum marginal problems in holography. Finally, by observing how different measures respond to these engineered geometries, we gain clarifying insights into the specific types of multipartite entanglement that each measure/signal is particularly sensitive to.

Abstract: The strongly-coupled 3-dimensional theory, holographically dual to black branes at fixed chemical potential $\muext$ and temperature $T \ll μ$ is considered in AdS$_4$ Einstein-Maxwell theory. The retarded Green's functions at frequency $ω$ is calculated using holography in the regime $ω, T \ll \muext$ but otherwise arbitrary. When the transverse space has finite volume, there is a non-zero energy scale $E_\text{gap}$, scaling as $1/μ$ for large $μ$, below which quantum-gravitational corrections due to the fluctuations of the nearly-gapless Schwarzian modes become important. Such corrections to the retarded Green's function are calculated at different relative values of $ω$, $T$, and $E_\text{gap}$. The $ω\to 0$ limit is used to define the shear viscosity $η$. As the temperature is lowered below $μ$, quantum corrections are found to increase the value of $η$ with respect to its semiclassical value. The quantum-corrected result for $η$ diverges as $\sqrt{E_\text{gap}/T}$ at $T \ll E_\text{gap}$, in accord with corresponding results for the absorption cross section. The quantum result for the ratio $η/s$, where $s$ is the entropy density, dips below the semiclassical limit of $1/4π$ when $E_\text{gap} \ll T \ll μ$, then turns back to increase towards lower temperatures, and finally diverges at temperatures much below $E_\text{gap}$.

Abstract: We use Dwork's deformation method to calculate the Hasse-Weil Zeta function of multi-parameter families of Calabi-Yau three and fourfolds. This information is used to identify subslices of codimension one in the complex-structure moduli space, where the Hodge structure splits in particular ways and different type IIB flux vacua emerge. We calculate the corresponding background fluxes and their potential that drives the IIB string compactification to these subslices and analyse the properties of the corresponding physical vacua. We address the question whether the subslices correspond to fixed loci of symmetries acting on the original family and whether they can be identified with consistent complex-structure moduli spaces of Picard-Fuchs systems with standard integral monodromy bases for fewer complex deformation parameters. We distinguish between supersymmetric vacua and singular subslices. In the latter case a standard geometrical basis can be expected if a physical transition leads to a smooth type II vacuum. In many cases the differential equations on the subslice are fulfilled by the restricted periods after adding an inhomogeneous term. This suggests that the resolution of the singularity provides three-chains and we indeed find that the corresponding integrals allow an integral expansion compatible with their interpretation as generating functions of disk instantons.

Abstract: We introduce a streamlined method for evaluating in-in loop integrals using dimensional regularization for diagrams with an arbitrary number of external legs and vertices, which complements earlier work and facilitates the extraction of the ultraviolet contributions. The method leads us to identify an apparent difficulty to renormalize with Hamiltonian counterterms within the in-in formalism.

Abstract: The s-wave approximation to the black hole dynamics has attracted considerable attention recently. However, the near-AdS2 geometry of the near-horizon region and decoupling of the non-s-wave modes usually requires a small-temperature limit. In this work we propose the new limit based on the large number of dimensions in which the temperature remains finite, but the s-wave sector may be described by Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity interacting with other modes with vanishingly small coupling. However, we demonstrate that the thermal bath of the tensor modes with non-zero angular momenta collectively produces a significant impact on the two-dimensional theory.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: HEE, entanglement thermodynamics, and HEN are analyzed in a holographic setup with backreaction. HEN shows two distinct behaviors: suppression at low temperatures and enhancement at high temperatures due to fluctuations caused by the backreaction parameter $ρ$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum correlations, especially entanglement, in strongly coupled thermal systems using holographic methods is a key motivation in theoretical physics.

Method: Numerical analysis of holographic entanglement negativity using expansion techniques in different temperature limits (low and high). Entanglement thermodynamics principles are applied to establish a first law-like relation in the small backreaction regime.

Result: HEN's behavior differs significantly from HEE and mutual information: it decreases at low temperatures and increases at high temperatures when the backreaction parameter $ρ$ is varied.

Conclusion: HEN serves as a more sensitive indicator of the competition between thermal and quantum correlations in systems with backreaction compared to HEE and mutual information.

Abstract: We investigate holographic entanglement negativity (HEN) as a probe of mixed state quantum correlations in a deformed AdS black hole background with backreaction sourced by a string cloud. The bulk geometry is dual to a strongly coupled large-$N_c$ gauge theory at finite temperature, backreacted by a finite density of heavy static fundamental quarks. Alongside holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), we analyze entanglement thermodynamics and establish a first law like relation in the small backreaction regime by identifying the deformed black hole at zero temperature as the natural ground state of the dual field theory. Using analytic expansions in the low and high temperature limits, we compute the HEN for adjacent, disjoint and bipartite subsystem configurations and examine its dependence on the backreaction parameter $ρ$. Our results reveal a clear regime dependence: at low temperature, backreaction suppresses the negativity, signaling a reduction of distillable quantum correlations while at high temperature the negativity is enhanced due to the monotonic $ρ$-dependence of near horizon contributions. We further compare the behavior of HEN with HEE and mutual information, demonstrating that entanglement negativity provides a sharper diagnostic of the competition between thermal and quantum correlations in holographic plasmas with matter backreaction.

Abstract: We develop a probability-level, manifestly causal formalism for calculations in QFT. The approach involves an implicit summation over final states, which makes causality manifest since retarded propagators emerge naturally. This inclusive summation over final states may also offer insights into the cancellation of IR divergences in physical observables within gauge theories, in accordance with the BN and KLN theorems. To study this, we first conduct particle scattering calculations using conventional methods, determining the quark-antiquark production cross section at first-order in gluon corrections, with careful tracking and cancellation of both IR and UV divergences. We then apply the causal formalism to analogous processes in scalar field theory, introducing novel diagrams that represent algebraic terms at the probability level, akin to Feynman diagrams at the amplitude level. We present a list of rules that generate all probability-level diagrams for particle scattering processes in which one is fully inclusive over final states that contain no initial-state particles. We also investigate the Unruh effect through the lens of the causal formalism. We calculate the transition rate of an accelerating UdW detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial observer and an accelerating observer. We confirm that the two perspectives give the same transition rate, despite the Rindler observer describing the Minkowski vacuum state as a thermal bath of particles. Numerical results for the transition rate are presented, highlighting the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state. Finally, we review the literature regarding the response of an UdW detector on various trajectories in the spacetime of a (3+1)-D Schwarzschild black hole, with a view to extending the analysis in the future using our causal formalism.

Abstract: We present a string theory construction in which the particle physics contributions to the one-loop vacuum energy exactly cancel, whilst the gravitational contributions are suppressed in the size of one or two large extra dimensions. This provides an ultraviolet realisation of the Dark Dimension and Supersymmetric Large Extra Dimensions scenarios, with, moreover, an explanation as to why the Standard Model contributions to the vacuum energy cancel without the need of eV mass-splittings. Gravity propagates in micron sized dark dimension(s), whilst the visible and hidden sectors are supported on D-branes. Supersymmetry is broken in the dark dimension(s) à la Scherk-Schwarz, whereas supersymmetry is broken at the string scale, à la Brane Supersymmetry Breaking, in the D-branes sector, without inducing tadpoles. Vacuum energy from the visible sector is cancelled by the vacuum energy of the hidden sector branes. We also discuss moduli stabilization in this set-up, finding that the interplay between the Scherk-Schwarz one-loop contribution and non-perturbative effects can fix the size of the dark dimension(s) to be exponentially large in the inverse string-coupling, leading to an exponentially small total vacuum energy, with all moduli stabilised in a dS saddle.

Abstract: Gravitationally prepared states are quantum field theoretic states prepared by gravitational path integrals with spatial boundaries that have fixed boundary conditions for gravity but not for matter fields. They can be interpreted as quantum field theoretic states of closed universes encoding quantum gravitational effects of the past. We propose a method of modelling gravitationally prepared states in two dimensions with random matrix product states (RMPS). Such RMPS models allow us to exactly define and compute contributions of higher topologies and replica geometries in the gravitationally prepared state to all orders. We show that the bra-ket wormhole phase transition, a crucial physical property of gravitationally prepared states, is ensured if the transfer matrix of the RMPS satisfies the spectral gapping property, which we define, and define a class of models called $\mathrm{O}(k)$ models satisfying this property. A novel advantage of RMPS models is that they allow us to compute the effects of off-shell wormholes, i.e., wormhole topologies without semiclassical solutions. In particular, using RMPS models, we find that off-shell wormholes lead to nonzero long-distance correlators in gravitationally prepared states. We also define RMPS models in continuous space, and discuss implications for studying de Sitter gravitationally prepared states.

Abstract: We study generalizations of Buchdahl's compactness limits for perfect-fluid star solutions of $D$-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to higher-curvature corrections. We focus on Quasi-topological theories involving infinite towers of terms for which the unique vacuum spherically symmetric solutions correspond to regular black holes. We solve analytically the problem of constant-density stars and find that the space of solutions is bounded by: configurations with divergent central-pressure, corresponding to the most compact stars; configurations which possess zero central-pressure; and configurations for which the sizes of the stars coincide with the inner-horizon radii of the would-be regular black holes. In the more general case of perfect-fluid stars for which the mean density decreases with increasing radius, we show that, for each density profile, maximum compactness is reached when the metric becomes singular at the center. Under certain additional conditions, we find a novel Buchdahl limit for the maximum compactness of stars, attained by a specific constant-density profile. We show, in particular, that stars in these theories may be more compact than in Einstein gravity. While the vacuum solutions of these theories are such that all curvature invariants take mass-independent maximum finite values, we argue that there exist ordinary matter stars with finite central pressures for which such bounds can be violated -- namely, arbitrarily high curvatures can be reached -- unless additional constraints, such as the dominant energy condition, are imposed on the fluid.

Abstract: Semi-classical dilaton gravity in (1+1)-dimensions remains one of the only arenas where quantum black holes can be exactly constructed, fully accounting for backreaction due to quantum matter. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the mass and thermodynamic properties of static asymptotically flat quantum black holes both analytically and numerically. First, we analytically investigate eternal quantum black hole solutions to a one-parameter family of analytically solvable models interpolating between Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius and Bose, Parker, and Peleg gravities. Examining these models in a semi-classically allowed parameter space, we find naked singularities may exist for quantum fields in the Boulware state. Using a quasi-local formalism, where we confine the black hole to a finite sized cavity, we derive the conserved energy and analyze the system's thermal behavior. Specifically, we show the semi-classical Wald entropy precisely equals the generalized entropy, accounting for both gravitational and fine grained matter entropies, and we find a range where the quantum black holes are thermally stable. Finally, we numerically construct eternal black hole solutions to semi-classical Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger gravity and find their thermal behavior is qualitatively different from their analytic counterparts. In the process, we develop an analytic expansion of the solutions and find it accurately approximates the full numerical solutions in the semi-classical limit.

### [115] [On the Stability of Anisotropic Neutron Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19825)
*L. M. Becerra,E. A. Becerra-Vergara,F. D. Lora-Clavijo,J. F. Rodriguez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Anisotropic neutron stars with pressure anisotropy can have different maximum masses compared to isotropic counterparts, up to 30% higher. The Bowers-Liang and Covariant models become unstable at lower central densities, suggesting that isotropic stars may be more stable near maximum mass. Pressure anisotropy allows for more compact stable configurations that may collapse on longer timescales. Some configurations mimic a black hole's gravitational-wave ringdown, but subsequent echoes aren't guaranteed and depend on the star's internal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior and stability of neutron stars is fundamental for gravitational wave astronomy and theoretical astrophysics.

Method: We model neutron stars using three pressure anisotropy prescriptions: Horvat, Bowers-Liang, and Covariant. We employ three equations of state with varying particle compositions, using piecewise polytropic parametrization and continuous sound speed. Stability is assessed through dynamical evolution using a fully non-linear relativistic code, and for stable configurations, we compute the oscillation spectrum, particularly focusing on fundamental mode frequency. We determine the neutral-stability line and validate if configurations to the right are unstable under radial perturbations and collapse.

Result: Isotropic and Horvat models become unstable close to the maximum-mass limit, while Bowers-Liang and Covariant models become unstable at lower central densities. Anisotropy increases maximum mass by up to 30%. More compact stable configurations may collapse on longer timescales. Some configurations mimic black hole ringdown. Post-ringdown echoes aren't guaranteed and depend on structure.

Conclusion: Pressure anisotropy significantly affects neutron star stability and maximum mass. It allows for more compact configurations and longer timescales for collapse. Some configurations mimic black hole ringdown, but future echoes depend on internal structure and equation of state.

Abstract: We model anisotropic neutron stars using three distinct prescriptions for pressure anisotropy, the Horvat, Bowers-Liang, and Covariant models, and three equations of state with different particle compositions, each described by a piecewise polytropic parametrization with continuous sound speed. The stability of these configurations is assessed through their dynamical evolution using a fully non-linear relativistic code. For stable configurations, we compute the oscillation spectrum and identify the fundamental mode frequency. We found that, while the isotropic and Horvat models become unstable close to the maximum-mass point, the Bowers-Liang and Covariant models become unstable at lower central densities, indicating that the standard turning-point criterion may not reliably predict the onset of dynamical instability in anisotropic stars. Based on our results, we also determine the neutral-stability line and verify that configurations lying to the right of this line are indeed unstable under radial perturbations and collapse. Overall, given an equation of state, pressure anisotropy can increase the maximum mass of an stable configuration by up to ~30 % compared to the isotropic case. It also allows for more compact stable configurations that may collapse on longer timescales once they become unstable. Finally, we show that these compact stars could initially mimic a black hole's gravitational-wave ringdown. However, the production of subsequent echoes is not guaranteed by high compactness; instead, it depends critically on the star's specific internal structure and equation of state.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper compares two formalisms used to describe gravitational waves: the Newman-Penrose and the Bardeen formalisms. It finds that the Bardeen formalism is simpler and more effective for analyzing plane gravitational waves in Minkowski spacetime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding gravitational waves and their properties is a key goal in modern physics. Different mathematical tools can help achieve this goal, and comparing their effectiveness is an important part of ongoing research.

Method: This paper uses mathematical analysis and comparison of two formalisms: the Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism and the gauge-invariant Bardeen formalism. It specifically looks at plane gravitational waves in Minkowski spacetime, computes relevant variables, and compares invariants generated by each formalism.

Result: The study shows that the Bardeen formalism yields simpler and more effective description of gravitational waves compared to the NP formalism. It successfully demonstrates that only the transverse-traceless tensor modes survive, aligning with expectations from general relativity. Moreover, it establishes a connection between Bardeen variables and Killing invariants, highlighting the importance of using translation Killing vectors in analyzing gravitational waves.

Conclusion: The research concludes that the Bardeen formalism is a powerful and effective tool for analyzing gravitational waves, particularly in the context of plane waves in Minkowski spacetime. It provides a simpler alternative to more complex methods like the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm for calculating invariants related to gravitational waves.

Abstract: The Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism is traditionally used to analyze the polarization content of gravitational waves, while the gauge-invariant Bardeen formalism provides a complementary, and often simpler, description based on the irreducible scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations of the metric. In this work we apply the Bardeen formalism to plane gravitational waves in Minkowski spacetime, computing all scalar, vector, and tensor gauge-invariant variables explicitly and demonstrating that only the two transverse-traceless tensor modes survive, as expected for vacuum waves in general relativity.
  We then compare these Bardeen variables with curvature-based invariants constructed using the linearized Cartan--Karlhede (CK) algorithm. We show that the CK invariants do not distinguish the $\oplus$ and $\times$ modes. Instead, we show that the Bardeen variables coincide with the Killing invariants obtained by projecting the metric perturbation onto the translational Killing vectors of the Minkowski background. Thus, in the plane-wave case, the physical gravitational-wave degrees of freedom are encoded in invariants generated from the Killing vector fields, rather than Cartan invariants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a detailed analysis of Nat'{a}rio's warp drive spacetime, comparing its curvature invariants to Alcubierre's model and dispute claims about its greater feasibility.

Method: Four primary objectives: Petrov type classification, relative curvature magnitudes, visualization of invariants, and critical examination of Alcubierre's comparison.

Result: Nat'{a}rio's warp drive exhibits significantly higher curvature invariants, making it less viable.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Nat'{a}rio's warp drive is less feasible than previously thought, despite initial claims.

Abstract: We conduct a detailed analysis of Nat'{a}rio's ``zero-expansion'' warp drive spacetime, focusing on scalar curvature invariants within the 3+1 formalism. This paper has four primary objectives: First, we establish the Petrov type classification of Nat'{a}rio's spacetime, which has not been previously determined in the literature. We prove that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime is Petrov type I, not fitting the Class B warped product spacetime definition. Second, we assess the relative magnitude of the Weyl scalar curvature invariant and compare it with the amplitudes of Einstein's scalar and the Ricci quadratic and cubic invariants within the warp-bubble zone. Previous studies have focused on Ricci curvature and the energy-momentum tensor, neglecting the Weyl curvature, which we demonstrate plays a significant role due to the sharp localization of the form function near the warp-bubble radius. Third, we visualize several curvature invariants for Nat'{a}rio's warp drive, as well as momentum density, which we show as the critical physical quantity governing the orientation of the warp drive trajectory, overshadowing space volume changes. Fourth, we critically examine claims that Nat'{a}rio's warp drive is more realistic than Alcubierre's. We demonstrate that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime exhibits curvature invariant amplitudes 35 times greater than Alcubierre's, given identical warp-bubble parameters, making Nat'{a}rio's concept even less viable. Additionally, we address Mattingly et al.'s analysis, highlighting their underestimation of curvature invariant amplitudes by 21 orders of magnitude.

### [118] [Dissipative cosmology with $Λ$ from the first law of thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19911)
*Nobuyoshi Komatsu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A cosmological model with both a cosmological constant and a dissipative term is developed by applying the first law of thermodynamics to matter creation cosmology. The model suggests that a negatively moderate dissipative coefficient allows a transition from a decelerating to an accelerating universe. Horizon thermodynamics satisfies the second law, and maximizing entropy occurs in the final stage. Constraints from observed Hubble parameter data and thermodynamic conditions suggest a weakly dissipative universe with Λ is in line with our Universe. Entropy due to adiabatic particle creation is considered under a holographic-like scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deriving a cosmological model that combines a cosmological constant with a dissipative term using thermodynamic principles to explain the transition from decelerating to accelerating universe and validating it with observed data.

Method: Apply the first law of thermodynamics to matter creation cosmology to derive the model, examining background evolution and horizon thermodynamics. Use observed Hubble parameter data and thermodynamic constraints to constrain model parameters.

Result: The model supports a transition from decelerating to accelerating universe when β < 0.5. Horizon thermodynamics agrees with the second law, entropy maximization occurs at the end. Observed data and thermodynamic constraints favor a weakly dissipative universe with Λ and align with our Universe. Entropy due to adiabatic particle creation is considered under holographic-like matter creation.

Conclusion: A weakly dissipative universe with Λ is likely favored and consistent with our Universe. Thermodynamic principles support the model's transition and entropy behavior.

Abstract: We phenomenologically derive a cosmological model that includes both a cosmological constant term $Λ/3$ and a dissipative driving term $β(2 H^{2} + \dot{H})$ by applying the first law of thermodynamics to matter creation cosmology. Here $H$, $\dot{H}$, and $β$ are the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of $H$, and a non-negative dimensionless coefficient, respectively. The dissipative term is proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature, suggesting that the dynamic creation pressure has the same dependence. We examine the model's background evolution in the late universe and its horizon thermodynamics. The present model supports a transition from a decelerating universe to an accelerating universe when $β<0.5$. The second law of thermodynamics is always satisfied on the horizon, and maximization of entropy is satisfied in the final stage. We examine constraints on the present model using observed Hubble parameter data and the transitional and thermodynamic constraints and find that a weakly dissipative universe with $Λ$ is likely favored and consistent with our Universe. We also discuss irreversible entropy due to adiabatic particle creation, assuming a holographic-like matter creation cosmology.

Abstract: The gravitational-wave event GW231123_135430 is the heaviest binary black hole system observed by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA Collaboration to date, with the initial analysis indicating the individual black hole masses lie within or above the theorized pair-instability mass gap of roughly $60$--$130\,M_\odot$. The inference further suggests that both black holes possess high spins, measured to be $0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$. Therefore, the observation of this event suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond the standard stellar collapse. However, different waveform models yield significantly different parameter estimates, possibly due to missing physics in the models used in inference. In this work, we carry out a reanalysis of GW231123 using a physically complete model, accounting for both spin precession and eccentricity. Our analysis shows that this event does not exhibit strong evidence for eccentricity and the exclusion of eccentricity has minimal impact on inference. Furthermore, for GW231123-like systems, even eccentricities as large as $0.15$ at $10$ Hz do not yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement. Through a zero-noise injection recovery study, we show that the observed discrepancies in the parameter estimates can be explained by disagreement in the waveform models at strong spin precession, with the degree of parameter bias in the zero-noise runs being comparable to that observed for the real signal. We also show that inference performed with an eccentric, aligned-spin waveform model can yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement due to the degeneracy between eccentricity and spin precession. Bayesian model selection, however, rules out this interpretation in favor of the eccentric, spin precessing hypothesis, which supports zero eccentricity -- a conclusion we confirm with additional zero-noise injection-recovery tests.

Abstract: Two prescriptions, the expansion of near horizon of geometry and expansion of metric with zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$ (speed of light in vacuum), of constructing Carroll geometries are known to complement each other. The entropy of an ideal gas, confined in a box and kept very near to the horizon, depends on the transverse area of the container. We show this by using the Carroll geometry constructed through the expansion of the metric and then taking zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$. Therefore the present analysis re-assures the complementing nature of two ways of finding the Carroll geometry from the thermodynamical point of view.

We use and solve the TRW $F(T)$-gravity field equations (FEs) for each value of the $k$-parameter $(-1,\,0,\,+1)$ and the electromagnetic equivalent of the equation of state (EoS), leading to new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For the $k=0$ cosmological case, we find new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for any scale factor $n$. For $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find exact and far-future approximated new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and infinitely fast universe expansion summarized by analytical functions. All the new solutions are relevant for future cosmological applications, implying any electromagnetic source processes, such as the cosmological plasma models.

Abstract: Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.

Abstract: The effective dynamics of the Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime inspired by loop quantum gravity is studied. Two different schemes are considered to regularize the Hamiltonian constraint for the quantum dynamics. In the $μ_0$ scheme in which the quantum parameters are treated as constants, the equations of motion generated by the effective Hamiltonian are solved analytically. The resulting quantum-corrected effective spacetime obviously extends the effective spacetime previously obtained in the literature. In the new effective spacetime, the naked singularity and the central singularity presented in the classical JNW spacetime are resolved by a series of quantum bounces. In the scheme of choosing the quantum parameters as Dirac observables, the effective dynamics is also solved in the light of the solution in $μ_0$ scheme. It turns out that the resulting effective spacetime has singularities due to the appearance of the zero points of the time reparametrization functions. Hence, the effective theory in this scheme does not remain valid throughout the full spacetime.

Abstract: We provide a methodology to obtain black hole (BH) solutions in Hořava gravity (HG) and Einstein Aether (AE) theory for the spherically symmetric (SS) case with a static aether. This methodology consists of first specifying the form of the equation of state (EoS), rather than prescribing an energy density profile. The usual EoS for the static and SS case, $ρ= -p_r$, is no longer satisfied due to the presence of the HG AE terms. We study three linear EoS associated with: an analogue charged BH, a non-trivial extremal BH, and an ultra-relativistic stiff fluid, respectively. The HG AE terms lead to exotic behaviors, both in the physical properties of the solutions and in their thermodynamics. In Case I, the matter sources can be interpreted as an exotic anisotropic matter distribution, giving rise to an effective electric-potential term in the geometry. In Case II, we obtain a non trivial extremal BH solution for which the event horizon is $n_{\text{odd}}$ fold degenerate. In Case III, we find a solution with a non trivial repulsive potential, where the influence of the HG AE terms at short scales leads to the formation of a BH remnant whose horizon encloses a central singularity (instead of a de Sitter core as occurs in regular BHs).

Abstract: We revisit the near-horizon description of the Kerr space-time in the isolated horizon formalism using a non-twisting null geodesic congruence and eliminate the coordinate and geodesic pathologies that arise when the Carter constant of motion is globally fixed to a single constant. Adopting instead a previously proposed choice of the Carter constant which depends on the polar angle on the horizon, we obtain an analytic construction of the Newman--Penrose tetrad adapted to isolated horizons together with horizon-adapted coordinates in which its defining properties are manifest. We compute the associated curvature scalars and provide initial data on characteristics for the isolated horizon. In addition to an analytical solution, derived by leveraging extensive results on Kerr null geodesics, we develop two complementary series expansions and outline a practical numerical recipe to make the construction readily usable. Relative to earlier treatments, our formulation avoids caustic-induced breakdowns and incomplete coordinate coverage while yielding a detailed description of the Kerr black hole in the isolated horizon approach.

### [127] [Eckart heat-flux applicability in $F(Φ,X)R$ theories and the existence of temperature gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20553)
*David S. Pereira,José Pedro Mimoso*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines scalar-tensor theories where a generic nonminimal coupling induces a heat flux not expressible as a spatial gradient, complicating the Eckart interpretation. Only theories with F_X=0 allow a global Eckart fluid picture, while others may work only on symmetric backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper contributes to understanding scalar-tensor theories and their thermodynamic consistency, especially concerning heat flux and the Eckart framework.

Method: Mathematical analysis of the scalar-tensor Lagrangian and derivation of the heat flux components.

Result: Theories with F_X=0 allow a global Eckart interpretation, while others require specific symmetric backgrounds for an Eckart-like heat flux.

Conclusion: Limited generality restricts the applicability of global Eckart-like interpretations in these theories, highlighting the need for symmetric backgrounds when F_X≠0.

Abstract: We show that in single--scalar theories of the form $\mathcal{L}=F(Φ,X)R+G(Φ,X)$, a generic nonminimal coupling $F(Φ,X)$ induces, in the scalar--comoving frame, an additional transverse contribution to the effective heat flux, proportional to $(F_X/8πF)V_{\perp a}$, where $V_a \equiv h_a{}^c\nabla_c\nabla_d X\,u^d$ and $V_{\perp a}$ denotes the component orthogonal to the 4--acceleration $a_a$. This new term, that is not present in $F(Φ)R$ scalar-tensor theories, cannot in general be written as a spatial temperature gradient, and therefore obstructs a standard Eckart interpretation of the scalar sector for arbitrary timelike scalar configurations. As a result, requiring an Eckart heat flux $q_a = -K\bigl(D_a T_g + T_g\, a_a\bigr)$ for all such configurations is possible if and only if $F_X(Φ,X)\equiv 0$, i.e.\ $F(Φ,X)=F(Φ)$, resulting in a theory that is a subclass of Horndeski. Thus, only Jordan--like theories of the type $F(Φ)R+G(Φ,X)$ admit a global Eckart fluid picture of the scalar sector, while models with $F_X\neq 0$ can recover an Eckart--like form only on highly symmetric backgrounds where the transverse contribution vanishes or collapses to a single gradient direction. We also make a brief comment on the existence of temperature gradients $D_aT_g$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The spin-induced quadrupole moment-based test of black hole nature is routinely used to probe the true nature of detected binary signals, assuming a circular orbit. We extend the applicability of the method to binaries in eccentric orbits. Considering simulated signals of varying masses, spins, and signal strengths, we demonstrate how the systematic errors resulting from neglecting orbital eccentricity compare with the statistical errors, using a semi-analytic Fisher matrix-based formalism that accounts for both current and future detectors. Further, we quantify the systematic errors by developing a Bayesian inference framework for the current detector network. The inspiral-only aligned spin gravitational wave waveform model for eccentric binaries, TaylorF2Ecc, is employed. For the current detector network, neglecting an initial eccentricity of $e_0^{\rm inj}=0.1$ defined at $20\,\mathrm {Hz} $ can lead to a serious bias in binary parameter inference. Notably, a nearly equal-mass, moderately spinning binary black hole in an eccentric orbit can be identified as a non-black hole binary with extreme spins and asymmetric masses. We demonstrate the criticality of biased estimates that may arise when neglecting the orbital eccentricity while performing tests of black hole nature and discuss prospects.

Abstract: We present a general framework for the production of squeezed quantum states of the gravitational field in linearized quantum gravity. Time-dependent couplings in the quadratic part of the action generically produce squeezed states from the vacuum. Using the harmonic oscillator as an example, we describe three techniques to obtain the squeezing parameter from such quadratic terms. For gravity, the action to quadratic order in metric perturbations contains couplings both to background curvature as well as to matter sources. Thus, both time-dependent classical spacetimes and time-dependent classical matter typically produce squeezed states of gravity.

Abstract: The literature on experimentally verified material properties of tritium is sparse but information about this is crucial in fusion for pellet production (Magnetic Confined Fusion), target fueling (Inertial Confined Fusion), cryogenic distillation, as well as in astroparticle physics for neutrino experiments, and search for rare physics. To improve on this, the T$_2$ApIR experiment has been designed and built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK), and is in its scientific commissioning phase. The main focus of this experiment is to enable the investigation of the properties of all six hydrogen isotopologues and their mixtures in the gaseous, liquid, and solid phase, as well as the dynamics of their phase changes. In addition, mixtures with noble gases such as xenon and neon can be investigated. This is achieved using a cryogenic setup capable of reaching less than 10 in a measurement cell that allows optical access for infrared absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and a polariscope setup, as well as temperature and pressure measurement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imaging cosmic rays is vital for astrophysics and space exploration; current techniques are insufficient.

Method: P$μ$MA uses transmission tracks and material deflection to create images without relying on scattering angles, needing only two detectors.

Result: The method achieves mm resolution, is cost-effective, and demonstrated in experiments.

Conclusion: P$μ$MA is a breakthrough offering practical solutions for cosmic-ray imaging.

Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon imaging provides a non-destructive inspection technique, yet achieving millimeter-resolution imaging within practical timeframes remains challenging. Here we introduce Projection-shifted MUon transMission tomogrAghy (P$μ$MA), a hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates transmission and scattering information to enable high-resolution imaging. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on scattering-angle measurements to locate scattering points, P$μ$MA constructs transmission tracks by connecting hit positions in upstream and downstream detectors. The material-induced angular deflection is then projected as a detectable shift in an imaging plane. This approach allows millimeter-resolution cosmic-ray imaging with as few as two detectors, significantly increasing acceptance and usable muon events, and substantially lowering detector and electronics costs. We also present multi-detector variants that incorporate scattering-angle selection to enhance contrast. Simulations of a 30 mm thick lead block demonstrate a knife-edge width of 1.196 mm. Experiments resolve 2 mm copper sheets within 2 days, surpassing conventional methods under matched conditions.

Abstract: We present the optimization and performance characterization of the second-generation Fermilab Constant Fraction Discriminator ASIC (FCFD), designed for the readout of AC-coupled low-gain avalanche detector (LGAD) strip-sensors. The FCFD is explicitly engineered to be insensitive to signal-amplitude variations, thereby removing the need for time-walk correction that is required in other LGAD time-stamping readout ASICs. This updated version, referred to as FCFD1.1, incorporates several enhancements over the first iteration to address key challenges in AC-coupled LGAD front-end design. We outline the primary readout-ASIC design considerations for these applications, describe the methodology used to evaluate critical sensor and system parameters, and summarize the additionally implemented features. Performance measurements using injected charge signals and minimum-ionizing particles in test-beams demonstrate a time resolution of approximately 40 ps and a position resolution of roughly \SI{15}{\micro\meter} when tested with beam particles uniformly over the active area of the sensor.

Abstract: In both research and industrial settings, it is often necessary to expand the input/output channels of measurement instruments using relay-based multiplexer boards. In research activities in particular, the need for a highly flexible and easily configurable solution frequently leads to the development of customized systems. To address this challenge, we developed a system optimized for automated direct current (DC) measurements. The result is based on a 4x4 switching platform that simplifies measurement procedures that require instrument routing. The platform is based on a custom-designed circuit board controlled by a microcontroller. We selected bistable relays to guarantee contact stability after switching. We finally developed a system architecture that allows for straightforward expansion and scalability by connecting multiple platforms. We share both the hardware design source files and the firmware source code on GitHub with the open-source community. This work presents the design and development of the proposed system, followed by the performance evaluation. Finally, we present a test of our designed system applied to a specific case study: the DC analysis of complex resistive networks through multi-point resistance measurements using only a single voltmeter and current source.

Result: The simulations successfully reproduced expected resolution behaviors and identified unique effects such as wavelength-dependent edge enhancement, demonstrating the value of virtual experiments in experimental planning.

Conclusion: Numerical simulations play a crucial role in accurately predicting and optimizing experimental outcomes, especially for complex setups like BIFROST.

Abstract: Using the Monte Carlo ray tracing package McStas, we illustrate the possibilities of creating virtual experiments of the neutron spectrometer BIFROST at the European Spallation Source, ESS. With this model, we are able to benchmark BIFROST with respect to expected intensity, $Q$- and energy-resolution. The simulations reproduce the expected resolution behavior and quantify effects that are difficult to capture analytically, including a wavelength-dependent edge enhancement arising from a combination of the long-pulsed source and the pulse-shaping chopper. Furthermore, we present an antiferromagnetic (AF) spin wave simulation, which we use to create realistic datasets at different instrument operation settings. Our virtual experiments focus on realistic dispersive dynamics and illustrate how the virtual experiment approach reveal resolution effects, not easily calculable via analytical models. This demonstrates the crucial role of numerical simulations in the planning of challenging experiments.

Abstract: Laser flash melting and revitrification experiments have recently improved the time resolution of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to the microsecond timescale, making it fast enough to observe many of the protein motions that are associated with function. The technique has also opened up a new dimension for cryo-EM sample preparation, making it possible to deposit compounds onto a cryo-EM sample while it is frozen, so that upon flash melting, the embedded particles experience an altered environment. For example, we have recently shown that depositing ultrathin silicon dioxide membranes onto a cryo-EM sample causes particles to detach from the interface upon flash melting, removing preferred particle orientation. These experiments also point towards a new strategy for initiating protein dynamics in time resolved experiments by depositing reagents, which will then mix with the sample upon flash melting. Here, we describe an apparatus for physical vapor deposition of compounds onto cryo-EM samples, detailing its design and operation. As a demonstration, we determine that the minimum thickness of silicon dioxide sealing membranes in a laser flash melting experiment is just over two monolayers. We propose that our design can form the basis for an integrated platform for microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM experiments.

Abstract: Inverse Compton scattering is developing to be a promising method to generate coherent and tunable x-rays. In this paper we present a theoretical framework to describe an inverse Compton scattering x-ray source for arbitrary interaction angles between the electron and laser pulse. Importantly the divergence of a tightly focused laser pulse will have a significant impact of the number of scattered x-rays. The parameters of the interaction geometry are optimized for two specific cases: head-on scattering; and a grazing co-propagating interaction angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tight symmetrically focused laser pulse, that balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a grazing angle geometry an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation.

Abstract: We have realized an interferometer using a thermal cloud of magnetically trapped rubidium 87 atoms on a chip. The interferometer resembles a Ramsey interferometer with a state selective spatial splitting of the two internal states as proposed in [M. Ammar, and al., Phys. Rev. A, 91, 053623]. The splitting is effected by microwave fields from two on-chip waveguides while the atoms remain magnetically trapped. The inferred maximum separation is $1.2\pm 0.1~μ$m. We observe interference fringes with a contrast around 8\% limited by velocity difference of the two interferometer states when we close the interferometer. We devellop a model describing this contrast decay.

Abstract: The universality of free fall, a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of gravity, has so far only been tested with neutral composite states of first-generation Standard Model (SM) particles, such as atoms or neutrons, and, most recently, antihydrogen. Extending these gravitational measurements to other sectors of the SM requires the formation of neutral bound states using higher-generation, unstable particles. Muonium, the bound state of an antimuon ($μ^+$) and an electron ($e^-$), offers the possibility to probe gravity with second-generation (anti)leptons, in the absence of the strong interaction. However, the short $μ^+$ lifetime ($τ_μ\approx 2.2~μ$s) and the existing diffuse thermal muonium sources rendered such measurements unfeasible. Here, we report the synthesis of a high-brightness muonium beam, extracted from a thin layer of superfluid helium by exploiting its chemical potential and unique transport properties. The mean longitudinal velocity (${v}\approx 2180~\rm{m/s}$) and narrow distribution (${Δv}< 150 ~\rm{m/s}$) of the atoms characterise a superthermal beam, while yields are similar to the highest intensity diffuse sources. This new beam is expected to enable muonium interferometry and a percent-level measurement of its gravitational acceleration, providing the first direct test of the Weak Equivalence Principle with second-generation (anti)matter. Its unprecedented brightness also opens the way to sub-kHz 1S-2S spectroscopy, enabling precise determination of the muon mass and stringent tests of bound-state quantum electrodynamics.

TL;DR: A study reports new insights into inner-shell electron dynamics of heavy atoms using attosecond soft X-ray pulses, showing unexpected streaking patterns and time shifts in Auger electrons that challenge existing theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding inner-shell electron dynamics is crucial for advancing attosecond science and soft X-ray spectroscopy, particularly for molecules containing heavy atoms like iodine or bromine.

Method: The researchers used attosecond soft X-ray (atto-SXR) pulses centered at 130 eV combined with CEP-stabilized few-cycle Yb laser pulses. The method involved time-resolved inner-shell electron spectroscopy to observe the Auger electrons from xenon and krypton.

Result: The study found streaking patterns in N_{4,5}OO Auger electrons from xenon with a time shift of ~1.32 fs relative to 4d photoelectrons. Additionally, an energy-integrated yield minimum at 4 fs pump-probe delay was observed, neither of which can be explained by current streaking theories or lifetimes inferred from energy-domain measurements. In contrast, M_{4,5}NN Auger electrons from krypton did not exhibit these anomalies.

Conclusion: These observations provide new insights into the inner-shell electron dynamics of heavy atoms in the giant dipole resonance region and open up possibilities for future attosecond soft X-ray spectroscopy of molecular systems containing iodine or bromine atoms.

Abstract: Time-resolved measurement of Auger-Meitner (AM) decay [Nature 419, 803 (2002)] marked a milestone in the development of attosecond science. To date, the time constants for the AM decay processes obtained from the time-domain experiments were found to be consistent with the values deduced from conventional energy-domain measurements. One of the main factors limiting the temporal resolution of these studies is the unlocked carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) of the laser pulses used to probe the electronic dynamics triggered by inner-shell photoabsorption. In this work, we report time-resolved inner-shell electron spectroscopy of xenon and krypton using attosecond soft X-ray (atto-SXR) pulses centered at 130 eV in combination with CEP-stabilized few-cycle Yb laser pulses. We observed that the N$_{4,5}$OO Auger electrons from xenon exhibit a clear streaking pattern, but with an unexpected time shift of $\sim$ 1.32 fs relative to the 4$d$ photoelectrons. Furthermore, the energy-integrated yield of streaked Auger electrons from xenon exhibits a pronounced minimum at a pump-probe time delay of 4 fs. Neither of these observations can be explained by current streaking theories and both are inconsistent with lifetimes inferred from energy-domain measurements. The M$_{4,5}$NN Auger electrons from krypton partly overlap in energy with the 3$d$ inner-shell photoelectrons and do not show these anomalous features. This study offers new insights into the inner-shell electron dynamics of heavy atoms in the giant dipole resonance region, laying the groundwork for attosecond soft X-ray spectroscopy of molecular systems containing iodine or bromine atoms.

### [142] [Precision spectroscopy of the 2S-$n$P transitions in atomic hydrogen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20543)
*Lothar Maisenbacher*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses how laser spectroscopy was utilized to measure specific hydrogen transitions with ultra high precision to test QED.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision measurements of hydrogen transitions are vital for validating QED, a cornerstone of the Standard Model.

Method: Laser spectroscopy was used to measure optical 2S-nP transitions in a cryogenic hydrogen beam, with Doppler shifts mitigated through counter-propagating beams and velocity-resolved detection.

Result: Significant precision achieved with 4 parts in 10^12 relative uncertainty for the 2S-4P transition, enabling the most precise determination of the Rydberg constant R_infinity and proton charge radius r_p.

Conclusion: This study advances QED testing capabilities and supports validation of fundamental physics constants.

Abstract: Precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen is an important way to test bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED), one of the building blocks of the Standard Model. In its simplest form, such a test consists of the comparison of a measured transition frequency with its QED prediction, which can be calculated with very high precision for the hydrogen atom. However, these calculations require some input in the form of physical constants, such as the Rydberg constant $R_\infty$ and the proton charge radius $r_\mathrm{p}$, both of which are currently determined to a large degree by hydrogen spectroscopy itself. Therefore, the frequency of at least three different transitions needs to be measured in order to test QED. Equivalently, a comparison of the values of $R_\infty$ and $r_\mathrm{p}$ determined from measurements of different transitions constitutes a test of QED.
 To this end, laser spectroscopy of optical 2S-$n$P transitions has been performed in this work. As these transitions are one-photon transitions, they are affected by a different set of systematic effects than the two-photon transitions on which most other spectroscopic measurements of hydrogen are based. In order to contribute to the test of QED, their transition frequencies must be determined with a relative uncertainty on the order of one part in $10^{12}$, corresponding to approximately 1 kHz in absolute terms. This is in turn approximately a factor of 10000 smaller than the relatively broad natural linewidth of the 2S-$n$P transitions, and a successful measurement requires both a very large experimental signal-to-noise ratio and a detailed theoretical understanding of the line shape of the observed resonance.
 The 2S-$n$P transitions were probed on a cryogenic beam of hydrogen atoms, which were optically excited to the metastable 2S level. The atomic beam was crossed at right angles with counter-propagating spectroscopy laser beams, which further excited the atoms to the $n$P level. The fluorescence from the subsequent rapid spontaneous decay served as experimental signal. The excitation with two counter-propagating beams led to two Doppler shifts of equal magnitude, but opposite sign, which thus canceled each other out. A velocity-resolved detection was used to determine any residual Doppler shifts, which could be excluded within the measurement uncertainty for both of the measurements discussed below.
 In a first experiment, the 2S-4P transition was probed. Quantum interference of neighboring atomic resonances produced subtle distortions of the line shape, which were found to be significant because of the very large resolution relative to the linewidth. The line shifts caused by the distortions were directly observed and could be removed by use of a line shape model based on perturbative calculations. With this, the transition frequency was determined with a relative uncertainty of 4 parts in $10^{12}$. In combination with the very precisely measured 1S-2S transition frequency, this allowed the, at the time, most precise determination of $R_\infty$ and $r_\mathrm{p}$ from atomic hydrogen. Moreover, good agreement was found with the much more precise value of $r_\mathrm{p}$ extracted from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen, which had been in significant disagreement with previous data from (electronic) hydrogen, causing concern about the validity of QED. This result has since been confirmed by other experiments. The 2S-4P measurement is treated in the appendix of this thesis.
 The 2S-4P measurement, despite its large signal-to-noise ratio, was limited by counting statistics. To improve precision, a transition with a narrower linewidth and an improved experimental signal was necessary. Hence, the study of the 2S-6P transition, which offers a three times smaller natural linewidth, was begun. The atomic beam apparatus was upgraded, resulting in a corresponding decrease of the experimentally observed linewidth, and a close to an order of magnitude larger flux of atoms in the low-velocity tail of the atomic beam. Together with a detector redesign, this led to an up to 16 times larger signal than for the 2S-4P measurement, opening the path to increased precision. The Doppler-shift suppression was also rebuilt to support such precision, including a fiber collimator developed for this purpose, which provides high-quality spectroscopy beams at the new transition wavelength of 410 nm.
 This enabled a measurement of the 2S-6P transition frequency with a statistical uncertainty of 430 Hz, five times lower than for the 2S-4P measurement and corresponding to a suppression of the Doppler shift by six orders of magnitude. At this level of precision, the light force shift from the diffraction of atoms at the light grating formed by the counter-propagating spectroscopy beams becomes significant. This light force shift was directly observed for the first time for the 2S-$n$P transitions and found to be well-described by a model derived for this purpose. The size of all other systematic effects, except the very precisely known recoil shift, is estimated to be below 500 Hz each. The blind data analysis is ongoing at the time of writing and thus no transition frequencies can yet be given. However, a preliminary analysis suggests a five-fold improvement in the determination of $R_\infty$ and $r_\mathrm{p}$ as compared to the 2S-4P measurement, and a two-fold improvement over the currently most precise determination from atomic hydrogen. This places the uncertainty of the determined value of $r_\mathrm{p}$ within a factor of five of that of the muonic value. The 2S-6P measurement is treated in the main text of this thesis.

Abstract: Divalent atoms have emerged as powerful alternatives to alkalis in ultracold atom platforms, offering unique advantages arising from their two-electron structure. Among these species, ytterbium (Yb) is especially promising, yet its anionic properties and its Rydberg spectrum remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we perform a first and comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) of $^{174}$Yb in $6sns\,^1S_0$ Rydberg states across nearly two decades in principal quantum number $n$ and three orders of magnitude in molecular binding energy. Using the Coulomb Green's function formalism, we compute Born-Oppenheimer molecular potentials describing the Rydberg atom in the presence of a ground-state perturber and achieve quantitative agreement with high-resolution molecular spectra. This enables the extraction of low-energy electron-Yb scattering phase shifts, including the zero-energy $s$-wave scattering length and the positions of two spin-orbit split $p$-wave shape resonances. Our results provide strong evidence that the Yb$^{-}$ anion exists only as a metastable resonance. We additionally show the sensitivity of ULRM spectra to the atomic quantum defects, using this to refine the value for the $6s23f\, ^1F_3$ quantum defect. Together, these findings establish Yb ULRMs as a powerful probe of electron-Yb interactions and lay essential groundwork for future Rydberg experiments with divalent atoms.

Abstract: Structured light beams, such as optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum, are essential for applications ranging from low-power optical communications to high-intensity laser-matter interactions. However, scaling their power and energy while preserving complex phase and spatial structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we demonstrate coherent beam combining as a versatile and scalable method for generating high-power structured beams without limitations on topological charge or spatial structure, while maintaining exceptionally high modal purity. We experimentally implement coherent beam combining for optical vortex beams with topological charges l = 1, 5, and 8, achieving a combined average power of 100 W and a peak power of 100 kW, with combining efficiencies of 95.0%, 93.9%, and 91.2%, respectively. Off-axis digital holography confirms that the phase and intensity profiles of the combined beams retain high modal purity, even at high topological charges. These results establish coherent beam combining as an effective route to high modal purity structured light at high power levels, unlocking new opportunities for advanced photonics and high-intensity light-matter interaction studies.

Abstract: Photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) are defects in host photonic crystals (PCs) which create bound states in the PC band gap. These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap. We furthermore report optimised structures of H1 cavities, and provide the optimisation code for widespread use.

Abstract: Integrating alkali atomic vapors with nanophotonic devices offers a scalable route to quantum technologies that leverage strong atom-photon interactions. While there have been many approaches to such integration, the general reliance on traditional glass vapor cells, distilled alkali metals, and epoxy sealing limits reproducibility and scalability. Moreover, mitigating adverse Rb-photonics interactions is essential, particularly as devices become more compact and the alkali source lies in close proximity to the photonic elements. Here, we demonstrate the successful operation of compact and fully integrated devices that combine silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with microfabricated borosilicate vapor cells and pill-type rubidium (Rb) dispensers through hermetic seals via anodic bonding. We show how successful operation hinges on optically activating the dispenser in a low-power pulsed mode, releasing controlled amounts of Rb vapor on demand while mitigating photonic degradation. Simultaneously, a counter-propagating desorption laser completely suppresses Rb-induced losses and enables waveguide-based atomic vapor spectroscopy. Using this approach, we demonstrate repeatable control of vapor density by tuning activation pulse length, duty cycle, and device temperature. These results establish a compact, manufacturable, and scalable vapor-PIC device, and set the stage for future demonstrations in cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum nonlinear optics, and chip-scale atomic sensors.

Abstract: Chiral nanophotonic structures have garnered considerable interest in recent years due to their potential to enhance the efficacy of chirality-sensitive biomolecular detection. Designing metaplatforms to enhance chiroptical signals under linearly polarized excitation is particularly appealing due to the minimal chiral background and the ease of controlling excitation polarization. Here, a novel two-step inverse design scheme for dielectric lossless metasurfaces with superchiral hot spots is proposed. The method extends the local density of field enhancements for non-chiral fields into the chiral regime and significantly surpasses previous enhancements in super-chiral field generation. It has been demonstrated that by leveraging the excitation of high quality factor modes with small mode volumes, it is theoretically possible to convert linearly polarized plane waves into a superchiral hot spot with record-high enhancement in the near-field optical chirality up to 104. A prototype is successfully implemented using advanced nanofabrication technologies. The optical characterization of the prototype demonstrates a 102-fold enhancement in optical chirality. The findings of this study unveil novel prospects for chiral spectroscopy with ultra-compact devices, underscoring the role of machine learning and physics-based inverse design in the development of cutting-edge, functional photonic structures.

Abstract: Dynamic scattering and imaging with coherent, ultrafast, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources can resolve charge, phonon and spin processes on their intrinsic length and time scales. However, full field coherent diffraction imaging requires scanning of the sample combined with computational phase retrieval, making it challenging to quickly acquire a large series of dynamic frames. In this work, we demonstrate a technique for extracting dynamic 1D images of the average unit cell in a periodic sample from traditional EUV scatterometry data by analyzing the changing intensities of the far field diffracted orders. Starting from a system of equations relating small changes in far field diffraction to phase and amplitude perturbations at the sample plane, it is shown that under certain conditions, changes to the $n$th diffracted order map exclusively onto the $n$th Fourier component of the perturbation via a closed-form relation. We show through rigorous coupled-wave analysis simulations that our method can provide a good approximation even outside the scalar diffraction theory framework in which it is derived. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate this reconstruction method by exiting 1D nickel nanowires on a diamond substrate using an infrared laser pump pulse, and measuring their relaxation using a time-delayed EUV probe pulse, to visualize nanoscale phonon dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to overcome the limitations of traditional EO modulators, particularly the loop-length matching constraint and reliance on resonant structures, to create more compact and efficient devices for advanced optical and microwave communication systems.

Method: The authors developed a new non-resonant recirculating phase modulator architecture by repeatedly modulating the optical field within a single waveguide, eliminating the need for resonant structures or precise loop lengths. They demonstrated the concept by creating a Mach-Zehnder modulator and a cascaded PM, and evaluated their performance in FIR filtering and OFC generation.

These results highlight a practical, highly efficient non-resonant recirculating modulation platform with potential for scaling to high-order mode PMs.

Conclusion: This work pioneers a new non-resonant recirculating modulator architecture, offering compact, efficient, and scalable solutions for future optical and microwave communication systems without the constraints of resonant structures or loop lengths, opening new possibilities in these fields.

Abstract: High modulation efficiency and a compact footprint are critical for next-generation electro-optic (EO) modulators. We introduce a new class of non-resonant recirculating phase modulators (PMs) that boosts modulation efficiency by repeatedly modulating the optical field within a single, non-resonant waveguide, while fundamentally removing the loop-length matching constraint that has limited prior recirculating schemes. This architectural breakthrough simultaneously enables a much smaller device footprint and an extended low-V$π$ bandwidth, without relying on narrowband resonances. Building on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate both a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a cascaded PM, and verify their versatility in finite impulse response (FIR) filtering and optical frequency comb (OFC) generation. The recirculating MZM operates as a 4-tap rectangular-window FIR filter with 110 GHz bandwidth in a compact 2.889$\times$0.58 mm$^2$ footprint. The cascaded PM achieves a 3.40 GHz low-V$π$ bandwidth, a 110 GHz resonant EO bandwidth, and a V$π$L of 0.7 V$\cdot$cm, and generates 20 OFC lines under a 33 dBm microwave drive. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a practical and highly efficient non-resonant recirculating modulation platform, laying the groundwork for scalable high-order mode recirculating modulators (RMs) and opening new opportunities in optical communications, sensing, and microwave photonics.

The proposed devices exhibit clear logical discrimination according to a contrast-based performance metric and feature simple structures that favor compact implementations and integration into larger linear photonic architectures.

Abstract: 3D image display is essential for next-generation volumetric imaging; however, dense depth multiplexing for 3D image projection remains challenging because diffraction-induced cross-talk rapidly increases as the axial image planes get closer. Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing.

Abstract: Optical pin beams (OPBs) represent a novel class of structured light fields engineered for resilient, long-distance propagation. Their exceptional stability and strong resistance to atmospheric turbulence make them a compelling alternative to conventional Gaussian and other structured beams for free-space optical systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the physical principles, generation strategies, experimental realizations, and emerging applications of OPBs. By precise spatial modulation of the optical wave vectors, OPBs achieve highly collimated, self-reconstructing propagation with distinctive pin-like features that confer remarkable robustness and self-healing capability. We further discuss several OPB derivatives--including vortex, inverted, and vortex-inverted OPBs--which expand the functional landscape by enabling flexible control over amplitude, phase, polarization, and orbital angular momentum. Experimentally, OPBs have demonstrated outstanding performance across diverse platforms, ranging from free-space and underwater optical communications to optical trapping and super-resolution imaging. With their unique combination of propagation stability, light-field tunability, and environmental adaptability, OPBs hold strong promise for next-generation optical communication, precision sensing, and advanced imaging technologies.

Abstract: In precision frequency transfer systems, stringent requirements are imposed on the phase stability of transmitted signals. Throughout the transmission process, the inherent challenges of long-haul signal propagation inevitably introduce multiple noise components, including but not limited to thermal noise, phase fluctuations, and environmental interference. The system incline to use the conventional evaluation index - Allan deviation (ADEV) to reflect the system stability in order to evaluate the noise level. Whereas, ADEV can only provide numerical expression and lacks the time-frequency details. Therefore, a complete evaluation system is required by the system. In this paper, we present a groundbreaking integration of ADEV and wavelet transformed empirical mode decomposition (EMD-WT), establishing a novel analytical framework that enables simultaneous characterization of noise types and time-frequency domain properties. This synergistic approach achieves unprecedented dual-domain resolution in noise discrimination in frequency transfer systems.

Abstract: The transverse magnetic (TM) modes of a spherical cavity satisfy a dispersion relation connecting the angular eigenvalue $ν$ to the resonant frequency through zeros of the spherical Bessel function derivative. Analytic continuation of this dispersion relation to $ν= -1$ yields a formal zero-frequency endpoint where $j_{-1}(x) = \cos x / x$ admits the root $x = 0$. We examine this limit in detail, showing that while the mathematics is well-defined, the endpoint does not correspond to a physical electromagnetic mode. The positivity of the angular Sturm-Liouville operator restricts physical eigenvalues to $ν\geq 0$, placing $ν= -1$ outside the admissible spectrum. We demonstrate that all electromagnetic field components vanish in this limit, even though the underlying Debye potential $Π= \cos(kr)/kr$ remains non-trivial and exhibits a monopole-type singularity at the origin. This distinction between potential and field reflects the kernel structure of the curl-curl operator for spherically symmetric configurations. The analysis clarifies the boundary between propagating electromagnetic modes and static field configurations in spherical geometry, connecting the formal endpoint to longstanding questions about mode counting in cavity quantization.

Motivation: The need for scalable quantum communication devices led to the search for practical approaches to creating single-photon emitters on conventional chips.

Method: Used high-dielectric-constant nanopillars to create a localized dielectric environment, enabling exciton confinement. They converted a semi-classical approach to a fully quantum model by using the 2D excitonic Schrödinger equation and employed numerical solutions to study confinement through binding energies and wavefunction profiles.

Result: Formation of spatially confined single-photon emitters with lithography compatibility in 2D semiconductors, as demonstrated by both binding energy and wavefunction analysis.

Conclusion: This breakthrough supports the integration of 2D quantum emitters into photonic platforms, advancing quantum optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Single-photon emitters are essential building blocks for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies. However, realizing scalable, on-chip SPEs on a CMOS-compatible platform remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose and theoretically demonstrate a scalable approach to exciton confinement in two-dimensional semiconductors via local dielectric engineering. By introducing a high-dielectric-constant nanopillar above or beneath the 2D material, we create a spatially varying dielectric environment that can support localized exciton states, enabling deterministic, lithography-compatible single-photon emission without relying on strain, defects, or etching of the 2D layer. Using numerical solutions to the 2D excitonic Schrodinger equation, we quantify the resulting confinement through binding energies, wavefunction profiles, and a spatial confinement parameter. These results offer a practical and scalable route for integrating 2D-based quantum emitters into photonic platforms, paving the way for next-generation quantum optoelectronic devices.

Motivation: Understanding and simulating non-Hermitian systems could lead to breakthroughs in areas like enhanced sensing and topological photonics, particularly on nonorientable surfaces like Klein bottles.

Method: The researchers developed a silicon photonic integrated circuit that can emulate non-Hermitian time evolution. They reconstructed the Hamiltonian's complex components and mapped the fermi arcs by measuring the eigenvalue gaps.

Result: This is the first experimental demonstration of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold. It reveals same-charge EPs, offering a new model for studying non-Hermitian phenomena. The platform enables exploring exotic models in photonics.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for testing and developing non-Hermitian and topological models in optical systems, bridging theoretical predictions with practical implementations.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unlocked a wealth of unconventional wave phenomena beyond the reach of Hermitian systems, with exceptional points (EPs) driving enhanced sensitivity, nonreciprocal transport, and topological behavior unique to non-Hermitian degeneracies. Here, we present a scalable and reconfigurable silicon photonic integrated circuit capable of emulating arbitrary non-Hermitian time evolution with high precision. Using this programmable platform, we implement a two-band non-Hermitian Hamiltonian defined on a Klein-bottle topology a nonorientable parameter space that enables exceptional phases forbidden on orientable manifolds. Through an on-chip amplitude-and-phase reconstruction protocol, we retrieve the full complex Hamiltonian at multiple points in parameter space and experimentally map the associated Fermi arc where the imaginary eigenvalue gap closes. The orientation of the measured Fermi arc reveals a nontrivial exceptional topology: it implies the presence of same-charge EPs (or an EP monopole) that cannot annihilate locally on the Klein bottle. Our results demonstrate the first photonic realization of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold and establish a versatile platform for exploring exotic non-Hermitian and topological models relevant to classical and quantum photonics.

Abstract: Reconstructive spectrometers are a promising emerging class of devices that combine complex light scattering with inference to enable compact, high-resolution spectrometry. Thus far, the physical determinants of these devices' performance remain under-explored. We show that under a broad range of conditions, the noise-induced error for spectral reconstruction is governed by the Fisher information. We then use random matrix theory to derive a closed-form relation linking the variance bound to a set of key physical parameters: the spectral correlation length, the mean transmittance, and the number of frequency and measurement channels. The analysis reveals certain fundamental trade-offs between these physical parameters, and establishes the conditions for a spectrometer to achieve ``super-resolution'' below the limit set by the spectral correlation length. Our theory is confirmed using numerical validations with a random matrix model as well as full-wave simulations. These results establish a physically-grounded framework for designing and analyzing performant and noise-robust reconstructive spectrometers.

Motivation: Laser modulation control is important in many applications such as radar and communications.

Method: An iterative algorithm is developed to infer the laser transfer function for on-the-fly deconvolution. The algorithm is validated using an external-cavity diode laser.

The training approach incorporates the forward-forward method alongside traditional backpropagation.

Result: The system achieves exceptional accuracy (90.1%) with minimal optical nodes, demonstrating scalability and robustness. The classification accuracy remains largely consistent (0.2% reduction) despite variations in the programmable kernels.

Conclusion: This work presents a groundbreaking photonic solution that effectively balances energy efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, paving the way for practical implementations in photonic computing systems.

Abstract: Photonic convolutional accelerators have emerged as low-energy alternatives to power-demanding digital convolutional neural networks, though they often face limitations in scalability. In this work, we introduce a convolutional photonic accelerator that employs programmable kernels manifesting as trainable waveforms in the frequency domain to enable low-energy, high-throughput scalable image classification. The proposed scheme inherently provides dimensionality reduction and feature extraction directly in the optical domain. Numerical results targeting the Fashion-MNIST show that by using only 16 optical nodes, the system's classification accuracy tops at 90.1% when typical backpropagation is used. Moreover, by adapting the training technique to the forward-forward approach, a marginal drop of 1% is recorded compared to the backpropagation scenario, thus showcasing the compatibility of the overall architecture with a hardware-friendly training approach. Finally, we experimentally implement the trained kernels using a programmable waveshaper. Despite the difference between the simulated and experimentally generated transfer functions of the programmable kernels, the classification accuracy based on the experimentally obtained kernels exhibits a marginal 0.2% reduction, proving the validity of the idea and its high robustness to variations of the frequency-applied complex weights.

Result: OTOC增长速率与系统自由度和温度的关系满足普适函数，跨临界从经典到量子行为。在无穷自由度下，达到Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford界，说明量子贡献使机制饱和。

Conclusion: 在不依赖外部机制的情况下，该系统首次实现在经典哈密顿极限下的最大快速混合状态。

Abstract: Out-of-Time-Ordered Commutators (OTOCs), representing a key diagnostic for scrambling as a facet of short-time quantum chaos, have attracted wide-ranging interest, from many-body physics to quantum gravity. By means of a suitable form of the Wigner-Moyal expansion, and invoking ensemble equivalence in statistical physics, we provide a consistent approach to the growth rate of the OTOC for many-body systems with chaotic classical limit where both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the quantum nature of the density of states enter. Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $Λ$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $β$.
  We show that the scaled growth rate, $Λ/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f β$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity. In this way, we present first evidence of maximally fast scrambling in a quantum chaotic system with a well-defined classical Hamiltonian limit, without invoking any external mechanism such as (disorder) averaging.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解洛伦兹系统的历史依赖性提供了新的基础，通过分类守恒量揭示了系统 Dynamics的深层结构。

Abstract: Building upon the recent discovery of history-dependent dynamical invariants in the Lorenz system, this work presents a systematic classification of a complete family of such conserved quantities. Analysis of all 24 permutations in the augmented phase space identifies eighteen distinct invariants ($K_1-K_{18}$) organized into three regularization classes: Class I (permutations $1abc$), Class II ($2abc$), and Class III ($3abc$). Six permutations ($4abc$) yield null results due to Schwarz integrability conditions. Each class is characterized by a distinct polynomial factor that removes singularities at nullcline crossings. The regularized variable $v_n = p\, u_n$ evolves according to $dv_n/dt = Q_n(x,y,z)$, independent of $v_n$ itself; different conservation laws thereby impose distinct measures of trajectory history. Any three invariants from different classes provide independent constraints, defining a canonical Triad that characterizes orbit structure. Statistical analysis reveals class-dependent dynamical signatures: Class III invariants display higher intermittency (kurtosis ~15 versus ~8 for Class I) and stronger asymmetry (skewness ~2.7 versus ~1.6), correlating with lobe-switching events where the product $xy$ undergoes rapid sign reversal. This geometric sensitivity establishes Class III invariants as probes of topological transitions, while Class I invariants track continuous dynamics. The class-dependent divergence quantifies how different conservation principles impose incompatible demands on trajectory history. High-precision numerical validation confirms conservation of all identified quantities.

Abstract: In this work, the rate law for inhomogeneous concentration distributions has been formulated, by applying spatial integration over the products of species concentrations. Reaction rates for typical reactions have been investigated by assuming a linear concentration distribution in the grid. A few examples of one-dimensional concentration distributions, straight line, piecewise, and sine function, for a selected second order reaction have been taken to illustrate the validations of the method developed. Difference between the reaction rates by spatial integration and by mean concentrations have been discussed. It is revealed that the chemical reaction rates for combustion simulation can be calculated by appropriate sub-grid modeling of concentration distributions, without needs of the explicit consideration of turbulent combustion interactions, and the reaction rates for the species transport equation in turbulent combustion simulations can be accurately calculated if the concentration distributions of species within the grid are correctly defined.

Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) is a photophysical process where a singlet excitation generates two triplet excited states, enhancing exciton multiplication potentially useful for solar energy conversion. Since SF typically outcompetes radiative decay, single molecule studies of SF have remained elusive. Here, we present single molecule spectroscopy of a terrylenediimide (TDI) dimer at room and cryogenic temperatures. By analysing the stream of photons emitted by single dimers, the rates of formation and decay of SF-born triplet states were determined. We report considerable static and dynamic heterogeneities of the SF process which are reflected in broad rate distributions as well as the occasional occurrence of delayed fluorescence and rate fluctuations during spin evolution. Cryogenic experiments point to the formation of a coherent multiexciton superposition state which decays into the singlet exciton from which a correlated triplet pair evolves. Our results establish single molecule spectroscopy as a new avenue into mechanistic details of the SF process which often are drowned by ensemble av-eraging.

Abstract: Predicting monomer reactivity ratios is crucial for controlling monomer sequence distribution in copolymers and their properties. Traditional experimental methods of determining reactivity ratios are time-consuming and resource-intensive, while existing computational methods often struggle with accuracy or scalability. Here, we present a method that combines unsupervised learning with artificial neural networks to predict reactivity ratios in radical copolymerization. By applying spectral clustering to physicochemical features of monomers, we identified three distinct monomer groups with characteristic reactivity patterns. This computationally efficient clustering approach revealed specific monomer group interactions leading to different sequence arrangements, including alternating, random, block, and gradient copolymers, providing chemical insights for initial exploration. Building upon these insights, we trained artificial neural networks to achieve quantitative reactivity ratio predictions. We explored two integration strategies including direct feature concatenation, and cluster-specific training, which demonstrated performance enhancements for targeted chemical domains compared to general training with equivalent sample sizes. However, models utilizing complete datasets outperformed specialized models trained on focused subsets, revealing a fundamental trade-off between chemical specificity and data availability. This work demonstrates that unsupervised learning offers rapid chemical insight for exploratory analysis, while supervised learning provides the accuracy necessary for final design predictions, with optimal strategies depending on data availability and application requirements.

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectroscopic data is a long-standing challenge in Chemistry, traditionally requiring expert interpretation. We introduce NMIRacle, a two-stage generative framework that builds upon recent paradigms in AI-driven spectroscopy with minimal assumptions. In the first stage, NMIRacle learns to reconstruct molecular structures from count-aware fragment encodings, which capture both fragment identities and their occurrences. In the second stage, a spectral encoder maps input spectroscopic measurements (IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR) into a latent embedding that conditions the pre-trained generator. This formulation bridges fragment-level chemical modeling with spectral evidence, yielding accurate molecular predictions. Empirical results show that NMIRacle outperforms existing baselines on molecular elucidation, while maintaining robust performance across increasing levels of molecular complexity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Electrospray thrusters promise compact, high specific impulse propulsion for small spacecraft, yet ground characterization remains confounded by secondary species emission and incomplete diagnostics of neutral products. To address these limitations, we perform energy-resolved mixed quantum/classical (QM/MM) ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) of neutral 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, EMI-BF4, colliding with Au extractor surfaces with impact energies from 10 to 100 eV to resolve fragment species spectra, charge states, kinetic energy partitioning, and scattering geometry. The simulations reveal a three-stage sequence with impact energy: the low energy regime, 10 to 20 eV, which favors ionic dissociation, intermediate energy regime, between 30 to 40 eV, opens a neutralization window, and high energy regime, greater than 50 eV, drives covalent fragmentation into many light products with mixed charge states. Fractional energy distributions show a transition from few-body, energy-concentrated outcomes in the low energy regime to many-body, energy-dispersed outcomes in the high energy regime. Deflection angle distributions exhibit a strong mass-to-angle anti-correlation such that heavier fragments favor small deflection, whereas lighter fragments populate larger deflection angles. The fraction of transient metastables peaks near 50 eV, coinciding with abundant neutral fragment production. Importantly, neutral bombardment still produces charged secondaries at the target even when the upstream ion plume is fully suppressed by a decelerating electrode. These findings provide a basis for de-biasing facility measurements by pairing tandem time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and residual gas analyzer with suppression-bias corrections to inform the design of electrospray thrusters that reduce interception and contamination on extractor surfaces.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析两种不同阻值的21700电池，展示了如何更准确地识别电池的容量损化，特别是在负极的内阻和过冲电荷率下的非退化贡献。研究提出了一种基于放电分支的定量分析方法，以减少假性材料损失的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池容量的退化是电池寿命的重要指标，而电流效值（C/E）率的变化是评估电池退化的常见方法。然而，实验中通常使用的伪开路电压（pOCV）包含非退化贡献，如嵌入的内阻和充放电过程中的环状特性，特别是在基于Di图像分析（DMA）测量电池容量退化模式时，这些非退化贡献可能导致如何正确识别和归因电池的退化变得复杂。

Method: 本研究通过实验方法比较了两种不同阻值的21700电池（LG M50T和Molicel P45B），并提出了一种基于放电分支的分析方法。研究者首先从第一次约50毫秒的脉冲步进中提取了 SOC（State of Charge）依赖的瞬时内阻 $R_Ω(	ext{SOC})$，并通过使用内阻校正（IR）来校正 pOCV。对于M50T，内阻校正提升了低倍率放电时的 pOCV 偏移，从而更好地诊断嵌入的材料损失（LAM）和容量损失（LLI）。而对于 P45B，内阻校正则导致了 LAM 和 LLI 报告结果的偏差。研究者还通过调整电压窗口的下限，进一步优化了 LAM 的诊断方法。

Result: 研究结果表明，将内阻校正应用到 pOCV 中能够显著提高 LAM 和 LLI 的准确诊断。在M50T中，使用内阻校正降低了 PE-LAM 和 LLI 的误差率，而 P45B在某些情况下则提高了 LAM 和 LLI 的诊断精度。此外，研究者还发现，通过调整电压窗口的位置和上界可以进一步减少假性材料退化对其结果的影响。该研究为基于 DMA 的电池容量退化分析提供了一种更加可靠和准确的方法。

Conclusion: 电池容量的退化分析是电池研究中的一个关键问题，而针对非退化贡献（如内阻和环状特性）的准确校正对于提高退化分析的精度至关重要。本研究通过实验验证，提出了一种基于放电分支的分析方法，显著提高了基于 DMA 的电池容量退化诊断的准确性，为电池设计和优化提供了重要的理论依据。

Abstract: Degradation mode analysis (DMA) is widely used to decompose capacity fade into loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and loss of active material (LAM) from low-rate voltage-capacity data. Yet the measured trace is a pseudo-OCV (pOCV) that includes two non-degradation contributions: an SOC-dependent ohmic drop and intrinsic charge-discharge hysteresis, especially in graphite--silicon oxide (C/SiOx) negative electrodes. We show these can dominate attribution and generate Phantom LAM/LLI --apparent material loss created by curve registration, branch choice and voltage-windowing rather than true degradation. Using two commercial 21700 cells (LG M50T: higher resistance; Molicel P45B: lower resistance), we extract an SOC-dependent instantaneous resistance $R_Ω(\mathrm{SOC})$ from the first $\sim$50,ms pulse step and apply an IR correction to pOCV before fitting. In LG M50T, IR correction lifts the low-rate discharge pOCV by $+13$--$27$,mV with ageing; without it, PE-LAM is increasingly under-diagnosed (to $-8.80%$ relative error at late life) and LLI is suppressed (median $-3.07%$), with compensating inflation of apparent graphite loss. In P45B, on a branch-fair $3.0$--$4.2$,V window, end-of-life charge-branch DMA reports higher PE-LAM ($+3.42$,pp) and LLI ($+5.36$,pp), while the discharge branch recovers larger Si-LAM (discharge--charge difference to $+14.38$,pp). Raising the lower cutoff ($2.5$--$4.2 \rightarrow 3.0$--$4.2$,V) further under-reports Si-LAM by $13.61$,pp by removing the Si-sensitive low-voltage tail. We propose a practical protocol: correct only the instantaneous ohmic term, harmonize the voltage window, and base quantitative attribution on the discharge branch, treating anomalous/negative component LAMs on charge as allocation artefacts rather than recovery.

Abstract: The efficient and cost-effective conversion of nitro compounds to amines is crucial for industrial processes and environmental remediation, highlighting the growing demand for earth-abundant metal-based catalysts. In this study, magnetic Ni--NiO nanostructures and their composites with two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (\textit{h}-BN) were synthesized via a simple and scalable combustion method. The structural, morphological, and compositional properties of the synthesized materials were systematically investigated using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV--Vis spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of both Ni--NiO and \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanostructures was evaluated using nitrophenol reduction as a model reaction. The \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposite exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to pristine Ni--NiO, highlighting the synergistic interaction between \textit{h}-BN and Ni--NiO nanoparticles. Notably, the magnetic nature of the Ni--NiO core enabled facile recovery of the catalyst using an external magnetic field, and the composite demonstrated excellent stability and reusability for up to six catalytic cycles with minimal loss of activity. The combination of high catalytic efficiency, magnetic separability, and structural stability positions the \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposite as a promising candidate for green and sustainable catalytic applications, particularly in environmental remediation.

Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.

Result: Electronic temp effects minimal vs noticeable nuclear effects; Ar matrix minimal impact at 0K under co-deposition.

Conclusion: FT-TAO-based methods effective for studying thermal properties of MR systems, with distinct temp effects on nuclear vs electronic properties, and minor Ar matrix impact at 0K under co-deposition.

Abstract: Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) [J.-D. Chai, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 154104 (2012)] has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate electronic structure method for studying the ground-state properties of large multi-reference (MR) systems at absolute zero. To explore the thermal equilibrium properties of large MR systems at finite electronic temperatures, in the present work, we propose the finite-temperature (FT) extension of TAO-DFT, denoted as FT-TAO-DFT. Besides, to unlock the dynamical information of large MR systems at finite temperatures, FT-TAO-DFT is combined with ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to FT-TAO-AIMD. In addition, we also develop FT-TAO-DFT-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), denoted as FT-TAO-QM/MM, to provide a cost-effective description of the thermal equilibrium properties of a QM subsystem with MR character embedded in an MM environment at finite temperatures. Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene.

Abstract: Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has been proposed as a geoengineering strategy to mitigate global warming by increasing Earth's albedo. Silica-based materials, such as diamond-doped silica aerogels, have shown promising optical properties, but their impact on stratospheric chemistry, ozone one in particular, remains largely unknown. Here, we present first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the heterogeneous reaction between hydrogen chloride ($\mathrm{HCl}$) and chlorine nitrate ($\mathrm{ClONO_2}$), two main reservoirs of stratospheric chlorine and nitrogen species, on a dry, hydroxylated $α$-quartz silica interface. Our results reveal a barrierless reaction pathway toward the formation of chlorine gas ($\mathrm{Cl}_2$), a major contributor to stratospheric ozone loss. We design a heterogeneous kinetic model informed by our MD simulation and available experimental data: despite the barrierless formation of $\mathrm{Cl_2}$, the higher surface affinities and partial pressures of $\mathrm{HNO_3}$ and $\mathrm{HCl}$ compared to those of $\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ result in a negligible reaction probability, $γ_\mathrm{ClONO_2}$, upon chlorine nitrate collision with the silica surface. Since $γ_\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ enters as a proportionality constant in the definition of the heterogeneous reaction rate, our kinetic model indicates that the injection of silica-based aerosols may have only a limited impact on stratospheric ozone depletion driven by $\mathrm{HCl}$ and $\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ chemistry. At the same time, our findings also underscore the scarcity of experimental data, the need of better theoretical frameworks for the inclusion of MD results into kinetic models, and the urgency for further experimental validations of silica-based SAI technologies before their deployment in climate intervention strategies.

Abstract: The rigorous description of Conical Intersections (CIs) remains the central challenge of non-adiabatic quantum chemistry. While the ``Yarkony Seam'' -- the $(3N-8)$-dimensional manifold of degeneracy -- is well-understood geometrically, its accurate characterization by high-level electronic structure methods is plagued by numerical instabilities. Specifically, standard Coupled Cluster (CC) theory suffers from root bifurcations near Ground State CIs, rendering the ``Gold Standard'' of chemistry inapplicable where it is needed most. Here, we present \textbf{QuMorpheus}, an open-source computational package that resolves these singularities by implementing a topological framework based on Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules (DMHM) [P. Saurabh, arXiv:2512.19487 (2025)]. By algorithmically mapping the CC polynomial equations to a spectral sheaf, we compute the exact Monodromy ($μ$) invariants of the intersection. We demonstrate that this automated algebraic geometry approach correctly identifies the physical ground state topology in the Köhn-Tajti model and resolves the intersection seams of realistic chemical systems, including Ethylene and the Chloronium ion ($\mathrm{H_2Cl^+}$). Furthermore, we apply QuMorpheus to the photoisomerization of Previtamin D, proving that the experimentally observed Woodward-Hoffmann selection rules are a direct consequence of a topological ``Monodromy Wall'' ($μ=1, γ=π$) rather than purely energetic barriers. This establishes a general software solution to the ``Yarkony Problem,'' enabling the robust, automated mapping of global intersection seams in complex molecular systems. The topological stability of these intersections allows for the control protocols discussed in Ref.[P. Saurabh, Submitted to Phys. Rev. X (2025)].

Abstract: We outline the design and characterization of a laser pulse shaper, which creates an ``ultraslow optical centrifuge'' - a linearly polarized field whose polarization vector rotates with arbitrarily low angular acceleration. By directly recording this rotation in time with nonlinear cross-correlation, we demonstrate the tunability of such centrifuge (both in terms of its initial and its final rotational frequencies) in the range of accelerations which are three orders of magnitude lower than those available with a conventional centrifuge design. We showcase the functionality of the ultraslow centrifuge by spinning CS$_2$ molecules in a molecular jet. Utilizing the extremely low angular acceleration to control molecular rotation inside viscous media is a promising application for this unique optical tool.

Abstract: We uncover a generic mechanism through which the intrinsic geometry of multifractal quantum wavefunctions generates effective all-to-all interactions in many-body systems. By analyzing the multifractal spectrum, we demonstrate that the simultaneous participation of widely separated length scales creates a global connectivity that bypasses local interaction constraints. This nonlocality leads to fast information scrambling, evidenced by sharp changes in the quenched dynamics of the quantum Fisher information and bipartite mutual information with the onset of negative tripartite mutual information. Such rapid scrambling is a defining feature of strongly chaotic quantum dynamics, and our results identify the systems with multifractal states as a promising solid-state platform for realizing this regime. More broadly, they reveal a new paradigm in which complex, multiscale wavefunction structure intrinsically generates long-range connectivity, providing a natural route to achieving nonlocal behavior in strongly correlated quantum materials.

Abstract: We identify an unconventional form of the non-Hermitian skin effect that occurs not in position space but in many-body Fock space, which we call the Fock space skin effect (FSSE). Using quantum dimer models, we characterize FSSE analytically and numerically, and propose a concrete route toward its realization in Rydberg atom arrays. The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes. We show that FSSE enables the preparation of gapped spin liquid states, and in particular, we demonstrate how a Rydberg geometry realizing a square lattice quantum dimer model with next-nearest neighbor dimers can be driven by non-Hermiticity into an exact spin liquid ground state. Our results establish Fock-space non-Hermiticity as a powerful principle for engineering exotic quantum phases and dynamical state-preparation protocols.

Abstract: We address the physics of a regular arrangement of independent magnetic impurities embedded in a band of interacting electrons. We focus on the one-dimensional case that can be studied using bosonization and in which the electron bulk is described by a Luttinger liquid. The impurity spins interact with the electrons via magnetic exchange that introduces the possibility of Kondo and RKKY physics. We find that for two special values of the interactions, the model can be refermionized as a non-interacting electron band hybridized with a regular array of resonant levels. These solvable limits provide access to impurity correlators that correspond to either extended algebraic order or local screening. A physical picture emerges of how the interelectron interactions can stabilize either Kondo or RKKY physics depending on the sign of the interaction.

Abstract: We present a semi-automated method for obtaining an initial estimate of Wannier functions, designed to facilitate the construction of Wannier functions for describing low-energy effective models of solids, particularly those relevant to strongly correlated electron systems. Our approach automatically determines the hydrogenic projections orbitals and the center of the Wannier functions from information on Bloch wavefunctions at the $Γ$ point. This method is integrated into cif2qewan, enabling seamless generation of input files for Quantum ESPRESSO and Wannier90. We validate our method through applications to both inorganic and organic compounds, such as Si, SrVO$_3$, FeSe, Na$_8$Al$_6$Si$_6$O$_{24}$, and (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$. The obtained results demonstrate that our semi-automated projections give a good initial estimate of the Wannier functions. We also show the comparisons with other methods for estimating the initial states of the Wannier functions, such as the Selected Columns of the Density Matrix (SCDM). Our methodology shows an efficient way to construct Wannier functions, paving the way for high-throughput calculations in the study of complex materials.

Abstract: Seniority is a useful way of organizing Hilbert space for strongly correlated systems. The exact zero-seniority wave function, doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), provides accurate results (given the right orbitals) for many strongly-correlated electronic systems, but has combinatorial computational cost. In many cases, pair coupled cluster doubles provides a polynomial-cost approximation that closely reproduces the energies of DOCI, but it breaks down in some cases and, as shown herein, it does not provide particularly good density matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner approximation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to detect fractionalized excitations like Kitaev interactions in materials like CoNb₂O₆, which is difficult with conventional methods, so they turn to 2DCS spectroscopy, recently developed for Kitaev quantum spin liquids.

Method: Proposed a twisted Kitaev model for CoNb₂O₆, determined the twist angle from experimental data, used 2DCS nonlinear response, analyzed signals with spin superexchange splitting, and employed numerical projection methods to identify origin of signals.

Result: Observed non-rephasing diagonal and rephasing anti-diagonal signals in 2DCS, which split into discrete peaks due to x and y spin superexchange interactions. Two-spinon and four-spinon processes primarily contribute to the signals, showing that weak Kitaev interactions can be detected.

Conclusion: This study successfully demonstrates the effective detection of even weak Kitaev interactions in quantum materials using two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy.

Abstract: Detecting Kitaev interactions in real materials remains challenge, as conventional experimental techniques often have difficulty distinguishing fractionalized excitations from other normal contributions. Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers a novel approach for probing many-body phenomena, such as exotic excitations in quantum magnets. Motivated by recent experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and the development of the terahertz spectroscopy in Kitaev quantum spin liquid, we proposed a twisted Kitaev model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and determined the precise twist angle according to experimental specific-heat phase diagram. With this calibrated model, we found that non-rephasing diagonal and rephasing anti-diagonal signals appear in the 2DCS nonlinear response. The $x$ and $y$ components of the spin superexchange interactions split the rephasing signals into a grid of discrete peaks. We further demonstrate that the diagonal and the discrete rephasing signals primarily originate from two-spinon and four-spinon excitation processes based on numerical projection method. These findings indicate that even weak Kitaev interactions in quantum materials can be effectively detected via two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy .

Abstract: Kagome magnets naturally hosting Dirac points and flat bands exhibit novel topological phases, enabling rich interplays between interactions and topologies. The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.

Motivation: Understanding the phase diagram of frustrated quantum spin systems is crucial for advancing quantum many-body physics and developing new materials.

Method: Infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) combined with a corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) adapted to C₃-symmetric lattices.

Result: The system hosts two phases: a magnetically ordered canted-120° phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase. A first-order transition occurs at J_d/J ≈ 1.45. Magnetic moments are small but finite in the ordered phase, and the canting angle undergoes significant quantum renormalization.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive characterization of the quantum phase diagram for the J-J_d model on the maple-leaf lattice, revealing a first-order transition and quantifying the magnetic properties in the ordered phase.

Abstract: We study the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) combined with a corner transfer matrix renormalization group scheme adapted to $C_3$-symmetric lattices. Focusing on the fully antiferromagnetic $J$-$J_d$ model with $J_h = J_t := J$, we map out the ground-state phase diagram as a function of the dimer coupling $J_d$. Our results show that the system hosts only two phases: a magnetically ordered canted-$120^\circ$ phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase. We identify a first-order transition between these two phases at $J_d/J \approx 1.45$. Within the magnetically ordered phase, we observe small but finite magnetic moments. We also resolve the quantum renormalization of the canting angle, which deviates from the classical prediction over almost the entire magnetically ordered phase.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.

Abstract: Present article has addressed finite magnetic field extension of previous work by Cho et al. (Phys. Rev. B 108, 235172, 2023) on microscopic calculation of shear viscosity for electron fluid in graphene system. Our calculation is based on the kinetic theory approach in the relaxation time approximation. In the absence of magnetic field, transport is governed by a single shear viscosity coefficient, whereas the application of a finite magnetic field induces anisotropy, give rise to the five independent shear viscosity coefficients associated with distinct velocity gradient tensors. These coefficient can be physically categorized into perpendicular, parallel and Hall components relative to the magnetic field direction. When the scattering time equals to the cyclotron time, the perpendicular component is suppressed by 80% and parallel component by 50%, and Hall effect can reach maximum. Corresponding magnetic field strength for electron fluid in graphene is around 0.01-0.1 Tesla and the same for non-relativistic electron fluid and ultra-relativistic quark fluid are around 10 Tesla and 10^14 Tesla respectively. They may be considered as required magnetic field strength in three different fluid systems to observe noticeable magnetic field response in their shear viscosity coefficients.

Result: The probe gives universal values linked to the chiral central charge.

Conclusion: This probe offers a new tool for probing entanglement structure in 2D systems.

Abstract: We propose a ground state entanglement probe for gapped, two-dimensional quantum many-body systems that involves taking powers of reduced density matrices in a particular geometric configuration. This quantity, which we denote by $ω_{α,β}$, is parameterized by two positive real numbers $α, β$, and can be seen as a ``Rényi-like" generalization of the modular commutator -- another entanglement probe proposed as a way to compute the chiral central charge from a bulk wave function. We obtain analytic expressions for $ω_{α,β}$ for gapped ground states of non-interacting fermion Hamiltonians as well as ground states of string-net models. In both cases, we find that $ω_{α,β}$ takes a universal value related to the chiral central charge. For integer values of $α$ and $β$, our quantity $ω_{α,β}$ can be expressed as an expectation value of permutation operators acting on an appropriate replica system, providing a natural route to measuring $ω_{α,β}$ in numerical simulations and potentially, experiments.
