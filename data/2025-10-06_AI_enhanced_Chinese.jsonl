In the former case it is illustrated by means of two-dimensional plots\nof the scattering angle and of the number of bounces. We draw similar patterns\nfor the quantum differential cross section for various geometries of the disks.\nWe find that the eigenvalues of the S-matrix are distributed according to the\nCircular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE) in random matrix theory (RMT), provided the\nsetup be asymmetric and the wave-number be large enough. We then consider the\nelectric potential associated with charges randomly located on a plane as a toy\nmodel that generalizes the scattering from a leaky torus. We propose several\nmethods to analyze the spacings between the extrema of this function. We show\nthat these follow a repulsive Gaussian beta-ensemble distribution even for\nPoisson-distributed positions of the charges. A generalization of the spectral\nform factor is introduced and determined. We apply these methods to the case of\na chaotic S-matrix and of the quantum pinball scattering.

Plasmid DNA is a popular choice of nucleic acid for cell\nengineering due to its low cost and stability. However, plasmid DNA must\nsurvive the protective mechanisms present in the cell's cytoplasm to enter the\nnucleus for translation. Many of the existing methods for nucleic acid\ndelivery, such as chemical-based and virus-based delivery, suffer from\ndrawbacks induced by the nucleic acid carrier itself. Mechanical methods\npresent an alternative to nucleic acid carriers by physically producing\nopenings in the cell to deliver cargos. However, in most systems, the cell\nmembrane openings are too small to deliver large cargos, or the poration\nprocess leads to low cell viability. In this study, we present a microfluidic\ndevice with integrated high aspect ratio nanostructures that repeatably rupture\nthe cell membrane and nuclear envelope. These sharp-tipped nanolancets\npenetrate the cell deep enough to allow direct delivery of cargos into the\nnucleus, but still allow for cell recovery after treatment. We show the\ndevice's ability to deliver cargo to a variety of cell types while maintaining\nhigh viability. Then, we demonstrate the rapid onset of plasmid DNA expression\nthat results from direct nuclear delivery of naked DNA, showing expression\nspeeds comparable to microinjection, but with significantly greater throughput.\nWe envision the use of this device as a tool to quickly produce high quantities\nof genetically engineered cells to treat a myriad of diseases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These exotic phases, marked by the\nabsence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized\nexcitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the\nKitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in\nthe form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian\nstatistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due\nto their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence.\nDespite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of\nQSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their\ndefining properties.

By establishing a simplified power\nmodel, the study calculates the optimal kinematic parameters corresponding to\nthe minimum mechanical power requirements under two extreme conditions: no\nelastic energy storage and complete elastic energy storage. These optimal\nparameters are then compared with measured data from various small flying\nanimals. The results show that the measured parameters of hummingbirds,\nladybugs, and rhinoceros beetles are close to the no-storage optimum,\nindicating relatively weak elastic energy storage capacity; whereas hoverflies,\nbumblebees, and honeybees align closely with the complete-storage optimum,\nsuggesting strong elastic energy storage ability.

These models are often coupled to conformal\nscalar fields, which capture essential quantum effects such as the trace\nanomaly, while remaining analytically tractable. From the viewpoint of\ntwo-dimensional quantum field theory, unitary theories require a positive\ncentral charge. However, theories with a total negative central charge\nnaturally arise from the contribution of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to the\neffective action. Recent analyses of the Callan-Giddins-Harvey-Strominger\n(CGHS) model with a Russo-Susskin-Thorlacius (RST) counterterm have shown that\na negative central charge can remove curvature singularities in the backreacted\ngeometry.

Mutual information, including R\\'enyi Mutual Information (RMI), is a key tool for characterizing correlations in these systems. However, the computational cost of calculating RMI often makes it impractical for large-scale simulations, particularly for lattice models. This paper addresses the critical issue of whether different variants of RMI can reliably capture the long-wavelength physics or are predominantly influenced by short-range (UV) effects, which is crucial for performing accurate lattice simulations. By analyzing specific models like massless free fermions and the transverse field Ising model, the research aims to provide insights into the applicability of RMI in numerical computations for quantum many-body physics.

First, the theoretical framework is established by examining the properties of R\\'enyi mutual information in the context of conformal field theory (CFT), which describes the long-wavelength behavior of critical systems. The study then leverages numerical methods, specifically Matrix Product State (MPS) techniques, to perform calculations on the transverse field Ising model (TFIM), a lattice model known for its phase transition and critical behavior. By comparing analytical predictions with numerical results obtained from MPS calculations, the researchers can validate the theoretical findings and assess the impact of lattice effects across different parameter regions in the \u03b1-z plane. The Julia package QMICalc.jl is also developed as an open-source tool to facilitate the computation and analysis of RMI for researchers.", "result": "The study reveals that lattice effects significantly influence R\\'enyi mutual information in certain regions of the \u03b1-z parameter space. Specifically, for massless free fermions, the R\\'enyi mutual information shows distinct corrections due to the lattice structure depending on the values of \u03b1 and z. Similarly, MPS calculations on the TFIM confirm that lattice artifacts can either dominate or be negligible in different regions of the \u03b1-z plane. These findings provide a clear understanding of when R\\'enyi mutual information can be trusted to capture long-wavelength physics or when its lattice corrections must be carefully considered. The open-source Julia package QMICalc.jl further supports practical implementation and application of these methods in quantum many-body physics research.", "conclusion": "This paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of R\\'enyi mutual information in quantum many-body systems by systematically analyzing its behavior in the presence of lattice effects. The identification of regions where lattice corrections are relevant or irrelevant enhances the applicability of RMI in numerical computations. The provided Julia package QMICalc.jl empowers researchers to apply these methods effectively. The study not only advances theoretical knowledge but also provides practical tools and insights that can be used in future research on quantum many-body systems."}}

In this\nsetting, the $U(1)$-generating Killing field, assumed to exist in Kaluza-Klein\ntheory, undergoes a transition in its causal character, from spacelike in the\nglobally hyperbolic region to timelike in an acausal extension through a\nhorizon.

Here, we summarize the setup of a high-resolution general\nrelativistic hydrodynamics simulation of an equal-mass NSBH system performed\nentirely with public codes (Einstein Toolkit and FUKA) and a finite-temperature\nequation of state. The results we show include the $(\\ell,m)=(2,2)$ strain and\n2D snapshots of the system undergoing tidal disruption and early postmerger\ndisk formation. The system evolved for $\\sim 4$ orbits while the $L_2$ norm of\nthe Hamiltonian constraint remained below $6\\times10^{-7}$ throughout the\ninspiral prior to growing near merger time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5ba2\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u540e\u7eed\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Einstein Toolkit\u548cFUKA\u516c\u5f00\u5c55\u793a\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5bf9\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u548c2D\u56fe\u50cf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u5408\u5e76\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e16\u4ee3\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u548c\u5343atatou\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In all cases the large power\ndifference between classical and quantum channels presents challenges for such\nschemes, as the classical signals generate interfering noise that corrupts the\nquantum signal. In this work, we discuss the main interference mechanisms in\ncoexistence scenarios and provide a model to quantify their impact on the\nquantum signal quality. Analytical approximations in the model allow accurate\nand fast numerical solutions in the millisecond time-scale. The model accounts\nfor out-of-band non-linear interference effects, namely spontaneous Raman\nscattering (SpRS) and four-wave-mixing (FWM) in both cases of single-mode and\nSDM fibers with weakly-coupled degenerate mode groups. Rayleigh and SpRS\nbackscattering are considered in counter-propagating scenarios. Since broadband\nclassical transmission is targeted, the model also accounts for the effect of\nstimulated Raman scattering (SRS)-induced power tilt. Use of the model in\nsample scenarios indicates that the interference noise power is minimized at\nthe high end of the transmission band in both cases were the quantum is co- and\ncounter-propagating with respect to the classical signals, with a preference of\none or the other scheme depending on the link length and quantum signal center\nfrequency. Our model reveals that FWM has negligible impact in\ncounter-propagating schemes, but can be relevant in co-propagating schemes\nunder certain scenarios. Nevertheless, the FWM interference can be mitigated by\ndeallocating the classical signals adjacent to the quantum channel.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our main\ntechnical result shows that when the transition matrix of a graph associated\nwith a codebook has a large spectral gap, the channel output induced by\nuniformly sampled codewords is asymptotically indistinguishable from the target\noutput distribution, independently of the channel. This establishes the first\ndeterministic, channel-independent construction of resolvability codebooks.\n  Building on this, we construct a fully universal private channel coding\nprotocol by combining it with universal c-q channel coding based on the\nSchur-Weyl duality. With appropriate modifications to the requirements on\ncodebooks of universal c-q channel coding, we show that our fully universal\nprivate channel coding achieves the known optimal rate. This work thus sheds\nnew light on the expander property of a graph in the context of secure\ncommunication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6784\u9020\u7ecf\u5178\u91cf\u5b50\uff08c-q\uff09\u901a\u9053\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c55\u5f00\u56fe\u7684\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u534f\u8bae\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u7126\u70b9\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u7684Schr\u00f6inger\u56fe\u7684\u8c31\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e4c\u5c14\u65bd-\u97e6\u4f0a\u5c14\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u7528\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u7ecf\u5178\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u90fd\u9002\u7528\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u56fe\u8bba\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this work, we consider a\nvariant called cheat-penalised weak coin-flipping in which if a party gets\ncaught cheating, they lose $\\Lambda$ points (compared to $0$ in the standard\ndefinition). We find that already for a small cheating penalty, the landscape\nof coin-flipping changes dramatically. For example, with $\\Lambda=0.01$, we\nexhibit a protocol where neither Alice nor Bob can bias the result in their\nfavour beyond $1/2 + 10^{-8}$, which uses $24$ qubits and $10^{16}$ rounds of\ncommunication (provably $10^{7}$ times better than any weak coin-flipping\nprotocol with matching security). For the same space requirements, we\ndemonstrate how one can choose between lowering how much a malicious party can\nbias the result (down to $1/2 + 10^{-10}$) and reducing the rounds of\ncommunication (down to $25,180$), depending on what is preferred. To find these\nprotocols, we make two technical contributions. First, we extend the point\ngame-protocol correspondence introduced by Kitaev and Mochon, to incorporate:\n(i) approximate point games, (ii) the cheat-penalised setting, and (iii) round\nand space complexity. Second, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge)\nnumerical algorithm for constructing (approximate) point games that correspond\nto high security and low complexity.

We show that the absence of\nthis objectivity has a quantum advantage in cryptography and also provides the\ncrucial missing link in efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits with\nzero discord. For this purpose, we consider a model of mixed state quantum\ncomputation where one is promised concordant states at all stages of the\nquantum circuit. A concordant quantum state has zero discord with respect to\nany part and there exists a basis made up of a tensor product of orthonormal\nlocal subsystem basis in which the density matrix is diagonal. Efficient\nclassical simulation of concordant computation has surprisingly been an\noutstanding question in quantum information theory. We argue that a key\ningredient of an efficient classical simulation algorithm, a knowledge of the\nlocal basis in which the multi-party state is diagonal, is made available by\nquantum Darwinism. Concordant states in the absence of quantum Darwinism cannot\nbe efficiently simulated by existing methods and give a cryptographic advantage\nin communication. We show this by giving a protocol for secure quantum\ncommunication that exploits this insight. Our work also has implications for\nthe quantum-classical border and we discuss how objectivity emerging out of\nDarwinism demarcates this border in three ways - empirical based on our\nobservations and experience of objectivity, information theoretic due to the\nabsence of any quantum correlations and lastly computational in the sense\ndiscussed above.
