We show that one of the fundamental reasons is the disciplinarity itself: the disciplines deal with a limited set of quantities. This way some 'outlaw' quantities are not measured and the discipline does not have laws about them. All laws of science are based on approximations and the approximations must be different for inanimate and life sciences. Studying ions is special because ions belong simultaneously to thermodynamics and electricity, but neither of those disciplines alone can describe biological processes. One needs a cross-disciplinary discussion and maybe a new scientific discipline. We provide a method for handling the different interaction speeds characterizing the ion transport. Electrolytes in living matter introduce further peculiarities with their closed volumes, internal structure, and slow processes. Their meticulous analysis led to the appropriate approximations, leading to the correct scientific description. As a success story, the cross-disciplinary theory of neuronal operation has been developed."}

But a comprehensive theoretical research on both of them remains to be performed. This work aims to investigate important algebraic properties of generalized Bell states as well as explore topological features of quantum teleportation. First, the basis theorem and basis group are introduced to explain that the extension of a generalized Bell basis by a unitary matrix is still an orthonormal basis. Then a twist operator is defined to make a connection between a generalized multiple qubit Bell state and a tensor product of two qubit Bell state. Besides them, the Temperley--Lieb algebra, the braid group relation and the Yang--Baxter equation are used to provide a topological diagrammatic description of generalized Bell states and quantum teleportation. It turns out that our approach is able to present a clear illustration of relevant quantum information protocols and exhibit a topological nature of quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation."}

All figures and tables can be found at http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/TAU-24-002 (CMS Public Pages)", "summary": "The trigger system of the CMS detector is pivotal in the acquisition of data for physics measurements and searches. Studies of final states characterized by hadronic decays of tau leptons require the reconstruction and the identification of genuine tau leptons against quark- and gluon-initiated jets at the trigger level. This is a difficult task, particularly as improvements to the LHC have resulted in an increased number of interactions per bunch crossing in recent years. To address this challenge, a series of machine-learning algorithms with high identification efficiency and low computational cost have been incorporated into the high-level trigger for hadronically decaying tau leptons. In this paper, these developments and the trigger performance are summarized using data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV in 2022$-$2023, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 62 fb$^{-1}$."}

Using crossing symmetry and the consistency of the operator product expansion in the dual CFT, we explicitly construct the one-loop contribution to the correlator at order $1/c^2$, both in position space and in Mellin space. We show that a strong form of the bootstrap equations imposes constraints on the value of $n$. Remarkably, we find that our bootstrap approach uniquely determines $n=21$, which corresponds to the spectrum of IIB string theory compactified on K3. This stands in sharp contrast to the tree-level correlator for which $n$ is unconstrained. We also analyse the spectrum of unprotected double-trace operators and solve the mixing problem in the first case that involves both tensor and graviton correlators. When $n=21$, the anomalous dimensions rationalise and one of them vanishes. Lastly, we study the flat-space limit of the correlator and find perfect agreement with the one-loop amplitude recently obtained in [arXiv:2510.24558]."}

As a consequence, it is not only a solution in General Relativity, but also in Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theories for all coupling constants. The specific case of Entangled Relativity is noteworthy because the additional scalar degree of freedom is defined from the ratio between $R$ and $\\mathcal{L}_m$, which is ill-defined in this situation. In the present work, we embed the Mineur--Vaidya solution in a magnetic (or electric) field within the framework of Entangled Relativity, and show that the Mineur--Vaidya solution corresponds to the limit where the magnetic (respectively, electric) field vanishes. This notably allows us to demonstrate that, as in General Relativity, it is possible to dynamically form naked singularities in Entangled Relativity. This conclusion, in fact, applies to any Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theory, although it does not seem to be widely acknowledged in the literature."}
