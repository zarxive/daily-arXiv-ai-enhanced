While the effect of this strong coupling on light has been extensively studied, its impact on matter remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate photothermal energy harvesting using strong light-matter interactions in high-quality-factor metasurfaces. First, we show that maximum metasurface temperatures can differ by $90^\\circ C$ based on the spectral excitation pathway: direct excitation of the metasurface from its nominal equilibrium by a single wavelength results in lower metasurface temperatures compared to continuous spectral scans. Investigating the temporal dynamics of this thermo-optic nonlinearity, we show an initial linear rise to a critical temperature over $~10s$ of seconds, followed by a rapid rise to the high temperature steady state in $~33ms$ around the bistable transition point. This linear rise time increases sharply around the bistable transition point. Most significantly, we show emergence of a Q-factor-dependent temperature band splitting and energy gap of around $60^\\circ C$ between the critical temperature and the high temperature steady state of the metasurface under single wavelength illumination. This forbidden equilibrium temperature band signifies that the high temperature steady state of the metasurface resonance after transitioning across the laser wavelength is further away from its nominal resonance than its linewidth. Interestingly, hyperspectrally accumulated nonlinearities from prior wavelengths effectively dope the metasurface with optical states within this bandgap.

These dysprosium nuclei have non-zero nuclear spin and dynamical octupole deformation, which gives them high sensitivity to time-reversal-violating new physics via the nuclear Schiff moment (NSM). The DyO molecule was recently identified as being amenable to optical cycling -- the basis for many laser cooling and quantum control techniques -- which makes it a practical candidate for NSM searches. The measurements reported here are prerequisites to implementing optical cycling, designing precision measurement protocols, and benchmarking calculations of molecular sensitivity to symmetry-violating effects. The measured hyperfine parameters are interpreted using simple molecular orbital diagrams and show excellent agreement with relativistic quantum chemical calculations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The approach yields a set of interpretable and transferable effective low-energy models for the lowest few sub-bands up to fifth order for experimentally relevant growth directions. In particular, we are able to resolve higher order cross terms e.g., the dependency of the effective mass on the magnetic field. Our study reveals orbital inversions of the lowest sub-bands for low-symmetry growth directions, leading to significant changes of the lower order effective coefficients. We demonstrate a reduction of the direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction due to competing symmetry effects for low-symmetry growth directions. Finally, we find that the effective mass of the confined holes can diverge yielding quasi flat bands interesting for correlated states.

Here, a D3h-symmetric B80 bilayer structure has been proposed using density functional theory calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the bilayer structure maintain its structural integrity up to 1400 K, indicating superior thermodynamic stability compared to previously known B80 configurations, including the B80 buckyball and volleyball-like structures. Vibrational frequency analysis confirms its kinetic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveals a HOMO-LUMO gap of 0.72 eV and pronounced aromaticity, further supported by a nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS(0)) value of -44.3 ppm in the interlayer B-B bonds. The simulated photoelectron spectrum of the B80- bilayer reproduces key experimental features, with vertical detachment energies agreeing with experimental peaks within 0.04 eV.

We then show their usefulness in the framework of the nonlinear Nobre--Reigo-Monteiro--Tsallis (NRT) nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. More precisely, we employ them to analyze a family of ordinary differential equations which includes the Lorentzian solutions of the NRT-nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a constant potential. Moreover, an explicit expression for the Lorentzian solitary wave solutions is given, for any real value of the non-linearity parameter q, in terms of a transformation depending on q applied to the classical Lorentzian solution with q = 1, i.e., we succeed in encapsulating the whole nonlinear behavior in the new transformations. In addition, the composition of this transformation with its inverse (with different parameters) allows us to perform a shift in the nonlinearity parameter q. Moreover, a certain subfamily of our generalized transformations, which perform a shift on the non-linearity parameter q of the Lorentzian solutions, is found to have a group structure.

This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the \"more is better\" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance.

However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We will also discuss the monitoring of the h(t) strain reconstruction during the run showing that, on the 10 Hz to 2 kHz band, the reconstructed strain achieves a precision of 2% in modulus and 30 mrad in phase. Special emphasis will be given on the newly developed frequency-dependent bias and uncertainty computation method and the resulting online unbiasing of the h(t) strain.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the calibration steps for the Virgo interferometer during the O4b run, focusing on precise calibration of the mirror displacement and monitoring of strain reconstruction accuracy.

In this work, we examine the validity of this law for static, spherically symmetric charged black holes in the pure Lovelock theory of gravity. By studying infinitesimal variations in mass and charge, we derive a set of inequalities that constrain these variations. Our analysis shows that as the surface gravity approaches zero ($\u03ba\\to 0$), the range of admissible perturbations gradually diminishes, thereby forbidding the attainment of extremality through any finite classical process. The saturation of the inequality is interpreted as the emergence of a dynamical barrier near extremality, which prevents further evolution toward the extremal configuration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7eaf\u6d1b\u592b\u5947\u514b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u7535\u8377\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5b58\u5728\u4f8b\u5916\u3002'<br/>motivation: \u63a2\u8ba8\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u5e76 Love\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b Process\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u672a\u77e5\u9886\u57df\u3002'<br/>method: \u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u9650\u5c0f\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7535\u8377\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7ea6\u675f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\u65f6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8303\u56f4\u9010\u6e10\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u7981\u6b62\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6781\u503c\u72b6\u6001\u3002'<br/>result: \u6458\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5728\u7eaf\u6d1b\u592b\u5947\u514b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u7535\u8377\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5931\u6548\u3002'<br/>conclusion: \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5728\u7eaf\u6d1b\u592b\u5947\u514b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7b2c\u4e09\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4f53 mp-106 he \u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u6781\u503c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002<br/>", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7eaf\u6d1b\u592b\u5947\u514b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u7535\u8377\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5931\u6548\u4e86\u5417\uff1f\u601d\u8003\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u98a0\u8986\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u786e\u8ba4\u6b64\u731c\u60f3\u7684\u6210\u7acb\u3002'<br/>", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u7535\u8377\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u548c\u7535\u8377\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u6211\u8fd8\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\u65f6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002'<br/>", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u6771\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7ec4\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u5f53\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\u65f6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8303\u56f4\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fbe\u5230\u6781\u503c\u72b6\u6001\u3002'<br/>", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5728\u7eaf\u6d1b\u592b\u5947\u514b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u7535\u8377\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9650\u63a5\u8fd1\u6781\u503c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u60c5\u51b5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002'<br/>"}}

The calculated photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) show two different offset angles corresponding to ionization events occurring in the first and the second half cycles of one laser cycle. When the larger angle is greater than the angle of a model symmetric molecule with a similar ionization potential to the polar molecule, the smaller angle is smaller than the symmetric molecule. Using a developed strong-field model that consider effects of both the permanent dipole (PD) and the asymmetric Coulomb potential, we are able to quantitatively reproduce these phenomena. We show that the PD effect can increase (decrease) the response time of electrons within polar molecules to light in photoemission, thereby increasing (decreasing) the offset angle related to the first (second) half cycle of a laser cycle. The laser-dressed asymmetric Coulomb potential near the atomic nuclei also plays an important role in the sub-cycle-related response time and offset angle. This model may be useful for quantitatively studying attosecond ionization dynamics of polar molecules in strong laser fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86HeH+\u5728\u5f3a\u692d\u5706\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u88ab\u7535\u79bb\u7684\u7a7f\u96a7\u9053\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u52a8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6fc0\u5149\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7b2c\u4e00\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u534a\u5468\u671f\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u8f83\u5927\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u987b\u5927\u4e8e\u7b49\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u52bf\u65f6\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u89d2\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e8e\u8be5\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u7535\u79bb\u52bf\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8003\u8651\u6c38\u4e45\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e93\u4ed1\u52bf\u7684\u5f3a\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9a\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6c38\u4e45\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u539f\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u7b2c\u4e00\u534a\u5468\u671f\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u534a\u5468\u671f\u5cf0\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u504f\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u6838\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u8131\u51fa\u81f4\u5bc6\u52bf\u4e5f\u5728\u5b50\u5468\u671f\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u504f\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e2d\u8d77\u5230\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u7a7f\u96a7\u9053\u7535\u79bb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u5f3a\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u88ab\u7535\u79bb\u7684\u7a7f\u96a7\u9053\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76HeH+\u5728\u5f3a\u692d\u5706\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u88ab\u7535\u79bb\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6c38\u4e45\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e93\u4ed1\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u5149\u8131\u51fa\u52bf\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5b9a\u91cf\u8fd8\u539f\u504f\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "HeH+\u5728\u5f3a\u692d\u5706\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u88ab\u7535\u79bb\u7684\u7a7f\u96a7\u9053\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5b50\u5468\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6c38\u4e45\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u548c\u6838\u9644\u8fd1\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e93\u4ed1\u52bf\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u504f\u79fb\u89d2\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u534a\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5173\u4e8e\u5f3a\u692d\u5706\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u4e2dHeH+\u88ab\u7535\u79bb\u7684\u7a7f\u96a7\u9053\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f3a\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u504f\u79fb\u89d2\u7684\u5b50\u5468\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u79bb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Their weakly bound states serve as ideal test cases for studying Efimov physics and the emergence of universality beyond the three-body sector. In this work, we investigate few-$^4$He systems within a finite-cutoff effective field theory (EFT) framework. The EFT interactions are calibrated to reproduce low-energy observables obtained from the realistic LM2M2 potential, enabling a direct and systematic comparison between the two approaches. We demonstrate that, for suitably chosen finite cutoffs, the empirical effective range is accurately reproduced already at leading order, achieving next-to-leading-order precision without explicit higher-order corrections. Using these interactions, we solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for systems of a few atoms, obtaining binding energies and scattering observables in excellent agreement with results derived from realistic interatomic potentials. In particular, we compute atom--tetramer scattering parameters and binding energies of clusters up to eight atoms, thereby extending the EFT description to larger helium systems.

As a direct consequence of causality, the retarded Green's function and absorption amplitude are analytic in the upper-half plane. We show, however, that Stokes phenomena can obstruct this analyticity domain from carrying over to the elastic amplitude, which instead develops a branch-cut in the upper-half plane.

For the wave functions in the adelic Grassmannian $Gr^{ad}$, the bispectral involution which exchanges the role of $x$ and $z$ implies also the existence of an ``$x$-adjoint wave function'' $\u03c8^{\\star}(x,z)$ so that the product of the wave function, the $x$-adjoint, and the Hermite weight $e^{-x^2/2}$ has no residue. Utilizing this, we show that the sequences of coefficient functions in the power series expansion of any KP wave function in $Gr^{ad}$ and its image under the bispectral involution at $t_2=-1/2$ are always ``almost bi-orthogonal'' with respect to the Hermite product. Whether the sequences have the stronger properties of being (almost) orthogonal can be determined easily in terms of KP flows and the bispectral involution. As a special case, the Exceptional Hermite Orthogonal Polynomials can be recovered in this way. This provides both a generalization of and an explanation of the fact that the generating functions of the Exceptional Hermites are certain special wave functions of the KP Hierarchy. In addition, one new surprise is that the same KP Wave Function which generates the sequences of functions is also a generating function for the norms when evaluated at $t_1=1$ and $t_2=0$. The main results are proved using Calogero-Moser matrices satisfying a rank one condition. The same results also apply in the case of ``spin-generalized'' Calogero-Moser matrices, which produce instances of matrix orthogonality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86KP\u5206\u5f0f\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u4f34\u968f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f34\u968f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u54c8\u6885\u5c14\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3KP\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u54c8\u6885\u5c14\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86KP\u5c42\u6b21\u4e2d\u4f34\u968f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u5176\u4e0e\u54c8\u6885\u5c14\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3KP\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76Calogero-Moser\u77e9\u9635\u6ee1\u8db3\u79e9\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f34\u968f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f34\u968f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u4e0e\u54c8\u6885\u5c14\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u540c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u6d41\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u8fd8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86KP\u5206\u5f0f\u5c42\u6b21\u4e2d\u4f34\u968f\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5Calogero-Moser\u77e9\u9635\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u54c8\u6885\u5c14\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Electrochemical modeling has had advanced across empirical, analytical, numerical, and data-driven paradigms. Data-driven machine learning and physics based electrochemical modeling, however, have not been explicitly linked. Here we introduce Differentiable Electrochemistry, a mew paradigm in electrochemical modeling that integrates thermodynamics, kinetics and mass transport with differentiable programming enabled by automatic differentiation. By making the entire electrochemical simulation end-to-end differentiable, this framework enables gradient-based optimization for mechanistic discovery from experimental and simulation data, achieving approximately one to two orders of improvement over gradient-free methods. We develop a rich repository of differentiable simulators across diverse mechanisms, and apply Differentiable Electrochemistry to bottleneck problems in kinetic analysis. Specifically, Differentiable Electrochemistry advances beyond Tafel and Nicholson method by removing several limitations including Tafel region selection, and identifies the electron transfer mechanism in Li metal electrodeposition/stripping by parameterizing the full Marcus-Hush-Chidsey formalism. In addition, Differentiable Electrochemistry interprets Operando X-ray measurements in concentrated electrolyte by coupling concentration and velocity theories.

Therefore, one can attribute the origin of wings in the phase space due to energy like Nambu surfaces, giving a geometrical interpretation.

Here, we demonstrate an all-optical Joule-Thomson expansion process mediated by photon-photon interactions whereby the temperature of the optical gas drops abruptly to zero. Our experiments in various configurations of coupled multicore nonlinear waveguide arrangements illustrate how light undergoing expansion-induced cooling can be channelled from arbitrary input states into the fundamental mode with near-unity efficiency. We show that the stability of the post-expansion state is ensured through an irreversible process of energy conversion. The all-optical thermodynamic phenomena explored in this study may enable innovative techniques where various uncorrelated but identical sources are merged into a unified spatially coherent state, offering a route for direct beam combining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u5149\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u529f\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u5149-\u5149\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edd\u5531\u96f6\u5ea6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5149-\u5149\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u96f6\u5ea6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8 coupling\u591a\u6838\u5fc3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5149\u5c55\u5f00\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b7\u5374\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u6362\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5149\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u81f3\u57fa\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edd\u5531\u96f6\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u5149\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u5149\u675f\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5149-\u5149\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u5149\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This paper presents a feasibility study for the use of CE$\u03bd$NS superconducting detectors to find trafficked radiological materials.

Using tunnelling spectroscopy, we observe signatures of vibron-assisted tunnelling on an Fe impurity in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Notably, simultaneous shot-noise measurements at the centre of the vibrating impurity reveal super-Poissonian noise. In the absence of alternative sources of super-Poissonian noise, this implies vibronic-coupling-induced bunching of electrons during the tunnelling process through the impurity, as theoretically predicted decades ago.

Recently, a composite force sensor based on UCNPs embedded in a polystyrene microbead enabled the first real time measurement of feeding forces in living nematodes. However, the comparatively large stiffness of polystyrene only makes it relevant to biomedical application in a small subset of biological tissue. To facilitate deployment of UCNPs into biological tissues with a range of mechanical properties, we expand upon polymer UCNP composite systems by embedding UCNPs in three polymer matrices with varying stiffnesses (epoxy resin, polydimethylsiloxane, and alginate hydrogels). Furthermore, to enhance these composites mechanosensitivity, we methodically investigate using two different core-shell architectures of SrLuF based UCNPs doped with ytterbium, erbium, and varying manganese concentrations. We calibrate polymer UCNP composite optical force sensitivity with colocalized atomic force and confocal microscopy. Using the red to green emission ratio (Delta Percent IRed:IGreen) as the force read-out, we determine that SrLuF:Yb0.28Er0.025Mn0.013 with SrYF inert shell dispersed in epoxy resin exhibits the greatest emission color change (12 Delta Percent IRed:IGreen per microNewton). Finally, we map forces in the epoxy UCNP composite on the macroscale between the joint of a chicken wing bone using a commercially available wide field microscope, thereby demonstrating its ability to optically measure pressures in situ.

However, practical training of such models remains challenging, as gradient evaluation via the parameter-shift rule scales linearly with the number of parameters and requires repeated expectation-value estimation under finite-shot noise. We introduce a training framework that extends the principle of contrastive divergence to quantum models. By deriving the circuit structure and providing a general recipe for constructing it, we obtain quantum circuits that generate the samples required for parameter updates, yielding constant scaling with respect to the cost of a forward pass, analogous to backpropagation in classical neural networks. Numerical results demonstrate that it attains comparable accuracy to likelihood-based optimization while requiring substantially fewer samples. The framework thereby establishes a scalable route to training expressive quantum generative models directly on quantum hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6563\u5ea6\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4e0e\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f3c\u7136\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6563\u5ea6\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 Circuit \u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc Circuit \u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u98df\u8c31\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6210\u672c\u5448\u73b0\u5e38\u6570\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6563\u5ea6\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Directional emissions at $2.34\\,\u03bc$m in the forward direction and $2.21\\,\u03bc$m in both forward and backward directions under different experimental parameters are considered for this study. The measured values of $g^{(2)}(0)$ in all cases are found to exceed unity, while remaining significantly below the thermal light limit of 2. Cross-correlation measurements reveal that forward- and backward-propagating $2.21\\,\u03bc$m radiations are correlated. Oscillatory features in $g^{(2)}(\u03c4)$ are observed over a broad range of excitation powers, and the dependence of the oscillation frequency on laser power can be attributed to AC Stark shifts, with contributions from hyperfine atomic structure in selected atomic velocity groups even in the presence of Doppler broadening. Our study establishes that the observed mid-infrared emission arises from a phase-matched, continuous-wave cooperative process that combines features of lasing and collective amplified spontaneous emission. The results highlight the buildup of long-range dipole coherence and velocity-selective coupling of atomic groups, which together govern the observed photon correlations and forward-backward emission symmetry.

Part 2. Oxygen", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding O2 bubble nucleation and growth during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to comprehend their influences on catalytically active sites in the process. To achieve this goal, mapping the spatial variation of nanoscale dynamic individual steps at the electrocatalytic interfaces is vital, as it further enables a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the process. Here, we combined tapping mode AFM imaging with a Pt ultramicroelectrode to investigate oxygen bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment. Our AFM feedback error signal and topography data reveal that bubbles of O2 gas nucleate at the step edge sites and interact with the catalytically active sites. This interaction between primary catalytic sites and bubble nucleation sites is the primary reason for a decrease in the current density at a given high overpotential of the OER.

We present Socrates-Mol, a framework that transforms language models into empirical Bayesian reasoners through context engineering, addressing cold start problems without model fine-tuning. The system implements a reflective-prediction cycle where initial outputs serve as priors, retrieved molecular cases provide evidence, and refined predictions form posteriors, extracting reusable chemical rules from sparse data. We introduce ranking tasks aligned with industrial screening priorities and employ cross-model self-consistency across five language models to reduce variance. Experiments on amine solvent LogP prediction reveal task-dependent patterns: regression achieves 72% MAE reduction and 112% R-squared improvement through self-consistency, while ranking tasks show limited gains due to systematic multi-model biases.

Reformulating its dynamics in terms of effective parameters $k_r$ and $k_\u03b8$, we analytically show exact periodicity of the Floquet operator for $k_r = j\u03c0/2$ and $k_r = j\u03c0/4$ with distinct periods for integer and half-odd integer $j$. These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_\u03b8$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = j\u03c0/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_\u03b8= \\pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_\u03b8= 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $j\u03c0/2$. Our work demonstrates that regular and chaotic regimes can be controlled for any system size by tuning $k_r$ and $k_\u03b8$, making the DKT a useful platform for quantum control and information processing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this study, the synthesis of 2D phlogopite (magnesium-rich mica) via liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) is reported using an efficient and scalable procedure. XRD structural analysis revealed a preferential orientation along the (033) plane, whereas AFM and SEM demonstrated a nanoscale thickness and homogeneous morphology. Optical characterisation by UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy shows tuneable band gaps up to 4.52 eV for the exfoliated 2D phlogopite and distinct vibrational modes indicative of structural evolution. At intense laser conditions, three-photon saturable absorption (3PSA) behaviour was evidenced by light-modulated electrical property studies, which emphasise the potential for optical limiting, switching, and mode-locking applications.

The pixels serve as a unit cell of an active pixel sensor to achieve a high level of parallelization and fast readout.

Starting from a scalar master equation corrected by a small fractional Laplacian term $(-\u0394)^{s}$ with $0<s<1$, we derive an analytic expression for the complex frequency shift at first order in the nonlocal coupling $\\varepsilon$. Evaluation of the fractional operator in both coordinate and momentum representations reveals a universal scaling law $\u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9\\propto \\varepsilon/M^{2s}$, largely independent of the field spin, with an additional $\\ell^{2s}$ enhancement in the eikonal regime $\\ell \\gg 1$. Applying the formalism to Schwarzschild, slowly rotating Kerr, Hayward regular, and LQG-corrected black holes, we demonstrate that the leading-order fractional QNM shift is universal, with geometric details entering only through overlap integrals of the mode functions.

This study develops and demonstrates a cubic photoelastic model that enables accurate fringe-order estimation from three orthogonal views, providing a foundation for reconstructing full three-dimensional stress states. A transparent, low-elasticity epoxy cube, free of prestress, was fabricated and examined using combined transmission and reflection photoelastic imaging. Three mutually orthogonal isochromatic fringe fields were recorded simultaneously under a single applied load. Image analysis employed a peak-valley intensity method to extract sub-fringe orders and to resolve low-stress cases with minimal noise. The cubic block produced high-quality fringe patterns in all directions, enabling separation of tangential and normal stress components. Independent orthogonal views confirmed directional sensitivity and yielded consistent fringe-order estimates under low loading, with response times on the order of tens of microseconds.

A modified form of the ET was proposed for this case, which includes an effective force originating from the interaction of the 1D quantum particle with the box edges. In this work, we derive an amended ET for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which includes the cubic nonlinear term, as well as for the 2D square-shaped potential box. In the latter case, we derive an amended COM equation of motion with an effective force exerted by the edges of the rectangular box, while the nonlinear term makes no direct contribution to the 1D and 2D versions of the ET. Nonetheless, the nonlinearity affects the amended ET through the edge-generated force. As a result, the nonlinearity of the underlying GPE can make the COM motion in the potential box irregular. The validity of the amended ET for the 1D and 2D GPEs with the respective potential boxes is confirmed by the comparison of numerical simulations of the underlying GPE and the corresponding amended COM equation of motion.

MXenes, such as Ti3C2Tx, are prime examples of 2D crystals often employed as thin networks of interconnected flakes deposited on substrates to realize functional devices. While a significant number of studies focused on transport in individual MXene flakes, inter-flake transport remains scarcely explored. Here, we demonstrate that charge transport in multi-flake conductive paths of Ti3C2Tx is dominated by interflake junctions and provide quantitative estimates of junction resistances. Scanning probe measurements reveal that in a MXene multi-flake conductive path, individual flakes behave as isopotential domains, since the voltage drop is localized precisely at the inter-flake junctions.

However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets.

The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \\href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}.

These interactions exert a pivotal influence on the optical response of a weak probe field and pave the way for novel applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of \u03c0/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift. These findings establish a direct correspondence between the PSHE and the underlying non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectrum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50-\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u78c1omechanics\uff08CMM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u611f\u77e5\u3001 avocado \u70b9\u6fc0\u53d1\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\u8f6c\u6362\u7b49\u7269\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 PT \u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 YIG \u9897\u7c92\u4e0e\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5fae\u6ce2\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u4e0e\u8154\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6ce2\u573a\u4e0e\u8154\u7684 x \u8f74\u5782\u76f4\u4e14\u8c03\u8c10\u8c03\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u4e09\u9636 avocado \u70b9 (EP3)\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206 PT \u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\uff08PSHE\uff09\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50-\u5149\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u6291\u5236\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8154\u4f53\u5185\u819c\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u672c\u5f81\u7279\u5f81\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u5728\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u78c1omechanics \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u4e0e\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u80fd\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027 avocado \u70b9\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u53cd\u5c04\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u548c YIG \u9897\u7c92\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u78c1\u5355\u6027\u6fc0\u53d1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8c03\u8c10\u8c03\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u9636 avocado \u70b9\u7684\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206 PT \u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u6ce2\u573a\u4e0e\u8154\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u3002\u5236\u4f5c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8154\u4f53\u5185\u819c\u957f\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6001\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u78c1omechanics \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u78c1\u5355\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u5149\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u9636 avocado \u70b9\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

The two bands interact via a hybridization term with spin-orbit coupling, which enables spin-flip processes. In the non-interacting limit, these profoundly alter the electronic structure, leading to the emergence of flat bands, van Hove singularities, and, most notably, Dirac cones within a single Kondo-Dirac semimetal order. The strongly interacting regime is explored via the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, in the absence of the sign problem, where we unveil a complete ground-state phase diagram revealing two distinct phases, the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase and a novel antiferromagnetic semimetal phase. Their characterization by the spectral functions establishes an orbital-selective Mott transition in the antiferromagnetic semimetal phase, marked by the opening of a gap exclusively in the $f$-orbital while Dirac cones persist in the $c$-orbital. Conversely, in the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase, both $c$- and $f$-orbitals sustain robust Dirac cones.

The mapping method builds on an entangling transformation of photonic and atomic degrees of freedom. By truncating the resulting cavity-dressed Hamiltonian (CDH) to successively larger excitation sectors, we construct a series of compact models that converge to the exact limit, outpacing conventional approaches even in the challenging resonant and ultrastrong light-matter regime. The mapping principle also applies to multimode cavities coupled to matter through noncommuting operators and to leaky cavities. We benchmark the CDH framework on the quantum Rabi model, demonstrating accurate spectral predictions in both weak and strong coupling regimes, together with converging ground-state and thermal observables. We study the Dicke-Heisenberg lattice model and determine its phase diagram under resonant and strong light-matter coupling, achieving significant computational savings over brute-force simulations and identifying cavity-mediated spin correlations both analytically and numerically. The closed-form and compactness of the CDH provide both physical insight and enhanced computational efficiency, facilitating studies of strongly coupled hybrid light-matter systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u6270\u52a8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u8154\uff09\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u5149\u2013\u7269\u8d28\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u62c9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u2013\u7269\u8d28\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5149\u573a\u7684\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u5b50\u80fd\u7ea7\u65f6\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea0\u7f20\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5149\u2013\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b21\u6269\u5c55\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u88c1\u526a\u540e\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u5f31\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u66f4\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u62c9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u2013\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u76f8\u4f4d\u56fe\u3001\u57fa\u6001\u53ca\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u7b49\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5149\u2013\u7269\u8d28\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

For repulsive interactions, our approach faithfully reproduces Abrikosov vortex lattices, achieving quantitative alignment with Thomas-Fermi theory and the Abrikosov constant, while underscoring the profound analogy between superfluid vortex ordering and Abrikosov lattices in type-II superconductors. In the attractive regime, we reveal that weak attractions sustain stable vortex arrays, whereas stronger attractions quench vortices, trigger radial contraction, and culminate in collapse at the Gagliardo-Nirenberg threshold. These findings deliver a cohesive numerical benchmark for vortex formation and collapse dynamics, forging a rigorous link between superfluidity and superconductivity in rotating quantum matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPU\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u6295\u5f71\u6700\u4f4e Landau \u7ea7\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u73af\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u65a5\u529b\u4e92\u4f5c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u4e8c\u5206\u0131\u751f\u963f\u6bd4\u79d1\u7d22\u592b\u73af\u8def\u683c\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6c64\u59c6\u65af-\u8d39\u7c73\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u963f\u6bd4\u79d1\u7d22\u592b\u5e38\u6570\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u73af\u91cf\u6709\u5e8f\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u73af\u8def\u4e4b\u95f4\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f31\u5f15\u529b\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u73af\u8def\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u5219\u89e6\u53d1\u5f84\u5411\u6536\u7f29\u548c\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728 Gagliardo-Nirenberg \u4e34\u754c\u503c\u5f15\u53d1\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u73af\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e25\u8c28\u5730\u94fe\u63a5\u4e86\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u73af\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u73af\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u573a guide \u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e GPU \u52a0\u901f\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6700\u4f4e Landau \u7ea7\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u73af\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u65a5\u529b\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u73af\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a1. \u5728\u65a5\u529b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u73af\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b26\u5408\u963f\u6bd4\u79d1\u7d22\u592b\u73af\u8def\u683c\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b2. \u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f31\u5f15\u529b\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u73af\u8def\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u5f15\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b3. \u65cb\u8f6c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u73af\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u73af\u8def\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7ec6\u5316\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u4e2d\u73af\u91cf\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u73af\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53-\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u73af\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u66f4\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

A series of these transducer pairs with varying diameters (and thus resonance frequency) and pitch separation (and thus coupling strength) are fabricated and measured. The work presented here models and quantifies the open-loop coupling between the MEMS transducer pairs and its dependence on pitch. Furthermore, a gain feedback loop is systematically applied to one of the device pair and the dynamics of the acoustically-coupled gain-loss system is investigated, and the formation of an exceptional-point or of an Hopf bifurcation is equally used to quantify the coupling coefficient.

Here, we introduce StoL, a diffusion model-based framework that enables rapid and knowledge-free generation of large molecular structures from small-molecule data. Remarkably, StoL assembles molecules in a LEGO-style fashion from scratch, without seeing the target molecules or any structures of comparable size during training. Given a SMILES input, it decomposes the molecule into chemically valid fragments, generates their 3D structures with a diffusion model trained on small molecules, and assembles them into diverse conformations.

These calculations are made on the basis of a wave-vector cut-off that is usually set at the Planck scale. Further, Weinberg's no-go theorem indicates that in the presence of translational invariance, local quantum field theories cannot produce a zero cosmological constant without fine-tuning. Various non-local theories have been constructed, starting from modifications to Einstein's equations, in order to `cancel' away the cosmological constant term. There is also a well-known theory, due to Coleman, that assumes one can compute a probability distribution function for baby universes connected by wormholes that has the most probable value of the constant to be zero under some assumptions. The current paper starts from a QFT in 4-dimensions, breaks translational invariance by confining the fields to a box and adds a marginal (in power-counting terms) non-linear, momentum-dependent term that dominates the dynamics produced by the quadratic terms in the high-energy limit. It immediately produces an equation for the wave-vector cutoff applicable to the theory - the equation is reminiscent of that from UV/IR mixing and it effectively lowers the cutoff massively for a box the size of the Universe. However, as will be shown, the wave-vector cutoff for a box relevant for regular particle physics experiments is much larger, in fact, the Planck scale, so there is no conflict with current experiments, including the Casimir effect. We consider several possibilities for these additional terms and conclude that only one is relevant to a low cut-off. We also make a connection to the recent DESI results.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper discusses a quantum field theory approach to solving the cosmological constant problem by introducing non-local terms that suppress the constant at low energies.

For any sentific questions or comments on this work, please contact mrsong@semi.ac.cn", "summary": "Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal $|C|>1$ flat bands can be viewed as color-entangled composites of $C$ lowest Landau levels, but in realistic moir\u00e9 systems non-ideal quantum geometry complicates this picture, leaving their stabilization mechanism incompletely understood. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a platform, we observe two FCIs joined by a continuous transition controlled by continuum model parameter $\u03ba$, arising from a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions. For $\u03ba$ below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable and effectively decomposes into two independent $C=1$ color sectors. Although the flat band is non-ideal, the resulting fractional phase is naturally accounted for by the non-chiral Halperin-(112) state with counterpropagating edge modes. Above the transition, the system enters a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this robustness, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: when the Bloch wave function is geometrically unstable, interactions dynamically split a non-ideal flat band into an ideal subcomponent that hosts the FCI and non-ideal remnants. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a \"color separator,\" explicitly visualizing the ideal subcomponent at the single-particle level. Together, these results establish two different routes by which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, expanding their viable parameter space and clarifying the interplay between geometry and topological order.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6241\u5e26\u4e2d\u5206\u6570Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u626d\u66f2\u5c42\u72b6\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u53cc\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6570Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u5782\u76f4\u78c1\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8272\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u5b50\u5e26\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6570Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6241\u5e26\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u6241\u5e26\u7531\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6027\u4f1a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6570Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6241\u5e26\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u6570Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8272\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u78c1\u611f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7406\u60f3\u5b50\u5e26\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bd5\u7ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u6781\u5c0f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u6570Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u6570Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8272\u5206\u79bb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6241\u5e26\u5bf9\u5206\u6570Chern\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u3002"}}

Here, we demonstrate ultrafast propagation of magnon-polaritons-hybrid quasiparticles arising from the coupling between spin waves and electromagnetic fields in thin pure, bismuth-, and gallium substituted yttrium iron garnet (YIG, Bi:YIG and Ga:YIG) films. Using time- and phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy and time-resolved scanning transmission microscopy, we show that magnon-polaritons can propagate faster than 100 km/s, nearly three orders of magnitude more than conventional spin waves, and can be observed at distances exceeding 40 micrometers in 20 nm thick films. Analytical modeling based on retarded Maxwell equations and Polder tensor formalism confirms the hybridized nature of the excitations and captures the nontrivial dispersion and attenuation profiles.

An elegant way to capture the effects of the latter on the conductivity is through a field-dependent effective electronic temperature T_eff that can significantly exceed that of the lattice. Despite its elegance, its actual use has been limited, which, at least in part, can be attributed to the concept originating from computer simulations; experimental confirmations have largely been indirect (through scaling of conductivity) and did not establish that T_eff equals the real temperature of the electron distribution. Moreover, it has hardly been tested for important classes of disordered materials, including quantum dot solids. Here, we investigate whether the effective temperature concept is applicable to quantum dot solids, using zinc oxide as relevant model system. To verify that field-driven conductivity increases indeed reflect an actual increase of the electronic temperature, we combine direct and indirect measurements of T_eff: we convert conductivity changes at high fields to an effective temperature that we show to be consistent with a direct measurement of the electronic temperature using the Seebeck effect.

Microscopic insights into these systems are often inferred from our understanding of the air-water interface, which is assumed to exhibit similar behavior. Here, we challenge this paradigm by combining heterodyne-detected vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy with machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at first-principles accuracy to investigate the graphene-NaCl(aq) interface as a prototypical hydrophobic solid-water system. Spectroscopic results suggest that ions have a minimal effect on the structure of the interfacial water, while simulations reveal that Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ accumulate densely at the surface. Together, these findings reveal a new adsorption mechanism that departs from the established air-water interface paradigm, where interfacial ion adsorption is typically associated with, and often detected through, pronounced alteration of the interfacial water alignment and orientation. This difference arises because ions cannot penetrate the solid boundary and reside at a similar depth as the interfacial water molecules. As a consequence, large ion populations can be accommodated within the extended two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network at the interface, causing only minor local distortions but significant changes to its longer-range connectivity. These results reveal a distinct mechanism of electrolyte organization at aqueous-carbon interfaces, relevant to energy applications, where performance is highly sensitive to the local organization of interfacial water.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This article outlines the theoretical structure and calibration of the model within a dual-geometry cosmological setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u53cd-de Sitter\u548cde Sitter\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u3002\u4ece\u5e26\u6709\u4e24\u4e2aFLRW\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u9879\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52bf\u80fd\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5f17\u91cc\u5fb7\u66fc\u548c\u514b\u83b1\u56e0-\u9ad8\u5fb7\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6709\u6548\u6d41\u4f53\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u03bbCDM\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e0e(1+z)^{-3}\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5c0f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u8fd8\u81ea\u7136\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u901a\u8fc7\u74e6\u56e0\u8f9b-screening\u3002\u672c\u6587\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5728\u53cc\u51e0\u4f55\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8fde\u63a5AdS\u548cdS\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u6269\u5c55\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u529b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2aFLRW\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u9879\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52bf\u80fd\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5f17\u91cc\u5fb7\u66fc\u548c\u514b\u83b1\u56e0-\u9ad8\u5fb7\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6709\u6548\u6d41\u4f53\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u03bbCDM\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u5c0f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u529b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76"}}

Within the bias area, several heavy-metal wires carrying dc charge current are periodically attached to the waveguide and exert so spatially periodic spin-orbit torques, producing current-controllable modulated magnon gain and loss. It is demonstrated that this decorated waveguide can emit a strong, single frequency magnon mode at the Bragg point (lasing) and also absorb at the same frequency phase-matched incoming coherent magnons (anti-lasing). The underlying physics is captured by an analytical model and validated with full material and device-specific numerical simulations. The magnonic laser absorber response is tunable via the current density in the wires, the extent of the biased region, and the intrinsic damping, enabling the control of lasing frequency and emission power. The structure is shown to amplify thermal magnons, offering a route to low-noise on-chip microwave sources. The concept is compatible with planar waveguides, ring geometries, and antiferromagnets.

We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation.

Battery electrolytes feature a large design space composed of different solvents, additives, and salts, which is difficult to explore experimentally. High-fidelity molecular simulation can accurately predict the bulk properties of electrolytes by employing accurate potential energy surfaces, thus guiding the molecule and formula engineering. At present, the overly simplified classic force fields rely heavily on experimental data for fine-tuning, thus its predictive power on microscopic level is under question. In contrast, the newly emerged machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) can accurately reproduce the ab initio data, demonstrating excellent fitting ability. However, it is still haunted by problems such as low transferrability, insufficient stability in the prediction of bulk properties, and poor training cost scaling.

Most near-term approaches are cast as variational energy minimization and thus inherit the challenges of problem-specific energy landscapes. We develop the quantum amplitude-amplification eigensolver (QAAE), which departs from the variational paradigm and instead coherently drives a trial state toward the ground state via quantum amplitude amplification. Each amplitude-amplification round interleaves a reflection about the learned trial state with a controlled short-time evolution under a normalized Hamiltonian; an ancilla readout yields an amplitude-amplified pure target state that a state-learning step then re-encodes into an ansatz circuit for the next round -- without evaluating the energy gradients.

Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \\sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $\u03be_R^2 \\sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids.", "AI": {"tldr": "even-size chains can have a partially symmetric phase, but the magnetization typically scales with the inverse square root of the system size, while in an odd-numbered chain, the magnetization is finite. Parity conservation protects magnetization in odd-sized chains but not in even-sized ones, implying that such chains cannot exhibit finite magnetization. Symmetry-breaking fields in low-energy physics lead to manifestation of SSB in specific quantum systems, such as spin chains with Luttinger liquid phases. This suggests that metrological applications benefit from the unique properties of odd-sized chains with finite effective magnetization in the broken symmetry phase.", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684 metrological applications. \u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u5947\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5076\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u94fe\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Luttinger\u6db2\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6709\u9650\u5927\u5c0f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5947\u5076\u957f\u5ea6\u94fe\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5947\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u94fe\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u573a\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6709\u9650\u78c1\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5076\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u94fe\u4e2d\u78c1\u5316\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u5c0f\u6309\u5e42\u5b9a\u5f8b\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u5947\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u94fe\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u4e0eLuttinger\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u7279\u6027\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5947\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u573a\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u78c1\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7279\u6027\u5728\u5076\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u94fe\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u5947\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u94fe\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u5176\u5947\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800codd\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u8d28\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7531\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 metrological \u667a\u6167\u4eea\u5668\u65b9\u9762\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u9014\u3002"}}

Numerical simulations with GipsyX validate cm-level orbit determination and timing stability within tens of picoseconds across GCRS and BCRS and demonstrate mm-level round-trip GCRS <--> BCRS frame closure over 24 h. These results underscore the necessity of relativistic corrections for high-precision GNSS throughout the Earth-Moon system and demonstrate that GNSS signals can support a decimeter-level orbit accuracy and sub-nanosecond-scale timing synchronization in cislunar space, establishing a robust framework for future operations.

While the non-interacting limit (U=0) provides a finite-size reference, increasing on-site repulsion U induces localization and reorganizes the low-energy spectrum. For the extended model, we examine moderate (U=4) and strong (U=10) coupling regimes, where conventional structure factors reveal familiar crossovers among charge, spin and local-pairing correlations. PCA of the corresponding correlation matrices captures these crossovers directly from the data, without assuming predefined order parameters by identifying charge-dominated, spin-dominated and pairing-dominated regimes through variance condensation into leading components. This establishes PCA as a transparent, model-agnostic framework for uncovering the hierarchy and competition of correlation channels in finite Hubbard lattice clusters, providing a bridge between exact diagonalization and modern machine-learning diagnostics in strongly correlated systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u5bf9 Hubbard \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5f53\u91cf\u586b\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u5355\u5c42 Hubbard \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u3001\u5171\u8f68\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u914d\u5bf9\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22 Hubbard \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca PCA \u5728\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 3x4 \u548c 4x4 \u67f1\u72b6\u8f85\u5177\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u9699\u8f83\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5fae\u6b63\u5219\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\u5e94\u7528 PCA \u5206\u6790\u5173\u8054\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u3001\u5171\u8f68\u548c\u914d\u5bf9\u6fc0\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u4ea4\u8054\u6781\u9650\uff08U=0\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53c2\u8003\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u4ea4\u8054\u5f3a\u5ea6 U \u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6001\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4f4e\u9636\u80fd\u9636\uff1b\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cU=4 \u548c U=10 \u7684\u4ea4\u8054\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u3001\u5171\u8f68\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u914d\u5bf9\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 PCA\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bbe\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\uff1bPCA \u4f5c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u9650 Hubbard \u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u67b6\u8d77\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bca\u65ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 PCA \u5728\u5206\u6790\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3 Hubbard \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6fc0\u53d1\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-P\u00e9rot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 \u03a9, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature.

Compared with single-photon driving, the two-photon process exhibits a pronounced advantage in energy capacity and entropy regulation, which becomes more prominent under stronger driving.

This study presents a differentiable inverse design framework for such metasurfaces, creating an accurate mapping between meta-atom geometries and their multi-channel optical responses across diverse optical dimensions. Using a deep neural network-driven, end-to-end optimization pipeline, the framework enables intelligent, iterative refinement of rotatable metasurface within constrained design space. Using this approach, we show high-fidelity holographic video display by rotating a single element in a cascaded metasurface doublet around the optical axis. The doublet enables pixel-resolved holographic imaging with 288 independent channels, and by switching input/output polarization states, the system demonstrates four distinct full-color dynamic holographic videos.

Specifically, we have adopted the Starobinsky model $f(R) = R + \u03b1R^2$, which incorporates higher-order curvature corrections to describe nonlinear gravitational behavior. The analysis focuses on the nonlinear spherical evolution of anisotropic matter configurations and explains how dark matter influences their physical characteristics. The presence of dark matter is found to significantly affect the radial and tangential pressure distributions, thereby altering the overall dynamics of the system. The model is employed for the compact object $ Her~X-1$ described by the generalized Tolman-Kuchowicz metric, demonstrating a singularity-free behavior of the physical parameters. The results reveal that increasing the parameter $n$ of the generalized Tolman-Kuchowicz metric leads to striking variations in the model characteristics, highlighting its essential role in governing internal structure and evolution of the compact object.

However, their lower-dimensional counterpart, one-dimensional (1D) moir\u00e9 superlattices, remain largely unexplored. Electrons in 1D are generally described by Luttinger liquid theory, with universal scaling relations depending only on the Luttinger parameter g. In particular, at half-filling, Umklapp scattering plays a crucial role, as it can significantly change the conductance-temperature scaling relation and lead to Mott insulators. However, this prediction has never been observed since doping an empty band to half-filling was extremely difficult. Here, we show that the marriage of moir\u00e9 superlattices and 1D electrons makes it possible to study the Luttinger liquid in an exceptionally wide filling region simply by electrical gating. We perform transport measurements on 1D moir\u00e9 superlattices of carbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, and observe correlated insulating states at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings of the superlattice mini-band, where Umklapp scattering becomes dominant. We also observe a T-linear conductance at these commensurate fillings over a range of temperatures. Strikingly, the T-linear conductance leads to a strongly suppressed Luttinger parameter, suggesting a state of extreme correlation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These calibration techniques are well documented for standalone FTIR instruments but not for microscope coupled-FTIRs, even though such an architecture greatly simplifies collection of light from micro and nano scale structures.

In flat space, the approach reproduces the known relaxation behaviour for massive fields and reveals qualitatively distinct dynamics in the massless case.

More specifically, we consider the Anderson and the Aubry-Andre-Harper models connected to electronic reservoirs and embedded in a single-mode optical cavity. The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-Andr\u00e9-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems.

In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper reviews the physics of kagome lattices, discussing theoretical underpinnings, experimental progress in realizing novel states, and different material classes emphasizing electronic states and their relation to kagome lattice interactions.", "motivation": "The paper aims to summarize the key driving forces in quantum materials and provide a comprehensive review of the kagome lattice physics and its experimental applications.", "method": "The paper employs a review-based approach, synthesizing theoretical models and experimental evidence from various material classes that exhibit kagome lattice characteristics.", "result": "The paper synthesizes insights into how the unique structure of kagome lattices contributes to the stabilization of exotic electronic states in different materials.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that kagome lattices offer a promising framework for understanding and engineering new electronic phases in quantum materials."}}

Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles.

While popular algorithms, such as Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), limit the number of circuit-execution to two per iteration, irrespective of the number of parameters in the circuit, they have their own challenges. These methods use central-differences to calculate biased estimates of directional derivatives. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that this may lead to instabilities in \\emph{training} the PQCs. To remedy this, we propose Stochastic Shadow Descent (\\texttt{SSD}), which uses random-projections (or \\emph{shadows}) of the gradient to update the parameters iteratively. We eliminate the bias in directional derivatives by employing the Parameter-Shift Rule, along with techniques from Quantum Signal Processing, to construct a quantum circuit that parsimoniously computes \\emph{unbiased estimates} of directional derivatives.

Our construction generalizes standard form factor techniques to deal with the deformed two-body scattering amplitudes, which are typical in this setting. The results are minimal form factors which are the product of the undeformed solution and a new function. This function can be fixed by requiring constant asymptotics for large rapidities, smoothness in the limit when the perturbation parameters go to zero, and agreement with standard MFF formulae for particular choices of the perturbation couplings. We observe that, for a certain range of parameters, the new MFF develops a pole at $\u03b8=0$. By considering several UV-complete theories, we argue that such poles can emerge naturally from the MFF integral representation and suggest how they may be eliminated.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

GUED reveals information about the nuclear motions that is complementary to the information on the electronic states provided by spectroscopic measurements. GUED experiments so far have utilized a single laser pulse to excite the molecules and an electron pulse to probe the dynamics. This limits the excited states which can be studied to only those that can be reached by absorption of a photon from the ground state or in some cases simultaneous absorption of multiple photons. A broader class of experiments and dynamics can be accessed using two time-delayed laser pulses to access unexplored regions of the potential energy surfaces. As a proof-of-principle experiment using a double excitation, we studied the photodissociation of trifluoroiodomethane molecules that are pre-excited with an infrared (800 nm) femtosecond laser pulse before photo-dissociation is triggered with an ultraviolet (266 nm) femtosecond laser pulse. We have observed significant differences in the dissociation dynamics, with pre-excitation resulting in a slower dissociation process. This new capability can offer new insights on the evolution of nuclear wavepackets in regions of the excited potential energy surface which are inaccessible in single photon excitation.

Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\\tilde\u03b6$, the mode frequency $\\tilde\u03c9$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\\tilde\u03b6$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced.

Here, we report on the detection and quantification of both HNC and HCN isomers in low-temperature plasmas generated from N$_2$/H$_2$/CH$_4$ mixtures using quantum cascade laser and frequency comb absorption spectroscopy. The identification of HNC is confirmed by comparison with molecular spectroscopic databases. The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity. We attribute this stark difference to fundamentally different kinetics, dominated by an interplay between formation of vibrationally 'hot' intermediates (HCN* and HNC*) and their subsequent stabilization and destruction. This mechanism contrasts with cold interstellar environments, where dissociative recombination reactions dominate and the formed HNC persists and accumulates over astrochemical timescales.

Inverse-designed photonics, empowered by optimization and learning algorithms, have emerged as a powerful paradigm for realizing compact and multifunctional integrated photonic components. In this work, we develop a staged-annealing topological optimization (SATO) framework tailored for the design of integrated terahertz (THz) beam-shaping devices. Employing this inverse-designed framework, we experimentally demonstrate a class of compact THz vortex beam emitters on an all-silicon on-chip platform. These devices efficiently convert the in-plane fundamental transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode into free-space vortex beams with mode purity up to 87% and energy conversion efficiency up to 74% across the target wavelength range (680 \u03bcm to 720 \u03bcm).

The background metric, recently obtained as an analytic generalization of the Schwarzschild geometry, depends on the halo velocity parameter $V_{c}$ and the core radius $a$. Using the sixth- and seventh-order WKB methods with Pade approximants, supported by time-domain integration and Prony analysis, we compute the fundamental quasinormal frequencies and transmission coefficients. The results show that the real part of the frequency slightly increases while the damping rate decreases with growing field mass $\u03bc$, leading to longer-lived oscillations. The influence of the dark matter halo parameters is found to be negligible for astrophysically realistic values, confirming the robustness of Schwarzschild-like ringdown signatures.

Two types of external-field setups are considered: One is a circularly polarized electromagnetic field and the other is a combination of a circularly polarized electric field and a static magnetic field. The system is modeled by a classical frustrated Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice, whose ground state is a single-$Q$ spiral spin configuration. The effects of irradiated electric and magnetic fields are taken into account by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the Zeeman coupling, respectively, without heating effects. By numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that the two field configurations lead to distinct skyrmion crystal (SkX) phases and their associated topological phase transitions: in the former setup, SkXs composed of skyrmions with skyrmion numbers of one and two with opposite signs emerge, whereas in the latter setup, SkXs with the same sign appear. The stabilization mechanisms of these SkXs are accounted for by the competition among electromagnetic-field-induced chiral DM interactions, electric-field-induced three-spin interactions, and the Zeeman coupling based on the high-frequency expansion within the Floquet formalism. Furthermore, for the latter setup, we find that the stability region of the SkX phase varies significantly depending on the timing of the application of the circularly polarized electric field and the static magnetic field. Our findings would broaden the possible routes to generate and control SkXs by time-dependent electromagnetic fields, advancing both the theoretical comprehension and experimental control of topological spin crystals.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our core innovation is a comprehensive channel-constrained framework: we model the diffusion and denoising steps as quantum channels defined by Kraus operators, ensure their physical validity through optimization on the Stiefel manifold, and introduce tailored training strategies and loss functions that leverage this constrained structure for high-fidelity state reconstruction. Experimental validation on systems ranging from single qubits to entangled states $7$ -qubits demonstrates high-fidelity state generation, achieving fidelities exceeding $0.998$ under both random and depolarizing noise conditions.

The area of this surface is expressed through the eigenvalues of the Douglas-Gram matrix of the boundary loop, and is identical for the self-dual and anti-self-dual chiralities related by parity. We prove the Confinement Theorem by showing that the effective string tension sigma_eff[C] (ratio of our Hodge dual area to a Euclidean one bounded by the same loop) is bounded as sigma_eff[C]>= sqrt(2) , remaining finite and positive for all regular loops. Consequently, the Wilson loop decays exponentially with the Euclidean area, providing a purely geometric proof of confinement. Quantization of the quadratic holomorphic action yields a quantum string, with a universal constant correction for each of the two chiral strings. The worldsheet theory is one-loop exact.

A single parameter multiplying the exchange integral, is determined from the exact thermodynamic energy of a few reference molecules. The value of the parameter depends on the basis and level of configuration interaction but is the same for all molecules.

Besides, both modes yield the maximum isolation ratio of more than 10 dB.

Dynamical decoupling is a widely used, powerful technique for decoherence error suppression. However, it is susceptible to control errors, making non-robust sequences like UDD impractical to implement and robust ones like CPMG to significantly overestimate decoherence times. This overestimation issue remains largely unexplored in the past few decades, leading to many reports of exceptionally long yet plausible decoherence times across various qubit platforms. Here, we construct Hadamard phase cycling as a non-Markovian quantum error mitigation method for dynamical decoupling. This method exploits group structure to design phase configurations of equivalent ensemble quantum circuits, effectively eliminates circuit outputs generated from erroneous dynamics, and scales linearly with circuit depth. Harnessing its error mitigation capability for ensemble solid-state electron spin qubits embedded in paramagnetic molecules and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond enables accurate acquisition of decoherence times. Applying Hadamard phase cycling on single trapped ion and superconducting transmon qubits effectively preserves their state fidelity during dynamical decoupling. The integration of scalable quantum error mitigation and suppression would facilitate the development of quantum technologies with noisy qubits and control hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5728Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) \u65f6\u4ee3\u9762\u4e34 qubit \u9759\u6001\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u53bb (Dynamical Decoupling) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u6d88\u53bb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u63a7\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u5e8f\u5217\u5982 UDD \u5b9e\u65bd\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u9c81\u68d2\u5e8f\u5217\u5982 CPMG \u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u6d88\u53bb\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86 Hadamard \u9636\u8c03\u76f8\u4f4d\u6f02\u79fb\u6cd5 (Hadamard Phase Cycling) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u4f4d\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664 faulty \u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7efc\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb qubit \u548c\u6c2e-v \u7a7a\u7a74\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5728 diamond \u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u5355\u79bb\u5b50\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u8f6c\u5b50 qubit \u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u4fdd\uff0c\u4e3a noisy qubit \u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9 NISQ \u65f6\u4ee3 qubit \u9759\u6b62\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa Hadamard \u9636\u8c03\u76f8\u4f4d\u6f02\u79fb\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528 qubit \u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u4f4d\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u63d0\u5347 qubit \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u4fdd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5747\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u79bb\u5b50\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u8f6c\u5b50 qubit\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5176\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u4fdd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7 scalabe \u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6291\u5236\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5728 noisy qubit \u548c\u63a7\u5236\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

For each dimension, we also focus on several topics that are especially interesting in that setting. These include: for 2-manifolds, the geometry of the \"full moduli space\" of $T[M_2]$ and its interaction with polarizations and symmetries; for 3-manifolds, the effect of torsion in homology on the

We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters.

Here we investigate a representative triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate CoBr$_2$, where first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a dominant nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping channel that enhances the ferromagnetic Kitaev-type exchange interactions. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg term is highly sensitive to a direct $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hopping path and electronic correlations. The magnetic exchange parameters are evaluated using the hopping amplitudes obtained from DFT calculations within an exact diagonalization framework.

In four terminal Josephson junctions, the Weyl physics, namely topologically protected zero energy state, emerges without assuming any exotic materials. In this study, we consider the four-terminal Josephson junction with the quantum point contact structures between the mesoscopic normal region and four superconducting terminals. The quantum point contacts can tune electrically the number of conduction channels. We theoretically investigate an effect of the increase of channels on the emergence of Weyl points. The increase of channels causes the increase of Andreev bound states in the system, which increase the emergence probability of Weyl points. When all terminals have two channels, the emergence probability is up to 17\\%, which is about four times larger than that for all single channel junctions. We consider the balance of the number of conduction channels in the four terminals.

However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises.

We train the model using $\\sim10^5$ input waveforms data with a 70\\%/10\\% train/validation split, while 20\\% data are reserved for testing. The median mismatch for the generated waveforms in the test dataset is $\\sim10^{-2}$, with better performance in a restricted parameter space of $\u03c7_{\\rm eff}\\in[-0.80,0.80]$. Our model is able to generate 100 waveforms in 0.1 second at an average speed of about 4.46 ms per waveform. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the native SEOBNRv4 implementation in lalsimulation. The latent sampling uncertainty of our model can be quantified with a mean mismatch deviation of $2\\times10^{-1}$ for 1000 generations of the same waveform. Our work aims to be the first step towards developing a production-ready machine learning framework for the faster generation of gravitational waveform approximations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By analytically and numerically examining the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $c_1$ and the cosmological parameter $\u039b$, we reveal how these modified gravity parameters alter the underlying physical processes. Using geodesic analysis, we compute the specific energy, angular momentum, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius, and radiation flux of test particles, providing insight into how the modified gravity framework affects orbital stability and the organization of the accretion flow. Subsequently, through numerical solutions of the general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) equations, we describe the morphology of the shock cone formed via the BHL accretion mechanism around the BH. The numerical results demonstrate that increasing the values of $c_1$ and negative $\u039b$ reduce gravitational focusing. Consequently, depending on the parameter choices, the opening angle of the shock cone either widens or narrows compared to the Schwarzschild case. However, because of weakened gravitational focusing, both the amount of accreted matter and the density of material trapped inside the cone decrease significantly. These results indicate that scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet corrections act as an effective gravitational damping term, transferring turbulence and transforming shock-dominated accretion into more stable configurations.

By comparing simultaneous and individual estimation strategies, we demonstrate that the simultaneous approach offers a notable advantage in our system. To support this, we compute the quantum Fisher information matrices (QFIMs) based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). Our results show that the quantum Cram\u00e9r Rao bound (QCRB) associated with the RLD is consistently lower than that of the SLD, indicating superior estimation precision. From a physical standpoint, this improvement reflects the system's enhanced capacity to encode, transfer, and extract quantum information while allowing optimal control of fundamental interactions. We show that increasing the Rabi frequency, cavity loss rate, and the average number of photons and phonons, combined with reduced mechanical damping and temperature, enhances the system's sensitivity to the coupling parameters. These mechanisms act on the available quantum resources, such as entanglement, squeezing, and state purity, leading to more precise estimations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that under certain conditions, heterodyne detection can closely approach the ultimate precision set by the QFIM.

This study investigates molecular engineering strategies to enhance the second-order nonlinear response of derivatives based on the donor-acceptor molecule 2-(4'-diphenylaminobiphenyl-4-yl)quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (TPA-QCN). Four derivatives incorporating modifications designed to increase molecular hyperpolarizability ($\u03b2$) or promote favorable orientation were synthesized and characterized. The most successful modification, intramolecular bridge-locking, simultaneously increases hyperpolarizability and enhances spontaneous orientation by reducing detrimental electrostatic interactions during deposition.

Although some efforts have been made to integrate perovskite nanomaterials with optical fibers, technological challenges have hindered reliable in-situ preparation methods. Herein, we propose an area-selective wetting strategy for optical fibers, which utilizes hydrophobic sidewalls and hydrophilic end facets to reliably hold small precursor droplets. By introducing a space confinement strategy to suppress the kinetics of solvent evaporation, Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals were successfully grown in-situ on the fiber end facet. The versatility of this in-situ growth method for single crystals on fiber end facets of various sizes has also been verified. In a separate approach, the controllable in-situ preparation of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline thin films was achieved through vacuum-assisted rapid crystallization.

Unlike collapse theories, EQM does not allow an action on one system to change the reduced density matrix (RDM) of a remote entangled system - a clear case of nonlocal action. However, EQM does allow an action on one system to change the global state of the system and its remote entangled partners. We argue that such changes should also count as nonlocal actions, meaning EQM is not local after all. First, we consider an argument to the contrary, which deems such global changes to be mere extrinsic changes, whereas nonlocal action requires intrinsic changes to the remote system. We respond that the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction is problematic and cannot hold the weight of this argument. We then try to clarify when actions that change global states count as nonlocal actions. We argue that it is when the global states are essential explanatory mechanisms of the theory. In EQM, the global state is needed to explain why, in an anti-correlated Bell state, Alice's measuring spin-up ensures that she encounters only the branch where Bob measures spin-down.", "AI": {"tldr": "EQM is not a local theory because its global state changes can explain nonlocal correlations in Bell states.", "motivation": "Understanding the locality of Everettian quantum mechanics (EQM) is key to grasping its implications for quantum nonlocality.", "method": "Analyzed EQM's mechanism for global state changes and their role in explaining Bell correlations.", "result": "EQM's reliance on global states implies it's not local, countering the view that only local actions at a distance are nonlocal.", "conclusion": "EQM offers a novel explanation for quantum nonlocality without traditional local influences between distant systems."}}

The metric is asymptotically flat and characterized by a simple lapse function $f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass and $a$ represents the characteristic scale of the surrounding dark-matter halo that regularizes the central region. The effective potentials for all perturbing fields possess the standard single-barrier form, ensuring linear stability and the applicability of the WKB formalism.

The parameter $a$ leads to a moderate increase in the real oscillation frequency, while the damping rate remains almost unchanged, producing only small corrections to the Schwarzschild spectrum.

The matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time series of a data segment is first computed for a reference template, and the SNRs of nearby templates are then reconstructed by convolving this reference SNR time series with the ratio waveforms, defined as the frequency-domain ratios between the reference and neighboring templates. The computational speedup arises because the ratio waveforms can be safely truncated: they are significant only over a short interval approximately equal to the duration difference between the templates. Storing these truncated ratio waveforms is practical and enables additional efficiency gains, in contrast to storing full templates, which is generally infeasible for long-duration, low-mass signals. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method with mock non-spinning CBC injections in the $1-3~M_\\odot$ range. The reconstructed SNR time series agrees with that obtained from standard matched filtering to an accuracy of $O(10^{-4})$, while the relative computational cost is reduced by $\\gtrsim 25\\%$.

In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover Bosonic codes under approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of solving the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning.

We find that the two-phase trained agent can discover the optimal set of codewords, i.e., the Fock states $\\ket{4}$ and $\\ket{7}$ considering the effect of both single-photon and double-photon loss. We identify that the discovered code surpasses the breakeven threshold over a longer evolution time and achieve the state-of-art performance.

By studying the refraction law for null geodesics at the spherical shell, and taking account of the light travel time delay, the images are obtained by ray tracing a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk. For a static shell we identify three signatures: a redshift cusp at the shell, a V-shaped profile of the transfer function $r(b)$, and a loss of the one-to-one correspondence between photon spheres and photon rings on the observer's screen. During the collapse of the shell, the spacetime evolves from a stage with a single photon sphere inside the shell, through an intermediate stage with double photon spheres, and finally to a spacetime with a single photon sphere outside the shell. However, when the shell is released from a large distance, the corresponding images never show two separate photon rings, even in the stage with two photon spheres. In addition, the motion of the shell leads to a discontinuity in the redshift factor.

The energy-momentum tensor is assumed to satisfy the weak energy condition, possess a non-positive trace, and obey constraints on radial and tangential pressures, collectively equivalent to the dominant energy condition with additional constraints. By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics and imposing ISCO conditions, we demonstrate the general absence of an upper bound on the ISCO radius in higher-dimensional spacetimes.

Since their invention over two decades ago, numerous efforts have pushed frequency combs to broader bandwidths and more stable operation. More recently, quantum squeezing and entanglement have been explored in single frequency comb systems for quantum advantages in sensing and signal multiplexing. However, the production of quantum light across multiple frequency combs remains unexplored. In this work, we theoretically explore a mechanism that generates a series of nonlinearly coupled frequency combs through cascaded three-wave upconversion and downconversion processes mediated by a single idler comb.

Although $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals exhibit substantially extended spin coherence times at the `magic' magnetic field, the concomitant weak optical absorption has until now prevented single-photon storage. Here, we overcome this challenge by integrating a noiseless photon echo protocol -- which makes full use of the crystal's natural absorption for photonic storage -- with a universally robust dynamical decoupling sequence incorporating adiabatic pulses to protect nuclear spin coherence, enabling long-lived quantum storage at the `magic' magnetic field.

The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations.

Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle.

Firstly, we find that in general not even the $C^0$-structure of the extension is uniquely determined by the assumption that the metric extends continuously. However, we exhibit an interesting local-global relation regarding the $C^0$-structure which in particular entails its rigidity for ''strongly spherically symmetric'' continuous extensions across the Cauchy horizon of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m spacetime. Secondly, we construct continuous extensions which have the same $C^0$-structure, but do not have equivalent $C^1$-structures. This construction also carries over to weak null singularities in 3+1 dimensions. Understanding the uniqueness properties of continuous spacetime extensions to the boundary is of importance for the study of low-regularity inextendibility problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This is accomplished by using a Hamming weight-preserving quantum circuit and a unary basis for data encoding, with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the overall architecture provided. We demonstrate the practical utility of our model by applying it to solve both forward and inverse PDE problems. Furthermore, we exploit the inherent orthogonality of our quantum circuits (which guarantees a spectral norm of 1) to develop a novel uncertainty quantification method. Our approach adapts the Spectral Normalized Gaussian Process for SPINNs, eliminating the need for the computationally expensive spectral normalization step. By using a Quantum Orthogonal SPINN architecture based on stacking, we provide a robust and efficient framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) which, to our knowledge, is the first UQ method specifically designed for Separable PINNs.

This suggests HDC is exceptionally well-suited for a quantum-native implementation. We establish a direct, resource-efficient mapping: (i) hypervectors are mapped to quantum states, (ii) the bundling operation is implemented as a quantum-native averaging process using a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and Oblivious Amplitude Amplification (OAA), (iii) the binding operation is realized via quantum phase oracles, (iv) the permutation operation is implemented using the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), and (v) vector similarity is calculated using quantum state fidelity measurements based on the Hadamard Test. We present the first-ever implementation of this framework, validated through symbolic analogical reasoning and supervised classification tasks. The viability of QHDC is rigorously assessed via a comparative analysis of results from classical computation, ideal quantum simulation, and execution of a 156-qubit IBM Heron r3 quantum processor.

Indeed, concepts such as approximate $t$-designs arise when comparing how close an associated moment operator of a given unitary ensemble is to that of another, reference ensemble. Despite the importance of moment operators, their properties have not been as explored for quantum channels. In this work we develop a theoretical framework to compute moment operators for ensembles of quantum channels, for all moment orders $t$, with a special focus on determining ensembles that can be used as points of reference. By deriving hierarchies between ensembles, via inequalities of their moment operator norms, we give them operational meaning, and define useful concepts such as that of channel $t$-designs. Finally, we perform theoretical and numerical studies which show that different types of noise can decrease the norm of the moment operators (e.g., depolarizing noise), as well as increase it (e.g., amplitude damping), and generalize noise-induced concentration phenomena to channel-design-induced phenomena.

The parameter $\u03b5>0$ assigned at the bridge represents the strength of connectivity: if $\u03b5=0$, then the graph is completely separated. We show that for sufficiently small values of $\u03b5$, a phenomenon called pulsation occurs. The pulsation is characterized by the periodic transfer of the quantum walker between the two graphs. An asymptotic expression with respect to small $\u03b5$ for the probability of finding the walker on either of the two graphs is derived.

The Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) equation uniquely characterizes Markovian dynamics that are completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP), yet many physical systems display non-Markovian features such as algebraic relaxation and coherence backflow beyond the reach of semigroup evolution. Fractional calculus provides a natural framework for describing such long-memory behavior through power-law temporal kernels introduced by fractional time derivatives. Here we establish a unified hierarchy that embeds fractional quantum master equations within the broader landscape of open system dynamics. The fractional master equation forms a structured subclass of memory-kernel models, reducing to the GKSL form at unit fractional order. Through Bochner--Phillips subordination, fractional evolution is expressed as an average over Lindblad semigroups weighted by a power-law waiting-time distribution. This construction ensures physical consistency, explains the algebraic origin of long-time decay, and bridges unitary, Markovian, and structured non-Markovian regimes. The resulting framework positions fractional calculus as a rigorous and unifying language for quantum dynamics with intrinsic memory, enabling new directions for theoretical analysis and quantum simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 memories\u3002\u5206\u6570 master\u65b9\u7a0b\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u4ece\u7eaf\u5355\u5143\u6f14\u5316\u5230\u975eMarkovian\u975e\u8fd4amp\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Bochner-Philips\u5b50\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u5e73\u5747\u5c06\u5206\u6570\u6f14\u5316\u4e0eLindblad\u534a\u7fa4\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u662f\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u9000\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06Markovian\u548c\u975eMarkovian\u73af\u5883\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975eMarkovian\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u6062\u590d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u6570\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u548cBochner-Philips\u5b50\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u6570 master\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0eLindblad\u534a\u7fa4\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u6570\u6f14\u5316\u4e0eLindblad\u534a\u7fa4\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u975eMarkovian\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5Markovian\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u975eMarkovian\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u5185\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The interplay between lattice topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to both bulk and edge exceptional points (EPs), which govern the charging dynamics. In the topological regime, an edge-state EP emerges at an exponentially small non-Hermitian strength, resulting in early PT-symmetry breaking and rapid energy accumulation. This topological enhancement originates from the PT-symmetric non-Hermitian dynamics, in which the broken-symmetry edge mode with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue dominates the time evolution. Consequently, the topological phase consistently yields higher stored energy and faster saturation than the trivial configuration across all parameter regimes and system sizes. These findings demonstrate that topology constitutes a genuine physical resource for enhancing the performance of quantum batteries.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, existing matching-based decoders for the color codes such as the restricted decoder (Kubica and Delfosse, 2023), suffer from limited decoding performance. Inspired by the global decoding insight of the unified decoder (Benhemou et al., 2023), this paper introduces a correlated decoder for the 4.8.8 color code, which improves upon the conventional restricted decoder by leveraging correlations between restricted lattices, and is derived by mapping the correlated matching decoder for the surface code onto the color code lattice. Analytical and numerical results show that the correlated decoder achieves higher thresholds than the restricted and unified decoders, while matching the performance of the unified decoder at very low physical error rates. Under the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, the estimated thresholds for the color code against bit-flip error are 10.38% and 3.13%, respectively.

While QEM has been primarily studied for mitigating errors in the estimation of expectation values of observables, recent works have explored its application to estimating noiseless probability distributions. In this work, we propose two protocols to improve the accuracy of QEM for probability distributions, inspired by techniques in software engineering. The first is the N-version programming method, which compares probability distributions obtained via different QEM strategies and excludes the outlier distribution, certifying the feasibility of the error-mitigated distributions. The second is a consistency-based method for selecting an appropriate extrapolation strategy. Specifically, we prepare $K$ data points at different error rates, choose $L<K$ of them for extrapolation, and evaluate error-mitigated results for all $\\binom{K}{L}$ possible choices.

Using Kramer's theory together with the $P$-representation, we derive an analytical expression for the bit-flip error rate within the potential-barrier approximation. The agreement is demonstrated between analytical calculations and numerical simulations obtained by diagonalization of the Liouvillian superoperator. In the purely dissipative limit, the switching rate increases monotonically with detuning, as the two metastable states approach each other in phase space. However, the exponential contribution to the bit-flip rate exhibits a nontrivial dependence on system parameters, extending beyond the naive scaling with the average photon number. In the presence of large Kerr nonlinearity, the switching rate becomes a nonmonotonic function of the detuning and reaches a minimum at a finite detuning. This effect arises because detuning lowers the activation barrier for weak nonlinearity but increases it for large ones, ensuring a minimum of the switching-rate at nonzero detuning. These results establish key conditions for optimizing the performance of critical cat qubits and are directly relevant for the design of scalable superconducting bosonic quantum architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u4e8c\u5149\u4f5c\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Kerr\u4ecb\u8d28\u632f\u8361\u5668\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684 detuning \u548c\u4e24\u5149\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5207\u6362\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u5907\u91cf\u5b50\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7528\u4e8e bosonic qubit \u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 Kramers \u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408 P-\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4f4d(flip)\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52bf\u5792\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff08\u901a\u8fc7Liouvillian\u8d85\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u543b\u5408\u3002\u5728\u7eaf\u8017\u6563\u6781\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5207\u6362\u7387\u968f\u7740 detuning \u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a meta\u7a33\u6001\u9010\u6e10\u9760\u8fd1\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f4d error \u7387\u7684\u6307\u6570\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5e73\u5747 photon \u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927 Kerr \u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u5207\u6362\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a detuning \u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u975e\u96f6 detuning \u5904\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a detuning \u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f31\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684..<br/>.<br/>\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5173\u952e\u732b qubit \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53 bosonic \u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5207\u6362\u901f\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6761\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Kramers\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408P-\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4f4d error\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u543b\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5207\u6362\u7387\u968f\u7740 detuning \u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5927 Kerr \u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u5207\u6362\u7387\u6210\u4e3a\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u5728\u975e\u96f6 detuning \u5904\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5173\u952e\u732b qubit \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53 bosonic \u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Coupling to photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) promises to further enhance the SnV light-matter interface and unlock a diverse range of entanglement generation protocols. Recent pioneering experiments showing Purcell enhancement of SnV centers in PCCs underscore this potential. However, optical coupling that is coherent - the key ingredient for use in quantum protocols - has so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate above-unity coherent cooperativity of SnV centers embedded in photonic crystal cavities. We fabricate free-standing PCCs using a quasi-isotropic undercut. Across two samples, we conduct room-temperature characterizations, measuring resonances for 327 cavities, with an average quality factor exceeding $Q = 1.0(3) \\times 10^4$. Two cavity-coupled emitters are examined in detail, exhibiting quality factors up to $Q = 25.4(4) \\times 10^3$ and Purcell-reduced lifetimes corresponding to cooperativities up to $C = 20.6(11)$. Furthermore, the single SnVs are observed to strongly modulate the cavity transmission with an extinction contrast up to $98.8(4) \\%$ on resonance. Finally, SnV linewidth measurements reveal above-unity coherent cooperativities in both devices, with the highest value being $C_\\mathrm{coh} = 8.3(12)$.

However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus\" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable.

The great advantage is that Gaussian states are experimentally accessible via their first and second statistical moments. In this work, we investigate parameter estimation for Gaussian states, in which the probe-state preparation stage involves two noncommutative Gaussian measurements on the position and momentum observables, introducing tunable parameters. The influence of these noncommutative Gaussian measurements is investigated through the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We showed that the QFI for characterizing Gaussian channels can be increased by adjusting the uncertainty parameters in the preparation of the probe state. Furthermore, if the probe is initially in a thermal state, probe-state preparation may generate quantum coherence in its energy basis. We showed that not only does the amount of coherence affect the improvement of the QFI, but also the rate of change of the coherence with respect to the parameter to be estimated. The proposed probe-state protocol is applied to two paradigmatic single-mode Gaussian channels, the attenuator and amplification channels, which are building blocks of Gaussian quantum information.

Browne"], "title": "Sequences of Bivariate Bicycle Codes from Covering Graphs", "comment": null, "summary": "We show that given an instance of a bivariate bicycle (BB) code, it is possible to generate an infinite sequence of new BB codes using increasingly large covering graphs of the original code's Tanner graph. When a BB code has a Tanner graph that is a $h$-fold covering of the base BB code's Tanner graph, we refer to it as a $h$-cover code. We show that for a BB code to be a $h$-cover code, its lattice parameters and defining polynomials must satisfy simple algebraic conditions relative to those of the base code. By extending the graph covering map to a chain map, we show there are induced projection and lifting maps on (co)homology that enable the projection and lifting of logical operators and, in certain cases, automorphisms between the base and the cover code. The search space of cover codes is considerably reduced compared to the full space of possible polynomials and we find that many interesting examples of BB codes, such as the $[[144,12,12]]$ gross code, can be viewed as cover codes. We also apply our method to search for BB codes with weight 8 checks and find many codes, including a $[[64,14,8]]$ and $[[144,14,14]]$ code. For an $h$-cover code of an $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code with parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h, d_h]]$, we prove that $k_h \\geq k$ and $d_h \\leq hd$ when $h$ is odd.

As quantum hardware advances toward modular and networked architectures, various fault tolerant DQC schemes have been proposed, which can be broadly categorized into three architectural types. Type 1 architectures consist of small quantum nodes connected via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, enabling nonlocal stabilizer measurements. Type 2 architectures distribute a large error correcting code block across multiple modules, with most stabilizer measurements remaining local, except for a small subset at patch boundaries that are performed using nonlocal CNOT gates. Type 3 architectures assign code blocks to distinct modules and can perform fault tolerant operations such as transversal gates, lattice surgery, and teleportation to implement logical operations between code blocks. Using the planar surface code and toric code as representative examples, we analyze how the resource requirements, particularly the number of Bell pairs and the average number of generation attempts, scale with increasing code distance across different architectural designs.

A key component of such architectures is a scheduler that coordinates operations over a short-range quantum network required to enable the necessary non-local entangling gates between quantum processing units (QPUs). It is desirable to determine schedules of minimum make span, which in the case of networks with constrained resources hinges on their efficient usage. Here we compare and contrast two approaches to solving the make span minimization problem, an approach based on the resource constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) framework, and another based on a greedy heuristic algorithm. The workflow considered is as follows. Firstly, the computational circuit is partitioned and assigned to different QPUs such that the number of nonlocal entangling gates acting across partitions is minimized while the qubit load is nearly uniform on the individual QPUs, which can be accomplished using, e.g., the METIS solver. Secondly, the nonlocal entangling gate requirements with respect to the partitions are identified, and mapped to network operation sequences that deliver the necessary entanglement between the QPUs. Finally, the network operations are scheduled such that the make span is minimized. As illustrative examples, we analyze the implementation of a small instance of the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm over instances of a simple hub and spoke (star) network architecture comprised of a quantum switch as the hub and QPUs as spokes, each with a finite qubit resource budget. In one instance, our results show the RCPSP approach outperforming the greedy heuristic. In another instance, we find the two performing equally well. Our results thus illustrate the effectiveness of the RCPSP framework, while also underlining the relevance and usefulness of greedy heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Comparing two scheduling approaches for quantum computing architectures: RCPSP framework and greedy heuristic.

This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4e8c\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u786e\u8ba4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u76f8\u53c2\u6570$\theta$\u7684 indexer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u533a\u57df$A$\u7684\u603b\u7535\u8377\u7b97\u5b50$\tilde{Q}_A$\u7684\u6307\u6570\u671f\u671b\u503c$\big\bra\big.e^{\text{i}\theta\tilde{Q}_A}\big.\big\rangle$\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u5728\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u89e3\u6790\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u51fa\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u4e8c\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u6d01\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}
