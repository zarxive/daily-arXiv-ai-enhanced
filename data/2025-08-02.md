Motivation: Investigating black hole configurations in cosmological settings could provide insights into galaxy evolution and large-scale structure.

Method: Inverse scattering technique used to build solution for collinear black holes in expanding bubble. Analytical methods to study thermodynamics and equilibrium configurations.

Result: Solution exists with multiple Kerr black holes. Black holes maintain realistic properties. Binary system achieves equilibrium when surrounded by expanding bubble.

Conclusion:  offers analytical model for multiple black holes in expanding universe, useful for theoretical studies, publication in GR journal. Could explain galaxy structures and gravitational waves.

Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity,
describing a collinear array of an arbitrary number of Kerr black holes inside
an expanding bubble of nothing is built, thanks to the inverse scattering
technique. Physical properties and thermodynamics of the single Kerr in the
bubble are studied. No cosmic strings or struts are present. The binary black
hole system displays equilibrium configurations, because the expanding bubble
surrounding the black holes balances the mutual gravitational attraction of the
two constituents.
