In this study, we developed two types of\nscintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (SCI-IMPs),\none incorporating barium fluoride, and the other bismuth germanate, to enable\nsimultaneous high-precision timing and energy measurements. To evaluate their\nperformance over a wide energy range from keV- to GeV-scale, electron-positron\nannihilation gamma rays and cosmic ray muons were used. For energy\nmeasurements, both detectors achieved an energy resolution of approximately 35%\nat 511 keV. For timing measurements using 511 keV, coincidence time resolutions\n(CTRs) of approximately 50 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) were obtained\nfor both detectors. In contrast, for cosmic ray muon experiments where cosmic\nray muon energy is typically on the order of GeV, CTRs were measured to be 25.1\nand 16.8 ps FWHM for barium fluoride- and bismuth germanate-based detectors,\nrespectively. The versatile scintillator-integration technique established in\nthis study can broaden the applicability of the newly developed SCI-IMPs.

We formalize these\nideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves\nprovably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex\nfunctions. First, for block-separable functions, we show that RsAA maintains\npolynomial runtime while known off-the-shelf algorithms require exponential\ntime and structure-aware algorithms exhibit arbitrarily large polynomial\nruntimes.

Second, we use recent advances in the theory of intrinsic\nhypercontractivity to demonstrate polynomial runtimes for RsAA on appropriately\nperturbed strongly convex functions that lack global structure, while\noff-the-shelf algorithms remain exponentially bottlenecked. In contrast to\nprior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the\ngeometry of barriers between local minima.

General analytic\nexpressions are derived for transition matrix elements of all multipolar\norders, formulated to be applicable for experimental use. Using configuration\ninteraction combined with many-body perturbation theory, we calculate not only\nthe previously reported contributions from electric dipole (E1) transitions,\nbut also the electric quadrupole (E2), electric octupole (E3), magnetic dipole\n(M1), and magnetic quadrupole transitions (M2) that have not yet been\ninvestigated for cadmium. These matrix elements are then employed to determine\nthe lifetimes of key excited states, particularly those pertinent to laser\ncooling and optical frequency standards, and to evaluate the long-range\ndispersion coefficient C6.

As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field\nin this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms\nof which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in\nperturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to\nthe out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore\nthe full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple\nfactorized expression.

To\nconsider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study\nevaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research\nhighway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate\npH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24\nhours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period.\nLeachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH > 10) and decreases\nover time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion\nconcentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more\ngradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg\nCaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Much of\nthe interesting physics stems from a hierarchy of scales that is present in the\nquantum spectrum, in terms of two quantum numbers that characterize it. In this\nwork, we establish an explicit connection with the hierarchy of these scales\nwith a $\\textit{radial localization}$ or the absence of it of the probe scalar\nWKB-wavefunction. Subsequently, this scale separation can be traced back to the\nhierarchy between the local red-shift and the classical light-traversing time\nin a geometry that produces a Rindler-throat. The classical null ray takes a\nlogarithmically divergent time to reach the Dirichlet wall, and interestingly,\nwe explicitly demonstrate that the scalar quantum spectrum arising from the\nRindler throat yields a Dip-time of the corresponding spectral form factor,\nwhich scales with a universal power of the light traversing time. Armed with\nthese, we further consider a $\\textit{dressed effective model}$ where the\nDirichlet boundary condition is inserted in a ten-dimensional supergravity\ngeometry, where classical string sources back-react. We demonstrate that, as a\nresult of this backreaction, the quantum-dynamical time-scales, $\\textit{e.g.}$\nthe Dip time of the corresponding spectral form factor can be further enhanced\nwith factors of the string length, thereby making the Dirichlet wall\nconfiguration better mimic the true black hole.

The resulting\nmoir\\'e superlattice potential modulates the electronic band structure, leading\nto emergent topological phases and novel transport properties such as quantized\npiezo responses both for spin and charge transport. This approach allows us to\ntune the system across different topological regimes and to explore the\npiezo-spintronic responses as a function of the band topology. When inversion\nsymmetry is broken either by a sublattice potential $V$, alignment with an hBN\nsubstrate, uniaxial strain, or structural asymmetry present in the moir\\'e\nsuperlattice, the system acquires a finite Berry curvature that is opposite in\nthe $K$ and $K'$ valleys (protected by valley time reversal symmetry). In\ncontrast, for strain, the valley-contrasting nature of the pseudo-gauge field\nensures that the quantized response is robust and proportional to the sum of\nthe valley Chern numbers.

Of particular interest\nis whether the 1/2 FQHS in this system has a one-component (1C) or\ntwo-component (2C) origin; these are typically identified as the Pfaffian\n(non-Abelian) or the $\\Psi_{331}$ (Abelian) FQHSs, respectively. We report here\nour experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an\nultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well. At the\nlowest densities, the 2DES displays only odd-denominator FQHSs, and the ground\nstate at $\\nu = 1/2$ is a composite fermion Fermi sea. As the density is\nincreased, a FQHS emerges at $\\nu = 1/2$, and becomes very strong. In a finite\ndensity range where the 1/2 FQHS is strongest, we also observe its daughter\nFQHSs at $\\nu = 8/17$ and 7/13, consistent with the theoretically expected\ndaughter states of a Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS. At the highest densities, the 2DES\nbecomes 2C, signaled by the emergence of a bilayer Wigner crystal state and the\ntransitions of FQHSs flanking $\\nu=1/2$. The 1/2 FQHS remains robust near this\ntransition and, notably, its charge transport energy gap exhibits an\n\\textit{upward} cusp with a maximum value of about 6 K on the 1C side of the\ntransition; this is the largest gap reported for any even-denominator FQHS. Our\nobservation of the transition of the 2DES ground states near $\\nu=1/2$ to 2C\nstates at high densities, and our measurements of the robustness of the 1/2\nFQHS against charge distribution asymmetry, suggest that the 1/2 FQHS also\nmakes a transition from 1C to 2C.

A key ingredient in our analysis is the open\ntwo-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To\nnumerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the\nevolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\\phi_k$ within an open\ntwo-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity\nexhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with\nnon-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also\ninvestigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov\nentropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial\nsound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos\ncoefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a\nmaximally chaotic system.

Using the constrained random\nphase approximation (cRPA), we compute material-specific effective Coulomb\ninteraction parameters $U$, $U'$, and $J$, including their spatial dependence\nacross distinct correlated subspaces defined by local coordination and crystal\nsymmetry. In semiconducting compounds, long-range nonlocal interactions\npersist, revealing unconventional screening and suggesting strong excitonic\neffects beyond simple dielectric models. In cold-metallic systems, sizable\nlong-range Coulomb interactions remain despite the presence of free carriers,\nhighlighting their atypical metallic screening. Among 33-valence-electron\ncompounds, we find $U_{\\mathrm{eff}} > W$ in the $\\beta_2$ phase, indicating\nproximity to charge-density-wave or Mott instabilities. Several V- and Nb-based\nsystems exhibit intermediate-to-strong correlation strength, with $U/W > 1 $ in\nmultiple cases. Using cRPA-derived Stoner parameters, we identify magnetic\ninstabilities in various V-, Nb-, Cr-, and Mn-based compounds. Finally,\nselected cold-metallic systems display plasmon dispersions that deviate from\nthe conventional $\\sqrt{q}$ behavior, revealing nearly non-dispersive\nlow-energy modes.

Moreover, the\ncurvature singularity is not analytic with respect to the dynamics of the\nUniverse encoded in the Hubble function $H(t)$: for arbitrarily small but not\nzero $H^\\prime(t)$, the curvature invariants are singular, while for\n$H^\\prime(t)$ identically zero, they are regular. Therefore, we can not\nanalytically decouple the black hole from the entire Cosmos, namely, we can not\nassume the Schwarzschild solution locally and the FRW metric at large scale\nwithout violating the analyticity of the metric. Since the spacetime does not\nexist for $r \\leqslant$2M, and since the DEC is violated for r<8M/3, we are\nallowed to doubt the existence of black holes in our Universe as understood up\nto now.

In this work\nwe articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated\nelectronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the\nelectromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the\nmaterial system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we\nfocus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic\nFermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often\nenergetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may\nform, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the\nelectromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the\nCasimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular\norientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the\ninterplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic\nelectromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal\nnematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the\nanisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$\ntimes larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes.\nThis finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with\ncurrently available experimental technology.

In particular, we study the smallest subsystem\nMHC codes, namely, subsystem codes derived from the concatenated [[4,2,2]]\nerror-detecting codes.

The multipartite state absent of\nmultipartite entanglement is called a 2-producible state, which is a tensor\nproduct of at most 2-partite states. Recently, it is proved that a tripartite\npure state is 2-producible if and only if the gap between entanglement of\npurification and its lower bound vanishes. Here, we show that the entanglement\nof purification gap is not sufficient to detect more than tripartite\nentanglement with 4-partite random stabilizer states. We then generalize\nentanglement of purification to the multipartite case, where the gap between\ngeneralized entanglement of purification and its lower bound quantifies the\nquantum communication cost for distributing one part of the multipartite system\nto the other parts. We also demonstrate that a multipartite state is\n2-producible if and only if the generalized entanglement of purification gaps\nvanish. In addition, we show that the generalized entanglement of purification\ngaps are related to the local recoverability of the multipartite state from its\nmarginal state on some parts of the system and the distance between the state\nand the 2-producible states with the relative entropy. Moreover, we calculate\nthe generalized entanglement of purification gaps for the states fulfilling the\ngeneralized Schmidt decomposition, which implies that the 4-partite stabilizer\nstates do not always have the generalized Schmidt decomposition.

Originally published 2014", "summary": "This thesis focuses on the Lie-theoretic foundations of controlled open\nquantum systems. We describe Markovian open quantum system evolutions by Lie\nsemigroups, whose corresponding infinitesimal generators lie in a special type\nof convex cone - a Lie wedge. The Lie wedge associated to a given control\nsystem therefore consists of all generators of the quantum dynamical semigroup\nthat are physically realisable as a result of the interplay between the\ncoherent and incoherent processes the quantum system is subject to. For\n$n$-qubit open quantum systems, we provide a parametrisation of the largest\nphysically relevant Lie algebra (the system algebra), in which these Lie wedges\nare contained: the Lindblad-Kossakowski Lie algebra. This parametrisation\nprovides several useful benefits. First, it allows us to construct explicit\nforms of these system Lie wedges and their respective system Lie algebras.\nSecond, we analyse which control scenarios yield Lie wedges that are closed\nunder Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) multiplication and therefore generate\nMarkovian semigroups of time-independent quantum channels. Lie wedges of this\nform are called Lie semialgebras, and we completely solve this open problem by\nproving that Lie wedges specialise to this form only when the coherent controls\nhave no effect on both the inherent drift Hamiltonian and the incoherent part\nof the dynamics. Finally, this parametrisation of the Lindblad-Kossakowski Lie\nalgebra points to an intuitive separation between unital and non-unital\ndissipative dynamics, where the non-unital component of the dynamics is\ndescribed by affine translation operations. These translation operators are\nthen exploited to construct purely dissipative fixed-point engineering schemes\nto obtain either pure or mixed states as a system's unique fixed point.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u674e\u7406\u8bba\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u63a7\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u674e\u534a\u7fa4\u4e0e\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u674e\u534a\u7fa4\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u53d7\u63a7\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ecLindblad-Kossakowski\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u674e\u534a\u7fa4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528BCH\u4e58\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63a7\u5236.\u2014ch_pMiddleDot\u2014 \u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6216\u7ed3\u8bba", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u70b9\u548c\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\uff0c\u674e\u534a\u7fa4\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6e20\u9053\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLindblad-Kossakowski\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u5355\u76f8\u548c\u975e\u5355\u76f8\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u89c2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u975e\u5355\u76f8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7531\u4eff\u5c04\u5e73\u79fb\u64cd\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u674e\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u53d7\u63a7\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u674e\u534a\u7fa4\u4e0e\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The results indicate that\nthe noiseless emulation achieves competitive performance with the\nfully-classical pipeline, while noise significantly degrades overall\nperformance.

Fermions can be simulated on qubit-based\nquantum computers using a fermion-to-qubit mapping, subject to an overhead --\nthe circuit depth on a qubit quantum computer divided by that on a quantum\ncomputer built from native fermionic modes -- at worst scaling linearly with\nthe number of modes $N$. Existing approaches that lower this depth overhead\nusually trade it for space, using $O(N)$ ancilla qubits. We exponentially\nreduce the worst-case overhead of ancilla-free fermion-to-qubit mappings to\n$O(\\log^2 N)$ by constructing circuits that perform any fermionic permutation\non qubits in the Jordan-Wigner encoding in depth $O(\\log^2 N)$. We also show\nthat our result generalizes to permutations in any product-preserving ternary\ntree fermionic encoding. When introducing $O(N)$ ancillas and mid-circuit\nmeasurement and feedforward, the overhead reduces to $O(\\log N)$. Finally, we\nshow that our scheme can be used to implement the fermionic fast Fourier\ntransform, a key subroutine in chemistry simulation, with overhead $\\Theta(\\log\nN)$ without ancillas and $\\Theta(1)$ with ancillas, improving exponentially\nover the best previously known ancilla-free algorithm with overhead scaling\nlinearly with $N$. Our results show that simulating fermions with qubit quantum\ncomputers comes at a much lower asymptotic overhead than previously thought.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0ancilla\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65e0ancilla\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u65e0ancilla\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df1\u5ea6\u4eceO(N)\u4f18\u5316\u81f3O(log\u00b2N)\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f15\u5165ancilla\u540e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u81f3O(logN)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0ancilla\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}
