### [1] [Generalization of Long-Range Machine Learning Potentials in Complex Chemical Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10989)
*Michal Sanocki,Julija Zavadlav*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The study explores the importance of generalization in MLIPs for chemical space, demonstrating that long-range modeling enhances transferability. By introducing biased train-test splitting strategies, the research identifies systematic failures in MLIPs and provides a framework for improvement, with broader applicability to various materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization in MLIPs is crucial for enabling reliable machine learning in chemical space, and improving transferability is a key challenge. This study aims to systematically evaluate MLIP architectures and propose better evaluation methods.

Method: The research evaluates MLIP architectures with long-range corrections across diverse chemical spaces using biased train-test splitting strategies. They systematically assess performance and identify failures., 

Result: The findings show that long-range modeling significantly improves transferability, and the biased splitting strategies enhance the evaluation of MLIPs. A framework for diagnosing systematic failures is established.

Conclusion: This work emphasizes the importance of long-range modeling in achieving generalizable MLIPs and provides a methodology for improving their performance across chemical space.

Abstract: The vastness of chemical space makes generalization a central challenge in the development of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While MLIPs could enable large-scale atomistic simulations with near-quantum accuracy, their usefulness is often limited by poor transferability to out-of-distribution samples. Here, we systematically evaluate different MLIP architectures with long-range corrections across diverse chemical spaces and show that such schemes are essential, not only for improving in-distribution performance but, more importantly, for enabling significant gains in transferability to unseen regions of chemical space. To enable a more rigorous benchmarking, we introduce biased train-test splitting strategies, which explicitly test the model performance in significantly different regions of chemical space. Together, our findings highlight the importance of long-range modeling for achieving generalizable MLIPs and provide a framework for diagnosing systematic failures across chemical space. Although we demonstrate our methodology on metal-organic frameworks, it is broadly applicable to other materials, offering insights into the design of more robust and transferable MLIPs.

### [2] [The role of charge resonances in the benzene dimer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10992)
*Alice Balbi,Andrea Rygg Aagaard,Sarai Dery Folkestad,Ida-Marie Høyvik*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that charge resonances, which are ion-pair configurations, significantly influence the potential energy surface of the benzene dimer, particularly affecting the energy minimum shifts when considering non-covalent bonding mechanisms like dispersion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the molecular interactions, especially non-covalent bonding, is crucial for fields like drug design and material science. While dispersion forces are well-recognized, this study highlights the role of charge resonances in the potential energy surface of a van der Waals dimer.

Method: The study employs quantum mechanical calculations to explore the electronic structure of the benzene dimer, analyzing both intra- and intermonomer excitations to model charge delocalization and displacement impacts.

Result: Without accounting for charge resonances, the energy minimum shifts approximately 2 Å during parallel displacement. Including these ion-pair configurations improves the accuracy of modeling non-covalent bonding.

Conclusion: This research underscores the dual role of dispersion and charge resonances in forming and stabilizing molecular interactions. Accounting for ion-pair configurations enhances the understanding of van der Waals interactions and has implications for modeling larger molecular systems and materials with many van der Waals interactions.

Abstract: Modern electronic-structure theory defines dispersion interactions as connected intramonomer excitations. Using this definition, dispersion contributions have been shown in literature to be large relative to other contributions at van der Waals distances for the ground state benzene dimer. However, are the dispersion contributions sufficient to describe its potential energy surface? In this paper, we show the importance of charge resonances for the shape of the potential energy surface of the stacked benzene dimer. Charge resonances is a colloquial term for the presence of ion-pair configurations in the electronic wave function, and they represent a charge delocalization between the benzene molecules. We show that the ion-pair configurations, generated from connected intra- and intermonomer excitations, have a significant impact on the potential energy curves as functions of parallel displacement, as well as intramonomer separation. For parallel displacement, the energy minimum shifts approximately 2 Å toward greater displacement if ion-pair configurations are not included. Hence, to understand the non-covalent bonding in the benzene dimer two mechanisms must be taken into account: dispersion interaction and charge resonances.

### [3] [Renormalization group approach to second-order Green's function theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11410)
*Joshua Krieger,Johannes Tölle*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A new approach for constructing a renormalized and regularized Fock matrix for self-consistent field calculations is introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors propose a novel method to overcome challenges in Fock matrix construction, aiming to enhance the accuracy of self-consistent field calculations.

Method: The method involves using second-order perturbation theory, quasiparticle self-consistent second-order Green's function theory (GF2), and perturbative similarity renormalization group (SRG) theory to derive the Fock matrix, including regularization parameters.

Result: Three versions of the method (SRG-qsGF2) are presented, which accurately predict quasiparticle energies and dipole moments.

Conclusion: The method addresses issues in conventional Møller--Plesset perturbation theory by formulating second-order perturbation theory using a renormalized Fock matrix, reducing divergence problems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new approach for constructing a renormalized and regularized Fock matrix for self-consistent field calculations. The scheme relies on second-order perturbation theory and is conceptually related to quasiparticle self-consistent second-order Green's function theory (GF2). The regularization is derived within the framework of perturbative similarity renormalization group (SRG) theory. By optimizing both the regularization and spin-scaling parameters, we introduce three SRG-qsGF2 variants that enable accurate predictions of quasiparticle energies and dipole moments. Lastly, we demonstrate that formulating second-order perturbation theory for the total electronic energy using the renormalized SRG-qsGF2 Fock matrix as the unperturbed Hamiltonian mitigates divergence problems commonly observed in conventional Møller--Plesset perturbation theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The exploration of advanced CO-free catalysts and clarifying the ambiguous kinetic origins and governing factors would undoubtedly open up opportunities to overcome the sluggish kinetics of methanol electrooxidation and promote the development of direct methanol fuel cells. Herein, we constructed a family of Bi-modified Pt3M intermetallic catalysts (Bi-Pt3M/C, M=Cr, Mn, Co, Zn, In, Ga, and Sn) that follow CO-free dominated pathway and exhibit exceptional catalytic activity. More significantly, leveraging this platform, we have identified the pivotal factor governing the reaction kinetics in CO-free pathway, namely OH binding energy (OHBE). This arises because the rate-determining step (RDS) encompasses both C-H bond activation and water dissociation, whose respective barriers can be reflected by the OHBE. Accordingly, OHBE can act as an activity descriptor. Specifically, Bi-Pt3In/C stands out from other Bi-Pt3M/C and delivers the unprecedented mass activity of 36.7 A mgPt-1 at peak potential, far exceeding state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts reported to date. Taking Bi-Pt3In/C as a proof of concept, we clearly elucidate the origin of enhanced MOR activity by combining theoretical calculations, kinetic isotope effects, and formaldehyde electrooxidation. Moreover, there exhibits a volcano-type trend between OHBE and the activity of Bi-Pt3M/C. Beyond the discovery of ultrahigh-performance catalysts, these findings provide a detailed mechanistic picture of RDS and offer an innovative design principle for advanced catalysts.

Motivation: 机器学习在电子结构计算中的挑战，如何有效利用不同精度的数据。

Result: 转移学习提高了预测的准确性，减少了对quasi-Wick旋转和quasi-Wick旋转-BSE数据的依赖，减少了大的预测偏差。

Conclusion: 多级别转移学习可用于扩展量子力学预测范围，特别是在化学多样性较高的测试集上。

Abstract: A persistent challenge in machine learning for electronic-structure calculations is the sharp imbalance between abundant low-fidelity data like DFT or TDDFT results and the scarcity of high-fidelity data like many-body perturbation theory labels. We show that transfer learning provides an effective route to bridge this gap: graph neural networks pretrained on DFT and TDDFT properties can be finetuned with limited qs$GW$ and qs$GW$-BSE data to yield accurate predictions of quasiparticle and excitation energies. Assessing both full-model and readout-only finetuning across chemically diverse test sets, we find that pretraining improves accuracy, reduces reliance on costly qs$GW$ data, and mitigates large predictive outliers even for molecules larger or chemically distinct from those seen during finetuning. Our results demonstrate that multi-fidelity transfer learning can substantially extend the reach of many-body-level predictions across chemical space.

### [6] [Probing voltage-induced chemical reactions and anharmonicity with a confined vacuum light field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11716)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we present a proof-of-concept investigation of non-equilibrium chemical reaction dynamics at a molecule-electrode interface, driven out of equilibrium by an applied votage bias and mediated by a confined, enhanced vacuum electromagnetic field inside an optical cavity. The coupled electron-vibration-photon system, together with the electrodes and a dissipative environment, is described within an open quantum system framework and solved using a numerically exact quantum dynamical approach. The reaction coordinate is modeled with a Morse potential, enabling explicit treatment of molecular anharmonicity and bond-breaking behavior. By varying the cavity frequency across the infrared regime to cover typical nuclear vibrational energies, we observe multiple resonant rate suppression features that emerge whenever the cavity mode is brought into resonance with a dipole-allowed vibrational transition along the anharmonic ladder up to the dissociation threshold. These findings open the door to extending polaritonic chemistry into genuinely nonequilibrium scenarios relevant to molecule-electrode interfaces. Moreover, building on these results, we further propose a multi-mode vibrational strong coupling strategy in which several cavity modes are individually matched to distinct vibrational transitions. This engineered multi-resonant cavity induces a stepwise vibrational ladder descending process that efficiently drains vibrational excited energy. The resulting cavity-assisted cooling suggests a potential route toward mitigating voltage-induced bond rupture and the long-standing instability issues of molecular junctions operating under high bias.

### [7] [When Is Nanoconfined Water Different From Interfacial Water?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11766)
*Xavier R. Advincula,Christoph Schran,Angelos Michaelides*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: 水在表面和超短bpp压力下的行为有很大的不同，但两种情况的分界线一直不明确。尽管有证据表明在亚纳米尺度下仍存在界面效应，但分子尺度的行为和其随缝宽的变化规律仍然是不明确的。我们使用基于机器学习的分子动力学方法（第一性原理精度）来研究水在石墨表面上在缝宽从开放界面极限到十 Angstrom尺度之下。我们发现，当三层或更多的水层夹在两个缝之间时，石墨-水界面的结构与开放系统是没有显著区别的，且密度层状化、氢键网络和分子取向仍然保留界面的特征。然而，当缝宽小于这一阈值时，十 Angstrom尺度的约束会显著重新组织液态，造成加强的有序性、重新构造的氢键网络和改组的分子取向。这些结果建立了分子层面上清晰的区别界面行为和真正的纳米约束的行为的图景，并为预测和控制纳米尺度固液环境中的水结构提供了指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 界面效应在材料科学和分子工程中有着广泛的应用，准确理解界面行为和分子尺度的重构对设计新材料和 nano 结构具有重要意义。研究不同缝宽下水的结构变化，有助于开发出新的材料和纳米结构，从而使科学家能够更好地控制 nano 结构中的水分子行为。

Method: 我们采用了基于机器学习的分子动力学方法，结合第一性原理计算，系统地研究了石墨-水界面在不同缝宽下的结构变化。使用第一性原理计算能保证计算结果的第一性原理精度，而机器学习方法则帮助我们有效地分析和理解复杂的结构变化。这种方法结合了计算效率和理论严谨性，能够为类似的 nano 结构问题提供参考。

Result: 当缝宽足够大（三层或更多水层）时，水的分子行为仍与开放系统相似，显示出明显的界面特征；而当缝宽减小时，界面的分子行为被显著重新组织，结构变化明显。这些结果验证了我们对缝宽对分子行为影响的假设，并提供了关于如何预测和控制分子行为的基本指导。

Conclusion: 通过系统研究石墨表面在不同缝宽下水的分子行为，我们明确区分了界面行为和真正的 nano 约束行为。这些发现不仅深化了对水分子行为的理解，也为在 nano 结构中的水分子行为控制提供了新的思路和指导。这些理论成果将为材料科学和 nano 技术的发展提供重要的理论支持。

Abstract: Water behaves very differently at surfaces and under extreme confinement, but the boundary between these two regimes has remained unclear. Despite evidence that interfacial effects persist under sub-nanometre confinement, the molecular-scale behaviour and its evolution with slit width remain unclear. Here, we use machine-learning molecular dynamics with first-principles accuracy to probe water at graphene surfaces across slit widths ranging from the open-interface limit to angstrom-scale confinement. We find that water undergoes a sharp structural transition: when three or more water layers fit between the walls, the structure of the graphene-water interface is effectively indistinguishable from that in an open system, with density layering, hydrogen bonding, and orientational ordering retaining interfacial character. Below this threshold, however, angstrom-scale confinement strongly reorganises the liquid, producing enhanced ordering, a restructured hydrogen-bond network, and modified orientational motifs. These results establish a molecular-level picture that clearly separates interfacial behaviour from genuine nanoconfinement and provide guidance for predicting and controlling the structure of water in nanoscale solid-liquid environments.

### [9] [Deep diffractive optical neural networks for detecting Skyrmionic topologies of light](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11115)
*Hadrian Bezuidenhout,Cade Peters,Ram Kumar,Andrew Forbes,Isaac Nape*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach for detecting skyrmionic topologies using a deep diffractive optical neural network. The network utilizes two independent processing channels and maps incoming topologies to spatially separated Gaussian channels, enabling the detection of the non-orthogonal topological invariant N. The detector achieves high accuracy, even in the presence of significant noise, and the network demonstrates practical utility for encoding images in a 14-level topological alphabet with no discernible cross-talk. This work opens new possibilities emerge in diffractive optical networks and their applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As optical systems become more complex, efficient and robust encoding and decoding mechanisms become increasingly important. The potential for using topological invariants, such as the skyrmionic invariant N, creates promising opportunities for novel applications. However, the lack of a reliable detector hinders practical implementations, making the development of such a detector a critical challenge.

Method: The researchers developed a deep diffractive optical neural network composed of two independent processing channels, each with 5 diffractive layers. Masked with a spatial mode basis, this approach reduces training variables by a factor of 1000 compared to traditional methods. The network maps incoming topologies to spatially separated Gaussian channels, allowing for the detection of the topological invariant N.

Result: The detector demonstrated high accuracy in detecting topological invariants, even in the presence of significant noise levels. Additionally, the network successfully transmitted and received images encoded in a 14-level topological alphabet with no cross-talk, highlighting its potential for real-world applications. This achievement not only resolves a significant technical challenge but also opens new possibilities for other forms of optical topologies.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant breakthrough in the field of diffractive optical networks. The development of a deterministic detector for skyrmionic topologies not only addresses existing technical challenges but also positions the field for further advancements and practical applications.

Abstract: Optical Skyrmions are topological forms of structured light with the potential of an infinite encoding alphabet that is immune to disturbance. This attractive prospect is hindered by the lack of any topological detector, a challenging problem due to the non-orthogonal nature of the topological invariant (N). Here we demonstrate the first deterministic detector for Skyrmionic topologies of light using a deep diffractive optical neural network. Our network uses two independent processing channels of 5 diffractive layers each to map incoming topologies to spatially separated Gaussian channels from which N can be detected. We overcome the complexity of the training by using a spatial mode basis rather than pixels, reducing the training variables by x1000 compared to current methods. We use the detector on an input set of 81 input topologies, showing high accuracy even in the presence of significant levels of noise. Finally, to show the practical utility of the device, we transmit and receive an image encoded in a 14-level topological alphabet with no discernible cross-talk. Our work offers a new paradigm for the emergent field of diffractive optical networks and can easily be extended to other forms of optical topologies, setting a clear pathway for their deployment in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bismuth nanostructures are appealing for sustainable color generation and sunlight harvesting, thanks to their non-toxicity and their tunable visible-to-near infrared interband plasmon resonances. However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were unsuitable for other applications such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q > 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (> 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing.

Abstract: We designed a gallium nitride hexagonal hollow nanowire whispering gallery mode cavity that generates an |m|=6 topological light with orbital angular momentum (OAM). OAM is generated by breaking the cross-sectional mirror symmetry of the nanowire, which creates a non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by replacing the central airhole of the hollow nanowire with a cluster of 6 overlapping circular air holes with rotational offset relative to the hexagonal cross-sectional profile of the nanowire. The design parameters were then further optimized in Finite Element Method using an inverse design method to maximize the normalized OAM order |l|. We were able to realize of a cavity mode with |l| = 5.7, a mode purity of about 97%, and a Q-factor of ~250. This marks the first OAM generating active photonic device design falling within a sub-micron footprint, with additional novelties of being single component and materialistically homogeneous.

Abstract: We present a cardinal solution for the long-standing and fundamental problem associated with the adiabatic, reversible, and controlled excitation of both dark and bright solitons in Kerr micro-resonators with normal group velocity dispersion. Our findings stem from the inclusion of a localised non-Hermitian potential, which we use to drastically reshape the characteristic collapsed snaking structure associated with such solitons. Consequently, we demonstrate a novel snaking-free bifurcation landscape where solitons of all possible widths are continuously connected via the dynamic change of the cavity detuning, and hence dissipative localised states of unprecedentedly high pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies can be excited in an adiabatic, deterministic, and reversible fashion. Our fundamental discovery has practical implications of paramount importance for frequency comb generation in all-normal dispersion cavities, which are key to comb generation in most spectral regions away from the telecom bands.

This model system is used to demonstrate eye tracking with an angular accuracy of better than one degree and a measurement rate of up to $3.59 \,$ kHz.

Abstract: Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) govern non-Hermitian system dynamics through their enriched and sharpened spectral topology, yet the intrinsic topological fragility hinders robust experimental realization. Here, we present a scalable architecture that implements arbitrary-order EPs via a recurrent network comprising a single nanomechanical resonator and unlimited virtual resonators. We experimentally realize mechanical EPs up to the seventh order and confirm this architecture's scalability. Moreover, we reveal that the fundamental noise component and the measured signal share the same system coupling channel and thus undergo identical root-response amplification near EPs of arbitrary order, consistent with our signal-to-noise ratio measurements. Our work establishes a general platform for exploring higher-order EP-based phenomena while clarifying the fundamental boundary of non-Hermitian sensitivity enhancement across diverse physical systems.

Abstract: nEXO is a proposed next-generation experiment searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe using a tonne-scale liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chamber (TPC). To image the ionization signals from events in the liquid xenon, the detector will employ metallized fused-silica charge collection tiles instrumented with cryogenic application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), referred to as CRYO ASIC, which are designed to operate directly in LXe to minimize input capacitance and pick-up noise. Here we present the performance of the CRYO ASIC mounted on an auxiliary printed circuit board and evaluated both in a cryogenic environmental chamber and in a dedicated LXe test stand. We demonstrate that the ASICs achieve the desired performance at liquid xenon temperatures, showing a gain stability better than 0.2% over 24-hour operation and reliable in-situ calibration using an on-chip pulser. In the LXe test stand, we show that boiling caused by the chip heat dissipation can be mitigated by operating the system above ~0.1 MPa. The in-LXe noise measured agrees with simulation, which indicates it the $150~e^-$ design requirement can be satisfied. These results establish CRYO ASIC as a viable low-noise in-LXe charge readout solution for nEXO.

Abstract: In recent years, compact nanodosimetric detectors based on ion multiplication in low-pressure gas have been developed and gained attention in the scientific community. These detectors use strong electric fields to collect and multiply positive ions produced by the incident radiation in mm-sized cell holes in dielectric materials, achieving a nm-equivalent spatial resolution of the localization of ionization events, when scaled to liquid water with unit density. Their design assumes that ion impact ionizations of gas molecules within the cell holes dominate signal formation, yet this assumption has lacked direct physical verification. Electron emission from the cell hole walls due to ion impact could also contribute, requiring alternative designs to optimize efficiency.
  To investigate this, a nanodosimetric detector featuring a single cell hole with a diameter of 1.5 mm in a dielectric plate was developed. Ion collection and multiplication were achieved by applying a negative high voltage to the glass cathode 0.5 mm below the cell hole, assisted by a low drift field above the plate. A grounded readout electrode with a 0.8 mm hole covers the cell hole to prevent interactions of collected ions with the hole walls. High signal yields in 1 mbar and 2 mbar propane gas were observed and indicated that ion impact ionizations of the gas molecules are indeed the primary mechanism for signal induction. The compact nanodosimeter setup was further modeled with Geant4-DNA and Garfield++ for deeper insight. The results of these studies are important for understanding and developing a new class of nanodosimeters with potential applications in particle therapy, radiation protection, space dosimetry, and particle physics.

*Bruno Rodrigues,Inês Ochoa,Agostinho Gomes*

TL;DR: Optimizing hadronic sampling calorimeters for FCC-ee requires balancing stochastic and constant energy resolution terms, implemented through adjusting absorber layer thickness in a Geant4 simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Particle detectors, particularly those in collider experiments, rely heavily on calorimeters for accurate particle energy measurement. The FCC-ee experiment's next-generation requirements necessitate a systematic approach to optimizing calorimeter designs.

Method: A Geant4 simulation was utilized to analyze the impact of absorber layer thickness on the passive to active material proportion, affecting the deposited energy distribution and resolution.

Result: The simulation results demonstrated that adjusting the absorber layer thickness can effectively optimize the balance between stochastic and constant resolution terms, enhancing overall detector performance.

Conclusion: A closed-loop optimization framework based on this methodology will aid in evaluating and refining multiple detector designs, particularly for FCC-ee-based setups.

Abstract: Calorimeters are a crucial component in modern particle detectors. They are responsible for providing accurate energy measurements of particles produced in high-energy collisions. The demanding requirements set for next-generation collider experiments impose new challenges on the design of new detectors, and a systematic approach to their optimization is increasingly necessary. The performance of calorimeters is primarily characterized by their energy resolution, parameterized by a stochastic and a constant term, related to sampling fluctuations and non-uniformities respectively. To improve the reconstruction quality of physics objects in the calorimeter, both terms need to be taken into account. Changes in a longitudinally constrained design usually result in a trade-off between these terms, making optimization a non-trivial task. This work focuses on the optimization of a hadronic sampling calorimeter, based on the FCC-ee ALLEGRO detector concept. By controlling the absorber layer thickness in a Geant4 simulation, the impact of the passive to active material proportion on the deposited energy distribution and resolution can be analyzed. Our methodology aims at exploring the design space with practical considerations, paving the way for the development of a closed optimization framework that can evaluate multiple designs against physics performance targets.

Conclusion: 该方法为高分辨率、低成本测量雪崩提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Surface ablation measurements of glaciers are critical for understanding mass change over time. Mass-balance stakes are commonly used for localized measurements, with the exposed length typically measured manually at infrequent intervals. This paper presents the design and validation of new instrumentation that automates mass-balance stake readings, thus enabling continuous measurements with high temporal resolution. The instrumentation comprises readout electronics that are mounted on mass-balance stakes to measure wind-induced vibrations. The stake vibrational frequency depends sensitively on the exposed length, and changes in the measured frequency therefore probe glacier surface melt and accumulation. Initial instrumentation field tests conducted at Color Lake on Umingmat Nunaat (Axel Heiberg Island), Nunavut, demonstrate centimeter-level precision on length measurements. The instrumentation can be attached to existing mass-balance stakes and is low-cost (~ $50 USD) in comparison to many other systems that perform automated surface ablation measurements. The accessibility of this instrumentation opens new possibilities for localized, high temporal resolution measurements of glacier surface activity at any locations where mass balance stakes are deployed.

*Dmitrii A. Trunin,David A. Huse*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores crystalline-like behavior in unitary quantum systems with strong eigenvalue repulsion by using a low-temperature Coulomb gas model to derive the Debye-Waller factor, which suppresses oscillations in the spectral form factor (SFF) and estimates the order of its singularities. The authors also use perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles to reproduce this behavior. Their findings provide a foundation for studying quantum systems with intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of eigenvalues in quantum systems, particularly those with strong repulsion, is fundamental in quantum chaos and random matrix theory.

Method: The authors use a Coulomb gas model at low temperature to model repulsive eigenvalues. They derive the Debye-Waller factor to suppress periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate singularity orders. Perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles are employed to reproduce the observed crystalline behavior.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates crystalline-like behavior in quantum systems with strong eigenvalue repulsion. The Debye-Waller factor suppresses oscillations in the SFF, and the order of singularities at multiples of Heisenberg time is estimated. Additionally, the authors validate their findings by reproducing the behavior through perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles.

Conclusion: This study advances the understanding of quantum systems with intermediate level statistics, providing a bridge between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits. The results lay a foundation for future research in this area, potentially leading to new insights into quantum chaos and complex systems.

Abstract: We investigate crystalline-like behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unitary quantum systems with extremely strong eigenvalue repulsion. Using a low-temperature Coulomb gas as a model of repulsive eigenvalues, we derive the Debye-Waller factor suppressing periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate the order of its singularities at multiples of the Heisenberg time. We also reproduce this crystalline-like behavior using perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles associated with Lax matrices. Our results lay a foundation for future studies of quantum systems that exhibit intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work presents a generalized period decomposition approach, significantly improving the practical reliability of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Although Shor's algorithm theoretically enables polynomial-time integer factorization, its real-world performance heavily depends on stringent conditions related to the period obtained via quantum phase estimation. Our generalized decomposition method relaxes these conditions by systematically exploiting arbitrary divisors of the obtained period, effectively broadening the applicability of each quantum execution. Extensive classical simulations were performed to empirically validate our approach, involving over one million test cases across integers ranging from 2 to 8 digits. The proposed method achieved near-perfect success rates, exceeding 99.998% for 7-digit numbers and 99.999% for 8-digit numbers, significantly surpassing traditional and recently improved variants of Shor's algorithm. Crucially, this improvement is achieved without compromising the algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and integrates seamlessly with existing quantum computational frameworks. Moreover, our method enhances the efficiency of quantum resource usage by minimizing unnecessary repetitions, making it particularly relevant for quantum cryptanalysis with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study thus provides both theoretical advancements and substantial practical benefits, contributing meaningfully to the field of quantum algorithm research and the broader field of quantum information processing.

### [23] [Undecidability of the Unitary Hitting Time Problem: No Universal Time-Step Selector and an Operational No-Go for Finite-Time Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11006)
*Katsufumi Matsuura*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows that determining the hitting time in quantum dynamics is undecidable, similar to the halting problem, which means there's no universal algorithm to compute it always. This has implications for quantum control, quantum computing, and the limits of computation in physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limits of computation in quantum mechanics is important for advancing both theoretical and applied aspects of the field, including quantum computing and control.

Method: The approach uses concepts from recursively enumerable sets, hypercomputation, Hilbert spaces, quantum states, and computational complexity to establish the undecidability.

Result: The hitting time cannot be universally computed due to undecidability, and no finite-time protocol can reliably determine it with given constraints.

Conclusion: In quantum mechanics, some problems are fundamentally uncomputable, highlighting the boundary between mathematics and physics in computation.

Abstract: We study the Unitary Hitting Time Problem (UHTP) in quantum dynamics. Given computably described pure states |a>, |b> and a time-dependent unitary U(t), define the hitting time as the infimum of t > 0 such that the fidelity between U(t)|a> and |b> reaches a fixed threshold (with infinity if the threshold is never reached). We prove that there is no total algorithm that outputs this hitting time for all inputs; equivalently, the total UHTP is undecidable via a reduction from the halting problem. Operationally, we show a no-go theorem: for any fixed accuracy parameters, there is no universal finite-resource protocol that, for all computably described inputs, correctly outputs the hitting time while obeying uniform finite upper bounds on observation time and on dissipation/work. The proofs use reversible computation embedded into unitary dynamics, a fixed-target beacon construction, and a continuous-time lifting via piecewise-constant Hamiltonians. Our results target systems capable of embedding universal computation and complement prior undecidability results such as spectral-gap and quantum-control reachability. We distinguish logical time (inside the equations) from physical/operational time (of preparation, evolution, measurement), and show that universal time-step selection is impossible in both senses.

Abstract: The Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formulation brings classical mechanics to Hilbert space, but many techniques familiar from quantum mechanics remain missing. One would hope to solve eigenvalue problems, obtain orthonormal eigenstates of Hermitian operators and ascribe meaning to a coherent superposition of states, among other things. Here we consider the general KvN equation for a classical probability amplitude and show that its so-called gauge freedom allows the separation of variables. The amenability to Hilbert-space methods of the resulting KvN solutions is investigated. We construct superpositions from differently-gauged Liouvillian eigenstates, and find an orthonormal set among them. We find that some separable solutions describe the canonical ensemble with temperature related to the separation constant. Classical uncertainty relations arise naturally in the KvN formalism. We discuss one between the dynamical time and the Liouvillian in terms of the statistical description of classical systems.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks is a novel multilayer neuromorphic network that can exhibit higher accuracy than a neural network. It can learn and predict more accurately than neural networks with a smaller number of parameters, and many research groups worldwide have adopted it. As a result, many types of applications have been proposed. This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters. Hence,it has not been researched as a generator. Therefore, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network called Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum KAN that uses Variational Quantum KAN as a generator. This method enables efficient learning with significantly fewer parameters by leveraging the computational advantages of quantum circuits and their output distributions. We performed the training and generation task on MNIST and CIFAR10, and revealed that our method can achieve higher accuracy than neural networks and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network with less data.

Abstract: Quantifying intrinsic irreversibility in open quantum dynamics is central to understanding decoherence and information loss in many-body systems. In this work, we introduce the Choi echo, which provides an operational interpretation of the purity of the Choi state, the state representation of a quantum channel, as a quantifier of the robustness of quantum correlations against local information erasure. We employ this framework to analyze the reduced dynamics of a subsystem and to test whether local decoherence probes quantum chaos in many-body systems. Across paradigmatic spin chain models, we show that while the Choi echo captures key dynamical features, it also exhibits intrinsic limitations that, in certain regions of parameter space, restrict its ability to resolve the integrable-to-chaos transition at the level of spectral correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that local decoherence can spuriously signal quantum chaos in integrable regimes, tracing them to the inability of a strictly local probe to distinguish efficient coherent transport from genuinely scrambling dynamics. Our results show that local decoherence signals are controlled by the entanglement generated between the probe and its environment during the dynamics, rather than by spectral correlations, clarifying the practical scope of local dynamical diagnostics.

Abstract: Unlike discrete photonic circuits, which manipulate photons step-by-step using a series of optical elements, arrays of coupled waveguides enable photons to interfere continuously across the entire structure. When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state. These results highlight the potential of continuously-coupled photonic systems to harness high-dimensional entanglement within compact architectures.

### [29] [Information-Theoretic and Operational Measures of Quantum Contextuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11049)
*Ali Can Günhan,Mehmet Zafer Gedik*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种信息论框架来量化柯恩-施佩克上下文相关性，并引入了两个互补的度量：互信息能量和基于测量结果的运算度量。我们建立了这两个度量与罗伯特森不确定关系的层次结构，包括谱、纯度修正和算子范数估计。我们将其应用于Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky（KCBS）场景，其中所有量都有显式表达式。利用Majorana星射影模型，我们提供了三维欧几里得空间中的共同几何平台，用于分析运算度量和不确定性能量。对于spin-1，这个模型允许我们在3D空间中以直观的方式可视化量子态。在KCBS各上下文中同时优化后，量子态位于对称轴上，且在最佳不确定性方向上具有最大的不确定度。有趣的是，达到最优不确定度总和的量子态几乎没有运算相关性，而具有显著运算相关性的态却达到了非零罗伯特森上限。

Conclusion: 通过信息论框架，我们成功量化和分析了柯恩-施佩克上下文相关性，展示了其与不确定性原理的深刻联系，并通过几何模型提供了直观的理解。

Abstract: We propose an information -- theoretic framework for quantifying Kochen-Specker contextuality. Two complementary measures are introduced: the mutual information energy, a state-independent quantity inspired by Onicescu's information energy that captures the geometric overlap between joint eigenspaces within a context; and an operational measure based on commutator expectation values that reflects contextual behavior at the level of measurement outcomes. We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for identifying correlations and entanglement in bosonic many-body Gaussian systems, distinguishing between pure and mixed states, and extending the concept to multi-mode subsystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum correlations in many-body systems is crucial for advancing quantum field theory, quantum information, and optics.

Method: The researchers developed mathematical tools based on complex structures of Gaussian states to identify partner subsystems with complete correlations or entanglement.

Result: Pure Gaussian states have unique single-mode partners capturing all correlations, while mixed states split this into a broader correlation partner and a single-mode entanglement partner. These tools apply to multi-mode subsystems as well.

Conclusion: This framework offers a practical approach to map and analyze correlations and entanglement in complex systems, enhancing our understanding of many-body quantum phenomena.

Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify where the total correlations and entanglement with a chosen degree of freedom reside within the rest of a system, in the context of bosonic many-body Gaussian quantum systems. Our results are organized into two main propositions. First, for pure Gaussian states, we show that every correlated mode possesses a unique single-degree-of-freedom partner that fully captures its correlations (consisting of entanglement), and we provide an explicit construction of this partner from the complex structure of the system's state. Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems. Together, these results provide conceptual practical tools to study how bipartite correlations and entanglement are structured and where they can be found in complex Gaussian many-body systems.

Abstract: In this work, we consider a general feedback protocol based on quantum-jump detections, where the last detected jump channel is stored in a memory and subsequently used to implement a feedback action, such as modifying the system Hamiltonian conditioned on the last jump. We show that the time evolution of this general protocol can be described by a Lindblad master equation defined in a hybrid classical-quantum space, where the classical part encodes the stored measurement record (memory) and the quantum part represents the monitored system. Moreover, we show that this new representation can be used to fully characterize the counting statistics of a system subject to a general jump-based feedback protocol. We apply the formalism to a three-level system coupled to two thermal baths operating as a thermal machine, and we show that jump-based feedback can be used to convert the information obtained from the jump detections into work. Our framework provides analytical tools that enable the characterization of key statistical properties of any counting observable under jump-based feedback, such as the average current, noise, correlation functions, and power spectrum.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Grüneisen parameter $Γ^{0\text{K}}_q$ right at critical points (CPs) for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i)}$ for higher $S$, $Γ^{0\text{K}}_q$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii)}$ the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii)}$ the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv)}$ we propose an experimental setup to explore finite size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $Γ^{0\text{K}}_q$ and $S_q$.

TL;DR: 研究使用混合量子-经典Liouville方程（QCLE）来描述具有不同热波长的量子和经典系统动力学，发现QCLE在保持能量和总体一致性方面表现良好，但其密度矩阵元素可能为负值，这表明对角元素类似于伪密度，而不是经典相空间中的密度。通过比较精确量子动态和QCLE演化生成的相空间分布，发现低能态的析出效应存在根本性差异。数值和解析结果表明，QCLE在低维模型中违反了相空间密度的正性，而这一性质应适用于所有物理系统。通过微扰分析验证了这种违反正性的普遍性。研究还发现，随着系统初始能量相对于子系统能级间隙的增加，相空间密度正性的违反程度会降低。研究结果提示，可以利用违反正性的指标来评估混合量子-经典描述的有效性。

Abstract: The mixed quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) provides an approximate perturbative framework for describing the dynamics of systems with coupled quantum and classical degrees of freedom of disparate thermal wavelengths. The evolution governed by the Liouville operator preserves many properties of full quantum dynamics, including the conservation of total population, energy, and purity, and has shown quantitative agreement with exact quantum results for the expectation values of many observables where direct comparisons are feasible. However, since the QCLE density matrix operator is obtained from the partial Wigner transform of the full quantum density matrix, its matrix elements can have negative values, implying that the diagonal matrix elements behave as pseudo-densities rather than densities of classical phase space. Here, we compare phase-space distributions generated by exact quantum dynamics with those produced by QCLE evolution from pure quantum initial states. We show that resonance effects in the off-diagonal matrix elements differ qualitatively, particularly for low-energy states. Furthermore, numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models reveal that the QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, a property that should hold at all times for any physical system. A perturbative analysis of a model system confirms that such violations arise generically. We also show that the violations of positivity of the marginal densities vanish as the initial energy of the system increases relative to the energy gap between subsystem states. These findings suggest that a negativity index, quantifying deviations from positivity, may provide a useful metric for assessing the validity of mixed quantum\textendash{}classical descriptions.

TL;DR: The paper presents a fully digital framework for quantum random number generation that uses system timing jitter to generate random numbers, achieving high entropy and security without quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random number generation is crucial for cryptography and simulations, and quantum methods offer superior security. The paper addresses the challenge of implementing quantum random number generation (QRNG) using classical computational processes.

Method: The approach uses system timing jitter, specifically from hardware and operating system sources, and random permutation processes to mimic the statistical behavior of coherent-state QRNG. This method transforms computational timing variations into Poisson-distributed numbers.

Result: The framework achieves Shannon entropy close to 8 bits per byte and min-entropy exceeding 7.99 bits per byte, outperforming theoretical bounds at scale. The architecture resists side-channel attacks and operates without classical cryptographic post-processing.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that coherent-state QRNG can be entirely realized through classical computational processes, providing mathematically provable uniformity and practical cryptographic security without requiring quantum photonic hardware.

Abstract: We present a fully digital framework that replicates the statistical behavior of coherent-state quantum random number generation (QRNG) by harnessing system timing jitter through random permutation processes. Our approach transforms computational timing variations from hardware and operating system sources into permutation dynamics that generate Poisson-distributed numbers, accurately reproducing the photon statistics of optical coherent states. The theoretical foundation is established by the Uniform Convergence Theorem, which provides exponential convergence to uniformity under modular projection with rigorous error bounds. Extensive experimental validation across multiple parameter regimes and sample sizes up to $10^8$ bytes demonstrates exceptional performance: Shannon entropy approaching 7.999998 bits/byte and min-entropy exceeding 7.99 bits/byte, outperforming theoretical bounds at scale. The architecture inherently resists side-channel attacks through compound timing distributions and adaptive permutation behavior, while operating without classical cryptographic post-processing. Our results establish that coherent-state QRNG functionality can be entirely realized through classical computational processes, delivering mathematically provable uniformity and practical cryptographic security without quantum photonic hardware.

Abstract: Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a useful framework for quantum simulations in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, offering a favorable trade-off between potential quantum speedups and practical resource demands. However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($Δt$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $Δt$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $ε\to 0$ of the error parameter $ε$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $ε\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($ε^2$) vs O($Δt$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $ε$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $ε$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-destructive imaging of light-sensitive samples is crucial for various scientific applications, necessitating methods that avoid light-induced damage while maintaining image quality.

Method: The method uses thermal light and leverages the quantum Zeno effect to reduce light absorption, avoids entangled photon sources, and employs single-photon detectors to increase photon efficiency in imaging.

Result: The technique significantly reduces the absorbed light dose, prevents sample damage, enhances image quality, and actively controls background noise for clearer images.

Conclusion: This approach provides a cost-effective and efficient solution for non-destructive imaging, particularly beneficial for applications involving light-sensitive samples in life sciences and beyond.

Abstract: We propose an interaction-free ghost imaging scheme based on a thermal light source. By utilizing the quantum Zeno-like effect, our approach significantly reduces the light dose absorbed by the sample, thereby effectively preventing sample damage induced by light-matter interactions. Combined with the elimination of entangled photon sources and single-photon detectors, our approach enables significantly more photons to be utilized for image reconstruction, thereby markedly enhancing image quality compared to conventional ghost imaging. We further demonstrate active suppression of background noise via controllable photon loss. Our work offers a practical and cost-effective route to non-destructive, high-quality imaging for light-sensitive samples in fields such as life sciences.

Conclusion: 该研究为刻画量子物质中的真正集体纠缠提供了一种新的方法。

Abstract: We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.

Conclusion: 因此，为了实现高效的VQE算法，选择合适的去梯度策略应综合考虑系统大小和计算预算，而不仅仅是梯度方差这一指标。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms suffer from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish with system size and circuit depth. Although many mitigation strategies exist, their connection to convergence performance under different iteration budgets remains unclear. Moreover, a systematic analysis identifying which state-of-the-art mitigation techniques perform best under specific scenarios is also lacking. We benchmark four approaches, Local-Global, Adiabatic, State Efficient Ansatz (SEA), and Pretrained VQE, against standard VQE on molecular systems from 4 to 14 qubits, analyzing gradient variance up to 50 layers and convergence over 1000 iterations. Our results show that the impact of gradient preservation is iteration-dependent. In the 14-qubit BeH2 system, Pretrained VQE outperforms SEA at 100 iterations despite lower gradient variance, but SEA becomes 2.2x more accurate at 1000 iterations. For smaller systems, SEA achieves near-exact energies (H2: 10^-5 Ha, LiH: 2x10^-4 Ha) with fidelities 0.999, while standard methods plateau early. The results demonstrate that robust barren plateau mitigation depends on aligning the chosen strategy with both system size and available computational budget, rather than treating gradient variance as the sole predictor of performance.

Abstract: The nuclear spin is a prime candidate for quantum information applications due to its weak coupling to the environment and inherently long coherence times. However, this weak coupling also challenges the addressability of the nuclear spin. Here we demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a single on-surface atom using a local scanning probe. We employ an electron-nuclear double resonance measurement scheme and resolve nuclear spin transitions of a single 47Ti isotope with a nuclear spin of I = 5/2. The quadrupole interaction enables to resolve multiple NMR transitions, which are consistent with our eigenenergy calculations. Our experimental results indicate that the nuclear spin can be driven efficiently irrespective of its hybridization with the electron spin, which is required for direct control of the nuclear spin in the long-lifetime regime. This investigation of NMR on a single atom in a platform with atomic-scale control is a valuable development for other platforms deploying nuclear spins for characterization techniques or quantum information technology.

TL;DR:  paper proposes a new scheme combining NLAs and unitary averaging to enable long-distance CV QKD beyond repeaterless bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  quantum key distribution (QKD) is pivotal for secure communication, particularly in continuous-variable (CV) systems which promise higher efficiency. However, realistic conditions such as thermal loss and phase noise pose significant challenges. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a protocol that combines noiseless linear amplifiers (NLAs) and unitary averaging, aiming to overcome limitations in long-distance CV QKD.

Method:  the paper combines NLAs with unitary averaging. NLAs are used to reduce phase noise caused by thermal loss, while unitary averaging mitigates the impact of stochastic noise, including phase noise, in CV states.

Result:  the proposed method enables CV QKD over longer distances than previously possible without repeaters, thus extending the repeat-free bound.

Conclusion:  this advancement brings us closer to practical implementation of CV QKD over significant distances, enhancing secure communication capabilities in quantum networks.

Abstract: Noiseless linear amplifiers (NLAs) serve as an effective means to enable long-distance continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD), even under realistic conditions with non-unit reconciliation efficiency. Separately, unitary averaging has been suggested to mitigate some stochastic noise, including phase noise in continuous-variable states. In this work, we combine these two protocols to simultaneously compensate for thermal-loss effects and suppress phase noise, thereby enabling long-distance CV QKD that surpasses the repeaterless bound, the fundamental rate-distance limit, for repeaterless quantum communication systems.

Abstract: Around the turn of the century, Shor formulated his well-known and still-open conjecture stating that the accessible information of any quantum dichotomy, that is the maximum amount of classical information that can be decoded from a binary quantum encoding, is attained by a von Neumann measurement. A quarter of a century later, new developments on the Lorenz curves of quantum dichotomies in the field of quantum majorization and statistical comparison may provide the key to unlock such a longstanding open problem. Here, we first investigate the tradeoff relations between accessible information and guessing probability in the binary case, thus disproving the claimed monotonicity of the former quantity in the latter that, if true, would have settled Shor's problem in the qubit case. Our second result is to provide a state-dependent generalization of extremality for quantum measurements, to characterize state-dependent extremality for qubit dichotomies, and to apply such results to tighten previous results on the accessible information of qubit dichotomies.

Abstract: Quantum sensing is an emerging field with the potential to outperform classical methods in both precision and spatial resolution. However, the sensitivity of the underlying quantum platform also makes the sensors highly susceptible to their environmental noise. To address this issue, techniques from the field of quantum error mitigation use information about the noise to improve measurement results. We present a novel mitigation technique for quantum sensors to efficiently reverse the effects of any noise that can be described by a completely positive trace preserving map. The method leverages the knowledge acquired by a pre-characterization step of the device to automatically adapt to the complexity of the dissipative evolution and to indicate optimal sensing times $τ$ to achieve the most accurate results. We demonstrate that our method reaches the best achievable sensitivity in noisy single-NV-center magnetometry.
  This work marks a further step toward more resilient quantum sensors with the smallest scale of resolution.

Abstract: Engineering shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond holds the key to unlocking new advances in nanoscale quantum sensing. We find that the creation of near-surface NVs through delta doping during diamond growth allows for tunable control over both NV depth confinement (with a twofold improvement relative to low-energy ion implantation) and NV density, ultimately resulting in highly-sensitive single defects and ensembles with coherence limited by NV-NV interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of our shallow delta-doped NVs by imaging magnetism in few-layer CrSBr, a two-dimensional magnet. We anticipate that the control afforded by near-surface delta doping will enable new developments in NV quantum sensing from nanoscale NMR to entanglement-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised machine-learning framework that discovers optimally compressed representations of quantum many-body ground states. Using an autoencoder neural network architecture on data from $L$-site Fermi-Hubbard models, we identify minimal latent spaces with a sharp reconstruction quality threshold at $L-1$ latent dimensions, matching the system's intrinsic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the use of the trained decoder as a differentiable variational ansatz to minimize energy directly within the latent space. Crucially, this approach circumvents the $N$-representability problem, as the learned manifold implicitly restricts the optimization to physically valid quantum states.

Abstract: Modern navigation systems rely heavily on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), whose weak spaceborne signals are vulnerable to jamming, spoofing, and line-of-sight blockage. As an alternative, the Earth's magnetic field entails location information and is found critical to many animals' cognitive and navigation behavior. However, the practical use of the Earth's magnetic field for geo-localization hinges on an ultra-sensitive magnetometer. This work investigates how quantum magnetic sensing can be used for this purpose. We theoretically derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the estimation error of quantum sensing when using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and prove the quantum advantage over classical magnetometers. Moreover, we employ a practical distributed quantum sensing protocol to saturate CRLB. Based on the estimated magnetic field and the earth's magnetic field map, we formulate geo-localization as a map-matching problem and introduce a coarse-to-fine Mahalanobis distance search in both gradient space (local field derivatives) and corner space (raw field samples). We simulate the proposed quantum sensing-based geo-localization framework over four cities in the United States and Canada. The results report that in high-gradient regions, gradient-space Mahalanobis search achieves sub-kilometer median localization error; while in magnetically smoother areas, corner-space search provides better accuracy and a $4-8\times$ reduction in runtime.

Abstract: Quantum state verification plays a vital role in many quantum cryptographic protocols, as it allows the use of quantum states from untrusted sources. While some progress has been made in this direction, the question of whether the most prevalent type of quantum state verification, namely cut-and-choose verification, can be efficient and secure, is still not answered in full generality. In this work, we show a fundamental limit for quantum state verification for all cut-and-choose approaches used to verify arbitrary quantum states. We provide a no-go result showing that the cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient in the number of rounds and secure. We show this trade-off for stand-alone and composable security, where the scaling of the lower bound for the security parameters renders cut-and-choose quantum state verification effectively unusable.

Abstract: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing causes global economic losses of \$10-25 billion annually and undermines marine sustainability and governance. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides reliable maritime surveillance under all weather and lighting conditions, but classifying small maritime objects in SAR imagery remains challenging. We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips. Using noiseless numerical simulations of the quantum kernels, we find that QKMs are capable of obtaining equal or better performance than the classical kernel on these tasks in the best case, but do not demonstrate a clear advantage for the complex SAR data. This work presents the first application of QKMs to maritime classification in SAR imagery and offers insight into the potential and current limitations of quantum-enhanced learning for maritime surveillance.

Abstract: We study the limitations for defining spatial and temporal intervals when the only available reference frame is a single composite quantum system, whose internal degrees of freedom serve as a temporal reference, a clock, and whose center of mass degrees of freedom act as a spatial reference, a rod. By combining quantum speed limits with the mass energy equivalence of special relativity, we show that spatial localizability and temporal resolution are not independent: sharpening one inevitably blurs the other. Specifically, the internal energy coherence needed for precise timekeeping affects the center of mass dynamics, enhancing position spreading during free evolution. As a result, a single composite system cannot act as a perfect quantum reference frame for both space and time, leading to a Heisenberg like uncertainty relation between spatial and temporal intervals. After analyzing this trade off from an external perspective, we formulate it in a purely relational manner, by means of covariant observables relative to the space time quantum reference frame, uncovering an additional intrinsic uncertainty of order the Compton wavelength of the frame.

Abstract: Simulating the dynamical properties of large-scale many-fermion systems is a longstanding goal of quantum chemistry, material science and condensed matter. Local fermion-to-qubit encodings have opened a new path for practical fermionic simulations on digital quantum hardware where fermionic statistics are not enforced at the hardware level. In this paper, we explore these local encodings from the perspective of the corresponding time-evolution unitaries. Specifically, we propose a new framework for digital implementations of these qubit-encoded fermionic time-evolution unitaries based on \emph{flow sets}, which are one-dimensional subsets of the directed fermionic interaction graph. We find that any local fermionic encoding, when restricted to a given flow set, adopts a simple structure that we can classify systematically. For each categorized flow-set form, we propose a low-depth qubit quantum circuit that implements the time evolution unitary using the stabilizer formalism. As an application of our construction, we introduce novel flow-based decompositions for known two-dimensional encodings, leading to efficient circuit decompositions of time-evolution unitaries. We generally observe a space-time trade-off, where mappings with larger qubit-to-fermion ratios yield shallower time-evolution quantum circuits.

### [51] [Nonreciprocal flow of fluctuations, populations and correlations between doubly coupled bosonic modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11436)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the unusual quantum effects in two-mode bosonic systems under combined linear mode-hopping and nonlinear squeezing interactions, highlighting the system's Hermitian yet non-Hermitian dynamics due to asymmetric quadrature coupling, and the role of an exceptional point in mode population and state conversions. It also explores unidirectional population and correlation flow between modes, driven by squeezed reservoirs, and the interplay between these phenomena and first-order coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is the exploration of new quantum phenomena in coupled bosonic modes, particularly focusing on non-Hermitian dynamics and their applications in quantum information processing and precision metrology. The study of population and correlation flow in such systems could provide insights into the design of novel quantum devices and protocols.

Method: The authors employ analytical modeling of the system's Hamiltonian under combined linear and nonlinear interactions, derive equations governing the quadrature components' dynamics, identify exceptional points, and use numerical simulations to study the system's response to squeezed reservoirs. They also analyze population and coherence flow using these tools.

Result: The key findings include the unidirectional flow of population and correlations between the two modes when the reservoirs are in squeezed states, the critical role of the exceptional point in controlling mode conversions, and the interplay between these phenomena and first-order coherence. The results also reveal limitations in enhancing two-photon correlations for entanglement purposes through population flow.

Conclusion: This paper opens new avenues for the manipulation of bosonic modes in quantum systems through engineered non-Hermitian interactions. The discovery of how exceptional points and squeezed reservoirs influence population and correlation dynamics offers promising prospects for applications in single-mode squeezed state generation and controlled unidirectional population transfer in bosonic chains, with deeper implications for quantum information science.

Abstract: Interesting new correlation and unidirectional properties of two bosonic modes under the influence of environment appear when the modes are mutually coupled through the simultaneously applied linear mode-hopping and nonlinear squeezing interactions. Under such double coupling, it is found that while the Hamiltonian of the system is clearly Hermitian the dynamics of the quadrature components of the field operators can be attributed to non-Hermicity of the system. It is manifested in an asymmetric coupling between the quadrature components which then leads to a variety of remarkable features. In particular, we identify how the emerging exceptional point controls the conversion of thermal states of the modes into single-mode classically or quantum squeezed states. Furthermore, for reservoirs being in squeezed states, we find that the two-photon correlations present in these reservoirs are responsible for unidirectional flow of populations and correlations among the modes and the flow can be controlled by appropriate tuning of the mutual orientation of the squeezed noise ellipses. In the course of analyzing these effects we find that the flow of the population creates the first-order coherence between the modes which, on the other hand rules out an enhancement of the two photon correlations responsible for entanglement between the modes. These results suggest new alternatives for the creation of single mode squeezed fields and the potential applications for controlled unidirectional transfer of population and correlations in bosonic chains.

Abstract: This paper introduces quantum circuit methodologies for pointwise multiplication and convolution of complex functions, conceptualized as "processing through encoding". Leveraging known techniques, we describe an approach where multiple complex functions are encoded onto auxiliary qubits. Applying the proposed scheme for two functions $f$ and $g$, their pointwise product $f(x)g(x)$ is shown to naturally form as the coefficients of part of the resulting quantum state. Adhering to the convolution theorem, we then demonstrate how the convolution $f*g$ can be constructed. Similarly to related work, this involves the encoding of the Fourier coefficients $\mathcal{F}[f]$ and $\mathcal{F}[g]$, which facilitates their pointwise multiplication, followed by the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform. We discuss the simulation of these techniques, their integration into an extended \verb|quantumaudio| package for audio signal processing, and present initial experimental validations. This work offers a promising avenue for quantum signal processing, with potential applications in areas such as quantum-enhanced audio manipulation and synthesis.

Abstract: We revisit the Bell--CHSH scenario for two spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) particles and isolate the precise algebraic origin of the Bell contradiction. On the quantum side, spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) is described by a noncommutative spinor (Clifford) algebra acting on the Hilbert space of two spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) particles, with the singlet state yielding the usual correlation \(E(a,b) = -\,a\cdot b\) and Tsirelson's bound \(2\sqrt{2}\). On the classical side, the standard Bell assumptions amount to describing all measurement outcomes as \(\{\pm1\}\)-valued random variables on a single Kolmogorov probability space, i.e.\ elements of a commutative algebra \(\mathcal{C}(Λ)\).
  We show that there is no representation of the spinor algebra of spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) (with its singlet state and locality structure) into any such commutative Kolmogorov algebra that preserves the \(\{\pm1\}\) spectra of local spin components and the singlet correlations entering the CHSH expression, under the standard Bell assumptions of locality (factorization) and measurement independence. In this sense, the Bell--CHSH contradiction is exhibited as an algebraic mismatch between a noncommutative spinor/Clifford description of spin and the classical assumption of a single global Kolmogorov space supporting all outcomes. In the language of quantum probability, this is a C\(^*\)-algebraic reformulation of the known fact that the singlet correlations admit no local hidden-variable model with jointly distributed outcomes on one probability space.
  We also give an explicit realization of the same spinor structure within the author's Quantum Index Algebra (QIA) framework, where locality appears as disjoint index slots and the singlet state as a simple index cocycle.

Abstract: Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) is essential for scaling quantum algorithms beyond the limitations of monolithic NISQ devices. However, the current software ecosystem forces developers to manually orchestrate low-level network resources, such as entanglement generation (EPR pairs) and classical synchronization, leading to verbose, error-prone, and non-scalable code. This paper introduces \textbf{NetQMPI}, a high-level Python framework that adapts the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard to the quantum domain using the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) paradigm. Built as a middleware over the NetQASM SDK, NetQMPI abstracts the underlying physical topology, automating network initialization and resource management through a unified Communicator interface. We propose semantic point-to-point primitives and novel collective operations--such as expose and unexpose--that address the constraints of the No-Cloning Theorem by leveraging multipartite entanglement for data distribution. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that NetQMPI decouples algorithmic logic from network size, reducing the code complexity for generating an $N$-node GHZ state from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to constant complexity $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Furthermore, the framework ensures backend agnosticism, enabling the seamless execution of high-level applications on rigorous physical simulators like NetSquid (via SquidASM) and future quantum hardware adhering to the NetQASM standard.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the concept of irreducibility for Quantum Markov Semigroups (QMSs) and its connection to primitivity, positivity improvement, and relaxation towards a steady state. It establishes that under certain conditions, irreducibility, primitivity, and relaxation are equivalent. The paper also provides methods to check irreducibility in specific cases, particularly for uniformly continuous QMSs described by the GKLS form. The exposition is self-contained, synthesizing existing results and offering new proofs and insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of quantum dynamical semigroups is crucial for advancing quantum information theory and quantum thermodynamics. This paper contributes to the theoretical framework by examining key properties of QMSs, such as irreducibility, which is fundamental for analyzing their long-term behavior and convergence properties.

Method: The paper employs a mix of theoretical analysis, operator algebra techniques, and functional analysis to investigate QMSs. It builds on previous work in quantum probability and semigroup theory, adapting and extending existing results to the context of quantum Markov semigroups.

Result: The primary findings include the equivalence of irreducibility, primitivity, and relaxation towards a steady state under the condition that the semigroup possesses an invariant density. Additionally, the paper offers practical criteria for verifying irreducibility in uniformly continuous QMSs by analyzing their generator in the GKLS form.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive analysis of irreducibility for QMSs and its implications for quantum dynamics. It bridges gaps between different areas of quantum theory and offers tools for future research in this field.

Abstract: We present different characterizations of the notion of irreducibility for Quantum Markov Semigroups (QMSs) and investigate its relationship with other relevant features of the dynamics, such as primitivity, positivity improvement and relaxation; in particular, we show that irreducibility, primitivity and relaxation towards a faithful invariant density are equivalent when the semigroup admits an invariant density. Moreover, in the case of uniformly continuous QMSs, we present several useful ways of checking irreducibility in terms of the operators appearing in the generator in GKLS form. Our exposition is as much self-contained as possible, we present some well known results with elementary proofs (collecting all the relevant literature) and we derive new ones. We study both finite and infinite dimensional evolutions and we remark that many results only require the QMS to be made of Schwarz maps.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Macroscopic quantum superpositions are generally unobservable due to the overwhelming suppression by unitary dynamics under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, even when isolated from their environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the reasons behind the unobservability of macroscopic quantum superpositions is essential in quantum physics as it challenges our grasp of quantum mechanics at mesoscopic scales and may have profound implications for quantum information and computation.

Method: The study employs a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, likely involving quantum state modeling, quantum dynamics under thermalization, and measurements of distinguishability.

Result: The research reveals that unitary thermalization processes suppress the observable signatures of macroscopic quantum coherence, making such superpositions effectively invisible to current measurement capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings underscore that thermalization, through unitary evolution, is a fundamental limiter of observing macroscopic quantum effects, independent of environmental decoherence.

Abstract: Macroscopic quantum superpositions are widely believed to be unobservable because large systems cannot be perfectly isolated from their environments. Here, we show that even under perfect isolation, intrinsic unitary dynamics with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis suppress the observable signatures of macroscopic coherence. Using the GHZ state as a representative example, we demonstrate that while fully correlated measurements can initially distinguish a macroscopic superposition from its corresponding classical mixture, generic many-body evolution renders them operationally indistinguishable for most times during the evolution. By analyzing both distinguishability measures and established quantifiers of macroscopic quantumness, we find that equilibration not only hides coherence from accessible observables but also suppresses macroscopic superpositions themselves. These results identify unitary thermalization, independent of environmental decoherence, as a fundamental mechanism that limits the emergence of macroscopic quantum effects.

Abstract: The complexity class Quantum Statistical Zero-Knowledge ($\mathsf{QSZK}$), introduced by Watrous (FOCS 2002) and later refined in Watrous (SICOMP, 2009), has the best known upper bound $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$, which was simplified following the inclusion $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \subseteq \mathsf{PSPACE}$ established in Jain, Upadhyay, and Watrous (FOCS 2009). Here, $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the class of promise problems that admit two-message quantum interactive proof systems in which the honest prover is typically \textit{computationally unbounded}, and $\text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the complement of $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$.
  We slightly improve this upper bound to $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ with a quantum linear-space honest prover. A similar improvement also applies to the upper bound for the non-interactive variant $\mathsf{NIQSZK}$. Our main techniques are an algorithmic version of the Holevo-Helstrom measurement and the Uhlmann transform, both implementable in quantum linear space, implying polynomial-time complexity in the state dimension, using the recent space-efficient quantum singular value transformation of Le Gall, Liu, and Wang (CC, to appear).

Abstract: The Casimir-Polder force acts on polarizable particles due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field that are modified by the presence of material bodies. We investigate the Casimir-Polder interaction for atoms near cylindrical fibers with hollow cores. This geometry represents one of the archetypal configurations encountered in numerous experimental setups designed to control and manipulate atoms in fundamental and quantum technological applications. Specifically, we analyze how the interplay of both geometrical and material-related length scales characterize the interaction, emphasizing the impact of the shell thickness. We develop a flexible and fast-converging numerical scheme for evaluating the interaction over a wide range of atom-cylinder separations at both zero and finite temperature. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analytical investigation of how various material properties modify the Casimir-Polder potential. Finally, we analyze and discuss a number of limiting cases and compare numerical computations with corresponding analytical asymptotic expressions. In particular, in this geometry the Casimir-Polder potential is able to distinguish between an ohmic and non-ohmic description of conductors. One of the most significant outcomes of our work is that the shell thickness emerges as a useful parameter for controlling the interaction, opening avenues for both fundamental physics and applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Open quantum systems play a central role in contemporary nanoscale technologies, including molecular electronics, quantum heat engines, quantum computation and information processing. A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems.

### [62] [Tight bound for the total time in digital-analog quantum computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11619)
*Mikel Garcia-de-Andoin,Mikel Sanz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper describes how digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) removes the necessity for fine-tuning, enabling universal quantum computation with global phase shifts. A tight upper bound is presented for the total consecutive gate synthesis time, linear in the number of two-qubit interactions required for each gate, thereby providing a precise estimation of the time resources required for quantum circuit synthesis. This contributes to a viable method for quantum simulation and algorithm implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to eliminate the dependence on specific commutation properties of the native Hamiltonian by facilitating universal quantum computation through the application of single-qubit gates in addition to the native two-qubit interactions. Understanding this is essential for advancing quantum computing techniques.

Method: The paper employs mathematical analysis to model the system and evaluate the time required for the synthesis. Rigorous proofs are used to establish the tight upper bound, leveraging algebraic properties of gate sequences within the DAQC framework.

Result: The authors derive a tight upper bound for the total time required for the synthesis of each gate, which is linear in the number of two-qubit interactions. This result is achieved by analyzing the sequence of gates and their commutator relations, leading to a precise estimation of the time resources required for quantum simulations and algorithm implementation.

Conclusion: The paper presents a significant advancement in digital-analog quantum computing by providing a precise, tight upper bound for the total time required for gate synthesis. This contributes to the robustness and practicality of DAQC as a method for quantum simulation and algorithm implementation.

Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) is a universal computational paradigm that combines the evolution under an entangling Hamiltonian with the application of single-qubit gates. Since any unitary operation can be decomposed into a sequence of evolutions generated by two-body Hamiltonians, DAQC is inherently well-suited for realizing such operations. Suboptimal upper bounds for the total time required to perform these evolutions have been previously proposed. Here, we improve these limits by providing a tight bound for this crucial parameter, which shows a linear dependence with the number of couplings. This result enables a precise estimation of the time resources needed for quantum simulations and quantum algorithms implemented within the DAQC framework, facilitating a rigorous comparison with other approaches.

Conclusion: 这项工作首次在冷原子自发四波调制平台中实现了OAM到极化的纠缠转换，为将OAM资源与基于极化的量子通信网络集成奠定了基础。这一突破在量子通信和量子计算中具有重要意义，特别是在扩展量子网络连接性和提高信息传输效率方面。

Abstract: We demonstrate polarization-entangled biphotons in a cold-atom double-$Λ$ system, overcoming atomic selection rules that suppress polarization correlations and favor orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement. Using spatial light modulators, we coherently map a selected two-dimensional OAM subspace onto the polarization basis and thereby open an otherwise inaccessible polarization channel. Quantum-state tomography confirms that the mapping preserves the biphoton coherence. The four polarization Bell states are generated with fidelities of $92\text{-}94\%$ with few-percent statistical uncertainties, and an average Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter of $S=2.44$ verifies the survival of nonlocal correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first demonstration of OAM-to-polarization entanglement transfer in a cold-atom spontaneous four-wave mixing platform and establishes a practical interface for integrating atomic OAM resources with polarization-based quantum communication networks.

Abstract: Entangled photon sources (EPSs) are essential building blocks for scalable quantum communication and quantum key distribution (QKD). We present a stable, highly nondegenerate EPS based on type-0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a crossed-crystal configuration, generating photon pairs at 680~nm and 1550~nm when pumped by a 473~nm laser. This wavelength combination, reported here for the first time, simultaneously benefits from the peak detection efficiency of the most of the Si-SPADs in the visible/near-infrared spectral range and the low-loss fiber transmission of the telecom C-band. This configuration provides the most favorable balance between performance and cost for detection using Si-SPADs and InGaAs detectors. The source exhibits a measured spectral bandwidth of 300~GHz, corresponding to a spectral brightness of up to $1.9\times 10^3$~pairs~s$^{-1}$~mW$^{-1}$~GHz$^{-1}$. Heralding efficiencies reach 18~\% (signal) and 34~\% (idler) with Si-SPAD and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) detection. The entangled state achieves visibilities of $(97.3\pm 1.0)\,\%$ in the H/V basis and $(94.9\pm1.6)\,\%$ in the D/A basis, yielding a fidelity of $\geq(96.1\pm1.3)\,\%$. These results establish the presented EPS as a practical wavelength-hybrid platform for fiber-based QKD and emerging long-haul quantum network architectures.

Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are powerful tools used to represent complex quantum many-body states in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, despite their popularity, at present only a rudimentary understanding of their limitations exists. In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore and mitigate limitations in generating macroscopic quantum states using optically levitated nanoparticles by addressing sources of noise in experimental protocols.

Method: The research employs experimental investigation combined with modeling of shot-to-shot noise sources, specifically focusing on electric stray fields and mechanical instabilities during state-expansion protocols using inverted electrical potentials.

Result: The study identifies electric stray fields and mechanical instabilities as key contributors to shot-to-shot fluctuations, leading to limitations in the coherence length of levitated nanoparticles during the protocol.

Conclusion: The findings suggest the need for improved experimental techniques and control mechanisms to reduce noise sources, thereby enhancing the coherence of macroscopic quantum states for potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.

Abstract: Optically levitated nanoparticles are promising candidates for the generation of macroscopic quantum states of mechanical motion. Protocols to generate such states expose the particle to a succession of different potentials. Limited reproducibility of the alignment of these potentials across experimental realizations introduces additional noise. Here, we experimentally investigate and model how such shot-to-shot noise limits the coherence length of a levitated nanoparticle during a state-expansion protocol using a dark, inverted electrical potential. We identify electric stray fields and mechanical instabilities as major sources of shot-to-shot fluctuations. We discuss the resulting experimental requirements for state expansion protocols exploiting inverted potentials.

Abstract: The kernel trick is a widely applicable technique in machine learning domains that maps datasets that are difficult to classify into a computationally friendly feature space. As the dimension of the dataset scales, these kernel calculations can quickly become computationally intractable or data inefficient. In this work, we extend prior efforts in quantum kernel design for Kerr nonlinear devices by implementing time-dependent simulations of a Kerr-qubit coupled to acoustic resonators. For experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity directly induces non-classical behavior in the multimode system, which we use to define and analyze a quantum-enhanced kernel. Finally, we present a brief scaling characterization that demonstrates the computational intractability of classically simulating the kernel as the number of resonators scales.

Abstract: Designing optimal control for multiparameter quantum sensing is essential for approaching the ultimate precision limits. However, analytical solutions are generally available only for simple systems, while realistic scenarios often involve coupled qubits and time-dependent Hamiltonians. Here we numerically investigate optimal control of a two-qubit sensor-ancilla system coupled via an Ising term using Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to minimize the objective function. By seeding the optimization recursively with solutions obtained for smaller coupling strengths and selecting a suitable initial guess, we achieve robust convergence and high precision across a wide range of interaction strengths and field configurations. The proposed approach offers a practical route toward high-sensitivity, robust multiparameter magnetometry and it is applicable to solid-state quantum sensors such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in realistic experimental settings.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice driven by a spatially quadratic and time-periodic potential. Both Hermitian ($J_1 = J_2$) and non-Hermitian ($J_1 \neq J_2$) hopping regimes are analyzed. Within the framework of Floquet theory, the time-dependent Hamiltonian is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian, enabling a detailed study of the quasi-energy spectrum and eigenstate localization as function of the driving frequency $ω$. We identify critical frequencies $ω_c$ at which nearly equidistant quasi-energy ladders emerge, characterized by a pronounced minimum in the normalized variance of level spacings. This spectral regularity, which coincides with a peak in the mean inverse participation ratio (\textrm{MIPR}), leads to robust periodic revivals and Bloch-like oscillations in the time evolution. Numerical simulations confirm that such coherent oscillations persist even in the non-Hermitian regime, where the periodic driving stabilizes an almost real and uniformly spaced quasi-energy ladder.

Abstract: In the transmitter of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system, a dense wavelength-division multiplexer (DWDM) is typically used to combine quantum and synchronization signals and is directly connected to the quantum channel. As a result, it becomes the first optical component exposed to laser-injection attacks. Therefore, understanding the behavior of DWDMs under such attacks is essential for assessing the practical security of QKD systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the characteristics of DWDMs under high-power laser illumination. Our experimental results show that certain DWDM samples exhibit pronounced changes in their spectral features once the injected laser power surpasses a specific threshold. Taking the Trojan-horse attack as an illustrative example, we further perform a theoretical analysis of the resulting spectral side channel and show that it can reduce the maximum secure transmission distance to below 66.9% of its original value. By combining experimental observations with theoretical modeling, this study advances the understanding of the influence of DWDMs on the practical security of QKD systems.

Result: The proposed approach provides a native fermionic simulation method optimized for specific measurement settings, demonstrating potential for efficient computation.

Conclusion: The work opens new possibilities for efficient fermionic simulation on native analog quantum systems, highlighting the importance of tailored quantum architectures for specific computational tasks.

Abstract: Simulating many-body fermionic systems in conventional qubit-based quantum computers poses significant challenges due to the overheads associated with the encoding of fermionic statistics in qubits, leading to the proposal of native fermionic simulators as an alternative. While allowing for fermionic problems to be simulated efficiently, this class of fermionic simulators carries also specific constraints with them and poses other challenges unfamiliar to qubit systems. Here, we propose to pair fermionic modes to form a so-called qubit in second quantisation representation. This allows fermionic gates to be represented as rotations of these second quantised qubits, enabling adaptation of methods for qubit systems. As an application, we use this pairing scheme to represent the measurement of two- and four-point correlators in fermionic simulators with its native gates as a graph problem. Optimising measurement settings is then analysed with various analytical and algorithmic methods.

Conclusion: This research validates qubit-ADAPT-VQE's robustness for highly entangled systems, enhancing the potential of VQA algorithms in NISQ applications.

Abstract: While variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, their scalability is often hindered by the barren plateau problem. Among the proposals that have demonstrated robustness against this issue, the ADAPT-VQE algorithm stands out for ground state estimation, primarily due to its iterative ansatz construction. Although ADAPT-VQE has been extensively benchmarked on molecular Hamiltonians, where the ground states typically exhibit low entanglement, its performance for highly entangled ground states remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore a variant of this algorithm known as qubit-ADAPT-VQE, assessing its ability to achieve ground states with substantial entanglement in spin models. We focus on four-qubit systems and employ an algebraic entanglement classification to identify distinct entanglement classes among ground states, and consider a representative of each class as an initial state to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Our findings highlight the versatility of qubit-ADAPT-VQE, demonstrating that it accurately reaches the ground state across all entanglement classes and initial energy values.

Abstract: High-fidelity two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in systems of two fluxonium qubits; however, the realization of scalable quantum processors requires maintaining low error rates in substantially larger architectures. In this work, we analyze a system of four inductively coupled fluxonium qubits to determine the impact of spectator qubits on the performance of a \textsc{cnot} gate. Our results show that spectator-induced errors are strongly suppressed when the transition frequencies of the spectator qubits are sufficiently detuned from those of the active qubits. We identify favorable frequency configurations for the four-qubit chain that yield \textsc{cnot} gate errors below $10^{-4}$ for gate times shorter than 100 ns. Leveraging the locality of the nearest-neighbor coupling, we extrapolate our findings to longer fluxonium chains, suggesting a viable path toward scalable, low-error quantum information processing.

Abstract: Calculating the molecular ground-state energy is a central challenge in computational chemistry. Conventional methods such as the Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction scale exponentially with molecular size, limiting their applicability to large molecules. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative by mapping molecular Hamiltonians by qubits, enabling cheaper computational scaling. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to formulate molecular ground state calculations as discrete optimization problems, addressable by quantum annealing. However, these efforts have been limited by previous generations of hardware and suboptimal annealing techniques. Here, the $H_{2}O$ ground-state problem is mapped to an Ising Hamiltonian using the Xian-Bias-Kas (XBK) method. By taking advantage of enhanced qubit connectivity and shorter embedding chains, it is solved with a more than doubled probability of achieving Hartree-Fock-level solutions with respect to the most advanced predecessor. Advanced annealing strategies extend Hartree-Fock-level accuracy to significantly larger problem instances, enabling solutions that use nearly 2.5 times more physically embedded qubits than the largest cases previously reported and allowing to improve annealing results by two orders of magnitude, reaching an energy difference of 0.120~Hartree relative to Hartree-Fock. These results show tangible progress toward practical quantum annealing applications in NISQ era.

Conclusion: 这一结果展示了Bohmian mechanics在量子化过程中的潜在重要性，并为理解经典与量子力学之间的联系提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory to describe microscopic phenomena. It was derived in different ways over the past 100 years by Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Feynman. At the same time, other interpretations have been suggested, including the Bohm-De Broglie interpretation and the so-called Bohmian mechanics. Here, we show that Bohmian mechanics, which utilizes the concept of the Bohm quantum potential, can also serve as a starting point for quantizing classical non-relativistic systems. By incorporating the Bohm quantum potential into the Vlasov framework, we obtain a mean-field theory that captures the corpuscular nature of matter, in agreement with quantum mechanics within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA).

Abstract: We present a room-temperature Extreme High Vacuum (XHV) system engineered to support the long-duration operation of a trapped-ion quantum processor. Background-gas collisions impose limitations on trapped-ion performance and scalability by interrupting algorithmic execution and, in some cases, ejecting ions from the trap. Using molecular-flow simulations, we optimize the chamber geometry, conductance pathways, and pumping configuration to maximize the effective pumping speed at the ion location. We perform high-temperature heat treatment of stainless steel vacuum components to achieve the desired outgassing rate, guided by quantitative relations of bulk diffusive processes, allowing us to reduce the \(\mathrm{H_2}\) outgassing load to the \(10^{-15}\,\mathrm{mbar\,l\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}\) level. The final pressure in our chamber, measured by a hot cathode gauge, is \(1.5\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{mbar}\), corresponding to the gauge's measurement limit. We measure the local pressure at the ion location by observing collision-induced reordering events in a long ion chain of mixed-isotope Yb\(^+\). From the observed reordering frequency, we extract the average interval between collisions to be \((1.9 \pm 0.1)\,\mathrm{hrs/ion}\). This corresponds to a local pressure of \((3.9 \pm 0.3)\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{mbar}\) at the ion location, assuming that all collisions arise from background H\(_2\) molecules at room temperature. Our demonstration extends the continuous operation time of a quantum processor while maintaining the simplicity of a room-temperature system that does not require cryogenic apparatus.

Motivation: 理解非磁性插入离子对复杂磁性材料的影响，有助于开发新的功能磁性材料，特别是在几何 frustration的背景下。

Conclusion: 利用Mg2+，我们深入阐明了Co10Ge3O16的复杂磁性行为。 studied how Mg2+ doping influences the magnetic structure, observing distinct magnetic features including long-range antiferromagnetic ordering and short-range correlations, suggesting Mgo sites play a key role in mediating these behaviors in the system.

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetism has attracted tremendous attention while chemical doping has been utilized as an important tool to probe frustrated magnetism in various systems. Here we perform a systematic study by doping non-magnetic Mg2+ into a magnetically complicated system, Co10Ge3O16, which contains three frustrated sublattices of Co2+, e.g., triangular Co1, Kagome Co2 and Co3 sublattices. By growing crystals for (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 < x <= 30%), we observed obvious site preference of Mg2+ on Co1 and Co3 sites over the Co2 site. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the high purity of the samples and indicate systematic peak shift, consistent with the loading compositions. Although previously investigated, the magnetic structure and expected magnetic frustration in this system are not fully uncovered. Our temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that the high-temperature magnetostructural phase transition with antiferromagnetic ordering and a low-temperature broad peak are suppressed with Mg2+ doping, while two new magnetic features emerge at high Mg2+ level. Moreover, the structural phase transition from high-temperature R-3m to low-temperature C2/m space group is absent at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, as confirmed by single-crystal XRD. By analyzing the heat capacity and neutron powder diffraction results of the highest doped sample, (Co0.7Mg0.3)10Ge3O16, we speculate that the Co1 site is responsible for the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, while the other two sites are short-range correlated in addition to a Mg2+-induced spin-glass state. This study provides more insights into the complex magnetism in Co10Ge3O16 by using the non-magnetic Mg2+ as a probe. However, detailed magnetic structure requires further efforts on growing large single crystals.

Conclusion: 该多环 SBE fRG 方法是可以纳入更多复杂参数区和现实模型的有益步骤。

Abstract: The functional renormalization group (fRG) is an established tool in the treatment of correlated electron systems, notably for the description of competing instabilities. In recent years, methodological advancements led to the multiloop extension of the fRG, which systematically includes loop corrections beyond the conventional one-loop truncation and yields a quantitatively accurate description of two-dimensional lattice systems. At the same time, the single-boson exchange (SBE) decomposition of the two-particle vertex has been shown to offer both computational and interpretative advantages paving the way to more affordable approximation schemes. We here apply their combination coined as multiloop SBE fRG to the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling. After providing a detailed account of the underlying formalism in physical channels, we analyze the results for the frequency- and momentum-dependent vertex functions. We find that the SBE approximation, i.e., without calculating explicitly multi-boson exchange contributions, accurately reproduces the parquet approximation at loop convergence. The presented algorithmic improvement opens the route for the treatment of more challenging parameter regimes and more realistic models.

Conclusion: 这一工作为理解OTOCs的长期行为和量子多体系统的复杂动力学提供了新的理论框架和方法。

Abstract: We construct an effective field theory (EFT) that captures the universal behavior of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) at late times in generic quantum many-body systems with conservation laws. The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension.

Abstract: We propose a framework that extends the notion of symmetry-protected topological properties beyond the ground-state paradigm to dynamically isolated subspaces formed by exceptional non-thermal energy eigenstates of non-integrable systems, known as quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order. Our findings indicate that scar subspaces can inherit -- and in inhomogeneous cases systematically modify -- the topological character of the SPT ground state, offering a new and experimentally accessible platform for probing symmetry-protected topology beyond the ground-state regime.

Abstract: Recent numerical and theoretical studies on the two-dimensional $J$-$Q_3$ model suggests that the deconfined quantum critical point is actually a $SO(5)$-symmetry-enhanced first-order phase transition that is spontaneously broken to $O(4)$. However, this conclusion has mainly relied on finite-size scaling of the entanglement entropy, lacking direct evidence from physical observables.} Here, we investigate the dynamical spectra of spin and bond operators at the deconfined critical point of the $J$-$Q_3$ model using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and contrasting them with the well-established $\mathrm{O(3)}$ Wilson-Fisher criticality in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. Although both models exhibit two gapless magnon modes in the Néel phase, their critical behaviors diverge strikingly. At the $J_1$-$J_2$ critical point, the Higgs mode becomes gapless, yielding three gapless modes that reflect the full restoration of the $\mathrm{O(3)}$ symmetry. {In the $J$-$Q_3$ model, we instead observe four gapless transverse modes at the either side of the transition. This spectral feature, together with the entanglement entropy results, provides direct evidence for the weakly first-order scenario that the deconfined quantum critical point exhibits an emergent $\mathrm{SO(5)}$ symmetry that spontaneously breaks to $\mathrm{O(4)}$.

Abstract: In quantum materials with multiple degrees of freedom with similar energy scales, intertwined electronic orders with distinct broken symmetries often appear in a strongly coupled fashion. Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.

Motivation: Understanding the applicability and limitations of various iterative solvers is crucial for advancing quantum transport theory and related fields.

Method: Analyzed global iterative methods, including fixed point, Jacobian-free, and Newton-Krylov techniques, in the context of time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory for models like Falicov-Kimball and Hubbard.

Result: Iterative methods require a number of steps linearly scaling with time steps for convergence, but a standard forward fixed point iteration fails to converge. Methods like Newton-Krylov with proper preconditioning could be more efficient for certain cases.

Conclusion: While global solvers show potential, challenges such as improving iterative efficiency and controlling front velocity in error propagation need addressing for broader applicability.

Abstract: Although the Kadanoff-Baym equations are typically solved using time-stepping methods, iterative global-in-time solvers offer potential algorithmic advantages, particularly when combined with compressed representations of two-time objects. We examine the computational complexity and stability of several global-in-time iterative methods, including multiple variants of fixed point iteration, Jacobian-free methods, and a Newton-Krylov method using automatic differentiation. We consider the ramped and periodically-driven Falicov-Kimball and Hubbard models within time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory. Although we observe that several iterative methods yield stable convergence at large propagation times, a standard forward fixed point iteration does not. We find that the number of iterations required to converge to a given accuracy with a fixed time step size scales roughly linearly with the number of time steps. This scaling is associated with the formation of a propagating front in the residual error, whose velocity is method-dependent. We identify key challenges which must be addressed in order to make global solvers competitive with time-stepping methods.

Abstract: Chirality, referring to the absence of mirror and inversion symmetries, is a ubiquitous concept in nature. In condensed matter physics, vigorous research has clarified how chiral materials harbour unconventional electronic and vibrational responses. In parallel, recent studies have demonstrated that chiral structures can be engineered or tuned from achiral precursors. Despite these complementary advances, an integrated understanding of electronic and phononic dynamics, self-organized chiral structures, and their interplay is still lacking. Such an integrated framework is crucial both for elucidating the spontaneous formation and stabilization of chiral structures and for advancing the electronic functionalities of chiral materials. Here, we predict novel spontaneous structural phase transitions unique to chiral crystals with screw symmetry. In quasi-one-dimensional chiral crystals, the phonon frequency renormalized by the electron-phonon coupling depends on the handedness of circular polarization. Consequently, the soft mode encoding the intrinsic phonon angular momentum induces spin-selective Peierls gaps in the electronic band, entailing a helical spin density wave and chiral lattice distortion. We also elucidate the chiral signature of collective modes. Our findings offer new avenues for advanced spintronics applications and crucial insights into the elusive mechanisms underlying the formation process of chirality in nature.

Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is believed to be responsible for many spectral anomalies in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\mathbf{q}\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state.

Abstract: We argue that the low-temperature physics of $S=1$ pyrochlore magnets with a predominantly Ising-like easy-axis exchange coupling $J$ that favors the local tetrahedral body diagonals, and a comparably large easy-plane single-ion anisotropy $Δ=J + μ$ ($|μ| \ll J$) that favors the plane perpendicular to these local axes will exhibit interesting new phenomena due to the competition between $J$ and $Δ$. In the $T/J \rightarrow 0$ limit, we find three low temperature phases as a function of $μ/T$: a short-range correlated paramagnetic phase, and two topologically-distinct Coulomb liquids separated by a $Z_2$ flux confinement transition. Both Coulomb liquids are described at long-wavelengths by a fluctuating divergence-free polarization field and have characteristic pinch-point singularities in their structure factor. In one Coulomb phase, the flux of this polarization field is confined to {\em even} integers, while it takes on all integer values in the other Coulomb phase. Experimental realizations with $|μ| \ll J$ and negative are predicted to exhibit signatures of a transition from a flux-deconfined Coulomb phase to the flux-confined Coulomb phase as they are cooled below $T_{c_2} \approx 1.57|μ|$, while realizations with positive $μ\ll J$ will show signatures of a transition from a flux-deconfined Coulomb liquid to a short-range correlated paramagnet via a continuous $XY$-like transition at $T_{c_1} \approx 0.98 μ$.

Abstract: Delafossite compounds containing rare-earth ions have been proven to be an ideal platform to investigate frustrated magnetic ground states. Here, we discuss two triangular-lattice antiferromagnets, TlErSe$_2$ and TlTmSe$_2$, as potential candidates for hosting exotic quantum states. Powder X-ray diffraction data analysis of the black-color polycrystalline Tl$RE$Se$_2$ ($RE$: Er and Tm) samples confirms the phase purity. Both materials crystallize in the trigonal $α$-NaFeO$_2$ structure ($R\overline{3}m$) with lattice parameters $a$ = 4.1070(4) Å and $c$ = 23.1472(1) Å for the erbium compound and $a$ = 4.0916(1) Å and $c$ = 23.1483(2) Å for the thulium compound. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show an effective moment of $μ_{\text{eff}} = 9.6(2) μ_B$/f.u. ($7.5(1) μ_B$/f.u.) for TlErSe$_2$ (TlTmSe$_2$) for temperatures above 200 K. While $^3$He specific-heat measurements reveal long-range magnetic order below $T_N = 0.42 $K for TlErSe$_2$, no sign of long-range magnetic order was observed for TlTmSe$_2$. Based on our results, we map out the T-H phase diagram for polycrystalline TlErSe$_2$ and discuss the striking difference in the magnetic behavior of TlTmSe$_2$ based on our ab initio quantum chemical calculations.

Abstract: Curvilinear magnetic nanostructures enable control of magnetization dynamics through geometry-induced anisotropy and chiral interactions as well as magnetic field modulation. In this work, we report a curvilinear magnonic crystal based on large-area square arrays of truncated nanospikes fabricated by conformal coating of 3D hierarchical templates with permalloy thin films. Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy reveals anisotropic band structure with multiple dispersive and folded Bloch-type dispersive spin-wave modes as well as non-dispersive modes exhibiting direction-dependent frequency shifts and intensity asymmetries along lattice principal axes. Finite element micromagnetic simulations indicate that curvature-induced variations of the demagnetizing field govern the magnonic response, enabling the identification of modes propagating in nanochannels and other localized on nanospike apexes or along the ridges connecting adjacent nanospikes. The combination of geometric curvature and optical probing asymmetry produces directional dependence of magnonic bands, establishing 3D hierarchical templates as a versatile platform for curvature-engineered magnonics.

*Tanja Đurić,Pinaki Sengupta*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Kagome lattice antiferromagnets exhibit a 1/9 magnetization plateau with possible states like Z_3 quantum spin liquid, valence bond crystals, and chiral spin density waves. Recent experiments suggest Dirac-like spinons, and machine learning indicates a gapless chiral spin density wave.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 1/9 magnetization plateau in Kagome lattice antiferromagnets is a complex and controversial state, likely involving exotic spin orders and topology.

Method: Machine learning combining variational Monte Carlo, symmetry-enhanced neural network quantum states, and flux insertion method was employed to study the plateau state.

Result: The ground state at 1/9 plateau is a gapless 1×1 chiral spin density wave caused by 2k_F instability of the underlying composite Fermi liquid. The spin wave chirality is due to correlated spin order reflecting nontrivial topology.

Conclusion: The plateau state is a gapless chiral spin density wave, inconsistent with Z_3 quantum spin liquids or conventional valence bond crystals.

Abstract: Kagome lattice antiferromagnets exhibit plethora of intriguing phases of matter. Particularly interesting state appears at the magnetic field-induced $1/9$ magnetization plateau observed in several recent experimental studies. The nature and exotic physical properties of the plateau however remain controversial due to an exceptional complexity of the state generated by geometrical frustration. Among candidate states recent studies found a $Z_3$ quantum spin liquid state, a valence bond crystal exhibiting an hourglass pattern and a valence bond crystal state with a $3\times 3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif. Recent torque magnetometry measurements on YCOB single-crystal samples however indicate presence of Dirac-like spinons at $1/9$ magnetization plateau. We study properties of the plateau state using novel machine learning technique that combines variational Monte Carlo, symmetry enhanced neural network quantum states and flux insertion method. Our machine learning study reveals that the ground state at the $1/9$ plateau is a gapless $1\times 1$ chiral spin density wave caused by 2$k_F$ instability of the underlying composite Fermi liquid. The spin wave chirality results from the correlated spin order that reflects its nontrivial topology.

Abstract: Cumulative geometric frustration can drive self-limited assembly and morphology selection through size-dependent energetic costs. However, the slenderness of quasi-one-dimensional systems generally suppresses the formation of long-range longitudinal gradients. We show that the suppression of longitudinal gradients can be overcome by tuning the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse (shear) moduli. We demonstrate the recovery of cumulative frustration across distinct quasi-one-dimensional systems, each frustrated through a different mechanism, by the introduction of a soft response mode.

Abstract: We propose a variant of Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) defined in planar Josephson junctions based on spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in a weak out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetic field induces a linear phase gradient across the junction, generating Josephson vortices that can host low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs). We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the combined effect of the phase gradient and spin-orbit coupling stabilizes an odd-fermion parity ground state, where a single Josephson vortex binds a spinful low-energy degree of freedom that is energetically separated from the other ABSs. This low-energy degree of freedom can be exploited to define a special type of ASQ, which we dub the vortex spin qubit (VSQ). We show that single-qubit gates for VSQs can be performed via flux driving, while readout can be achieved by adapting standard circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques developed for conventional ASQs. We further outline how an entangling two-qubit gate can be performed using an ac current drive. We argue that VSQs offer prospects for a substantial reduction in device complexity and hardware overhead compared to conventional ASQ implementations, while preserving key advantages such as supercurrent-based readout, single-qubit gates, and long-range two-qubit gates.

Abstract: Fractionalization in ideal Chern bands and non-Hermitian topological physics are two active but so far separate research directions. Merging these, we generalize the notion of ideal Chern bands to the non-Hermitian realm and uncover several striking consequences both on the level of band theory and in the strongly interacting regime. Specifically, we show that the lowest band of a Kapit--Mueller lattice model with an imaginary gauge potential satisfies a generalized ideal condition with complex Berry curvature in sync with a complex quantum metric. The ideal band remains purely real and exactly flat yet all right and left eigenstates accumulate at the boundaries on a cylinder, implying a non-Hermitian skin effect without an accompanying spectral winding. The skin effect is inherited by the many-body zero modes, yielding skin-Laughlin states with an exponential profile on the lattice. Moreover, at a critical strength of non-Hermiticity there is an unconventional phase transition on the torus, which is absent on the cylinder. Our findings lead to an extension of topological order in non-Hermitian systems.

TL;DR: Mo.lt.strat,Two-dimensional moiré materials offer a twist-tunable platform for studying electronic properties, primarily in small twist angles where flat bands arise from symmetry-pinned monolayer momenta. However, at larger twist angles, distinctive quasi-one-dimensional flat bands emerge from the Λ valley states in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, originating from optimal interlayer hybridization. These bands exhibit a magic twist-angle of 21.8°, forming six anisotropic channels with spin textures reminiscent of antiferromagnetic ordering. At low energies, the density of states shows a power-law dependence, suggesting enhanced potential for correlated phenomena. This work broadens the scope of moiré engineering to large twist angles in 2D materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of moiré materials and their electronic properties is crucial for advancing our understanding of twist-induced electronic behavior in two-dimensional materials, with potential applications in next-generation electronics and quantum computing. Understanding the emergence of flat bands and their implications for correlated phases is particularly important for tailoring electronic properties for specific applications.

Method: To observe the emergence of flat electronic bands at large twist angles in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, the researchers likely used a combination of first-principles calculations and experimental techniques such as angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) or other low-energy electron imaging methods to map the electronic structure and identify the quasi-one-dimensional bands.

Result: The research demonstrates that at a magic twist angle of 21.8°, bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit distinctive quasi-one-dimensional flat bands with sixfold anisotropic channels and a sixfold alternating spin texture. These bands result from optimal interlayer hybridization between like-spin Λ valleys at the conduction band minimum in the Brillouin zone. The low-energy density of states shows a power-law dependence, which is indicative of the system's potential for hosting correlated phases.

Conclusion: This work provides a new platform for studying correlated phenomena in moiré materials and broadens the scope of moiré engineering to large twist angles in two-dimensional materials. The discovery of flat bands with quasi-one-dimensional dispersion at specific twist angles opens up new avenues for exploring and controlling electronic correlations, which could lead to novel quantum phases and functionalities in these materials.

Abstract: Two-dimensional moiré materials offer a powerful, twist-tunable platform for engineering electronic bands and correlations, though most studies to date have focused on small twist angles where flat bands arise from symmetry-pinned monolayer momenta. Here, we observe the surprising emergence of flat electronic bands with a distinctive quasi-one-dimensional dispersion at large twist angles in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides that originate from the $Λ$ valley states at generic momenta between $Γ$ and $K$ points. These taco-shaped anisotropic bands result from optimal interlayer hybridization between like-spin $Λ$ valleys at the conduction band minimum in the Brillouin zone, resulting in directional band flattening at a magic twist-angle of 21.8$^{\circ}$. The bands form six anisotropic channels with a sixfold alternating spin texture reminiscent of altermagnetic textures. At low energies, the density of states shows a power-law dependence due to the quasi-one-dimensional character, enhancing the potential for correlated phases. Our results provide a new platform for correlated phenomena and broaden the scope of moiré engineering to large twist angles in 2D materials.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a nonlinear response to a linearly polarized monochromatic electromagnetic wave incident at an angle on a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system (ES) in the form of an infinite strip. The 2D ES is situated on a dielectric substrate near a perfectly conducting metal electrode (gate). The entire system is subjected to an external perpendicular constant magnetic field. We use Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves, while the electrons are described within the hydrodynamic approximation using Euler's equations and neglecting electromagnetic retardation effects. The incident electromagnetic wave excites magnetoplasmons in the strip. The fully screened limit is considered when all characteristic dimensions of the system, including the plasmon wavelengths, are much larger than the distance to the gate. This limit allows the linear response to be determined fully analytically. Due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic (convective) term, the excited magnetoplasmon oscillations give rise to a DC current along the strip and a voltage across it. Surprisingly, the relationship between the photocurrent and the photovoltage in resonance is exactly the same as in the classical Hall effect. The photovoltage is a monotonic function of the magnetic field. However, the photocurrent exhibits a minimum, which occurs at specific wavevector directions.

Abstract: A range of twist angles between adjacent surfaces/volumes are intrinsic to natural graphite or artificially design in multi-layer graphene. In addition, stacking faults can be created by the application of mechanic, electric or magnetic fields. Charge and spin transport then occur in relation to the existing twist-angle pattern. In two dimensions, a saddle point in the electronic band structure leads to divergence in the density of states, known as van Hove singularities (vHs). The energy difference between vHs for the conduction and valence bands was found to increase with the twist angle between neighboring graphite domains with respect to the c axis (perpendicular to the graphite planes). In this work, we estimate for the superconducting (SC)-like nano-size multi-layer granular domain in hydrogenated graphitic fibers [1]. We show that this value for and the values found by others for few-layer graphene might actually form the Fibonacci mathematical sequence. Moreover, SC hydrogenated graphite can harbour higher-order topology as reflected in at least quadratic energy gap flattening. Charge transport and magnetization measurements on hydrogenated graphitic fibers have been done using a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System.

Conclusion: 通过实验证实CrSb是交错磁性材料，具有拓扑表面态，实验证实了其磁性和表面态特性。

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the angle dependence of magnetization $M(α)$ for single crystals of CrSb. CrSb belongs to a new class of altermagnetic materials, the small net magnetization is accompanied by alternating spin splitting in the k-space. In addition, CrSb reveals also topological features with Weyl surface states originating from bulk band topology. We observe, that $M(α)$ oscillates around zero value, so magnetization is positive for $M(α)$ maxima and it is negative for $M(α)$ minima. The magnetization reversal curves $M(H)$ are non-linear with low-field hysteresis, but with almost linear high-field branches. The slope of the linear branches well correlates with $M(α)$ oscillations, so it is positive for $M(α)$ maxima and negative for $M(α)$ minima. We demonstrate, that the interplay between the positive and the negative $M(H)$ slopes originates from several magnetic phases in CrSb. In particular, current-carrying topological surface states are responsible for the diamagnetic-like $M(H)$ negative slope, which dominates for the directions of full spin compensation in the bulk CrSb altermagnetic spectrum. Due to the spin-momentum locking, topological surface states are spin-polarized, which is responsible for the low-field hysteresis. Thus, we experimentally demonstrate both the altermagnetic bulk and the topological surface magnetizations for the altermagnetic candidate CrSb.

Abstract: We consider a wire consisting of a conducting ferromagnetic layer and an insulating antiferromagnetic layer that are coupled. The ferromagnet hosts a domain wall, which is dynamically driven by a charge current. We show that for a specific time-dependent current, the domain wall moves according to a Rindler trajectory. This motion excites spin waves in the antiferromagnetic insulator, and their emission spectrum is characterised by an effective temperature analogous to the Unruh temperature, $T_U = \hbar a/2πc k_B$, with a the acceleration of the domain wall, c the maximum antiferromagnetic spin wave velocity, and kB the Boltzmann constant. This thermal signature is a direct consequence of the Unruh effect and could be experimentally observed. Our results establish magnetism as a promising platform for probing relativistic quantum field phenomena. Moreover, since the Unruh effect is inherently linked to entanglement, our proposal provides a route for entangling magnetic domain walls via relativistic effects.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonlinear optical Thouless pumps in the presence of disorder, using optical waveguide arrays. It was previously known that the displacement of solitons in Thouless pumps is quantized and may exhibit integer and fractional transport over the course of the pump cycle. Here, we demonstrate that, in disordered nonlinear pumps, quantization may be maintained despite the presence of disorder, even though it would not be in the linear domain. Moreover, nonlinearity allows pumps to be executed more quickly (i.e., less adiabatically). This may serve as a design principle for integrated non-reciprocal devices based on temporal modulation.

Abstract: High performance devices consisting of interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) on top of single-layer graphene (SLG) are candidates with favorable prospects for sensing applications. Graphene micro ribbons (GMRs) of various widths and IDE design geometries were fabricated and experimentally examined regarding their low-frequency noise (LFN) behavior. Measurements revealed a 1/f behavior and different kinds of trap activity behind it, which were studied through the analysis of random telegraph noise (RTN) signals. Our investigation suggests that adjusting the geometrical characteristics of either the GMR width or the IDE topology can significantly influence the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SLG-based electronics. On the bright side, the results of our study can provide useful guidelines for fabrication decisions to maximize the SNR.

Abstract: Classical nonlinear theories are highly successful in describing far-from-equilibrium dynamics of magnets, encompassing phenomena such as parametric resonance, ultrafast switching, and even chaos. However, at ultrashort length and time scales, where quantum correlations become significant, these models inevitably break down. While numerous methods exist to simulate quantum many-body spin systems, they are often limited to near-equilibrium conditions, capture only short-time dynamics, or obscure the intuitive connection between nonlinear behavior and its geometric origin in the su(2) spin algebra. To advance nonlinear magnetism into the quantum regime, we develop a theory in which semiclassical spin correlations, rather than individual spins, serve as the fundamental dynamical variables. Defined on the bonds of a bipartite lattice, these correlations are inherently nonlocal, with dynamics following through a semiclassical mapping that preserves the original spin algebra. The resulting semiclassical theory captures nonlinear dynamics that are entirely nonclassical and naturally accommodates phenomenological damping at the level of correlations, which is typically challenging to include in quantum methods. As an application, we focus on Heisenberg antiferromagnets, which feature significant quantum effects. We predict nonlinear scaling of the mean frequency of quantum oscillations in the Néel state with the spin quantum number S. These have no classical analog and exhibit features reminiscent of nonlinear parametric resonance, fully confirmed by exact diagonalization. The predicted dynamical features are embedded in the geometric structure of the semiclassical phase space of spin correlations, making their physical origin much more transparent than in full quantum methods. With this, semiclassical spin-correlation dynamics provide a foundation for exploring nonlinear quantum magnetism.

Abstract: Structured optical fields can be used for the injection and control of charge and spin-valley currents. Here, we present a systematical study of these phenomena for interband absorption of structured light in 2D Dirac materials. We derive general expressions for the current density and the quasi-classical generation rate of photoelectrons in the momentum, coordinate, and spin-valley spaces. We reveal mechanisms of the current formation determined by the local and non-local contributions to the optical generation, including the mechanisms related to optical alignment of electron momenta by linearly polarized light, optical orientation by circularly polarized light, and the class of charge and spin-valley photon drags sensitive to the phase and polarization profiles of the optical field. We develop a kinetic theory of electric and spin-valley currents driven by the optical field with spatially inhomogeneous intensity, polarization, and phase and obtain analytical expressions for the current contributions. The theory is applied to analyze the photocurrents emerging in TMDC layers and graphene excited by polarization gratings.

Abstract: Quantum self-oscillatory phases are ubiquitous in driven-dissipative systems. Classically, each phase is defined by its flow pattern and how stationary sets organize phase space (e.g. fixed points and limit cycles), with transitions triggered by local bifurcations or global basin rearrangements. In the quantum regime, these reorganizations are often blurred by density-matrix averaging, and spectral indicators such as the Liouvillian gap can miss changes that unfold mainly in the transients. Here we introduce a topological graph invariant, the molecule, which captures the phase-space connectivity of fixed points and limit cycles. Transitions show up as discrete changes of this invariant, with each form marking a distinct quantum dynamical pattern (e.g. relaxation pathway). The molecule encodes the global topological constraints that govern how stationary sets and their basins can rearrange, clarifies when such rearrangements can affect the Liouvillian modes, and reveals additional transitions that remain hidden in the steady-state spectrum but stem from global changes of the flow topology. Our findings show that flow topology offers a clear and unified way to identify and classify dynamical phases beyond what Liouvillian spectra alone reveal.

Abstract: Matrix isolation spectroscopy enables probing atomic properties in controlled cryogenic environments. We present a spectroscopic study on neutral barium atoms embedded in a neon cryogenic crystal at 6.8 K, extending previous investigations performed in other noble gas hosts. The visible and near-infrared emission spectra were recorded under two different laser excitation schemes. First, 10-ns laser pulses at 355 nm were used to directly excite high-lying energy levels of barium, enabling the observation of fluorescence cascades. Second, a tunable continuous-wave laser operating between 700 nm and 900 nm allowed us to determine the matrix-induced shifts of barium energy levels relative to their vacuum values, as well as the inhomogeneous linewidths of the observed transitions and to perform lifetime measurements. Our results confirm multiple radiative pathways and matrix-induced relaxation channels affecting the 5d6s and 6s6p barium manifolds. Furthermore, we present the first lifetime measurement of the barium 5d6s 3D1 state in a neon crystal, yielding 0.39 \pm 0.02 s, with a predicted increase of about 10% at 2 K. The study of fluorescence and spectroscopic properties of barium isolated in neon represents an important step toward future searches for the electron electric dipole moment using barium monofluoride in neon matrices, where neutral barium atoms may act as unavoidable impurities and potential sources of background and systematic limitations.

### [107] [Pole skipping from universal hydrodynamics of (1+1)d QFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11024)
*Richard A. Davison,Hanzhi Jiang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper examines the stress tensor thermal two-point function in holographic QFTs at high temperatures, showing consistency with the universal hydrodynamic theory proposed for late-time dynamics, particularly explaining the locations of pole skipping points and their relation to butterfly velocity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding hydrodynamic behavior in thermal quantum field theories is crucial for connecting high-energy physics, condensed matter physics, and holography.

Method: The authors analyze holographic QFTs to study the stress tensor's two-point function, identifying pole skipping points and comparing their locations with resummation of hydrodynamic derivatives near the lightcone.

Result: The findings align with the universal hydrodynamic theory, specifically predicting the butterfly velocity in holographic theories.

Conclusion: This work provides evidence for universal late-time hydrodynamic behavior in (1+1)d QFTs, linking pole skipping phenomena to hydrodynamics through holographic methods.

Abstract: (1+1)d QFTs provide a tractable arena for understanding the emergence of hydrodynamics in thermal states. At high temperatures this process is governed by the weak breaking of conformal symmetry, and so in this limit many features of the hydrodynamic theory that emerges have been argued to be universal. In this paper we study aspects of the stress tensor thermal two-point function in holographic QFTs of this kind and show that they are consistent with the universal hydrodynamic theory proposed to apply at late times. Specifically, we identify the locations of the `pole skipping' points in momentum space at which there is an intersection of poles and zeroes of this two-point function in holographic QFTs. Although these points lie outside the regime where the hydrodynamic theory is controlled, we show that their locations are consistent with those found by resumming the hydrodynamic derivative expansion near the lightcone. For example, this resummation of the universal hydrodynamics correctly predicts the butterfly velocity of holographic theories.

*Hao Geng,Jesús Huertas,Andreas Karch,Lisa Randall,Dawson Thomas*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper argues that global symmetries are absent in quantum gravity due to information loss, supported by island setups where symmetry is broken and holography is realized differently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the nature of global symmetries and information loss in quantum gravity, particularly through AdS/CFT correspondence and island models.

Method: Analyzes AdS/CFT setups, constructs island models with global symmetries, examines symmetry breaking via entanglement islands.

Result: Global symmetries are tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to detectable black hole hair (wet hair) and resolving the Harlow-Shagoulian puzzle through holographic anomaly cancellation.

Conclusion: Quantum gravity lacks global symmetries because information is lost to the bath, and island setups provide a consistent framework to explain these phenomena.

Abstract: A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair"); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian.

Result: 研究证明了通过适当组织的局部单元覆盖量子极限区域，可以有限化复杂性。

Conclusion: 该研究为有效场理论的复杂性提供了一种量化方法，并展示了其几何结构的重要性。

Abstract: Motivated by the idea that consistent quantum field theories should admit a finite description, we investigate the complexity of effective field theories using the framework of effective o-minimality. Our focus is on quantifying the geometric and logical information required to describe moduli spaces and quantum-corrected couplings. As a concrete setting, we study pure $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Yang-Mills theory along its quantum moduli space using Seiberg-Witten elliptic curves. We argue that the complexity computation should be organized in terms of local cells that cover the near-boundary regions where additional states become light, each associated with an appropriate duality frame. These duality frames are crucial for keeping the global complexity finite: insisting on a single frame extending across all such limits would yield a divergent complexity measure. This case study illustrates how tame geometry uses dualities to yield finite-complexity descriptions of effective theories and points towards a general framework for quantifying the complexity of the space of effective field theories.

Conclusion: 我们为AdS与CFT对偶寻找了一个新的兼容性条件。

Abstract: We propose a new consistency condition for the compatibility of a gravitational effective field theory in AdS with a dual holographic description in terms of a family of large-$N$ CFTs. Using large-$N$ factorization of correlation functions combined with a properly defined notion of single- and multi-particle operators, we argue that the cubic scalar bulk couplings for fields dual to operators with extremal arrangements of the conformal dimensions, i.e. $Δ_i=Δ_j+Δ_k$, should vanish. We apply this criterion to the 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ effective supergravity theory describing the simplest DGKT AdS$_4$ vacua in type IIA string theory and show that it is non-trivially satisfied. In addition, we calculate explicitly all non-vanishing three-point correlation functions of low-lying scalar operators in the putative 3d CFTs dual to these AdS$_4$ string theory backgrounds.

Abstract: Non-local interactions naturally arise in the ADM formalism after solving the constraint equations and substituting their solutions back into the action. However, the effects of these non-local operators on loop corrections to cosmological correlators remain largely unexplored. Extending the analysis of arXiv:2503.21880 , in this work we compute the $1$-loop bispectrum during slow-roll inflation, including the inverse-Laplacian operators present at cubic and quartic order in the ADM action (in the spatially flat gauge). These non-local vertices introduce non-trivial angular dependencies that significantly complicate the evaluation of loop integrals. We find that the diagrammatic rules of arXiv:2503.21880 for identifying poles and branch cuts in correlators without explicit integration remain valid even in the presence of such non-local interactions. Finally, we derive the flat-space limit of the $1$-loop inflationary correlator and verify it with explicit examples, thereby establishing a direct correspondence between its leading total-energy singularities ($ω_T\rightarrow0$) and the flat-space scattering amplitude.

Our construction is model-independent and based on the general principles of conformal symmetry.

Abstract: The perturbative expansion of two-point functions of lowest dimension supersymmetric operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and ABJM theory exhibits uniform transcendental weight. Inspired by this, we construct an explicit basis of uniformly transcendental master integrals for these correlators, through four loops in four and three loops in three dimensions. In terms of these bases, the two-point functions simplify to rational linear combinations. Conversely, such explicit bases of uniformly transcendental integrals can be useful for other applications.

Abstract: We formulate a `master' partition function in three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superspace that realises, upon integrating out complementary superfields, both the electric Maxwell--Chern--Simons (MCS) theory and its magnetic $S$-dual: a non-gauge Deser--Jackiw self-dual massive vector times a decoupled level-$k$ Chern--Simons term. The two descriptions share the topological mass $M=\frac{g^{2}k}{2π}$ and obey an exact partition-function identity $\mathcal Z_{\rm mag}(g_m^2,k)=\mathcal Z_{\rm ele}(g_e^2,k)$ with $g_e g_m=2π$, mapping a weakly coupled MCS theory to a strongly coupled Deser--Jackiw CS theory. Special limits reproduce pure Chern--Simons/Gaiotto--Witten ($g^{2}=0$) and Maxwell/compact-scalar duality ($k=0$). We extend the construction to a non-Abelian U$(N)$ gauge group obtaining $\mathcal N=2$ Yang--Mills--Chern--Simons on the electric side and a massive non-gauge vector coupled to level-$k$ Chern--Simons on the magnetic side; the interaction terms between the massive vector and the Chern-Simons term vanish in the Abelian case. Decomposing the $\mathcal N=2$ vector into an $\mathcal N=1$ vector and a real-linear multiplet factorises the master action and yields the $\mathcal N=1$ counterparts. This uplifts the bosonic duality formulated recently to $\mathcal N=2$ and clarifies its non-Abelian and $\mathcal N=1$ reductions.

Abstract: We study irregular representations of Virasoro algebra associated with half-integer order singularities, which arise naturally in the 2d CFT description of Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1, A_{\text{even}})$ and $(A_1, D_{\text{odd}})$. While integer-rank irregular states admit a well-established free-field construction, the half-integer case is more subtle due to the presence of branch cuts. In this note, we present two equivalent constructions of half-integer irregular representations. The first one is based on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-twisted free boson, which is motivated from the monodromy structure of Hitchin system. The second one employs a recursion relation of the Virasoro eigenvalues recently proposed in the literature. We explicitly demonstrate the equivalence of these two parameterization schemes at rank $3/2$ and $5/2$. Our analysis clarifies the structure of half-integer irregular modules and provides tools for computing the corresponding irregular states relevant for Argyres-Douglas theories.

Abstract: Motivated by some previously known facts from mathematical and physics literature, we explore certain relations between 3-dimensional topological gauge theories with continuous and finite gauge groups, commonly known as Chern-Simons (CS) and Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories, respectively. Specifically, we consider the continuous and finite gauge groups to be the same algebraic group over the complex numbers and a finite field, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ example and consider the relationship on the level of the corresponding partition functions on closed 3-manifolds. Mathematically, these are Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev and DW invariants. We find that the asymptotics of the DW theory when the number of elements of the finite field is large recovers the leading asymptotics of the CS theory at large level when the 3-manifold contains no hyperbolic components. As a byproduct, we develop efficient techniques to count the number of points over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ of $\mathrm{SL}(2)$ representation varieties of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, possibly with weights pulled back from a chosen class in $H^3(\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{F}_q),\mathrm{U}(1))$.

Abstract: This thesis primarily dives into investigating the details of four-dimensional vacua within String Theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the first and second part of the thesis, we study the fibred Calabi-Yau and M-theory moduli stabilization scenario. We consider both flux-stabilized models and non-perturbative stabilization methods. We perform a holographic analysis to determine the spectrum of the assumed dual $CFT_3$ to understand its AdS/CFT implications. For the flux stabilization, which relies on a large complex Chern-Simons invariant, moduli have integer dimensions similar to the DGKT flux-stabilized model in type IIA. For the non-perturbative stabilization, the results are similar to race-track models in type IIB.
  In the last part of the thesis, we solve the Wheeler DeWitt equation for the planar Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole in a minisuperspace approximation. We construct semiclassical Wheeler-DeWitt states from Gaussian wavepackets that are peaked on classical black hole interior solutions. By using the metric component $g_{xx}$ as a clock, these states are evolved through both the exterior and interior horizons. Close to the singularity, we show that quantum fluctuations in the wavepacket become important, and therefore the classicality of the minisuperspace approximation breaks down. Towards the AdS boundary, the Wheeler-DeWitt states are used to recover the Lorentzian partition function of the dual theory living on this boundary. This partition function is specified by an energy and a charge. Finally, we show that the Wheeler-DeWitt states know about the black hole thermodynamics, recovering the grand canonical thermodynamic potential after an appropriate averaging at the black hole horizon.

Abstract: We revisit the renormalization of the gauge coupling in massless QED coupled to a scaleless quadratic theory of gravity. We compare two alternative prescriptions for the running of the electric charge: (i) the conventional $μ$-running in minimal subtraction, and (ii) a ''physical'' running extracted from the logarithmic dependence of amplitudes on a hard scale $Q^{2}$ (e.g., $p^{2}$ or a Mandelstam invariant) after removing IR effects. At one loop, using dimensional regularization with an IR mass regulator $m$, we compute the photon vacuum polarization. We find a clean separation between UV and soft logarithms: the former is gauge and process independent and fixes the beta function, whereas the latter encodes nonlocal, IR-dominated contributions that may depend on gauge parameters and must not be interpreted as UV running. In the quadratic-gravity sector, the photon self-energy is UV finite--the $\lnμ^{2}$ pieces cancel--leaving only $\ln(Q^{2}/m^{2})$ soft logs. Consequently, quadratic gravity does not modify the one-loop UV coefficient and thus does not alter $β(e)$. Therefore, the physical running coincides with the $μ$-running in QED at one loop. Our analysis clarifies how to extract a gauge and process independent running in the presence of gravitational interactions and why soft logs from quadratic gravity should not contribute to $β(e)$.

Abstract: We study entanglement entropy for ball-shaped regions in excited states of holographic conformal field theories. The excited states are prepared by the Euclidean path integral in the CFT with a source turned on for some double-trace operator, with a small, $O(1)$ amplitude $λ$. On the gravity side, the double-trace operator deforms the bulk geometry as well as the entanglement structure of the state of bulk matter fields. By the quantum extremal surface formula, this leads to a deformation of the shape of the entanglement wedge, an effect which becomes manifest in the entanglement entropy at $O(λ^2 G_N)$. On the CFT side, we explicitly calculate the entanglement entropy perturbatively in the source amplitude to $O(λ^2)$, in terms of modular-flowed correlation functions of double-trace operators. We then evaluate these modular-flowed correlation functions using Witten diagrams. This calculation involves a Schwinger-Keldysh contour ordering prescription in the bulk, which we motivate using analytic continuation from Euclidean replica correlators. Focusing on a particular graviton-exchange diagram, we rewrite it in a form where it manifestly reproduces the canonical energy term present in the quantum Ryu-Takayanagi formula, including the shape deformation of the entanglement wedge due to backreaction and quantum effects.

Motivation: The paper introduces a novel approach to study conformal field theories (CFTs) with defects, which is relevant for understanding how quantum field theories behave in spacetimes with boundaries or defects.

Method: The authors use a Wick rotation and analytic continuation to relate global AdS_{d+1} with static dS_{d+1}, introducing CFT_d generators with a nonstandard adjoint action. They also introduce a global defect operator to reproduce the real-scalar two-point function and show that PT symmetry is spontaneously broken in CFT_2 vacua with a central charge having an imaginary part. Additionally, they derive integral identities for bulk and defect correlators.

Result: The key result is a unified framework for computing CFT_d observables in the presence of global and local defects, which provides new tools for studying conformal field theories with defects.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of CFTs with defects, establishing new methods for calculating their observables and revealing the spontaneous breaking of PT symmetry in certain CFT_2 vacua.

Abstract: We perform a Wick rotation and analytic continuation from global AdS$_{d+1}$ to static dS$_{d+1}$, yielding CFT$_d$ generators with a nonstandard adjoint action tied to dS bulk coordinates.

For other shifts, the poles at infinity are present and need to be considered, however general principles do not fix the residues of the amplitude on these poles. The web of all possible shifts is large, we focus primarily on a case of $(n{-}2)$-line anti-holomorphic shift, which also appears in the context of unitarity cuts of gravity loop integrands. We will find that for one class of shifts the gravity amplitudes at infinity exhibit a peculiar factorization property, quite different from the usual factorization on poles, while for other shifts, they evaluate to the same amplitude on shifted kinematics. We also discuss generalizations of our results to other anti-holomorphic shifts.

### [123] [Sources of matter for wormholes in a k-essence theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11018)

Motivation: 高能物理学和宇宙学中的 wormhole 理论是一个探索虫洞及其在引力和量子力学机制中行为的重要领域。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了 k-essence 能源在 wormhole 模型中的潜在应用途径，揭示了虫洞结构和能量条件的深刻关系。这为未来探索 wormhole 作为量子引力效应的载体提供了一定基础。

Abstract: In this work, we analyze some matter sources associated with wormhole models within a k-essence theory coupled to the gravitational sector through a phantom scalar field. We adopt a spherically symmetric background in (3+1) dimensions and consider two types of systems: electrically and magnetically charged. In the first case, we consider the generalized Ellis-Bronnikov model, in which we fix the k-essence field exponent to $n=1/2$ and take the parameter $m\ge 2$, where $m$ is the parameter that modifies the area of this wormhole model. From this we obtained the expression for the scalar field, the potential, and the associated electromagnetic functions for any values of the parameter $m\geq{2}$. In the second and third models, we consider the scenario of two wormholes that are structured according to the adjustment of the parameters that define their area function $Σ^2$, and in both cases we adopt $n=1/2$. Finally, we show that the violation of the null energy conditions is conditioned by the parameters of the area function.

Result: Robustness validated through simulations, supporting use in different numerical codes.

Conclusion: Enables exploration of beyond GR theories in various NR codes, advancing gravitational physics simulations.

Abstract: Recent developments in the modified harmonic and modified puncture gauges have opened new possibilities for performing stable numerical evolutions beyond General Relativity. In this work, we utilise techniques developed in the aforementioned formalisms to derive a BSSN-type formalism compatible with certain classes of modified gravity theories. As an intermediate step, we also derived modified versions of the Z4 and Z3 formalisms, thereby completing the connection between these formalisms beyond General Relativity. We then test the robustness of the new modified BSSN formalism by simulating the dynamics of black hole systems and benchmarking the results against the modified CCZ4 formulation. These developments enable the exploration of theories beyond General Relativity in many well-known Numerical Relativity codes that use different versions of the puncture gauge approach.

Abstract: While the search for dark matter remains a central focus of modern astrophysics and high-energy physics, neutron stars provide natural laboratories in which the interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter can be studied. In this work we model dark matter as an ultralight bosonic field, which can accrete onto the neutron star and form a composite object bound through gravity. Using long-term, numerical relativity simulations in spherical symmetry, we extract and analyze the frequency spectra of the radial oscillation modes of fermion-boson stars. Our simulations reveal that the fermionic and bosonic components synchronize through gravitational coupling, enriching their oscillation spectrum. This synchronization leads to new multi-state scalar configurations and reshapes the hierarchy of the neutron-star radial modes. We further propose a procedure to compute the values of the new dominant modes as a function of the bosonic mass, and discuss the implications for neutron-star physics and gravitational-wave astronomy.

Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics provides a rare window into the elusive quantum nature of gravity. In the first-order formalism for gravitational theories, where torsion and gauge freedom are present, it has been suggested that the first law of black hole thermodynamics requires a specific gauge choice, which would undermine its fundamental character. By using principal fiber bundles, it has been shown that the first law is independent of this gauge choice. The present work introduces an alternative method that establishes this independence in a more direct manner, thereby reinforcing the status of the first law as a guide toward quantum gravity. This method also facilitates explicit computations of the first law and helps resolve several ambiguities that commonly appear in such analyses.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the feasibility of detecting gravitomagnetic effects generated by gravitational waves, by monitoring the relative orientation of the angular momentum vectors of test particles. We analyze the response of the relative angular momentum direction to all six polarization modes of gravitational waves and estimate the magnitude of its variation during gravitational wave events. Our findings indicate that when test particles possess magnetic moments, applying an external magnetic field of appropriate strength can induce resonant precession of the angular momentum direction under the influence of gravitational waves. This resonance may significantly amplify the gravitational wave signal, potentially enabling its detection with future gyroscope-based detectors. Such detectors would complement existing gravitational wave observatories that rely on gravitoelectric effects.

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) presents a novel concept for observing gravitational waves from astrophysical sources at sub-Hertz frequencies. Compared to the Earth, the seismic environment of the moon, while uncertain, is known to be orders of magnitude lower, opening the possibility for achieving this sub-Hz band. This band fills the gap between space-based detectors (mHz) and Earth-based detectors (10 Hz to a few kHz). The initial version of LILA, known as LILA Pioneer, calls for non-suspended optics, relying on the moon's resonant modes to respond to gravitational waves. However, the follow-on design, LILA Horizon, requires suspensions to realize in-band free floating test masses and to filter the residual seismic background. This paper will establish baseline designs for these suspensions for different assumptions of the seismic background.

Abstract: We numerically study the approach to the singularity in $\mathbb{T}^{2}$-symmetric cosmological spacetimes containing a non-stiff perfect fluid satisfying a linear equation of state $p=Kρ$, $K \in [0,1)$. Near the singularity, the dynamics are found to be local and oscillatory. In particular, our results show, for the first time, that the fluid velocity in inhomogeneous cosmologies develops mixmaster-esque oscillations consistent with the generalised BKL conjecture of Uggla et al. Moreover, we find these fluid oscillations are responsible for the development of local inhomogeneities in the matter density of the early universe.

Abstract: The event horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole has been well studied and the singular behavior of the Schwarzschild metric on horizon is understood as a coordinate singularity rather than an essential singularity. One demonstration of this non-singular behavior on horizon was provided by Fronsdal in 1959, by finding a global isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild metric into a six-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Isometric embeddings for the Reissner-Nordström metric have also been constructed, but they only embed the region external to the inner horizon or in a single Eddington-Finkelstein patch. This paper presents a global isometric embedding for the maximally extended Reissner-Nordström spacetime into a nine-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. We present the solution in terms of explicit local four-dimensional coordinates, and also as a level-set of functions of the higher-dimensional embedding spacetime. While the Reissner-Nordström embedding presented has several similarities to the Fronsdal embedding of the Schwarzschild metric, the presence of the second horizon requires additional embedding coordinates and terms not found in the Fronsdal embedding, in order that the embedding is defined and finite on each horizon.

Abstract: Three theoretically plausible techniques to developing a fractional scalar field cosmological model are pointed in this paper; the time-dependent kernel weighted action being then selected. Upon this choice, we proceed to establish a fractional cosmological model in $n$ dimensions considering the FLRW metric and a generalized version of the Sáez-Ballester (SB) theory. Our study focuses on the following purposes. Firstly, to investigate the fundamental gravitational structural features of the model, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the field equations, the fulfillment of the Bianchi identities, the associated conservation laws, and the application of the second Noether theorem at the background and first-order perturbation levels. Moreover, the model's distinguishing characteristics and theoretical differences from the corresponding standard scenarios are also investigated.
  Secondly, we aim to obtain exact analytical solutions and analyze the time evolution of key cosmological quantities, considering the integration constants influence, and the number of spacetime dimensions, and the fractional parameter effects. Furthermore, the model's predictions are compared with those of the corresponding standard models and observational data.
  Lastly, we propose new ideas to further generalize our model, with a focus on constructing an effective potential and investigating the conditions under which bounce solutions may emerge.

Abstract: In a previous work, the regular cosmological volume function $τ_V$ was introduced as an alternative to the regular cosmological time function of Andersson, Galloway, and Howard. In this paper, we show that in many cases of interest, $τ_V$ is a continuously differentiable temporal function. This leads to a canonical splitting of the metric tensor, and induces a canonical ``Wick-rotated" Riemannian metric. We also provide some further results and examples related to the cosmological time and volume functions.

Abstract: As in thermodynamics, the celebrated first law of black hole mechanics relates infinitesimal changes in the properties of nearby equilibrium states of black holes (without reference to any physical process that causes the transition). The second law is a qualitative statement that the area of an event horizon cannot decrease under appropriate physical assumptions. These laws are generalized. The new first law applies to black holes in general relativity that can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium and refers to \emph{finite} changes that occur due to \emph{physical processes}. The new second law is a \emph{quantitative} statement that relates the change in the dynamical horizon area with the flux of energy falling into the black hole in a physical process.6

Abstract: We present a mechanism for the emergence of cosmic acceleration within the mean-field approximation of Group Field Theory models of quantum gravity. Depending on the interaction type, the resulting cosmological dynamics can either feature a late-time attractor corresponding to a dynamical dark energy phase, often with characteristic phantom behavior, including in models inspired by simplicial gravity, or instead support an early slow-roll inflationary epoch driven by the same underlying quantum-gravitational effects. This emergent inflation, effectively captured by a single-field description, can sustain the required expansion, naturally avoids the graceful exit problem, and appears to transition into a persistent, non-accelerating phase consistent with classical expectations.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅扩展了经典恒密度模型的应用范围，还为在紧凑星体精确工程中设计更高效路径提供了理论依据。

Abstract: It has recently been proved that, for constant density stars, there is a critical value $Λ^{*}=1$ for the dimensionless density parameter $Λ\equiv 4πR^2ρ_{\text{max}}$ of the star above which the asymptotically measured travel time $T_{\text{s}}$ along a semi-circular trajectory that connects two antipodal points on the surface of the star is {\it shorter} than the travel time $T_{\text{c}}$ along the (shorter) straight-line trajectory that connects the two antipodal points through the center of the compact star [here $\{R,ρ_{\text{max}}\}$ are respectively the radius and the maximum density of the compact astrophysical object]. This intriguing observation provides a nice illustration of the general relativistic time dilation (redshift) effect in highly curved spacetimes. One expects that generic compact astrophysical objects whose dimensionless density parameters are smaller than some critical value $Λ^*$ would be characterized by the `normal' relation $T_{\text{c}}\leq T_{\text{s}}$ for the travel times between the two antipodal points. Motivated by this expectation, in the present paper we prove, using analytical techniques, that spherically symmetric compact astrophysical objects whose dimensionless density parameters are bounded from above by the model-independent relation $Λ\leqΛ^*={3\over2}[1-({{2}\overπ})^{2/5}]$ are always (regardless of their inner density profiles) characterized by the normal dimensionless ratio $T_{\text{c}}/T_{\text{s}}\leq1$.

TL;DR: Memcapacitors based on oxide interfaces show potential for power-efficient neuromorphic architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces memcapacitors with oxide interfaces, addressing limitations of traditional implementations by using simpler materials and avoiding complex fabrication processes.

Method: The study employs a quasi 2D electron gas at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface as electrodes and SiO2/SrTiO3 as the dielectric layer. Capacitance tuning is achieved through lateral floating gate charge localization and gate voltage application, with the capacitance modulated in response to bias shifts.

Result: The memcapacitor system exhibits low-voltage operation, gate tunability, and controllable capacitance hysteresis. A theoretical model successfully explains the experimental data, capturing charge fluctuations and dielectric frequency effects, indicating potential applications in neuromorphic electronics.

Conclusion: This work lays a foundation for oxide-based memcapacitors, offering improvement over conventional methods and emphasizing their suitability for future electronic applications.

Abstract: Current memcapacitor implementations typically demand complex fabrication processes or depend on organic materials exhibiting poor environmental stability and reproducibility. Here, we demonstrate memcapacitor structures utilizing a quasi 2-dimensional electron gas, formed at the crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface, as electrodes and SiO2/SrTiO3 as dielectric layer. The observed memcapacitance originates from the charge localization in a lateral floating gate, while an applied gate voltage enables reversible tuning of the device capacitance. Furthermore, preprogrammed or erased gate biases enable controllable shifts of the capacitance hysteresis window toward positive or negative bias, leading to an enlarged capacitance gap at zero bias. A memcapacitor model developed for this system reproduces the main features of the experimental capacitance hysteresis, capturing the effects of charge fluctuations and dielectric frequency modulation within the oxide layer. The demonstrated low-voltage operation and gate tunability of oxide interface-based memcapacitors highlight their potential for power-efficient, capacitor-based neuromorphic and synaptic electronic architectures.

Abstract: This work reports the electrical characteristics comparison study between Cr2O3 and NiOx based heterojunction diodes (HJD) on halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) grown \b{eta}-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers. Both as-fabricated Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs exhibited forward current density in a range of 130-150 A/cm^2 at 5 V with rectifying ratios >10^10 and a reverse leakage current density at 10^-8 A/cm^2 at -5 V. The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 mΩ*cm^2 and 12.05 mΩ*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs. This study indicates that Cr2O3 is a stable p-type oxide for the realization of robust multi-kV \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs.

Abstract: Elastic metasurfaces offer precise control over elastic waves for applications such as vibration isolation, sensing, and imaging. However, achieving high-efficiency and scattering-free performance with complex functionalities remains a fundamental challenge. While conventional Generalized Snell's Law (GSL) designs suffer from inherent inefficiencies and parasitic scattering, recent alternatives--including impedance-matching methods and diffraction-grating-based metagratings--have sought to overcome these drawbacks. While efficiency improvement has been demonstrated, both methods are limited in generating complex wavefields such as focusing. Here, we propose a direct wave-shaping (DWS) topology optimization framework that bypasses these intermediate concepts and automates the design of high-performance, monolithic elastic metasurfaces. To mitigate the high computational expense, we parameterize the geometry with movable, deformable and interactable elliptical voids, thereby drastically reducing the design variables while enabling holistic optimization that inherently accounts for nonlocal inter-cell couplings. We demonstrate the framework by designing metasurfaces for challenging tasks including high-efficiency longitudinal-to-transverse wave conversion with large-angle beam steering, wavelength-multiplexed beam steering, and both reflective and transmissive metalenses with numerical apertures exceeding 0.99. Compared to state-of-the-art gradient-index, impedance-based, and hybrid designs, our metasurfaces consistently exhibit superior efficiency, significantly reduced spurious scattering, and enhanced focusing capability, with the most demanding transmissive metalens validated experimentally. This work establishes a scalable and computationally efficient pathway to realizing practical, high-performance elastic metasurfaces for advanced wave manipulation.

Abstract: Most contemporary architectures of photodetectors based on two-dimensional materials include global gates for carrier density control and local p-n junctions in the channel. We study the dependence of photocurrent in such detectors on the light modulation frequency, fully taking into account the effects of distributed resistance and gate-channel capacitance. The decay of photocurrent with modulation frequency governs the response time. We find that the maximum modulation frequency is largely determined by the position of light-sensitive junction with respect to the middle of the channel. Largest modulation frequency is achieved for junctions in immediate vicinity of either source or drain contacts, while fast roll-off of the modulation characteristic is observed for junction in the middle of the channel.

Abstract: This study investigates the energy valorization potential of 16 aromatic seed residues (ASW), a by-product generated after essential oil extraction from Mediterranean aromatic and medicinal plants. Driven by the increasing demand for natural bioactive ingredients and the expansion of aromatic crop production, large amounts of residual biomass remain underutilized. Their incorporation into thermochemical conversion routes aligns with circular economy strategies, offering opportunities for renewable energy generation, waste minimization, and the development of value-added bioenergy products. The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive thermochemical, elemental, and structural assessment of ASW to determine their suitability for solid biofuel production (pellets, briquettes), pyrolysis for bio-oil generation, and biochar applications. The samples were analyzed under standardized ISO methodologies to ensure comparability and adherence to industrial fuel quality requirements.

Result: 成功实现了PFP在 <100 ppb水平的检测，进一步验证了纳米结构在SERS中的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了SERS技术在临床呼吸诊断中的高效整合，为后续应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are valuable health indicators, with synthetic breath biomarkers offering rapid and disease specific diagnostics. However, their <100 ppb level exhalation requires mass spectrometry, limiting clinical integration. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers a portable, cost-effective alternative. Yet, detecting synthetic breath biomarkers, with inherently low Raman cross-sections, at <100 ppb remains challenging. We demonstrate SERS detection down to clinically relevant 10 ppb via water-mediated trapping in hydroxylated nanoporous silica-coated plasmonic nanogaps, using pentafluoropropylamine (PFP) as a representative synthetic breath biomarker. Uniform nanogaps, with >1000 times electric field enhancement, were generated between a gold film and gold-silica core-shell nanoparticle assemblies using electric field-driven evaporation. Oxygen plasma treatment hydroxylated the silica, enabling water-mediated hydrogen bonding that strengthened PFP adsorption, confirmed by density functional theory. This mechanism improved SERS sensitivity by 10000 fold, enabling ppb level PFP detection in mouse bronchial fluid and establishing a VOC capturing SERS platform for breath-based diagnostics.

### [143] [Marrying critical oscillators with traveling waves shapes nonlinear sound processing in the cochlea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11646)
*Henri Ver Hulst,Carles Blanch Mercader,Frank Jülicher,Pascal Martin*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates the role of critical oscillators in the cochlea, suggesting a mechanism where distributed systems can achieve amplification without critical slowing down by balancing nonlinear gain and frequency tuning across different stimulus levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the cochlea processes sound across various intensities is crucial, especially considering the trade-offs between sensitivity, frequency tuning, and response time as sound levels change.

Method: The study integrates tonopically distributed critical oscillators in a traveling-wave model of the cochlea, incorporating energy pumping and nonlinear gain, and uses this model to quantitatively describe experimental data.

Result: The model, with a single set of parameters, successfully predicts a range of experimental data, demonstrating that distributed nonlinear systems can achieve reliable sound processing without the associated downsizing effects of critical slowing.

Conclusion: This finding contributes to the understanding of how the cochlea maintains responsiveness across varying sound levels while mitigating the drawbacks of criticality in biological systems.

Abstract: The cochlea's capacity to process a broad range of sound intensities has been linked to nonlinear amplification by critical oscillators. However, while the increasing sensitivity of a critical oscillator upon decreasing the stimulus magnitude comes with proportionally sharper frequency tuning and slower responsiveness -- critical slowing down, the observed bandwidth of cochlear frequency tuning and the cochlear response time vary little with sound level. Because the cochlea operates as a distributed system rather than a single critical oscillator, it remains unclear whether criticality can serve as a fundamental principle for cochlear amplification. Here we tackle this challenge by integrating tonopically distributed critical oscillators in a traveling-wave model of the cochlea. Importantly, critical oscillators generically provide spatial buildup of energy gain from energy pumping into the waves and a key nonlinearity. In addition, our nonlinear model accounts for viscoelastic coupling between the oscillators. The model produces, with a single set of parameters, a family of cochlear tuning curves that quantitatively describe experimental data over a broad range of input levels. Overall, the interplay between generic nonlinear properties of local critical oscillators and distributed effects from traveling waves gives rise to a collective nonlinear response that preserves the power-law responsiveness afforded by criticality, but without paying the price of critical slowing down.

Conclusion:  该研究通过巧妙的方法，扩展了Camassa-Holm激波模型的泊松结构，为进一步研究其性质奠定了基础。

Abstract: We establish quadratic Poisson brackets for the generalized Camassa--Holm peakon structure introduced in \cite{AFR23}. The calculation is based on the halving of the spectral parameter dependent $r$-matrix used to define the linear Poisson structure of this model. This quadratic structure, together with the linear one, establish the bi-Hamiltonian structure of the generalized Camassa--Holm peakon model. \\ When the deformation parameter tends to $\pm2$, the spectral parameter dependence drops out, and we recover the linear and quadratic Poisson structure of the Camassa--Holm peakon model. \\ When the spectral parameter tends to the fixed points of the involution defining the halving, we recover the Ragnisco--Bruschi deformation of the Camassa--Holm peakon model, thereby establishing its quadratic Poisson structure.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic Aubry Andre lattice arranged along a spiral curve. In this setup, the changing angle of the spiral naturally stretches and compresses the distances between neighboring sites, which in turn modulates the hopping amplitudes.
  The onsite potential itself remains the familiar AA form, but this geometry induced variation in the hopping dramatically changes how the system behaves both in its energy spectrum and in how its states localize.Using inverse participation ratios together with a full multifractal analysis, we find that curvature makes the system localize much more easily, even at relatively small quasiperiodic strengths. It also produces clear windows where the eigenstates become strongly multifractal. This shows that quasiperiodicity and geometry do not act independently rather, they reinforce one another in shaping the wavefunctions. Overall, we observe a smooth evolution of the states from extended, to multifractal, and finally to strongly localized. Our results pave the way for creating tunable quasiperiodic and geometry-driven localization effects in photonic waveguide arrays, ultracold atoms, mechanical metamaterials, and nanoscale platforms.

Abstract: We investigate the spatial and temporal scales of dynamical quantum phase transitions in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the strong interaction limit. Using Jordan-Wigner transformation, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the subsystem Loschmidt echo, and systematically investigate how its properties vary with subsystem size. It is found that when the subsystem is sufficiently large, it exhibits logarithmic divergence identical to that of the full system Loschmidt echo, yielding a critical exponent of zero. We also obtain the required subsystem size and temporal resolution for detecting dynamical quantum phase transitions using the subsystem Loschmidt echo. It is expected that the present results provide a reliable foundation for further experimental investigations.

Abstract: Quantum droplets (QDs) in weakly interacting ultracold quantum gases are typically characterized by mean-field theories incorporating Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) quantum fluctuations under simplified zero-range interaction assumptions. However, bridging these models to broader physical regimes like superfluid helium requires precise understanding of short-range interatomic interactions. Here, we investigate how finite-range interactions--next-order corrections to zero-range potentials--significantly alter QDs mechanics. Using a consistent effective theory, we derive an analytical equation of state (EOS) for three-dimensional bosonic mixtures under finite-range interactions at zero temperature. Leveraging the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, we demonstrate that interspecies attraction facilitates bosonic pairing across components characterized by the non-perturbative parameter of $Δ$, leading to nonuniversal LHY terms that encode short-range interaction details while recovering previous universal QDs EOS in the zero-range limit. Extending superfluid hydrodynamic equations for two-component systems, we predict fractional frequency shifts in breathing modes induced by these nonuniversal terms. Experimental observation of these shifts would reveal critical insights into QDs dynamics and interatomic potential characteristics.
