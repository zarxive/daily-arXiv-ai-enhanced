Here we demonstrate that these improvements arise from differences in the one-particle density matrix that are encoded into the non-canonical Fock matrix and not from the nature of the KS orbitals, as is commonly assumed. Equipped with this insight, KS-CCSD(T) can be leveraged to achieve near-chemical-accuracy for electronic and thermochemical properties of transition-metal dimers and main-group compounds. Most strikingly, KS-CCSD(T) qualitatively recovers the entire Cr$_2$ potential energy surface, a notorious failure case for HF-CCSD(T) and single-reference density functional theory. We further introduce a density difference diagnostic that identifies multireference character and guides practitioners toward rational selections of optimal references at mean-field cost. These results establish KS-CCSD(T) as a practical route to treat strong correlation within the \"gold standard\" framework, and this has immediate implications for machine learning potential development and materials research, areas that heavily rely on KS-DFT for model-parameter fitting."}

Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) provides a rigorous framework for incorporating NQEs, but its practical applicability is often limited by the slow and strongly system-dependent convergence with respect to the number of beads. Here we introduce path-integral generalized smoothed trajectory analysis (PIGSTA), a post-processing framework for the systematic incorporation of NQEs into atomistic simulations, using either classical or path-integral molecular dynamics trajectories. By applying analytically defined convolution kernels to simulation trajectories, PIGSTA corrects the frequency-dependent discretization error associated with a finite number of beads, without modifying the underlying dynamics. For harmonic systems, PIGSTA recovers the exact quantum-mechanical limit at any bead number, whereas standard PIMD becomes exact only in the infinite-bead limit. More generally, the method significantly improves the convergence of thermodynamic and structural observables at finite bead numbers and provides an internal, reference-free diagnostic of bead-number convergence based on the consistency of energy and force estimators. We assess PIGSTA for ambient liquid water and for the Zundel cation at ultralow temperature, representing a particularly demanding case for bead-number convergence. In both systems, PIGSTA reproduces the converged PIMD limit and enables physically consistent results at reduced bead numbers when convergence criteria are satisfied. Owing to its post-processing nature and negligible additional computational cost, PIGSTA offers a practical and broadly applicable approach for incorporating NQEs into atomistic simulations."}

We present a joint experimental-theoretical investigation of dimethyl phosphate (DMP-) in aqueous solution, an established model system of the sugar-phosphate backbone. Utilizing 31P-NMR spectroscopy as probe of phosphate-ion association, variations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ content exhibit a systematic shielding of the 31P chemical shift (δiso(31P)) with moderate temperature dependence. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio (GIAO-DF-LMP2) level of theory are used to reveal the microscopic mechanism. Simulations are performed for a configurational ensemble of DMP-ion geometries and their first solvation shells, demonstrating (i) the spatial convergence of changes of the nuclear shielding constant σiso(31P), (ii) the intramolecular geometric origin of short-timescale σiso(31P) fluctuations and (iii) an average shift of σiso(31P) of about 3-5 ppm upon contact ion pair formation with Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions. A quantitative analysis of δiso(31P) for varying ion content and temperature allows us to extract the temperature-dependent fraction of the contact ion pair species, indicating that solvent separated or free ion pairs are the energetically preferred species.

We introduce mimyria, a modular and automated framework that orchestrates electronic-structure reference calculations, trains atom-resolved machine-learning response models, and generates IR and Raman spectra from MD trajectories within a unified workflow. We introduce the polarizability gradient tensor (PGT) as a novel atom-resolved machine-learning target property for Raman spectroscopy, complementing the established atomic polar tensor (APT) for IR spectroscopy. As a necessary prerequisite, we demonstrate how both PGTs and APTs can accurately be computed from electronic-structure theory, validate them across formally equivalent derivative formulations, and thereby benchmark their numerical consistency. We then employ machine learning as an efficient surrogate to represent the validated APT and PGT response functions on aqueous benchmark systems. We validate the trained models directly at the level of the spectrum against explicit ab initio reference calculations and find that IR and Raman spectra converge with surprisingly small training sets. Moreover, spectral agreement improves more rapidly than the root-mean-square error (RMSE). While RMSE is straightforward to compute, statistically converged reference spectra are generally impractical to obtain, motivating the need to relate model-level errors to observable-level accuracy. By connecting these complementary error measures, we provide practical guidelines and early-stopping criteria for achieving sufficient spectral fidelity.

Therefore, the neighbourhood of the GC black hole is a naive opportunity to test modified theories of gravity. In this work, effect of $f(R)$ gravity near the black hole is studied. The difference of pericentre shift between GR and $f(R)$ gravity is studied for compact orbits having semi-major axis equal to and below $a=1000$ au (S0-2 like orbits). In a model dependent approach, we choose $f(R) \\propto R^2$ (power law gravity) model which is cosmologically motivated and study the deviation in orbital pericentre shift for both zero spin and non-zero spin of the black hole. It is found that effect of $f(R)$ gravity becomes prominent for compact orbits. In model independent approach to $f(R)$ gravity with the generic scalaron fields ($ψ=f'(R)$), we extract the parameters of $f(R)$ gravity from the current bounds on Parametrised Post Newtonian (PPN) parameters ($γ, β$) near the GC black hole. The screening of $f(R)$ gravity is also investigated for these bounds on PPN parameters. It has been found that sufficiently massive scalarons ($10^{-16}$ eV) are completely screened but light and intermediate mass scalarons ($10^{-22}$ eV and $10^{-19}$ eV) are unscreened towards S0-2 like orbits as well as in the orbit of the newly discovered short period star S4716 ($a=407$ au). The possibility of detection of the $f(R)$ gravity effects due to these unscreened scalarons is forecasted with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs)."}

The BBU instability induces oscillations in the trailing bunch, which are detrimental to its beam quality. When the instability is large, assuming little mitigation from ion motion and energy spread, the beam suffers emittance growth, and charge can be kicked transversely out of the plasma channel. The detrimental effect on beam quality is substantially worse at high efficiencies, which places constraints on the achievable power efficiency in applications such as linear colliders, where maintaining the beam quality is required. In this paper, we present the first experimental signatures of the BBU instability in data taken in the E302 experiment at the FACET-II facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. We use a specific beam-optical setup and a novel method to probe for transverse instabilities on diagnostic screens downstream of a magnetic dipole spectrometer.

Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \\cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $κ(δ)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $δ$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $κ(δ)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $κ(δ)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(π,π)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $ω=0$. The Knight shift, $χ_{sp}(0,0)(δ)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \\approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U < U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $δ_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $δ=δ_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community."}

We show that the bilocal phase responsible for entanglement generation remains well-defined and non-factorizable even in the absence of spacetime geometry. The familiar Newtonian $1/r$ phase, relevant for QGEM protocols, arises only after the conformal invariance is broken by introducing the infinity twistor, which selects a particular spacetime representation of the underlying bilocal quantum interaction.

In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced. As previously reported, laser light can transform a portion of diamond film into a nanostrip. The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections. Here, it is demonstrated that nanochannels with rectangular cross-sections and width-to-height aspect ratios exceeding fifty can form between pairs of nanostrips. With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. By fabricating a nanofluidic device and using microspectrophotometry, it is found that the nanochannels fill with water through capillary action, are resistant to clogging, and are mechanically stable against water filling.

Existing manifold-based approaches often rely on polynomial parameterizations, limiting their effectiveness for general smooth, non-polynomial nonlinearities. To overcome these limitations, we develop a direct optimization framework that employs a Lagrange multiplier formulation to determine the resonance backbone curve on the response surface constrained by the harmonic balance governing equations. Crucially, solving this formulation efficiently requires second-order sensitivity information. Therefore, the primary innovation of this work is the derivation of a analytical Hessian Tensor for generic $C^2$-continuous nonlinear elements. This is achieved by combining an extended Alternating Frequency/Time (AFT) method for computing second-order derivatives with local-coordinate tensor transformations. By integrating this analytical Hessian into the solver, the proposed framework ensures robust convergence and significantly reduces runtime, making it practical for large-scale models where numerical differentiation is computationally prohibitive. The method is validated on three benchmarks of increasing complexity: a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) system with cubic nonlinearity, a beam with cubic stiffness or hyperbolic tangent (tanh) friction nonlinearities, and an industrial-scale finite element model of a compressor bladed disk (blisk) with a friction ring damper. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework accurately and efficiently computes both resonance and anti-resonance backbone curves, providing a robust frequency-domain tool for structures with non-polynomial nonlinearities."}

Whether such superluminality implies a genuine violation of causality in curved spacetime is subtle and remains conceptually nontrivial. In this work we revisit this question using two complementary and largely symmetry-independent diagnostics.\n  First, we analyse the global causal structure of the effective (optical) metric governing DH photon propagation and identify conditions under which it remains stably causal, thereby excluding the formation of closed causal curves. Second, from a quantum-field-theoretic perspective, we examine microcausality by treating the gravitational background as a fixed Lorentz-breaking field and applying flat-spacetime analyticity bounds to the photon commutator within the geometric-optics regime of the EFT.\n  For two representative examples, a circular photon orbit in Schwarzschild and a linear trajectory in a two-black-hole geometry, we find that, within the regime of validity of the DH effective theory, both diagnostics indicate that the superluminal photon propagation is causally benign. Our results do not constitute a general definition of microcausality in curved spacetime, but provide a controlled and instructive check of causal consistency for EFT superluminality in gravitational backgrounds."}

We have employed the state-of-the-art relativistic Fock space coupled cluster approach as well as the configuration interaction with many-body perturbation theory method to calculate the energy levels, the transition amplitudes, the branching ratios, and the hyperfine structure parameters of the lowest excited states in Ac+.

Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer)."}

Here we demonstrate broadband continuous frequency tuning in a non-Hermitian laser array achieved solely by controlling the pump currents. We show that in two coupled sub-lasers with frequency detuning ($Δω$) and relative loss ($Δα$), a mode-switching boundary emerges in the ($Δω$, $Δα$) parameter space, shaping the frequency landscape of the lower-loss supermode. The topology of this boundary comprises pseudo-symmetric (PS) and pseudo-symmetry-broken (PSB) branches connected at an exceptional point (EP). When tuning trajectories cross the PS branch, frequency tuning is discontinuous, whereas trajectories crossing the PSB branch enable continuous tuning; trajectories through the EP yield the maximum continuous tuning range. Experiments using two coupled terahertz quantum cascade lasers demonstrate continuous tuning over 10 GHz, enabled by arbitrarily many combinations of pump currents. Extending this approach to a multi-element array further expands the continuous tuning range to 163 GHz. These results establish a general route to broadband continuous tuning in moving-part-free semiconductor lasers and highlight the potential for dynamic eigenvalue engineering in non-Hermitian photonics and beyond."}

In addition to constructing experiments using radiopure materials and handling in underground laboratories, it is necessary to understand and reduce known backgrounds in data analysis. The Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless double beta Decay is searching for this decay using 76Ge-enriched high-purity germanium detectors submerged in an active liquid argon veto. A significant background in LEGEND is surface events from shallowly-impinging radiation on detector surfaces. In this paper we introduce the Collimated Alphas, Gammas, and Electrons (CAGE) scanning system, an internal-source scanning vacuum cryostat, designed to perform studies of surface events on sensitive surfaces of HPGe in a surface-lab. CAGE features a collimated radionuclide source inside a movable infrared shield that is able to perform precision scans of detector surfaces by utilizing three independent motor stages for source positioning. This allows detailed studies of pulse shapes as a function of source position and incident angle, where defining features can be extracted and exploited for removing surface backgrounds in data analysis in LEGEND. In this paper, we describe CAGE and demonstrate its performance with a commissioning run with 241Am. The commissioning run was completed with the source at normal incidence, and we estimate a beam spot precision of 3.1 mm, which includes positioning uncertainties and the beam-spot size. Using the 59.5 keV gamma population from 241Am, we show that low-energy photon events near the passivated surface feature risetimes that increase with radial distance from the detector center. We suggest a specific metric that can be used to discriminate low-energy gamma backgrounds in LEGEND with similar characteristics."}

We investigate the excitation dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive interaction confined in a potential well with finite depth and width driven by a strong oscillatory pulse field. By numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Crank-Nicolson method and split operator method, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the evolution of density distribution in real space and that in momentum space, and the occupation distribution in energy space. It is shown that cold atoms with weak interaction oscillate as a whole body in a finite space when the amplitude of pulse drive is not strong enough. During the evolution atoms occupy the bound states with larger probability. Increasing the driving strength or atomic interactions promotes the excitation of atoms into continuum states and their diffusion out of the potential well, leading to complex structures or even interference-like patterns in the momentum distribution. The number of cycles in the pulse envelope plays a crucial role in the dynamical behavior: High-frequency driving can suppress diffusion and maintain localization. Furthermore, repulsive atomic interactions can enhance high-harmonic generation yields by several orders of magnitude.

The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits. In the integrable regime, where the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated, we observe a dynamical phase transition between ferromagnetic to paramagnetic spin phases. In contrast, when the spins and phonons are strongly coupled, we observe clear signatures of non-integrable chaotic dynamics, including erratic phase-space trajectories and the exponential growth of excitations and entanglement quantified by the one-body Rényi entropy. By quenching from an unstable fixed point in the near-integrable regime, quantum noise can generate correlated spin-phonon excitations. Our numerical calculations, in clear agreement with experiment, reveal the generation of two-mode spin-phonon squeezing, 2.6 dB below the standard quantum limit (4.6 dB relative to the initial thermal state), followed by generalized vacuum Rabi collapses and revivals.

In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced. As previously reported, laser light can transform a portion of diamond film into a nanostrip. The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections. Here, it is demonstrated that nanochannels with rectangular cross-sections and width-to-height aspect ratios exceeding fifty can form between pairs of nanostrips. With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. By fabricating a nanofluidic device and using microspectrophotometry, it is found that the nanochannels fill with water through capillary action, are resistant to clogging, and are mechanically stable against water filling. A versatile platform for producing high-aspect-ratio nanochannels that are optically accessible and fluidically functional is presented, thereby expanding opportunities for advanced applications."}

For a set of TFTs, the subthreshold transfer characteristics can be independently simulated from the experimental shallow defect DoS, with no adjustable parameters. The full transfer curve is simulated by introducing a single parameter: the conduction band tail energy. Additionally, the simulation reveals that the shallow trap density controlling subthreshold behavior can be directly extracted from transfer curves. Finally, a systematic In-enrichment study, combined with DFT+U DoS simulations, enables identification of vacancy cation coordination environments for all experimentally observed subgap peaks. The dominant trap controlling conventional a-IGZO TFT performance is centered at ~0.32 eV below the conduction band mobility edge and is assigned to a Ga-Ga-In oxygen vacancy defect."}

Although the stabilization regime in such fields is theoretically established, its modified properties in the nondipole regime for long laser pulses remains unknown. Here, we numerically investigate the strong-field ionization of an atom in a long XUV laser pulse in the nondipole regime. Our study of the time-dependent quantum dynamics reveals a quasiperiodic modulation of the ionization yield as a function of pulse duration. We demonstrate that the Coulomb-field-induced slow oscillation of the ionized electron wave packet during the interaction is responsible for the observed modulation of the ionization yield. Furthermore, we scrutinize the unusual photon momentum sharing between the photoelectron and the ion in this extreme regime. These effects are observable in upcoming x-ray free-electron laser facilities."}

Besides the low-lying modes, we particularly focus on high overtones, which are physically pertinent due to the substantial deformation of the QNM spectrum triggered by spectral instability. In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods. The high overtones are significantly deformed, owing to the presence of echoes due to the discontinuity. This deformation in the asymptotic QNM spectrum reveals universal features that are largely independent of the specific form of the discontinuity in the potential, seemingly coinciding with those observed in the modified Pöschl-Teller effective potential. We speculate on whether the collective effect of the high overtones has an observational impact on gravitational wave signals."}

Their on-chip integration promises to bring metrology capacity outside of the lab, particularly since they can operate at low continuous-wave pump laser power in the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regime. Yet, such small foot-print and low power comes at a cost: higher noise and overall lower comb power. In particular, this translates to highly challenging detection and locking of the carrier-envelope offset, necessary for complete stabilization of the comb. Recently, Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) of a DKS to a reference laser has been demonstrated as a tool for passive all-optical stabilization of DKS microcombs, with fundamental modification to the DKS and microcomb properties. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of additional power from the reference laser (now part of the DKS) and the KIS phase locking that pins the repetition rate together fundamentally alter the DKS, forcing an energy redistribution to maintain its center of mass. We demonstrate this self-balancing effect theoretically, which in a pure quadratic dispersion resonator leads to reference-dependent recoil. With higher-order dispersion through which the DKS yields phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), we demonstrate that self-balancing increases the DW radiation, experimentally showing a 22 dB increase of comb teeth at 780 nm in an octave-spanning microcomb for efficient deployable carrier-envelope offset detection."}

For ξ> 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for ξ\\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge. The energy momentum tensors for both quantized fields are renormalized to be finite at operator level, which renders the stable vacuum maximally symmetric.

The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits.

Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations. This provides the first fully analytic realization of a finite-thickness, stable gravastar in the Shtanov-Sahni braneworld, highlighting a genuinely geometric mechanism for singularity avoidance in compact objects."}

In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3."}

However, owing to the multiple degrees of freedom of the detector constellation, a linear TTL model requires at least 24 parameters, while a higher-fidelity quadratic model involves up to 60 coefficients, rendering parameter estimation computationally expensive. To accelerate parameter determination, we propose a modified parameter set obtained via a linear transformation of the original angular coupling coefficients, which effectively reduces correlations among TTL noise components. In addition, we perform parameter fitting using an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry configuration, PD4L, rather than the fiducial Michelson configuration.

Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits.

We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set.

Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9968], in this work we propose a practical framework for determining the ensemble N-representability of a p-body matrix. This is accomplished using a purification strategy consisting of embedding an ensemble state into a pure state defined on an extended Hilbert space, such that the reduced density matrices of the purified state reproduce those of the original ensemble. By iteratively applying variational unitaries to an initial purified state, the proposed algorithm minimizes the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between its p-body reduced density matrix and a specified target p-body matrix, which serves as a measure of the N-representability of the target. This methodology facilitates both error correction of defective ensemble reduced density matrices, and quantum-state reconstruction on a quantum computer, offering a route for density-matrix refinement. We validate the algorithm with numerical simulations on systems of two, three, and four electrons in both, simple models as well as molecular systems at finite temperature, demonstrating its robustness."}

Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries.

A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics."}

In particular, this translates to highly challenging detection and locking of the carrier-envelope offset, necessary for complete stabilization of the comb. Recently, Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) of a DKS to a reference laser has been demonstrated as a tool for passive all-optical stabilization of DKS microcombs, with fundamental modification to the DKS and microcomb properties. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of additional power from the reference laser (now part of the DKS) and the KIS phase locking that pins the repetition rate together fundamentally alter the DKS, forcing an energy redistribution to maintain its center of mass. We demonstrate this self-balancing effect theoretically, which in a pure quadratic dispersion resonator leads to reference-dependent recoil. With higher-order dispersion through which the DKS yields phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), we demonstrate that self-balancing increases the DW radiation, experimentally showing a 22 dB increase of comb teeth at 780 nm in an octave-spanning microcomb for efficient deployable carrier-envelope offset detection."}

This mechanism is highly promising for next-generation, room-temperature terahertz applications, particularly in high-speed, sensitive detection and imaging. In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion. The results are described by the developed microscopic theory based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation approach."}

Vandermonde matrices of the eigenvalues play a central role in the theory. This proposal directly finds the pseudo-distribution using weak measurements of the generator of position moments (momentum translations). While the pseudo-distribution can be extracted from the data in a theory-agnostic way, it is shown that under quantum-mechanical formalism, the predicted pseudo-distribution is identified with the Kirkwood-Dirac pseudo-distribution. We discuss the construction of both the joint pseudo-distribution and a conditional pseudo-distribution, which is closely connected to weak-value physics. By permuting position and momentum measurements, we give a prescription to directly probe the canonical commutation relation and verify it for any quantum state. This work establishes the theory of a characteristic function approach to pseudo-distributions, as well as providing a constructive approach to measuring them directly."}

We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied.

Whether such superluminality implies a genuine violation of causality in curved spacetime is subtle and remains conceptually nontrivial. In this work we revisit this question using two complementary and largely symmetry-independent diagnostics.\n  First, we analyse the global causal structure of the effective (optical) metric governing DH photon propagation and identify conditions under which it remains stably causal, thereby excluding the formation of closed causal curves. Second, from a quantum-field-theoretic perspective, we examine microcausality by treating the gravitational background as a fixed Lorentz-breaking field and applying flat-spacetime analyticity bounds to the photon commutator within the geometric-optics regime of the EFT.\n  For two representative examples, a circular photon orbit in Schwarzschild and a linear trajectory in a two-black-hole geometry, we find that, within the regime of validity of the DH effective theory, both diagnostics indicate that the superluminal photon propagation is causally benign. Our results do not constitute a general definition of microcausality in curved spacetime, but provide a controlled and instructive check of causal consistency for EFT superluminality in gravitational backgrounds."}

This is achieved by building from recently developed models of quasiparticle density, mapping radiation-induced qubit error rates onto a quantum error channel and simulation of a simple surface code. We also provide a performance metric to quantify the resilience of a QEC code to radiation impacts. Additionally, we sweep various parameters of chip design to test mitigation strategies for improved QEC performance. Our model approach is holistic, allowing for modular performance testing of error mitigation strategies and chip and code designs."}

This bulk phase shift admits a holographic interpretation as of the thermal momentum-space two-point function of a scalar operator in the CFT in the Regge limit. At small impact parameter, the phase shift acquires an imaginary part signaling inelastic scattering, obscuring the interpretation of time delay and deflection which become complex-valued. However, in a holographic CFT these quantities can also be extracted from the so called bulk-cone singularities of the position space thermal correlator. Extending this analysis to small impact parameters, we find that the position-space correlator develops a singularity precisely when a null geodesic reflects off the black hole singularity and reaches the opposite boundary. This provides a more robust identification of bulk time delay and angular deflection through singularities of position-space correlators."}

In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced. As previously reported, laser light can transform a portion of diamond film into a nanostrip. The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections. Here, it is demonstrated that nanochannels with rectangular cross-sections and width-to-height aspect ratios exceeding fifty can form between pairs of nanostrips. With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. By fabricating a nanofluidic device and using microspectrophotometry, it is found that the nanochannels fill with water through capillary action, are resistant to clogging, and are mechanically stable against water filling. A versatile platform for producing high-aspect-ratio nanochannels that are optically accessible and fluidically functional is presented, thereby expanding opportunities for advanced applications."}

In general, the deformation mixes the chord basis of the Hilbert space in the seed theory, which we order through a modification of the Lanczos algorithm. The resulting chord number in the ordered basis represents a wormhole length at a finite cutoff in the bulk. We study the thermodynamic properties of the deformed theory; the evolution of $n$-point correlation functions with matter chords; the growth of complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state; and the entanglement entropy between the double-scaled algebras for a given chord state. The latter, in the triple-scaling limit, manifests as the minimal codimension-two area in the bulk following the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.

Distinguished from trusted-device QRNGs whose security depends on characterized devices, semi-device-independent (semi-DI) QRNGs permit partial devices to be defective or even maliciously manipulated, which achieves a good trade-off between generation rate and security. In this paper, we propose a semi-DI QRNG that resists general attacks while accounting for finite-size effects. The protocol requires no rigorous characterization of the source and measurement devices other than limiting the energy of the emitted states, significantly reducing the demands on practical QRNG systems. Leveraging the tight Kato inequality for correlated variables, we show that our protocol generates more randomness than it consumes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scheme on a continuous-variable system with ternary inputs of states. Heterodyne detection is employed to enable phase compensation through data postprocessing, alleviating the stringent requirement on system stability. The system operates at 100 MHz, achieving a net random number generation rate of 1.165 Mbps at 5.3x10^9 rounds. Our work offers a promising approach to achieve both the robust security and high generation rate with a simple experimental setup."}

This bulk phase shift admits a holographic interpretation as of the thermal momentum-space two-point function of a scalar operator in the CFT in the Regge limit. At small impact parameter, the phase shift acquires an imaginary part signaling inelastic scattering, obscuring the interpretation of time delay and deflection which become complex-valued. However, in a holographic CFT these quantities can also be extracted from the so called bulk-cone singularities of the position space thermal correlator. Extending this analysis to small impact parameters, we find that the position-space correlator develops a singularity precisely when a null geodesic reflects off the black hole singularity and reaches the opposite boundary. This provides a more robust identification of bulk time delay and angular deflection through singularities of position-space correlators."}

Quantum technologies offer a fundamentally new means of shaping economic behavior by introducing non-classical correlations between decision-makers. Here we demonstrate a prototype quantum stock market in which entanglement between traders' valuations mitigates the runaway devaluation characteristic of speculative busts. Using reinforcement-learning agents trading a single commodity, we show that replacing classical valuations with quantum-correlated qubit-encoded valuations stabilizes prices and increases the AI traders' net worth relative to a classical market, where instead agents rapidly converge to liquidation strategies that collapse the asset value. To explain this behavior, we formulate and analyze a quantized version of the $p$-guessing game, a canonical model of speculative dynamics. Quantum entanglement and phase coherence reshape the strategic landscape, eliminating the pathological pure-strategy Nash equilibrium that drives market collapse in the classical game, while mixed-strategy equilibria remain non-degenerate and avoid bust-type outcomes. These results identify quantum correlations as a novel, endogenous mechanism for market stabilization and, more broadly, demonstrate the utility of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for uncovering optimal strategies in complex decision-making frameworks with quantum degrees of freedom."}

A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics."}

Treating the ACE2--Spike interface as an open quantum system embedded in a biological environment, we simulate how vibrational interactions and environmental memory reshape the coupled receptor--ligand dynamics and modulate vibrationally assisted electron transfer (VA-ET). Using a Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation (NMSSE) approach, we simulate electron transfer between donor and acceptor states in ACE2 modulated by a specific vibrational mode of the Spike protein. The influence of environmental memory (non-Markovian dynamics) and non-Condon effects (vibrational modulation of electronic coupling) are analyzed in detail. In the Markovian limit with an Ohmic bath, population dynamics reduce to exponential kinetics, and extracted transfer rates agree with semiclassical Marcus--Jortner predictions in the appropriate regime. Beyond the Markovian, high-temperature limit, we observe clear deviations: non-exponential decay, coherent oscillatory features, and enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational frequency. Incorporating off-diagonal system--bath coupling alongside diagonal coupling shows that nuclear motion can dynamically gate electron tunneling, sharpening the frequency selectivity of the VA-ET mechanism. Finally, a structured (sub-Ohmic) environmental spectral density with long-lived correlations (``memory'') preserves electronic--vibrational coherence over longer times, amplifying vibrational selectivity under non-Condon coupling.

For the non-minimally coupled massless real scalar field with ξRφ^2 term in the Lagrangian (mass can be introduced by shift of ξ), only when ξ\\le 5/48, the quantized Hamiltonian is spontaneously non-negative and the vacuum is well defined. For ξ> 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for ξ\\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge.

In the literature, the quantum state preparation algorithm by Sun et al. is known to be optimally bounded, defining the asymptotically optimal width-depth trade-off bounds with and without ancillary qubits. In this work, a simpler algebraic decomposition is proposed to separate the preparation of the real part of the desired state from the complex one, resulting in a reduction in terms of circuit depth, total gates, and CNOT count when $m$ ancillary qubits are available. The reduction in complexity is due to the use of a single operator $Λ$ for each uniformly controlled gate, instead of the three in the original decomposition. Using the PennyLane library, this new algorithm for state preparation has been implemented and tested in a simulated environment for both dense and sparse quantum states, including those that are random and of physical interest.

Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness.

Furthermore, we simulate complex many-body quantum dynamics, exemplified by the Bose-Hubbard model. Such quantum simulation tasks have long been considered beyond the reach of photonic hardware limited to linear operations. These capabilities, enabled by our extensible architecture, establish a viable route towards photonic quantum simulation and fault-tolerant quantum computing."}

In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology.

Furthermore, QSA naturally accommodates a constrained, trainable data-embedding that ties quantum state overlaps to data-level similarities. We find a gate complexity dominant scaling O(T d^2) for QSA, versus O(T^2 d) classically, suggesting an advantage in the practical regime where the sequence length T dominates the embedding size d. In simulations, we show that our QSA-based quantum transformer learns sequence prediction on classical data and on many-body transverse-field Ising quantum trajectories, establishing trainable attention as a practical primitive for quantum dynamical modeling."}

From this result, we derive an integrated fluctuation theorem and a Clausius-like inequality that unifies the first and second laws in terms of invariant work and coherent heat. Entropy production is identified with the relative entropy between forward and backward probability measures on the gauge-reduced space of thermodynamic trajectories, revealing irreversibility as a geometric consequence of limited observability. The third law emerges as a singular zero-temperature limit in which thermodynamic orbits collapse and entropy production vanishes.

In current superconducting quantum chips, fixed coupling is used as it is easier to scale, but it is limited by unwanted static ZZ interaction during single qubit operations, which degrades system performance. To overcome these challenges, we have introduced a first-of-its-kind hybrid tunable-coupling architecture that connects four fixed-frequency transmon qubits using a single coupler. This hybrid coupler uses off-resonant Stark drives to tune ZZ strength between qubit pairs. Experimentally backed simulation results indicate that our proposed hybrid design maximizes the qubit connectivity while reducing control overhead.

The framework incorporates quantum-authenticated Byzantine fault tolerance, ensuring security against malicious nodes while maintaining compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) constraints. Our theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees under heterogeneous noise conditions, while numerical simulations demonstrate that CEAS maintains 10-15 percentage points higher accuracy compared to entanglement-oblivious baselines under coordinated Byzantine attacks, achieving 90 percent Bell-pair utilization despite coherence time limitations.

The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos.

Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power."}
