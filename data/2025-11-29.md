Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Force transmission at large length scales is crucial for such biological functions as cell motility and morphogenesis. The networks that transmit these forces are malleable, patterned by active forces generated at the microscale by biological motors. In this paper we explore a simple model of a non-linear fiber network which has only two modes of deformation, but exhibits diverse mechanical phases with distinct large-scale response, tuned by the strength of a microscopic force dipole. We demonstrate, via numerical simulations, that the network is remodeled by organized patterns of buckling, which lead to a renormalization of the Poisson ratio. Finally, we show that the emergent behavior at large length scales can be ascribed to "mechanical screening" of the force dipole, analogous to dielectric screening of charges in electrostatics.

Abstract: Long-term time-lapse imaging of biological samples requires correcting for focal drift, which would otherwise gradually push the sample out of focus. We present a software-based method that eliminates this time-dependent blur using only a motorized Z-drive, with no additional hardware. The method relies on imaging marks made on the side of the coverslip opposite to the sample. We provide a Beanshell script implementation, evaluate its performance across multiple objectives, and benchmark it against a hardware autofocus system, finding comparable results. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness in live imaging of growing bacterial colonies.

### [3] [Generalizing the Shell Theorem to Constant Curvature Spaces in All Dimensions and Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20852)

Result: The findings align with known results in flat 3D space and generalize a key theorem in cosmology to curved space.

Conclusion: The work contributes to gravitational physics by extending fundamental properties of gravitational potentials to curved geometries, providing insights applicable to cosmology and space physics.

Abstract: A gravitational potential has the spherical property when the field outside any uniform spherical shell is indistinguishable from that of a point mass at the center. We present the general potentials that possess this property on constant curvature spaces, using the Euler-Poisson-Darboux identity for spherical means. Our results are consistent with known findings in flat three-dimensional space and reduce to Gurzadyan's cosmological theorem when the rescaling factor is exactly $1$. Our approach naturally extends to nontrivial spatial topologies.

### [4] [Investigating the Timing Behavior of Compton Scattering in BGO for Time-of-Flight PET](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20864)
*Minseok Yi,Daehee Lee,Alberto Gola,Stefano Merzi,Michele Penna,Simon R. Cherry,Jae Sung Lee,Sun Il Kwon*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: BGO used in TOF-PET detectors shows promise for excellent timing in Cherenkov mode but struggles with inter-crystal scattering (InterCS) events. A dual-pixel detector with segmented SiPM showed that while FED events maintain good timing, InterCS degrades timing resolution. For InterCS, selecting the earlier timestamp improved resolution but there's a significant drop compared to FED. Prompt photon yield also decreased in InterCS events. Overcoming InterCS is crucial for maintaining optimal timing performance in pixelated BGO detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybridizing Cherenkov and scintillation in TOF-PET detectors offers better resolution than either technique alone, making BGO an attractive material. However, the issue of scattering between crystals (InterCS) complicates timing accuracy, prompting research into mitigating this effect to maintain optimal performance.

Method: Experiments used a dual-pixel BGO detector coupled with segmented SiPM readout. Events were classified based on energy deposition into FED, InterCS, and penetration types using energy-weighted positioning and GATE simulations. The impact on timing resolution between FED and InterCS was analyzed, along with changes in prompt photon yield.

Result: While FED events maintain good timing resolution, InterCS significantly degrades this, especially when energy splitting reduces prompt photon yield. The dual-pixel setup improved some metrics but not enough to overcome the scattering issue, emphasizing the need for more advanced timestamping strategies for future BGO TOF-PET systems.

Conclusion: To maintain optimal timing performance in pixelated BGO TOF-PET systems, further advancements are needed to address the issue of inter-crystal scattering. Specifically, time-aware timestamping strategies must be integrated to improve resolution and handle the challenges posed by scattering events.

Abstract: Bismuth germanate (BGO) is gaining renewed attention as a viable material for hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) detectors. While single-crystal studies have demonstrated excellent timing resolution by leveraging prompt Cherenkov photons, practical detector modules based on pixelated arrays introduce a high prevalence of inter-crystal scattering (InterCS) events, complicating timing accuracy. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impact of InterCS on BGO Cherenkov timing using a dual-pixel detector coupled to a segmented SiPM readout. Events were classified into full-energy deposition (FED; primary crystal 511 keV absorption), InterCS, and penetration types via energy-weighted positioning and validated using GATE simulations, which also revealed that over 25% of the experimentally identified full-energy events involved intra-crystal scatter (IntraCS). For InterCS events, the optimal timestamp selection was achieved by choosing the earlier of the two timestamps, yielding a coincidence timing resolution of 221 ps FWHM (831 ps FWTM)-markedly worse than the 184 ps (603 ps FWTM) obtained for FED events. Furthermore, prompt photon yield was found to decrease measurably due to energy splitting: InterCS events averaged 4.73 detected photons in the first 1 ns, compared to 5.76 for FED events. These results emphasize the importance of incorporating time-aware, per-pixel timestamping strategies in pixelated BGO TOF-PET systems to maintain optimal timing performance in the presence of scatter.

Conclusion: The advancement of SNSPDs with tungsten germanide opens new possibilities for applications in remote sensing, thermal imaging, environmental monitoring, and molecular physics.

Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are among the most sensitive single-photon detectors available and have the potential to transform fields ranging from infrared astrophysics to molecular spectroscopy. However, extending their performance into the mid-infrared spectral region - crucial for applications such as exoplanet transit spectroscopy and vibrational fingerprinting of molecules - has remained a major challenge, primarily due to material limitations and scalability constraints. Here, we report on the development of SNSPDs based on tungsten germanide, a novel material system that combines high infrared sensitivity with compatibility for large-scale fabrication. Our detectors exhibit saturated internal detection efficiency at wavelengths up to 29 $\mathrm{μm}$. This advance enables scalable, high-performance single-photon detection in a spectral region that was previously inaccessible, opening new frontiers in remote sensing, thermal imaging, environmental monitoring, molecular physics, and astronomy.

TL;DR: The paper investigates impurity distribution in a Czochralski-grown HPGe crystal, providing detailed dopant concentration mapping and segregation coefficients that help optimize HPGe crystal growth for low-background detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for understanding and controlling impurity segregation in HPGe crystals used for rare-event physics experiments, which directly impacts their performance and scalability.

Method: The researchers sectioned a single HPGe crystal into 37 longitudinal segments and used Hall-effect measurements to determine dopant concentrations in each segment, allowing for a systematic impurity distribution map.

Result: The study determines effective segregation coefficients and initial melt concentrations for key dopants (B, Al, Ga, P) and compares them with theoretical expectations, offering quantitative insights into impurity transport under realistic growth conditions.

Conclusion: The findings are essential for improving HPGe crystal pulling techniques, optimizing impurity control, and enhancing the reliability of large-scale low-background HPGe detectors for rare-event searches.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of rare-event physics experiments depend on large-volume, detector-grade high-purity germanium (HPGe) crystals with precise control of impurity segregation during growth. We report a detailed study of impurity distribution in a single Czochralski-grown HPGe crystal produced at University of South Dakota (USD). The crystal was sectioned longitudinally into 37 segments, enabling the first high-resolution and systematic mapping of dopant profiles along the length of a detector-grade HPGe boule. Hall-effect measurements were used to extract impurity concentrations for boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and phosphorus (P) in each segment. From these data, we determine effective segregation coefficients ($K_{eff}$) and initial melt concentrations ($C_0$) for the dominant dopants and compare them with classical Burton-Prim-Slichter expectations. The results provide quantitative insight into impurity transport and melt-solid partitioning under realistic detector growth conditions. These findings inform process-optimization strategies for HPGe crystal pulling, improve impurity control along the boule, and support the reliable fabrication of large, low-background HPGe detectors for next-generation rare-event searches.

Abstract: Access to Magnetic Resonance Imaging system assembly knowledge can be expanded by leveraging open-source hardware and software, simplified installation requirements, and collaborative training initiatives. To this end, we conducted a three-day workshop to construct an operational 0.27T MRI scanner. The workshop hosted 16 participants, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows, trainers, and students, who collaborated to build the scanner using open-source hardware and software components. Teams were designated to focus on various subsystems, including the magnet, passive shimming, radiofrequency (RF) coils, gradient coils, data acquisition, and reconstruction. Pre-workshop preparation involved simulation-based design processes and fabrication techniques, which incorporated configuring MaRCoS and PyPulseq libraries, CNC machining, and 3D printing. During the workshop, participants assembled an H-shaped magnet, which achieved a peak magnetic field strength of 0.269T. Passive shimming effectively reduced the field inhomogeneity from 3mT to 2mT. A 3 cm diameter RF solenoid was built and tuned to 11.4 MHz. The gradients exhibited less than 5% non-linearity in simulations and were fabricated by CNC machining copper plates. The assembled system was used to acquire a 2D spin echo of a water phantom. Following the workshop, the system was further optimized to scan relaxometry phantoms. A post-workshop survey was carried out, revealing over 87% satisfaction. The constructed scanner represents a valuable platform for educational initiatives, pulse sequence development, and preclinical research imaging efforts.

We show that temporal fluctuations not only enhance the precision of SPADE imaging, but also drastically simplify the measurement required to recover full object information -- in the presence of fluctuations, SPADE can be replaced by the much simpler image inversion interferometry. Both gains are enabled by exploiting temporal cumulants of the detected signal.

Abstract: We propose and theoretically demonstrate nonreciprocal negative refraction enabled by time-varying photonic structures. By engineering temporal modulations at the interfaces of hyperbolic media, we achieve isolation between forward and backward beams while preserving the hallmark property of negative refraction. Two complementary approaches are developed: in the optical regime, a multilayer AZO/ZnO hyperbolic slab is sandwiched between permittivity-modulated dielectric layers (3D time crystals); in the microwave regime, a wire medium is sandwiched between time-modulated resistive metasurfaces (2D time crystals). Both designs exploit Floquet harmonic expansions and are validated with a customized harmonic-balance finite-element solver. We report isolation exceeding 46 dB in the optical device and ~11 dB in the microwave counterpart. This work introduces a general framework for nonreciprocal negative refraction across frequency regimes, expanding the design space of time-varying metasurfaces and photonic time crystals.

Conclusion: 通过建议的优化方法，我们开发的模型不仅加速了计算速度，还能广泛应用于更复杂的放大器类型，为光通信系统的优化提供了新的工具

Abstract: We apply a known theorem for simplifying dynamical systems with bounded error to a specific optical fiber waveguide problem, supplementing the physical intuition and heuristics used in the optics community with proper mathematical justification. Using techniques from averaging theory of dynamical systems, a reliable accelerated model based on the coupled mode theory (CMT) approach for a common fiber laser amplifier application is derived. Computational testing reveals that this accelerated model achieves an ${\sim}4000$x increase in computational speed compared to the CMT model while preserving a high accuracy in key figures-of-merit such as output power and amplification efficiency. Further, we argue that by adopting our recommended approximations within the reduced model framework enables the model to be applied a wider set of amplifier types and configurations than can the current (comparable) reduced models found in the literature.

*Yanyun Xue,Xianpeng Lv,Guangxing Wu,Tianqi Lei,Chenyang Cao,Yiming Lei,Min Wang,Yan Li,Qihuang Gong,Di Zhu,Yaowen Hu*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper introduces a universal framework for nonlinear frequency combs with strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, providing a new theoretical approach using the general evolution equation (GEE) that unifies and enhances the Lugiato-Lefever approximation. The framework enables programmable spectral control and highlights the cooperative dynamics between Kerr nonlinearity and electro-optic modulation, opening promising applications for chip-scale, microwave-programmable comb sources in meterology, spectroscopy, and photonic technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring and improving the functionality of frequency combs through nonlinear dynamics and modulation techniques is a key goal in modern photonic research. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding and practical framework for such systems.

Method: The method involves developing the GEE, reducing it to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian, and establishing a frequency-domain formalism. The authors also introduce a band-wave correspondence to analyze the modulation effects on comb dynamics.

Result: The framework allows for precise control over the combs' frequency spectra and incorporates the dynamical effects of Kerr nonlinearity with strong-coupling electro-optic modulation. This leads to a versatile platform for generating complex frequency patterns with potential applications in advanced metrology, spectroscopy, and flexible photonic circuit design.

Conclusion: The work presents a significant advancement in the theoretical and experimental analysis of nonlinear frequency combs, particularly under strong-coupling conditions. It lays a solid foundation for future chip-integrated applications in microwaves and offers new possibilities for dynamic comb generation in various photonic technologies.

Abstract: Nonlinear frequency combs, including electro-optic and Kerr combs, have become central platforms for chip-scale frequency synthesis. Recent breakthroughs in strong-coupling electro-optic modulation further expanded their accessible nonlinear dynamics, unlocking new phenomena and functionalities, but the underlying foundation remains largely unexplored. Here we establish a universal theoretical and experimental framework for nonlinear combs under arbitrary electro-optic modulation by introducing a general evolution equation (GEE) that transcends the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation. The GEE reduces to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian that provides a frequency-domain formalism unifying strong-coupling electro-optic modulation with photonic synthetic dimensions. Together with a band-wave correspondence linking modulation waveforms to synthetic band structures, the formalism enables programmable spectral control. We further show compatibility between Kerr nonlinearity and strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, highlighting their cooperative dynamics. Our work provides a foundational model for strong-coupling electro-optics in nonlinear combs, opening a route toward chip-integrated, microwave-programmable comb sources for metrology, spectroscopy, and emerging photonic technologies.

TL;DR: 分数步长 shearing 的重构可以通过加权整数步长重构来减少误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分数shearing 在实际应用中难以精确实现，引入误差，而加权整数shearing方法可以有效解决这个问题。

Method: 通过加权整数shearing 平均的方法，结合最近的几个整数shearing 重构结果，使用精心设计的权重来消除主要的误差项。

Result: 仿真表明，该方法显著降低了 RMS 误差，较传统方法更精确。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于二维干涉ometry，为解决分数shearing 问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Wavefront reconstruction in lateral shearing interferometry typically assumes that the shear amount is an integer multiple of the sampling interval. When the shear is fractional, approximating it with the nearest integer value leads to noticeable reconstruction errors. To address this, we propose a weighted integer shear averaging method. The approach combines reconstructions from nearby integer shears with carefully chosen weights designed to cancel the dominant error terms. Analytical error analysis shows that two-shear averaging removes first-order errors, while three-shear averaging removes second-order errors. Numerical simulations with a test wavefront confirm that the method achieves significantly lower RMS error than conventional single-shear reconstruction. The technique is simple, computationally efficient, and can be readily extended to two-dimensional interferometry. This makes weighted integer shear averaging a practical and accurate tool for wavefront reconstruction when fractional shear is unavoidable.

Conclusion: 快中子加速晶体尺寸效应仅在数值上区别，定性结果与实验相符。

Abstract: The problem of changing the energy of a neutron when it passes through an accelerating crystal under conditions close to the Bragg condition is considered. It is shown that, similar to the case of the passage of long-wavelength neutrons through a refractive sample, the accelerated motion of a crystal results in a change in neutron energy. The physical nature of the phenomenon in both cases is determined by the difference in the Doppler frequency shift at the entrance and exit of the wave through the sample. The difference between the case of ordinary refraction of long-wavelength neutrons and the case of wave passage through a crystal under conditions where diffraction has a dominant influence on the nature of wave propagation is only quantitative. The results obtained are qualitatively consistent with the available experimental data.

Abstract: Metasurfaces have become a cornerstone of flat-optics, enabling precise control over light propagation through nanoengineered materials. Dynamic and reconfigurable metalenses are key to next-generation flat-optics platforms, yet their practical realization remains limited by slow response, optical loss, and polarization sensitivity. The integration of chalcogenide phase-change materials with metasurface architectures offers a powerful platform for dynamic optical tunability, owing to materials such as Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) that can reversibly switch between amorphous and crystalline states with distinct refractive indices. However, the strong optical absorption of crystalline GST in the visible to near-infrared range has hindered its widespread use in reconfigurable metalenses. In this study, we design an all-dielectric polarization-insensitive metasurface based on hybrid Si--GST nanostructures to realize a dynamically tunable bifocal metalens operating at 1.55 μm. The device achieves a variable focal length from 70 μm to 200 μm, with focusing efficiencies of 30% in the amorphous state and 20% in the crystalline state, as validated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we show that flat-top laser excitation enables uniform, reversible phase transitions within tens of nanoseconds -- amorphization in approximately 13~ns and crystallization in approximately 90~ns -- without mechanical motion or electrical bias. For next-generation metasurfaces intended for uses including beam steering, dynamic holography, optical routing, multi-depth imaging, and optical communication, this method shows great promise due to its control and stability.

Abstract: High-performance integrated broadband coherent light sources are essential for advanced applications in high-bandwidth data processing and chip-scale metrology, yet remain challenging. In this study, we demonstrate a monolithic Z-cut lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) microring platform that enables simultaneous generation of tunable multi-chromatic microlasers and Raman-assisted soliton microcombs. Exploiting the strong Raman activity and high second-order nonlinearity of LNOI, we engineered a dispersion-optimized microring with a loaded Q factor of 3.86X10^6, facilitating on-chip efficient broadband coherent light source. A novel phase-matching configuration with all the waves of the same ordinary polarization was realized for the first time in this platform, feasibly enabling modal-phase matched Raman-quadratic nonlinear processes that extend lasing signals into the visible spectrum. Under continuous-wave laser pumping at 3.73 mW in the telecom band, we achieved a Raman-assisted soliton comb centered at 1624.49 nm with record-low pump threshold on the LNOI platform. Concurrently, multi-chromatic Raman lasing outputs were observed at ~1700, ~813, and ~535 nm within the same microring. The system exhibited efficient wavelength tuning of these multi-chromatic laser signals through a 5 nm shift in pump wavelength. This work represents a significant advance in integrated photonics for versatile optical signal generation.

Abstract: Deep-ultraviolet (DUV) microscopy can provide label-free biochemical contrast by exploiting the intrinsic absorption of nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, offering chemically specific morphological information that complements structural optical thickness contrast from phase-sensitive imaging. However, existing DUV microscopes typically rely on specialized optics and DUV-sensitive cameras, which restrict field of view, increase system complexity and cost, and often require high illumination doses that risk photodamage. Here, we report a low-dose deep-UV lensless holographic microscopy platform that uses standard board-level CMOS sensors designed for visible light, eliminating all imaging optics and dedicated DUV detectors. Our system achieves large field-of-view (up to 116 mm2) DUV imaging with low illumination and label-free phase and chemically specific amplitude contrast. A specialized defocus/wavelength diverse pixel super-resolution reconstruction with total-variation regularization and robust autofocusing halves the effective sensor pixel pitch and yields down to 870 nm lateral resolution. We demonstrate chemically specific, label-free bioimaging on challenging specimens, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular vesicles and unstained mouse liver tissue. In liver sections, imaging at λ = 330 nm reveals lipid- and retinoid-rich accumulations that co-localize with Oil Red O staining, enabling label-free identification of hepatic stellate (Ito) cells. This combination of low-dose operation, chemically specific contrast and standard CMOS hardware establishes DUV lensless holographic microscopy as a practical and scalable route to high-content submicron-resolution whole-slide preparation-free bioimaging without exogenous labels.

Abstract: Beam alignment enables efficient, stable transmission and control of optical energy and information, which critically depend on precise monitoring and regulation of the three-dimensional (3D) relative positioning between fibers. This study introduces an approach to achieve more accurate 3D measurement of the spatial displacement between two optical fibers in a few-mode configuration, by integrating mode decomposition with a straightforward machine learning algorithm. This method leverages inherent information from the optical field, enabling precise beam alignment with a simple structure and minimal computational effort. In the 3D measurement experiment, the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.99 for transverse offsets in the x- and y-directions, and 0.98 for air gap in the z-direction. The RMSE in x-direction, y-direction and z-direction is respectively 0.135 μm, 0.128 μm and 2.42 μm. The time for a single 3D displacement calculation is 4.037e-4 seconds. Furthermore, it facilitates single-step displacement regulation with a deviation tolerance within 0.15 μm and modal content regulation with an accuracy of 4.67%. These results establish a theoretical framework for addressing key challenges in optical path alignment, crosstalk compensation, precision instrument manufacturing, and fiber optic sensing.

This approach stimulates nonlinear optical emissions to provide unique insights into the interior structure, fluorescent defects, and formational conditions of diamonds. As a result, MPM can be used to investigate gemstone quality, vacancy centers used in quantum technologies, and the various inclusions and fluorescent emitters that may trace gemstone provenance and treatment history.

Abstract: Next-generation scalable quantum photonic technologies operating at the single photon level rely on bringing together optimized quantum building blocks with minimal optical coupling losses.

In this work, we demonstrate the scalable integration of mature InGaAs quantum dots embedded in GaAs waveguides onto a low-loss SiN photonic platform, as evidenced by a high processing yield of 94.7% using a commercially available micro-transfer printing tool. These integrated emitters are embedded within a p-i-n heterostructure that allows for noise suppression, near-blinking-free operation and wavelength tunability upon CMOS-level electrical biasing.

Abstract: We investigate electronic transport in gapped bilayer graphene (gBLG) devices. For certain edge terminations -typically a combination of zigzag, armchair, and bearded types - we observe edge state conduction within the band gap, which is opened by a potential bias between the two layers. The edge states can generate a non-local resistance, in line with recent experiments [1]. Band structure calculations of gBLG nanoribbons corroborate the existence of the edge states, whose edge localization can be switched by tuning the electron energy. Their existence strongly depends on the edge termination and does not originate from a topological bulk-boundary correspondence.

Conclusion: 多热点系统的热传递是非均匀的，其性能显著依赖于热点的间距排列。这些发现为高功耗集成电路的热管理提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Understanding nanoscale hotspot thermal transport is crucial in electronic devices. Contrary to common perception, recent experiments show that closely spaced nanoscale multiple hotspots can enhance heat dissipation. Here, the thermal transport in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems is investigated by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The local thermal conductivity is proposed to describe the non-uniform spatial distribution of heat transport capability in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems. The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots. Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of hotspot spacing on thermal transport are investigated, showing that reducing the hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%. This work challenges the conventional view that thermal transport capability is spatially uniform throughout the system and provides fundamental insights for thermal management in high-power-density integrated circuits.

Motivation: The study aims to explore and exploit spin-wave phenomena in frustrated artificial spin ice systems for potential applications in analog signal processing.

Method: The researchers used a hybrid system with a multilayered ferromagnetic thin film and embedded nanoelements to demonstrate spin wave transmission.

Result: Coherent spin wave propagation was achieved over a one-micrometer distance using exchange-mediated coupling and evanescent tunneling.

Conclusion: This system shows promise for studying spin waves in frustrated ASIs and for new applications in signal processing, as it combines the strengths of different subsystems while mitigating limitations.

Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) systems exhibit fascinating phenomena, such as frustration and the formation of magnetic monopole states, and Dirac strings. However, exploring the wave phenomena in these systems is elusive due to the weak dipolar coupling that governs their interactions. In this study, we demonstrate coherent spin-wave propagation in an hybrid ASI system, which is based on a multilayered ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetized nanoelements embedded within it. We show that this system enables spin-wave transmission over a one-micrometer distance via exchange-mediated coupling between subsystems and evanescent spin-wave tunneling through the out-of-plane magnetized parts. This system overcomes the limitations of purely dipolar interactions in standard ASIs while preserving their fundamental properties. Thus, it provides a platform for studying spin-wave phenomena in frustrated ASI systems and paves the way for exploiting them in analog signal processing with spin waves.

TL;DR: We present a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra using thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. This framework allows magnetization densities to be expressed as spectral functions of generalized transport coefficients, which have physical interpretations. Magnetoresolved thermoelectric dichroometry in quantum-engineered platforms enables separation of orbital and heat contributions, providing a versatile method to analyze fundamental ground-state properties.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling magnetization in materials is essential for advancing spintronics and quantum technologies. This work proposes experimental techniques that enable precise measurement and separation of orbital and heat contributions to magnetization, offering new insights and tools for materials science.

Method: The methodology combines theoretical frameworks—thermodynamic integration, Green-Kubo relations, and Kramers-Kronig relations—with experimental approaches involving thermoelectric probes and magnetoresolved spectroscopy. It also introduces generalized sum rules that connect transport coefficients to magnetization densities.

Result: The analysis leads to a hierarchical construction of orbital and heat magnetizations into distinguishable contributions, revealing their physical origins and quantifiable relationship. Real-space markers of these magnetizations are derived, providing direct spatial resolution of their distributions. The proposed experimental techniques, particularly magnetoresolved thermoelectric dichroometry, can be implemented in quantum-engineered platforms to isolate and study distinct magnetization contributions, offering a versatile and powerful approach to analyzing magnetization.

Conclusion: This work establishes a comprehensive theoretical and experimental framework for accessing and disentangling orbital and heat magnetizations in materials. The proposed techniques and formalism open new avenues for understanding and controlling magnetization properties, with potential applications in spintronics, quantum computing, and materials design. The unified approach bridges experiment and theory, achieving what could otherwise seem like intractable goals.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.

Abstract: Majorana fermions (zero modes) are predicted to emerge in nanowire-superconductor heterostructures. This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures). Our findings could explain why Majorana fermions have not been observed in current experiments, and offer guidance for the size selection of heterostructures to implement Majorana fermions in future studies.

Conclusion: 这一工作展示了通过电场修饰Wannier哈密尔顿来预测并指导二维材料的非线性光电响应的可能性。

Abstract: We develop a practical approach to electrically tuning the nonlinear photoresponse of two-dimensional semiconductors by explicitly incorporating a static out-of-plane electric field into the electronic ground state prior to optical excitation, as a gate bias. The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities. These results establish field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials.

Abstract: Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are responsible for strong optical resonances near the bandgap in low-dimensional materials and wide-bandgap insulators. Although current ab initio methods can accurately determine exciton energies and eigenstates, their symmetries have been much less explored. In this work, we employ standard group-theory methods to analyse the transformation properties of excitonic states, obtained by solving the BSE, under crystal symmetry operations. We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of generating and controlling THz waves, which are crucial for advanced imaging and communication technologies, particularly in the terahertz regime.

Method: The authors investigate THz emission in BiFeO3 and Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers through optical rectification of coupled phonon-polariton modes, employing a combination of thin-film synthesis, optical excitation, and strain wave generation in the Pt layers.

Result: They achieve tunable narrowband THz emission ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 THz by controlling the thickness of Pt layers, leveraging the coupling of electromagnon and magneto-acoustic modes.

Conclusion: This work reveals the fundamental interplay between phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic waves in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, paving the way for engineered THz sources with applications in spintronic devices and terahertz electronics.

Abstract: Collective excitations such as magnons and polar phonons provide natural access to the terahertz (THz) regime, but efficient generation and tunability remain elusive. Multiferroic BiFeO3 combines both orders at room temperature, offering a unique platform for narrowband THz emission. Here, we achieve efficient sub-bandgap optical rectification of coupled phonon-polaritons near 2 THz in bare epitaxial thin films. In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources.

### [34] [Quantum theory of electrically levitated nanoparticle-ion systems: Motional dynamics and sympathetic cooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21495)
*Saurabh Gupta,Dmitry S. Bykov,Tracy E. Northup,Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the quantum dynamics of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions in a dual-frequency Paul trap, predicting the achievable cooling of the nanoparticle to sub-kelvin and millikelvin temperatures through Coulomb coupling with Doppler-cooled ions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the goal of advancing the manipulation of quantum systems at micro- and nanoscale levels, particularly in the context of quantum thermodynamics and quantum sensing.

Method: The authors employ theoretical analysis, deriving analytical expressions for motion frequencies and classical trajectories, and develop a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system. They utilize concepts from quantum mechanics, specifically Coulomb coupling and Doppler cooling, within the framework of quantum optics.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates that it is feasible to cool the nanoparticle's motion to extremely low temperatures (	extless1K) even without motional feedback, and predicts an increase in cooling efficiency with more ions in the ensemble, achieving tenths of millikelvin in current setups.

Conclusion: This work lays the theoretical foundation for utilizing ions to assist in the preparation of non-Gaussian quantum states of levitated nanoparticles, opening new possibilities in quantum information processing and nanotechnology applications.

Abstract: We develop the theory describing the quantum coupled dynamics of the center-of-mass motion of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions co-trapped in a dual-frequency linear Paul trap. We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions. We then derive a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system and quantify the sympathetic cooling of the nanoparticle motion enabled by its Coulomb coupling to a continuously Doppler-cooled ion. We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles.

TL;DR: 研究者将量子力学方法应用于经典的'蜈蚣博弈'，发现其量子版本存在两个新的纳什均衡，在实验中优于经典策略。实验结果显示，量子策略能获得更高的收益，并更好地模拟了现实行为。研究者进一步提出，类似结构的量子博弈中可以进行推广。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜈蚣博弈（centipede game）是一个经典的博弈论示例，在此情境下，理性的玩家在理论上应该选择退一步，而实际上却经常合作。量子力学引入这个复杂系统，是否能更贴近现实中的决策模式，是一个有趣的研究课题。

Method: 研究团队参考了囚徒困境中的量子策略，结合数学编程和量子计算框架Qiskit，设计了新的量子策略模型。

Result: 通过数值模拟与实验结果表明，量子策略优于经典策略，能够在模拟的蜈蚣博弈中产生更有利的结果。特别是，在深入的博弈中，量子策略能给双方带来更高的收益。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了量子策略在复杂博弈中的潜在价值，尤其是在模拟人与人之间复杂互动时。未来的研究可能会扩展到其他多回合博弈，探讨量子力学在博弈论中的更广泛应用。

Abstract: The centipede game is a two-player non-zero-sum game. Each turn, a player can choose whether they want to take or pass a growing reward. The classical, rational solution of this game shows defection in the first round, when in reality, players cooperate much more often. Inspired by prior work employing quantum strategies in the prisoners dilemma, we showed that when similar quantum mechanics principles are applied to the centipede game, it leads to two new quantum Nash equilibria that are superior to the classical solution. Furthermore, by implementing our algorithm on Qiskit, we confirmed that leveraging quantum strategies, rather than strategies like backward induction, to solve the centipede game provided better payoffs for both players and more accurately modeled the games real-life outcomes. Ultimately, we propose a generalized conjecture for similarly structured quantum games.

TL;DR: 研究通过功率衰减耦合的排列对称性模型，探索远邻耦合对量子动力学的影响。系统随着幂指数α的变化，从高度对称的无限远耦合情况向无排列对称的短距离情况过渡，发现了新的动态行为，包括热化现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解排列对称性在量子集体动力学中的作用，分析实际系统中非均匀耦合对动态行为的影响。

Method: 研究排列对称性的破坏及动态行为变化，通过计算角动量算符J²和von Neumann熵S_{N/2}等量子量，分析不同α值下的系统行为变化。

Result: 随着α的增加，系统从高度排列对称的情况逐渐向无排列对称的情况过渡。在小α值时，系统接近排列对称子空间；在中间α区间，系统表现出热化现象，表明状态接近完全混合态；在大α值时，系统接近可积的冲击Ising模型。

Conclusion: 排列对称性的破坏随着α的变化，会引起量子系统动力学性质的显著变化，特别是在中间α区间，系统表现出典型的热化行为。结果表明，冷却周期τ的增加延长时间窗，使热化现象在更小α区间出现。使用有效维数和谱统计进一步确认了这些结果。

Abstract: Permutation symmetry plays a central role in the understanding of collective quantum dynamics. On the other hand, interactions are rarely uniform in real systems. By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^α$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $α$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $α$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $α=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $α\rightarrow \infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $α$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $α=0$, we find that for small $α$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $α=0$. At intermediate $α$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $α$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $τ$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $α$ when $τ$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $α$. We further confirm these results using effective dimension and spectral statistics.

TL;DR: We derived relativistic corrections to QSLs for continuous-variable systems, showing they slow amplitude and squeezing evolution, increase QSL bounds, and introduce a phase drift that can be detected with current technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum speed limits in relativistic and high-velocity regimes is crucial for advanced quantum technologies, such as satellite QKD and space-based clocks.

Method: Used Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion and perturbation theory on Gaussian states to derive closed-form QSLs and quantum Cramér-Rao bound.

Result: Relativistic corrections increase QSL bounds, introduce ε²t² phase drift, and offer a testable scenario with macroscopic systems.

Conclusion: Our findings provide a benchmark for relativistic effects in continuous-variable systems, paving the way for testing quantum speed limits experimentally.

Abstract: Timing and phase resolution in satellite QKD, kilometre-scale gravitational-wave detectors, and space-borne clock networks hinge on quantum-speed limits (QSLs), yet benchmarks omit relativistic effects for coherent and squeezed probes. We derive first-order relativistic corrections to the Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds. Starting from the Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion and treating $-p^{4}/(8 m^{3} c^{2})$ as a harmonic-oscillator perturbation, we propagate Gaussian states to obtain closed-form QSLs and the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. Relativistic kinematics slow evolution in an amplitude- and squeezing-dependent way, increase both bounds, and introduce an $ε^{2} t^{2}$ phase drift that weakens timing sensitivity while modestly increasing the squeeze factor. A single electron ($ε\approx 1.5\times 10^{-10}$) in a $5.4\,\mathrm{T}$ Penning trap, read out with $149\,\mathrm{GHz}$ quantum-limited balanced homodyne, should reveal this drift within $\sim 15\,\mathrm{min}$ -- within known hold times. These results benchmark relativistic corrections in continuous-variable systems and point to an accessible test of the quantum speed limit in high-velocity or strong-field regimes.

TL;DR: superconducting circuits with Ne film have been shown to have a thickness of a few nm to a few μm, which could be important for quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers want to use superconducting circuits with Ne film as a platform for quantum computing, so they need to control the growth of Ne films.

Method: They used high-Tc YBCO microwave resonators to monitor the growth of Ne films in real-time.

Result: The thickness of Ne films varies from a few nm to a few μm, and increasing the driving power reduces the thickness to below 100 nm.

Conclusion: This study takes a significant step toward controlling the formation of Ne films for eNe qubits and broadens the use of high-Tc resonators in hybrid quantum systems.

Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states coupled to superconducting circuits are a promising platform for quantum computing. Control over the formation of these charge states requires techniques to track and control the growth of solid Ne films on the circuit surface. We demonstrate a real-time Ne film-growth monitor using high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) YBCO microwave resonators. The high $T_c$ enables tracking of the film thickness near Ne's triple temperature and below. Across more than 300 solidification experiments, we find that the final Ne thickness varies stochastically from a few nm to a few $μ$m for films solidified from the liquid phase. By increasing the driving power in the resonator, we consistently reduce the final thickness to below 100 nm. These results represent an important step toward controlled formation of Ne films for eNe qubits and highlight the broader utility of high-$T_c$ resonators for hybrid quantum systems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A recent paper by Aziz and Howl (Nature 2025) argues that, once quantum matter is described at the level of quantum field theory and coupled to a classical gravitational field, higher order processes can generate entanglement between two spatially separated masses. A contemporaneous critical note (Marletto, Oppenheim, Vedral, Wilson, arXiv:2511.07348v1) shows that, in the actual nonrelativistic limit employed there, the interaction becomes ultra local, the total unitary factorizes, and no entanglement is generated from a product input. In this comment we (i) restate the core point of that critique, (ii) give a channel theoretic reformulation that makes the conclusion model independent, and (iii) clarify the distinction between activation of entanglement in already quantum matter and genuine mediation of entanglement by a classical field. Once these clarifications are in place, the standard BMV inference that observation of gravity mediated entanglement strongly indicates nonclassical gravitational degrees of freedom remains intact.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an emulator-based and hardware feasibility study of Aurora-DD, a phase-coherence compensation method that integrates a sign-based feedback update of a global phase offset (Delta phi) with a fixed-depth XY8 dynamical decoupling (DD) scaffold. The feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware. This represents an "offline closed-loop, online open-loop" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value <Z>, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution. Overall, the combined results support pre-calibrated Aurora-DD as a practical, stable, and hardware-compatible phase-coherence compensator for NISQ devices in single-qubit settings.

Abstract: The integration of Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers into diamond anvil cells has opened the door to quantum sensing at megabar pressures. Despite a multitude of experimental demonstrations and applications ranging from quantum materials to geophysics, a detailed microscopic understanding of how stress affects the NV center remains lacking. In this work, using a combination of first principles calculations as well as high-pressure NV experiments, we develop a complete description of the NV's optical properties under general stress conditions. In particular, our ab initio calculations reveal the complex behavior of the NV's inter-system crossing rates under stresses that both preserve and break the defect's symmetry. Crucially, our proposed framework immediately resolves a number of open questions in the field, including: (i) the microscopic origin of the observed contrast-enhancement in (111)-oriented anvils, and (ii) the surprising observation of NV contrast-inversion in certain high-pressure regimes. Our work lays the foundation for optimizing the performance of NV high-pressure sensors by controlling the local stress environment, and more generally, suggests that symmetry-breaking stresses can be utilized as a novel tuning knob for generic solid-state spin defects.

Abstract: Introducing new components and functionalities into quantum devices is critical in advancing state-of-the-art hardware. Here, we propose superconducting diodes (SDs) as a coherent nonreciprocal element in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures. In particular, we use an asymmetric SQUID as an SD controlled with a flux bias. We spectroscopically characterize SD and show that flux bias acts cooperatively with the nonlinear diode response to induce direction-dependent resonance shifts in the transmission spectrum. We use the SD as an elementary component to realize coherent nonreciprocal qubit-qubit coupling. With a minimal two qubit system, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal half-iSWAP gate with tunable Bell-state generation, thereby showcasing the potential of intrinsic nonreciprocity as a tool in coherent control in quantum technologies. Our work enables high-fidelity signal routing and entanglement generation in all-to-all connected microwave quantum networks, where nonreciprocity is embedded at the device level.

Abstract: We introduce a cost-effective quantum error mitigation technique that builds on the recent Ansatz-based gate and readout error mitigation method (M0). The technique, tiled M0, leverages the unique structure of tiled Ansätze (e.g., tUPS, QNP, hardware-efficient circuits) to apply a locality approximation to M0 that results in an exponential reduction in the QPU cost of the noise characterization. We validate the technique for molecular ground state energy calculations with the tUPS Ansatz on LiH, molecular hydrogen, water, butadiene, and benzene ($4-12$ qubits), demonstrating little to no loss in accuracy compared to M0 in noisy simulations. We also show the performance of the technique in quantum experiments, highlighting its potential use in near-term applications.

Conclusion: 该研究为研究复杂量子场论提供了一种更强大的工具，扩展了相对论连续矩阵积态的应用场景。

Abstract: Relativistic continuous matrix product states (RCMPS) are a powerful variational ansatz for quantum field theories of a single field. However, they inherit a property of their non-relativistic counterpart that makes them divergent for models with multiple fields, unless a regularity condition is satisfied. This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line. This makes RCMPS usable for a far larger class of problems than before.

Motivation: 随着量子计算和计算物理/化学的发展，如何高效估计强相关量子系统的基态能量一直是重要挑战。现有的量子模拟方法如DMRG在1D系统上有不错表现，但对于更高维的量子系统，计算效率较低，因此需要寻找更高效的方法。

Abstract: Ground state energy estimation for strongly correlated quantum systems remains a central challenge in computational physics and chemistry. While tensor network methods like DMRG provide efficient solutions for one-dimensional systems, higher-dimensional problems remain difficult. Here we present a variational double bracket flow (vDBF) algorithm that leverages Sparse Pauli Dynamics, a technique originally developed for classical simulation of quantum circuits, to efficiently approximate ground state energies. By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG. For an 8x8 Hubbard model (128 qubits), the speedup is even more pronounced. These results demonstrate that classical simulation techniques developed in the context of quantum advantage benchmarking can provide practical tools for many-body physics.

Abstract: High-fidelity numerical methods that model the physical layout of a device are essential for the design of many technologies. For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here.

Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect typically refers to freezing the dynamics of a quantum system through frequent observations. In general, quantum Zeno dynamics is obtained with an error of order $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$, where $N$ is the number of projective measurements performed within a fixed evolution time. In this work, we develop higher-order Zeno sequences that achieve faster convergence to Zeno dynamics, yielding an improved error scaling of $\mathcal{O}(1/N^{2k})$, where $k$ describes the order of the Zeno sequence. This is achieved by relating higher-order Zeno sequences to higher-order Trotter formulas that achieve similar convergence behavior. We leverage this relation to develop higher-order Zeno sequences for different manifestations of the quantum Zeno effect, including frequent projective measurements and unitary kicks. We go on to discuss achieving quantum Zeno dynamics through periodic control fields of high frequency. We explicitly develop control fields that yield a second-order type improvement in the Zeno error scaling and present shorter Zeno sequences. Finally, we discuss the connection to randomized and Uhrig dynamical decoupling to develop more efficient implementations in the weak coupling regime.

Abstract: The preparation and control of quantum states lie at the heart of quantum information science (QIS). Recent advances in solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) and nanophotonics have transformed the landscape of quantum photonic technologies, enabling scalable generation of quantum states of light and matter. A new frontier in solid-state quantum photonics is the engineering of many-body interactions between QEs and photons to achieve robust coherence and controllable many-body entanglement. These entangled states, including photonic graph and cluster states, superradiant emission, and emergent quantum phases, are promising for quantum computation, sensing, and simulation. However, intrinsic inhomogeneities and decoherence in solid-state platforms pose significant challenges to realize such complex entangled states. This review provides an overview of the fundamental many-body interactions and dynamics at the light-matter interfaces of solid-state QEs, and discusses recent advances in mitigating decoherence and harnessing robust many-body coherence.

Abstract: This work investigates a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian operator in a two dimensional noncommutative space. The system consists of an electron subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, coupled to a harmonic potential and an external electric field $\mathbf{E}$, within the context of non-extensive statistical thermodynamics. The noncommutative geometry introduces a fundamental minimal length that modifies the phase space structure. The thermodynamics of this quantum system is developed within the framework of Tsallis statistics through the derivation of $q$-generalized versions of the partition function, magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility, following the application of a generalized Hilhorst transformation adapted to non-commutative geometry. The combined effects of the non-extensivity parameter $q$ and the noncommutativity parameter $θ$ are analyzed by considering the limit $q \rightarrow 1$, revealing new thermodynamic regimes and anomalous electromagnetic properties specific to quantum systems in non-commutative geometry.

Abstract: In conventional quantum mechanics, all unitary evolution takes place within the space-time Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{xt}=L^2(\mathcal M_{xt})$, with time as the sole evolution parameter. The momentum-energy representation $φ(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert. Here we restore the fundamental symmetry between the conjugate pairs $(x,t)$ and $(k,E)$ by extending the quantum theory to an enlarged Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{\text{total}} = \mathcal H_{xt} \oplus \mathcal H_{kE}$, within which the momentum-energy sector $\mathcal H_{kE}=L^2(\mathcal M_{kE})$ carries its own autonomous unitary evolution generated by a self-adjoint operator $\hat{\mathcal T}$. The resulting structure establishes a meta-symmetry: a symmetry between two conjugate dynamical projections of a single global quantum state. It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity.

Abstract: Two-sample tests have been extensively employed in various scientific fields and machine learning such as evaluation on the effectiveness of drugs and A/B testing on different marketing strategies to discriminate whether two sets of samples come from the same distribution or not. Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation centers on overcoming previous limitations of optical parametric amplifiers (OPA), which were restricted to coherent states. By introducing a generalized OPA protocol, the authors aim to unlock a broader range of quantum phenomena and practical applications in quantum state engineering.

Method: The authors propose a GP-OPA protocol that can accept arbitrary non-classical inputs, such as squeezed vacuum states. The method involves using the GP-OPA to perform two-photon subtractive operations, creating Schrödinger cat states, and to amplify non-Gaussianity in small-amplitude Schrödinger cat states, resulting in high-purity quantum resources.

Result: The GP-OPA protocol successfully demonstrates the generation of high-fidelity, larger-amplitude squeezed Schrödinger cat states and can distill non-Gaussianity into high-purity quantum resources like photon-number superpositions. The setup integrates a single optical module and achieves versatile quantum state engineering.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances the field of quantum optics by introducing a generalized protocol for OPA that broadens its applications and enables the generation of complex quantum states from a single integrated setup. The protocol represents a versatile tool for achieving various quantum resources essential for quantum technologies.

Abstract: The heralded optical parametric amplifier (OPA) has emerged as a promising tool for quantum state engineering. However, its potential has been limited to coherent state inputs. Here, we introduce a generalized heralded OPA protocol that unlocks a vastly expanded class of quantum phenomena by accepting arbitrary non-classical inputs. With a squeezed vacuum input, the setup functions as an integrated two-photon subtractor, deterministically generating high-fidelity, larger-amplitude squeezed Schrödinger cat states -- an operation previously requiring complex, discrete setups. Furthermore, when fed a small-amplitude SC state, the protocol acts as a non-Gaussianity amplifier, distilling it into high-purity approximations of key quantum resources like specific photon-number superpositions. This work transforms the OPA from a specialized source into a versatile and practical platform for advanced quantum state engineering, enabling the generation of a wide array of non-Gaussian states from a single, integrated setup.

Motivation: Developing compilation workflows for fault-tolerant quantum computing is essential to exploit hardware advancements.

Method: A compilation pipeline was developed integrating tools for lattice surgery on the surface code, incorporating error-aware techniques like unitary synthesis and magic state production.

Result: Both algorithms achieve break-even performance at physical error rates with 2517 qubits (d=11) or 1737 qubits (d=9).

Conclusion: This work provides conditions for achieving algorithmic break-even with near-term quantum hardware, paving the way for end-to-end compilers.

Abstract: Recent experimental progress in realizing surface code on hardware, including demonstrations of break-even logical memory on devices with up to hundreds of physical qubits, has materially advanced the prospects for fault-tolerant quantum computation. This progress creates urgency for the development of compilation workflows that directly target the forthcoming generation of devices with thousands of physical qubits, for which algorithm execution becomes practical. We develop a pipeline for compiling logical algorithms to physical circuits implementing lattice surgery on the surface code, and use this pipeline to identify the requirements for achieving algorithmic break-even -- where quantum error correction improves the performance of a quantum algorithm -- for two prominent quantum algorithms: the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our pipeline integrates several open-source software tools, and leverages recent advances in error-aware unitary gate synthesis, high-fidelity magic state production, and the calculation of correlation surfaces in the surface code. We perform classical simulations of physical Clifford proxy circuits produced by our pipeline, and find that both 5-qubit QAOA and QPE can reach algorithmic break-even with 2517 physical qubits (surface code distance $d=11$) at physical error rates of $p=10^{-3}$, or 1737 physical qubits ($d=9$) at $p=5\times 10^{-4}$. Our work thereby identifies conditions for achieving algorithmic break-even with near-term quantum hardware and paves the way towards an end-to-end compiler for early-fault-tolerant surface code architectures.

TL;DR: Mirror Subspace Diagonalization (MSD) reduces measurement overhead in quantum Krylov algorithms for ground-state energy estimation by simulating Hamiltonian matrix elements within the Krylov subspace, achieving logarithmic factor cost reduction compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient ground-state energy calculations are challenging in quantum computing, with measurement costs often prohibitive. MSD addresses this by proposing a novel method that decreases these costs significantly.

Method: MSD leverages finite-difference approximation to express Hamiltonian operators and optimizes timestep parameters to minimize both finite difference and statistical errors. It employs classical post-processing to infer Hamiltonian moments, leveraging the Lanczos scheme for error mitigation.

Result: MSD achieves a sampling cost reduction factor of 10-10,000, making it particularly effective for high-accuracy molecular simulations with strong electronic correlations, such as those using large basis sets in post-Hartree-Fock methods.

Conclusion: MSD represents a significant advancement in optimizing quantum algorithms for computational chemistry, demonstrating remarkable efficiency in reducing measurement costs while maintaining accuracy for complex molecular systems.

Abstract: Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a promising approach for ground-state energy estimation in the near-term quantum computing era. A major challenge, however, lies in their inherently substantial sampling cost, primarily due to the individual measurement of each term in the Hamiltonian. While various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the sampling overhead remains a significant bottleneck, especially for practical large-scale electronic structure problems. In this work, we introduce an alternative method, dubbed mirror subspace diagonalization (MSD), which approaches the theoretical lower bound of the sampling cost for quantum Krylov algorithms. MSD leverages a finite-difference formula to express the Hamiltonian operator as a linear combination of time-evolution unitaries with symmetrically shifted timesteps, enabling efficient estimation of the Hamiltonian matrix within the Krylov subspace. In this scheme, the finite difference and statistical errors are simultaneously minimized by optimizing the timestep parameter and shifting the energy spectrum. Consequently, MSD attains the lower bound of the sampling cost of the quantum Krylov algorithms up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we employ classical post-processing to infer Hamiltonian moments, which are used to mitigate the ground state energy error based on the Lanczos scheme. Through theoretical analysis of the sampling cost, we demonstrate that MSD is particularly effective when the spectral norm of the Hamiltonian is significantly smaller than its 1-norm. Such a situation arises, for example, in high-accuracy simulations of molecules using large basis sets that incorporate strong electronic correlations. Numerical results for various molecular models reveal that MSD can achieve sampling cost reductions ranging from approximately 10 to 10,000 times compared to the conventional quantum Krylov algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research explores techniques to enhance quantum entanglement in optomechanical systems, which is crucial for advancing quantum information processing and communication technologies.

Method: The study employs two mechanically coupled resonators driven by a common EM field. A polarizer introduces polarizations (TE and TM modes), and mechanical coupling is controlled through parameters like polarization angle and phonon hopping rate.

Result: The method successfully generates multipath bipartite and tripartite entanglement. By breaking dark modes through polarization and mechanical coupling, they achieve resilient entanglement states that resist thermal fluctuations up to two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for creating noise-tolerant quantum resources essential for various quantum technologies, particularly in quantum computing and communication.

Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate multi-paths entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control. Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($φ$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($φ=π/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime. Our work sheets light on new possibilities to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources that are useful for plethora of modern quantum technologies.

Abstract: Versatile, tunable, and potentially scalable single-photon sources are a key asset in emergent photonic quantum technologies. In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity. Single-photon emission from the coupled emitter-cavity system is verified via the second-order correlation measurement, revealing a $g^{(2)}(τ=0)$ value of 0.3. A detailed analysis of the spectrally selective, cavity enhanced emission features shows the impact of a pronounced acoustic phonon emission sideband, which contributes specifically to the non-resonant emitter-cavity coupling in this system. The achieved level of cavity-emitter control highlights the potential of open-cavity systems to tailor the emission properties of atomically thin quantum emitters, advancing their suitability for real-world quantum technology applications.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅简化了对d维量子同步通信性能的评估，而且为理解不同资源的有界性提供了新的途径。

Abstract: We develop a unified framework to analyze $d$-dimensional quantum teleportation through the joint geometry of two complementary figures of merit: average fidelity $F$ (how well a protocol works on average) and fidelity deviation $D$ (how uniformly it works across the inputs). Technically, we formulate a representation-theoretical framework based on Schur-Weyl duality and permutation symmetry calculus that reduce the higher-moment Haar averages to a finite set of trace invariants of the composed correction unitaries. This yields closed-form expressions for $F$ and $D$ in arbitrary Hilbert-space dimension and delivers tight bounds that link the admissible deviation directly to the gap from the optimal average performance. In particular, any measured pair $(F, D)$ can be ported into a visibility estimate for isotropic channel resources, turning the $(F, D)$-plane into a calibrated diagnostic map. We further cast the teleportation advantage and CGLMP-inequality violation as two witnesses lines in the $(F,D)$ plane: one line certifies that $F$ beats the classical benchmark $2/(d{+}1)$, while the other line certifies the Bell nonlocality. Their identical slope but distinct intercepts expose a quantitative gap between "entangled yet local" and "genuinely nonlocal" resources.

By spatially positioning individual emitters within tip-cavities with different plasmon resonances, the researchers achieve adaptive control over the excitation and emission processes, optimizing single-photon purity and enabling deterministic coupling with nano-optical cavities.

Conclusion: This work provides a promising pathway for developing highly-sensitive and deterministic room-temperature single-photon sources for quantum-computing and sensing technologies by leveraging the unique properties of hBN and tip-enhanced quantum-sensing techniques.

Abstract: Atom-like defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide room-temperature single-photon emission and coherent spin states, making them attractive for quantum-computing and -sensing applications. However, their random spatial and spectral characteristics hamper deterministic coupling with nano-optical cavities, limiting their use as bright single-photon sources and sensitive quantum sensors. Here, we present tip-enhanced quantum-sensing spectroscopy of single-photon emitters in hBN. Through precise spatial positioning of individual emitters within tip-cavities with different plasmon resonances, we adaptively control the enhancement rates of both excitation and emission, as well as the single-photon purity. In this way, optimal selection of their relative contributions can effectively reconfigure solid-state single-photon sources, with simultaneous nano-spectroscopic space- and time-resolved analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate tip-enhanced quantum-sensing with single spin defects through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments in tip-coupled hBN nanoflakes. Our approach provides a unique pathway toward highly-sensitive and deterministic quantum-sensing with room-temperature single-photon emitters.

Abstract: Zitterbewegung (ZBW), the trembling motion predicted by the Dirac equation, has long remained unobservable in free electrons due to its sub-Compton scale. We elaborately construct a relativistic vortex electron wave packet as a coherent superposition of both positive- and negative-energy Dirac states and derive their space-time dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that introducing orbital angular momentum provides a mechanism for amplifying the ZBW amplitude far beyond that of conventional Gaussian packets, while maintaining coherence. The resulting relativistic vortex states unify Gaussian and Bessel-Gaussian models within a single framework and opens new possibilities for observing relativistic quantum dynamics in structured electron wave packets.

Abstract: Entanglement for pure bipartite states is most commonly quantified in a state-by-state manner to each pure state of a bipartite system a scalar quantity, such as the von Neumann entropy of a reduced density matrix. This provides a precise local characterization of how entangled a given state is. At the same time, this local description naturally invites a set of complementary, more global questions about the structure of the space of pure states: How abundant are the states with a given amount of entanglement within the full state space? Do the manifolds of constant entanglement exhibit distinct geometric regimes? These questions shift the focus from assigning an entanglement value to a single state to understanding the global organization and geometry of entanglement across the entire manifold of pure states.
  In this work, we develop a geometric framework in which these questions become natural. We regard the projective Hilbert space of pure states, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, as a Riemannian manifold and promote bipartite entanglement to a macroscopic functional on this manifold. Its level sets stratify the space of pure states into hypersurfaces of constant entanglement, and we define a geometric entanglement entropy as the log-volume of these hypersurfaces, weighted by the Fubini-Study gradient of entanglement. This quantity plays the role of a microcanonical entropy in entanglement space: it measures the degeneracy of a given entanglement value in the natural quantum geometry.
  The framework is illustrated first in the simplest case of a single spin-1/2 and then for bipartite entanglement of spin systems, including a two-qubit example where explicit calculations can be carried out, along with a sketch of the extension to spin chains.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, as one of the fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics, has garnered significant attention over the past few decades for its extraordinary nonlocality. With the advancement of quantum technology, quantum entanglement holds promising application for exploring fundamental physical theories. The experimental scheme of Quantum Gravity Induced Entanglement of Masses (QGEM) was proposed to investigate the quantum effects of gravity based on the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theory. In this study, we analyze the quantum properties of the entangled final states generated in the QGEM scheme. Our findings reveal that the photon emission rates (transition rates) are closely related to the degree of entanglement. Specifically, the transition rate decreases as the degree of entanglement increases when the distance between particle pairs is small, then it gradually approaches an asymptotic value that is independent of entanglement as the distance increases. We then discuss the possibility of using photon emission rates to detect quantum entanglement with these results.

Abstract: Many optimally scaling quantum simulation algorithms employ controlled time evolution of the Hamiltonian, which is typically the major bottleneck for their efficient implementation. This work establishes a compression protocol for encoding the controlled time evolution operator of translationally invariant, local Hamiltonians into a quantum circuit. It achieves a near-optimal scaling in circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(t \text{ polylog}(t N/ε))$, while reducing the control overhead from a multiplicative to an additive factor. We report that this compression protocol enables the implementation of Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation with as few as 414 CNOT gates for a frustrated quantum spin system on a 6x6 triangular lattice and delivers ground state energy errors below 1% (with $\pm$ 1.5% variation, calculated with a hardware noise aware pipeline) on a 4x4 triangular lattice using the noisy emulator of the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device.

Abstract: Quantum operations that are perfectly admissible in non-relativistic quantum theory can enable signalling between spacelike separated regions when naively imported into quantum field theory (QFT). Prominent examples of such "impossible measurements", in the sense of Sorkin, include certain unitary kicks and projective measurements. It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose physical implementation arises from a fully relativistically covariant interaction, between the quantum field and a suitable probe, should be regarded as admissible. While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in "impossible measurement" scenarios. Finally, we show that the accuracy with which local field observables can be measured is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field, which also plays an essential role in a factorisation identity we prove for the field Kraus operators.

Abstract: Fermi's golden rule which describes the transition rates between two electronic levels under external stimulations is used ubiquitously in different fields of physics. The original Fermi's golden rule was derived from perturbative time-dependent Schrödinger's equation without the direct contribution by decoherence effect. However, as a result of recent developments of quantum computing and ultra fast carrier dynamics, the decoherence becomes a prominent topic in fundamental research.Here, by using the non-adiabatic molecular dynamics which goes beyond the time-dependent Schrödinger's equation by introducing decoherence, we study the effect of decoherence on Fermi's golden rule for the fixed basis and the adiabatic basis, respectively. We find that when the decoherence time becomes short, there is a significant deviation from the Fermi's golden rule for both bases. By using monolayer $\mathrm{WS_2}$ as an example, we investigate the decoherence effect in the carrier transitions induced by the electron-phonon coupling with first-principle method.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a novel holographic framework for mixed-state phases in random quantum circuits, both unitary and non-unitary, with a global symmetry $G$. Viewing the circuit as a tensor network, we decompose it into two parts: a symmetric layer, which defines an emergent gauge wavefunction in one higher dimension, and a random non-symmetric layer, which consists of random multiplicity tensors. For unitarity circuits, the bulk gauge state is deconfined, but under a generic non-unitary circuit (e.g. channels), the bulk gauge theory can undergo a decoherence-induced phase transition: for $G\,{=}\,\mathbb{Z}_N$ with local symmetric noise, the circuit can act as a quantum error-correcting code with a distinguished logical subspace inheriting the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-surface code's topological protection. We then identify that the charge sharpening transition from the measurement side is complementary to a decodability transition in the bulk: noise of the bulk can be interpreted as measurement from the environment. For $N\,{\leq}\,4$, weak measurements drive a single transition from a charge-fuzzy phase with sharpening time $t_{\#}\sim e^{L}$ to a charge-sharp phase with $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, corresponding to confinement that destroys logical information. For $N>4$, measurements generically generate an intermediate quasi-long-range ordered Coulomb phase with gapless photons and purification time $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(L)$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The decoy-state Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol is widely regarded as the de facto standard for practical implementations. On the receiver side, passive basis choice is attractive because it significantly reduces the need for random number generators and eliminates the need for optical modulators. Despite these advantages, a finite-key analytical security proof for the decoy-state BB84 protocol, where the basis is chosen passively with a biased probability, has been lacking. In this work, we present a simple analytical finite-key security proof for this setting, yielding a closed-form secret-key rate formula that can be directly evaluated using experimentally accessible parameters. Numerical simulations show that the key rates of passiveand active-measurement implementations are nearly identical, indicating that passive measurement does not compromise key-generation efficiency in practical QKD systems.

Conclusion:  Quantum mechanics allows for this limited form of intersubject agreement, but full agreement is forbidden。

Abstract: We formulate and prove an Agreement Theorem for quantum mechanics (QM), describing when two agents, represented by separate laboratories, can or cannot maintain differing probability estimates of a shared quantum property of interest. Building on the classical framework (Aumann, 1976), we define the modality of "common certainty" through a hierarchy of certainty operators acting on each agent's Hilbert space. In the commuting case -- when all measurements and event projectors commute -- common certainty leads to equality of the agents' conditional probabilities, recovering a QM analog of the classical theorem. By contrast, when non-commuting operators are allowed, the certainty recursion can stabilize with different probabilities. This yields common certainty of disagreement (CCD) as a distinctive QM phenomenon. Agreement is restored once measurement outcomes are recorded in a classical register. The classical Agreement Theorem can therefore be seen as emergent from the quantum world via recording. We establish an impossibility result stating that QM forbids a scenario where one agent is certain that a property of interest occurs, and is also certain that the other agent is certain that the property does not occur. In this sense, QM admits non-classical disagreement, but disagreement is still bounded in a disciplined way. We argue that our analysis offers a rigorous approach to the longstanding issue of how to understand intersubjectivity across agents in QM.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a cornerstone of financial decision-making, traditionally relying on classical algorithms to balance risk and return. Recent advances in quantum computing offer a promising alternative, leveraging quantum algorithms to efficiently explore complex solution spaces and potentially outperform classical methods in high-dimensional settings. However, conventional quantum approaches typically assume a one-to-one correspondence between qubits and variables (e.g. financial assets), which severely limits the applicability of gate-based quantum systems due to current hardware constraints. As a result, only quantum annealing-like methods have been used in realistic scenarios. In this work, we show how a gate-based variational quantum algorithm can be applied to a real-world portfolio optimization problem by assigning multiple variables per qubit. Specifically, we address a problem involving over 250 variables, where the market graph representing a real stock market is iteratively partitioned into sub-portfolios of highly correlated assets. This approach enables improved scalability compared to traditional variational methods and opens new possibilities for quantum-enhanced financial applications.

*Gaurang Agrawal,Matt Wilson*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the foundation of the generalised Born rule in compositional physical theories, demonstrating that it can be derived from basic principles. It shows that introducing noise strengthens the connection between scalars and probabilities. The study contributes to our understanding of how probability emerges in quantum theory and beyond.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the foundational principles of the Born rule is crucial for developing a deeper grasp of quantum mechanics and its generalizations. This paper aims to uncover the minimal assumptions needed for the Born rule to hold.

Method: The authors analyze process-theoretic models, comparing theories with and without the generalised Born rule. They demonstrate equivalence under certain conditions and explore the impact of introducing noise.

Result: The key outcome is the derivation of the Born rule from basic axioms, along with the understanding that noise increases the correspondence between scalar quantities and probabilities.

Conclusion: The paper provides a new foundation for the Born rule, showing its necessity and reinforcing the role of probabilities in physical theories.

Abstract: A basic postulate of modern compositional approaches to generalised physical theories is the generalised Born rule, in which probabilities are postulated to be computable from the composition of states and effects. In this paper we consider whether this postulate, and the strength of the identification between scalars and probabilities, can be argued from basic principles. To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds. We proceed to consider introduction of noise into any such theory, and observe that the result of doing so is a strengthening of the identification between scalars and probabilities; from bare monoid homomorphisms to semiring isomorphisms.

Result: TiO3系统中样本表现出由2p内层电子自旋-轨道相互作用引起量子纠缠，CeF3系统则通过4f电子的自旋-轨道相互作用和4f-4d电子间的交换相互作用形成量子纠缠。在3d→3p激发过程中，因3d-3p交换相互作用强烈，导致量子纠缠消失。

Conclusion: X射线内层激发中量子纠缠的生成机制复杂，可以通过不同激发路径和电子状态特性来调控其发生。

Abstract: We theoretically investigated how the quantum entanglement between the spin of the photoelectron and the polarization of the emitted X-ray photon depends on the excited core-level, using the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ and 3$d\rightarrow\ $3$p$ SPR-XEPECS (spin- and polarization-resolved XEPECS) processes for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$-type system, and the 4$f\rightarrow\ $4$d$ SPR-XEPECS process for $\rm CeF_{3}$-type system. In the calculation for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$-type system, we used $\rm TiO_{6}$ cluster model with the full-multiplet structure of the Ti ion and the charge-transfer effect between Ti 3$d$ and ligand O 2$p$ orbitals. For $\rm CeF_{3}$-type system, we used ionic model with the full-multiplet structure of the Ce ion. We found two distinct mechanisms for entanglement generation in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ and 4$f\rightarrow\ $4$d$ cases. The first is generated by the spin-orbit interaction of the 2$p$ core electron, whereas the second is generated by the spin-orbit interaction of the 4$f$ valence electron and strong exchange interaction between the 4$f$ and 4$d$ electrons. However, in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $3$p$ case with the strong 3$d-$3$p$ exchange interaction, we found that the entanglement is not generated due to the crystal field effect. These results reveal the existence of two distinct mechanisms for entanglement generation in X-ray inner-shell excitation processes.

Abstract: The ionization dynamics of a hydrogen molecule, serving as a fundamental benchmark in quantum chemistry, is investigated within a comprehensive framework combining quantum electrodynamics and the Lindblad master equation. This approach enables a first-principles description of light--matter interactions while accounting for dissipative processes and external particle influx. We systematically explore the system's evolution across three distinct regimes: closed, dissipative open, and influx-driven open quantum systems. Our results reveal a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule ($|\rm{H}_2\rangle$) across all configurations. The dissipation strengths for photons ($γ_Ω$), electrons ($γ_e$), and phonons ($γ_ω$) are identified as critical control parameters, with $γ_Ω$ significantly accelerating system stabilization. Furthermore, the introduction of particle influx ($μ_k$) leads to a complex redistribution of energy, notably populating the atomic state ($|\rm{H},\rm{H}\rangle$). The ionization pathway is exquisitely sensitive to the initial quantum state, dictated by the composition and number of photons, which governs the accessible spin-selective excitation channels. This is conclusively demonstrated in a model with an embedded anode, where the maximum ionization probability is fundamentally constrained to $\frac{3}{4}$ by orbital hybridization. This study provides a unified theoretical foundation for quantum-controlled chemistry, with direct implications for future experiments in cavity QED and quantum information processing.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of stochastic trajectories in configuration space and develops equations of motion for these variables to model the measurement process as a dynamical physical process.

Result: A new framework, quantum analytical mechanics, is proposed to complement the existing Hilbert space quantum mechanics by enriching the descriptive capabilities of the theory.

Conclusion: The proposal of quantum analytical mechanics does not replace but complements traditional quantum mechanics by introducing additional variables to explain the measurement process.

Abstract: The question about the existence of so-called ``hidden'' variables in quantum mechanics and the perception of the completeness of quantum mechanics are two sides of the same coin. Quantum analytical mechanics constitutes a completion of standard quantum mechanics based on the concept of stochastic trajectories in the configuration space of a quantum system. For particle systems, configuration space is made up out of their coordinates and, if relevant, their orientation. Quantum analytical mechanics derives equations of motion for these variables which allow a description of the measurement process as a dynamical physical process. After all, it is exactly these variables experiments are designed to interact with. The theory is not a replacement of Hilbert space quantum mechanics but a mathematical completion enriching our toolset for the description of quantum phenomena.

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or quantum magic, presents a valuable resource in quantum error correction and computation. We study the dynamics of locally injected magic in unitary Clifford circuits, where the total magic is conserved. However, the absence of physical observables quantifying magic precludes a direct microscopic or hydrodynamic description of its local distribution and dynamics. Using insights from stabilizer quantum error correcting codes, we rigorously show that the spatial distribution of magic can be inferred from a canonical representation of low-magic states, dubbed the bipartite magic gauge. Moreover, we propose two operationally relevant magic length scales. We numerically establish that, at early times, both length scales grow ballistically at distinct velocities set by the entanglement velocity, after which magic delocalizes. Our work sheds light on the spatiotemporal structure of quantum resources and complexity in many-body dynamics, opening up avenues for investigating their transport properties and further connections with quantum error correction.

Abstract: Active matter denotes a system of particles immersed in an external environment, from which the particles extract energy continuously in order to perform motion. Extending the paradigm of active matter to a quantum framework requires an open quantum system description. In this work, we consider a driven quantum particle whose external driving exhibits characteristics of classical activity. We model the dynamics with time-local master equations and analyze the particle motion at different time scales for different forms of the master equations. By systematically comparing several types of master equations, we uncover how the particle motion evolves under the interplay of quantum effects and active-like dynamics. These results are essential for guiding possible experiments aimed at realizing quantum analogues of classical active systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The dissipative quantum Rabi model exhibits rich non-equilibrium physics, including a dissipative phase transition from the normal phase to the superradiant phase. In this work, we investigate the stability of the superradiant phase in the presence of a weak spin relaxation. We find that even a weak spin relaxation can render the superradiant phase to a superradiant metastable phase, in which symmetry-breaking states are stable only for a finite time. This arises because each spin-jump induced by relaxation applies as a strong perturbation to the system, potentially driving the system from a symmetry-breaking state to the symmetry-preserving saddle point with finite probability, before it eventually relaxes back to a symmetry-breaking state. Such dynamical processes lead to a finite lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states and restore the symmetry in the steady state. To substantiate these results, we combine mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses with exact numerical simulations. The lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states are analyzed in finite-size systems, and the conclusions are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit via finite-size scaling. Our findings establish the metastable nature of the symmetry-breaking states in the dissipative quantum Rabi model and reveal the complexity of the dissipative phase transition beyond their equilibrium counterpart. The mechanisms uncovered here can be generalized to a broad class of open quantum systems, highlighting fundamental distinctions between equilibrium phase transitions and steady-state phase transitions.

The approach provides a unique way to explore the quantum-classical transition. The framework shows full gauge invariance and can constrain couplings through existing experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The search for fundamental interactions beyond general relativity and standard model. The interest in understanding the role of quantum coherence in physical processes and the potential for probing the quantum-classical boundary.

Method: Constructs a conserved coherence current operator via coarse-grained Noether mass current. Uses this to describe a gauge-interaction's effect, derives phase shifts, decoherence rates, and forces. Validates the consistency with gauge invariance and causality.

Result: Observable signatures in atom interferometers and nanoparticles, potential for constraining coupling constants with current experiments. The framework is complementary to other classical fifth-force searches and provides a new perspective on quantum coherence effects in gauge interactions.

Conclusion: Offers a new theoretical pathway to probe quantum coherence-dependent fundamental forces. Highlights the potential of quantum systems like atom interferometers and nanoparticles to constrain such interactions, contributing to the understanding of the quantum-classical transition and beyond-standard-model physics.

Abstract: We propose a hidden U(1) gauge interaction that couples exclusively to quantum coherence in massive systems. The central innovation is a conserved coherence current operator constructed from the Noether mass current via operator-level coarse-graining. This current vanishes for classical matter distributions but is nonzero for spatial superpositions and entangled states, yielding a gauge interaction that is dormant in classical regimes but activated by quantum coherence. The framework predicts three distinctive signatures: (i) interferometric phase shifts scaling linearly with fringe visibility, (ii) decoherence rates with characteristic m^2 scaling and spatial dependence distinct from collapse models, and (iii) entanglement-selective forces between distant massive qubits. The theory maintains full gauge invariance, causality, and positive time evolution. We show that state-of-the-art atom interferometers and levitated nanoparticles can place first constraints on this interaction class, complementary to classical fifth-force searches. This approach provides a novel theoretical framework for probing coherence-selective fundamental interactions and their potential role in the quantum-classical transition. To make this more concrete, we also spell out a simple benchmark latent-field model and work out, in detail, how a representative large-momentum-transfer atom interferometer constrains the corresponding coupling strength.

Conclusion: 提供了量子力学到经典力学的严格数学框架。

Abstract: We present a new way of deriving classical mechanics from quantum mechanics. A key feature of the method is its compatibility with the standard approach used to derive transition rates between quantum states due to interactions. We apply the developed method to derive the main formulas of physical kinetics. We observe that, through the Liouville equation, we can deduce the non-collision part of the Boltzmann equation, and that, through the matrix of transition rates, we can deduce the collision integral. As a final result of the manuscript, we derive the Boltzmann equation from the Schrödinger equation as a single piece of formal mathematical manipulation, without any non-rigorous plausible reasoning used to glue together its different parts.

Abstract: Quantum walks, the quantum analogue to the classical random walk, have been shown to model fluid dynamics. Neutral atom hardware is a promising choice of platform for implementing quantum walks due to its ability to implement native multiqubit ($\geq\!3$-qubit) gates and to dynamically re-arrange qubits. Using error modelling for multiqubit Rydberg gates via two-photon adiabatic rapid passage, we present the gate sequences and predicted final state fidelities for some toy quantum walks, including `lazy' quantum walks. These `lazy' quantum walks include a rest state and therefore provide an integral step towards quantum walks for fluid simulation.

TL;DR: 尽管改进了OSD、 msg-passing和聚类型解码器的FPGA实现，但 msg-passing显著优于其他两种解码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子纠错码在近 Future的量子计算中具有重要性，尤其是低密度奇偶校验码（qLDPC）。然而，实时解码器需要专用硬件来加速，但如何平衡硬件资源和解码效率仍是个挑战。

Method: 本文针对FPGA实现，改进了三种qLDPC解码器：Relay、OSD和聚类型解码器。对于OSD，提出了一种计算集中在高概率故障位置的新变体。对于聚类型解码器，设计了一种适应FPGA的广义联合查找解码器。

Result: 通过设计线性并行时间的高秩亏矩阵高斯消元法，加速了关键计算。尽管改进，但OSD和聚类型解码器仍明显慢于Relay型解码器。

Conclusion: 基于硬件资源的限制，信道码的实时性最合理的路线可能是Relay型 msg-passing解码器。

Abstract: Real-time decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing but likely requires specialized hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), whose parallelism can alter relative algorithmic performance. We analyze FPGA-tailored versions of three decoder classes for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes: message passing, ordered statistics, and clustering. For message passing, we analyze the recently introduced Relay decoder and its FPGA implementation; for ordered statistics decoding (OSD), we introduce a filtered variant that concentrates computation on high-likelihood fault locations; and for clustering, we design an FPGA-adapted generalized union-find decoder. We design a systolic algorithm for Gaussian elimination on rank-deficient systems that runs in linear parallel time, enabling fast validity checks and local corrections in clustering and eliminating costly full-rank inversion in filtered-OSD. Despite these improvements, both remain far slower and less accurate than Relay, suggesting message passing is the most viable route to real-time qLDPC decoding.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Advantage Distillation (AD) is a classical post-processing technique that enhances Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols by increasing the maximum acceptable Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and thus extending the distance at which QKD links can be securely established. AD operates by post-selecting blocks of bits and extracting fewer high-fidelity bits, exhibiting a reduced QBER and thus lowering the amount of information that has to be disclosed during the information reconciliation step. In this work we present the first comprehensive finite key-size analysis of decoy-state BB84 enhanced via AD post-processing. We demonstrate that through the use of AD the maximum acceptable QBER increases from around $9.5\%$ to around $17.3\%$ for realistic key sizes. This result shows that substantial performance enhancements can be achieved in scenarios which are constrained by the maximum tolerable QBER via improvements of the post-processing method alone.

Motivation: 该研究探讨硬币 Universe 量子态的可能性，提出了量子编码理论的数学框架。

Method: 使用量子力学术语，将 Universe 量子态与编码理论相关联，提出硬币 Universe 观念。

Result: 证明了硬币 Universe 量子态可以编码大量量子态。

Conclusion: 硬币 Universe 观念扩展了我们对量子 Universe 的理解。

Abstract: We revisit whether a semiclassical baby universe in AdS/CFT necessarily possess a trivial one-dimensional Hilbert space or may instead carry a large entropy. Recent results on Haar random encoding suggest a breakdown of complementary recovery, in which no logical operators can be reconstructed from individual bipartite subsystems. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretation where a baby universe emerges as logical degrees of freedom that cannot be accessed from either boundary alone, assuming pseudorandom dynamics in holographic CFTs. We then analyze two conceptual puzzles: an apparent cloning of baby-universe microstates and its eventual fate at the singularity. Both puzzles are avoided because no single boundary observer can access the baby-universe degrees of freedom, be it classical or quantum, reflecting an emergent form of complementarity due to the structure of random encoding. In this interpretation, observers arise naturally: the same heavy operator that prepares the baby-universe geometry also serves as observer-like degrees of freedom that define an observer-dependent baby-universe microstate.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究AdS$_2$中的局域性约束，发现现有AdS$_{d+1}$中的局域性求和法则不适用于$d=1$，因边界上算符的有序排列不等价及共形块的奇点结构不同。在假设守恒性与温和增长条件下，确立了幂律界的关联函数，并通过离散关系及偶数和奇数局域块的展开式，得到涵盖整个AdS$_2$域的两种新局域性求和法则。本文通过自由标量场理论进行了具体测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 局域性是量子场论中的基础概念，理解其在不同维数空间中的表现对于理论构建至关重要。AdS/CFT对偶提供了探索这些概念的有效工具。

Method: 研究AdS$_2$中的局域性约束，通过分析共形块的奇点结构及有序排列的不等价性，确立幂律界，并使用偶数和奇数局域块的离散展开式，推导出局域性求和法则，最后在自由标量场中进行验证。

Result: 证明了在$d=1$时局域性求和法则的存在，导出了偶数与奇数局域块的展开式，并在此基础上得到了新的局域性求和法则。对自由标量 Field 理论进行了行为测试，验证了结果的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究拓展了局域性求和法则至 AdS$_2$，提出了偶数与奇数局域块的新求和法则，并在具体场论中验证了结果。这些发现有助于更好的理解 AdS/CFT 对偶及局域性在低维空间的表现。

Abstract: We study bulk locality constraints in quantum field theories in AdS$_2$. The known derivation of locality sum rules in AdS$_{d+1}$ does not apply for $d=1$ due to the different singularity structure of the conformal blocks and the inequivalence of operator orderings on the boundary. Assuming unitarity and a mild growth condition, we establish power-law bounds for correlators, derive dispersion relations and an expansion in terms of ``even'' and ``odd'' local blocks that converges in the entire AdS$_2$. These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory.

Abstract: We explore the potential role of area metrics, a generalised notion of geometry, in the AdS/CFT correspondence. Guided by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the first law of entanglement, we derive both a holographic dictionary as well as a bulk equation of motion for area metric fluctuations linearised around a four dimensional AdS background. Furthermore, we explore potential bulk Lagrangians that could give rise to the derived equation. It is shown that writing area metric fluctuations in terms of Lanczos like potentials gives rise to a particularly elegant bulk model.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the effect of supersymmetry breaking on Krylov complexity in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK model under irrelevant and mass deformations of the Hamiltonian. The irrelevant deformation breaks $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry down to $\mathcal{N}=1$, while the mass deformation breaks supersymmetry completely. Using Krylov subspace methods, we analyze the Lanczos sequence, Krylov dimension, complexity, and entropy at finite system size as functions of deformation strength. Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation has a stronger effect. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity.

Conclusion: 这项研究 successfully explored精确-WKB形式在定量分析一维势的确切量子化中的应用，特别是在不同参数下的转变行为和谱特性。通过二维和三维势的实例分析，进一步验证了其理论模型的普适性和适用性。该研究深入揭示了精确-WKB形式与路径积分类方法之间的内在联系，为多势阱系统和高阶量子系统的研究提供了新的视角和方法。这一成果不仅丰富了精确-WKB形式的理论基础，还在实际应用中为量子系统的研究和计算提供了可行的方法和指导。

Abstract: We discuss the exact quantization of general one-dimensional potentials in view of the exact-WKB formalism. Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations.

Main category: hep-th

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the implications of marginal deformations in celestial CFTs and their connection to bulk theory transitions, leveraging geometric insights.

Method: The paper defines marginal operators as composite operators involving pairs from celestial memory and Goldstone diamonds, consistent with traditional holographic principles.

Result: The result demonstrates a correspondence between boundary marginal deformations and bulk vacuum transitions, providing a clearer understanding of holographic connections in this context.

Conclusion: The study solidifies the holographic relationship in celestial CFTs, offering new geometric perspectives for analyzing dual QFTs in asymptotically flat spacetime backgrounds.

Abstract: For a given conformal field theory (CFT), one can deform it via the addition of a marginal operator to the spectrum. In two dimensions, when the added operator has conformal weights $h=\bar{h}=1$, conformal symmetry is not broken and the resulting theory is a distinct CFT. Studying such marginal operators for celestial CFTs allows for a geometric understanding of the space of allowed boundary theories dual to quantum field theories (QFT) in bulk asymptotically flat spacetimes. In traditional holographic examples, a marginal deformation on the boundary corresponds to a vacuum transition in the bulk theory. We affirm this in celestial CFTs which requires a general definition of marginal operators as composite celestial operators via pairs that live at distinct corners of celestial memory and Goldstone diamonds.

Abstract: We obtain a non-relativistic chiral massive higher-spin gravity in a deformed $AdS_3$ spacetime by applying a Lifshitz deformation and subsequent null reduction to chiral massless higher-spin gravity in $AdS_4$. Intriguingly, the vertices of this non-relativistic theory are less constrained than the ones of the original $4d$ chiral massless theory since we do not have enough dynamical generators to fix the couplings uniquely. Anticipating higher-spin interactions should be suppressed, we propose a simple approximate mass-spin relation which interpolates between the relativistic and non-relativistic regimes. With the proposed mass-spin relation, we observe that that higher-spin interactions indeed become suppressed at large spins, consistent with low-energy physics. We conjecture that the holographic dual of the non-relativistic chiral massive higher-spin gravity proposed in this work is a $2d$ non-relativistic Landau-Ginzburg theory in the light-cone gauge. This non-relativistic theory is expected to describe a two-fluid system with a $λ$-point constrained in one spatial dimension.

Abstract: We construct the planar integrand of the six-leg amplitude of massive W-bosons on the special Coulomb branch of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to two-loop order. We use the six-dimensional supersymmetric spinor-helicity formalism and the generalized unitarity-cut sewing technique to perform this analysis. The thus-found expression corresponds in the massless limit to the six-gluon maximally helicity-violating amplitude. The upshot of the current consideration is that the former is just an uplift of the latter from four to six dimensions. This repeats the pattern found earlier for four- and five-leg amplitudes of massive W-bosons.

Abstract: In this work we investigate holographic spacelike and timelike entanglement entropy using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription, for slab-shaped and ball-shaped entangling regions. We work with an infinite family of 10-dimensional Type IIB supergravity solutions, which are gravity duals to an infinite set of linear quiver theories, with the backgrounds defined using the electrostatic potential formalism for brane configurations. The dual theories are 4-dimensional confining theories at low energy, but decompactify and flow to 5-dimensional SCFTs in the UV. We find that the entanglement entropy exhibits phase transition behaviour, and we use our results to investigate proposed c-functions constructed from the entanglement entropy. Comparing with the flow central charge, another proposed c-function, we find that each displays good behaviour, and reflects both UV and IR features of the dual theory.

Conclusion: 此类模型在n=1时类似于受限BF理论，但随着n的增加，其动力学变得更加复杂且包含局域自由度。

Abstract: We consider a class of models in even spacetime dimensions $2n$ which share many similarities with Chern-Simons theories in odd spacetime dimensions $2n+1$. The independent dynamical variables of these models are a $GL(2n)$-connection and a metric in internal space. The action is a polynomial of degree $n$ in the curvature of the connection, with indices saturated by means of the metric and the Levi-Civita tensor. We show that the theory has no local degree of freedom in $2$ spacetime dimensions ($n=1$), where it can be reformulated as a constrained $BF$ model, but that its dynamics is more intrincate in higher dimensions ($n>1$), where local degrees of freedom are present. We treat in detail the cases of $2$ and $4$ spacetime dimensions.}

TL;DR: 研究了对称的聚变偏心弦，展示了闭弦如何在恒定卡尔布-拉蒙背景中转化为开放弦。思路清晰地说明了协同转换、边界条件的变化以及广义真空状态。探讨了环面共形化处理和世界面玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚现象。第二部分统一了对开弦非交换参数的对称推导，揭示了边界对称形式如何导致非交换几何，特别是当张力趋于零时卡罗annis几何的独特贡献。结论很好地整合了聚变现象、边界非交换性以及广义真空结构，这些All这些现象都源自带有磁场的弦世界面上几何的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弦理论中的聚变现象一直以来都是一个悬而未决的重要问题，而且基于卡罗annis几何的非交换空间理论在现代理论物理中占有重要地位。作者在研究对称的聚变偏心弦，试图通过卡尔布-拉蒙背景下的开闭弦转换和边界条件分析，揭示起波动形式与非交换几何间的关系，这具有重要的理论意义和应用前景。

Method: 在论文中，作者首先从闭弦的偏心弦出发，考虑恒定的卡尔布-拉蒙场下的情况，分析在张力趋于零的情况（即卡罗annis极限），首提出聚变偏心弦的全球性关系。接着，通过推导边界条件的改变和gluing矩阵的构建，导出广义化的边界状态。第二部分，通过统一的对称推导，揭示了开弦非交换参数的来源，并分析了这一现象在环面共形化处理中的表现。第三部分，深入探讨了当弦世界面上发生玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚时的现象，展示了这一过程如何持续不变地维持非交换几何特性。

Result: 本文的主要结果显示：在卡尔布-拉蒙场的存在下，闭弦在张力趋于零时，通过卡罗annis极限，发生聚变转变为开放弦。在这种情况下，边界条件发生显著变化，通过gluing矩阵构成了广义化的边界状态，这个状态可以通过布洛卡变换连续地从闭弦的真空态过渡到开放弦的真空态。此外，在环面共形化处理的情况下，世界面玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚的现象得以持续。在第二部分，统一的对称推导揭示了开弦的非交换参数来源于边界的对称形式，且在张力趋于零时，卡尔布-拉蒙场的非交换贡献是唯一的。其逆得到的非交换参数与Seiberg-Witten结果相似，但结果源于弦世界面的协同几何变化。

Conclusion: 总的来说，作者通过研究对称的聚变偏心弦，在恒定卡尔布-拉蒙场的背景下，涵盖了聚变到开放弦的全过程，自动化了边界条件、gluing矩阵、广义边界状态以及非交换参数的形成。尤其是在张力趋于零的情况下，文中得出的结论具有深刻的理论意义，并且推广了在环面共形场论中的相关现象。atoes(open-string noncommutativity)、边界条件变化以及广义真空态的协同变化都是由弦世界面几何的变化自然引致的。

Abstract: We study tensionless bosonic strings propagating in the presence of a constant Kalb-Ramond background and show how closed strings undergo a transition into open strings in this regime. The tensionless (Carrollian) limit induces a universal gluing between the worldsheet oscillators, which we generalize to include the effects of a constant $B$-field. We derive the modified mixed boundary conditions, construct the corresponding gluing matrix and obtain the generalized induced vacuum as a squeezed boundary state. This vacuum continuously emerges from the closed string vacuum through a Bogoliubov transformation, providing a precise realization of the closed-to-open string transition. We further extend the analysis to toroidal compactifications, and show that the mechanism of worldsheet Bose-Einstein condensation persists unaltered. In the second part of the paper, we give a unified symplectic derivation of the open string noncommutative parameter. We show that the boundary symplectic form alone determines the noncommutative geometry, and that in the tensionless limit the $B$-field term becomes the unique surviving contribution. Its inverse produces a noncommutative parameter similar to the Seiberg-Witten result, but arising intrinsically from the Carrollian worldsheet dynamics. Our results establish a coherent picture in which the emergence of open strings, boundary noncommutativity, and generalized vacuum structure all arise naturally from the worldsheet geometry of null strings in a $B$-field background.

Abstract: When a set of charged or dyonic objects scatter and subsequently disperse, the process generically emits electromagnetic radiation. The classical soft photon theorem constrains the constant term and leading power-law fall-off of the emitted waveform at asymptotic times solely in terms of the momenta and charges of the incoming and outgoing particles. In this work, we extend the analysis to include the full tower of subleading corrections in the late-time and early-time expansion of the electric and magnetic waveforms, providing explicit expressions that depend only on the kinematic data and the electric and magnetic charges of the scattered objects. Using independent electric and magnetic potentials, we compute the full classical soft expansion for general dyonic scattering. We provide explicit, recursive expressions for the trajectory coefficients and the resulting electric and magnetic waveforms. The resulting soft expansion exhibits manifest covariance under the electric-magnetic duality. The electric and magnetic waveforms transform as an $SO(2)$ doublet under electric-magnetic duality. This provides a non-trivial consistency check on our formulation. For the specific case of two-body scattering, we obtain resummed expressions for the waveforms in both the time and frequency domains.

While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $Λ$CDM at $1.5σ$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4σ$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8σ$ to $2.3σ$ (resp. $1.5σ$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models.

Abstract: The dark bubble model makes a positive cosmological constant natural in string theory, and predicts several new physical phenomena within reach in the near future. In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $Ω_c \approx 5\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant. We end by speculating on how to incorporate AdS black shells as black hole mimickers within the dark bubble model.

Abstract: We investigate the extended phase-space thermodynamics and $P$--$V$ criticality of electrically charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in Kalb--Ramond bumblebee gravity in the presence of a spherically symmetric cloud of strings. The background Kalb--Ramond field induces Lorentz symmetry violation through a dimensionless parameter $\ell$, while the string cloud is characterized by a parameter $α$, both entering the lapse function and deforming the geometry. Interpreting the ADM mass as enthalpy, we derive the main thermodynamic quantities, Hawking temperature, entropy, thermodynamic volume, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat, and analyze how $(\ell,α)$ jointly affect stability and phase structure. We obtain a Van der Waals--type equation of state, compute the critical point $(P_c,T_c,v_c)$, and show that, although the critical scales depend nontrivially on $\ell$ and $α$, the universal ratio $P_c v_c/T_c = 3/8$ is preserved. Using the thermodynamic topology approach, we determine that the total topological charge of the black hole solution remains $W=1$, placing it in the same topological class as the Reissner--Nordström--AdS black hole. Finally, by studying the Joule--Thomson expansion, we derive the inversion curve and find that the minimal inversion temperature satisfies $T_i^{\rm min}/T_c = 1/2$, as in the Reissner--Nordström--AdS case, indicating that Lorentz violation and the string cloud deform the thermodynamic scales without changing the underlying universality class.

We generalize this framework to massless momentum-space Feynman integrals with three off-shell legs and obtain a similar family of identities that can be used to calculate these integrals, especially for a non-planar subset of them, which naturally arise in the off-shell Sudakov form factors.

Abstract: In this paper we construct solutions with AdS/dS asymptotics for $D=3$ truncated gauged supergravity with a periodic scalar potential. In a holographic perspective assuming Dirichlet boundary conditions, the solutions can be interpreted as deformations of 2d dual CFTs triggered by non-zero vacuum expectation values of irrelevant operators. In addition to the domain wall type solutions, we incorporated in the analysis a black string solution, which can be also interpreted as a deformation by VEV of an irrelevant operator. Generalizing the flows to finite temperature we find that the corresponding geometries are singular but have horizons. For certain flows we provide an analytical description near the horizon region.

Abstract: We consider the effective theory of heterotic strings in two spacetime dimensions, in a double field theory-inspired formalism, manifestly consistent with $T$-duality in string theory. Restricting the gauge group to a single $\mathrm{U}(1)$, we study the charged black hole solution and perform a precise analysis of the properties of the dual geometry with the $\mathrm{O}(1,2; \mathbb{R})$-valued generalized metric. We comment on some aspects related to singularities and gauge dependence. We show that the classification program for higher derivative corrections can also be applied to the heterotic case. We further elucidate how a previously proposed solution to the equations of motion, parametrized in a manner fully non-perturbative in $α'$, can be extended to the scenario with $r$ abelian fields and the corresponding $\mathrm{O}(1,1+r; \mathbb{R})$ symmetry. We discuss some novel features of the solution for charged black holes.

Abstract: Among the many effects that occur in beam-beam electron-positron collisions at TeV energies, emission of hard synchrotron radiation, or beamstrahlung, has special importance. Beamstrahlung determines the energy spectrum of the most energetic electrons, positrons, and photons and supplies the initial condition for the calculation of all other QED processes. In this paper, we show that the description of beamstrahlung simplifies in the limit of large quantum parameter $Υ$, which is realized in 10 TeV collider designs. The beamstrahlung spectra for electrons and photons are given in terms of universal functions. We supply approximations to these functions that will be useful for more general studies of the beam-beam interaction at very high energies.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the charge carrier mobility in high-purity germanium (HPGe) as its thickness decreases, from bulk to micrometer scale, which is crucial for improving advanced radiation detectors and quantum devices. The study reveals that the mobility follows an extended exponential dependence influenced by electrostatic depletion, leading to a simpler device-level design rule for optimizing transport properties. Extracted parameters provide benchmarks for mobility engineering.:length=327


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how charge-carrier mobility evolves in HPGe as it is thinned is essential for optimizing radiation detectors, thin-body Ge electronics, and quantum devices. This knowledge contributes to the development of advanced materials for sensing, imaging, and quantum technologies.inish=42

Method: The researchers conducted Hall-effect measurements on n- and p-type HPGe samples, varying the thickness from 2.7 mm to 7 μm. They employed boundary-scattering and depletion-based models to analyze the data and determine the factors influencing mobility.

Result: The study found that mobility degradation is primarily due to electrostatic depletion, reducing the effective conducting channel thickness. The mobility follows an extended exponential dependence, with characteristic electrostatic lengths ranging from 6 to 50 μm. Boundary-scattering models did not adequately explain the mobility trends, emphasizing the importance of electrostatic effects. Comparison of long-range screening and near-surface electric fields revealed these as the primary mechanisms governing mobility crossover. Parameters extracted from the study provide quantitative benchmarks for optimizing mobility in ultrathin HPGe and predict performance in fully depleted Ge-on-insulator structures.ulong=6

Conclusion: This paper provides a systematic understanding of how the thickness of high-purity germanium affects charge-carrier mobility. The findings highlight the importance of electrostatic depletion as a dominant factor in mobility degradation and offer a design rule for optimizing the performance of Ge-based devices. The extracted parameters and extended exponential model serve as valuable tools for mobility engineering in various applications, including radiation detection, thin-body electronics, and quantum devices. This study advances the use of HPGe in next-generation electronic and quantum technologies by providing clear guidelines based on experimental data and theoretical modeling.

Abstract: Understanding how charge-carrier mobility evolves as high-purity germanium (HPGe) is thinned from bulk to micrometer scale is essential for optimizing advanced radiation detectors, thin-body Ge electronics, and emerging quantum devices. We report, to our knowledge, the first systematic thickness-dependent mobility study on bulk-grown, detector-grade HPGe, performing Hall-effect measurements on $n$- and $p$-type samples thinned from $2.7~\mathrm{mm}$ down to $7~\mathrm{μm}$ at room temperature. The mobility follows an extended-exponential dependence $μ(t) = μ_0 \left[ 1 - \exp\big( - (t/τ)^β \big) \right]$ with characteristic electrostatic lengths $τ= 6$--$50~\mathrm{μm}$. Comparison with boundary-scattering and depletion-based models shows that mobility degradation is dominated not by Fuchs--Sondheimer surface scattering but by electrostatic depletion that reduces the effective conducting channel thickness. Across all samples, the hierarchy $λ_D < τ\lesssim W_0$ identifies long-range screening and near-surface electric fields as the primary mechanisms governing the mobility crossover. This connection provides a simple device-level design rule: maintaining $t \gtrsim 3τ$ preserves most of the bulk mobility, while thinner devices enter a depletion-controlled regime with sharply reduced transport. The extracted parameters thus supply quantitative benchmarks for mobility engineering in ultrathin HPGe and a predictive framework for Ge-on-insulator structures, fully depleted channels, and future Ge-based quantum and electronic technologies.

Motivation: THz combs have potential in various fields but face challenges like size, bandwidth, and cooling. This work aims to overcome these issues.

Method: Used an RTD oscillator with an injected RF signal in a metallic waveguide to create a tunable, broadband TFC.

Result: Achieved a 1 octave bandwidth, tunable repetition frequency, and high data rate for communications.

Conclusion: Significant step towards practical, room-temperature THz combs for real-world applications.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency combs (TFCs) are promising for numerous applications in spectroscopy, metrology, sensing, and wireless communications. However, the practical applications of TFCs have been hindered thus far by the need for cryogenic cooling, limited bandwidth, and bulky configuration, largely due to the lack of advanced THz sources. Here, we report an electrically pumped, room-temperature, broadband, compact, and tunable TFC by integrating an actively mode-locked resonant tunneling diode (RTD) in a metallic waveguide. By injecting a strong, continuous-wave radio frequency (RF) signal into a direct-current-driven RTD oscillator, we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, offset-free comb spectrum spanning more than one octave, from 0.14 to 0.325 THz at room temperature. Moreover, we show that the repetition frequency of the TFC can be tuned from 0.9 to 50 GHz by the injected RF signal, and a 120 Gbps (16 Gbps per channel) data rate can be achieved in the TFC-based high-speed single-channel (multi-channel) wireless communications.

Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in exciton-polariton condensates governs spinor interactions among quasi-particles and shapes the emergence of topological excitations, such as vortices, solitons, and strings. Conventional approaches to generate and manipulate these excitations rely on external gauge fields and structured light modulation, or microcavity TE-TM polarization splitting. While the former can only access the polariton pseudospin indirectly, through separate coupling of the excitonic or photonic component, the latter suffers from a lack of deterministic control over the resulting topological defects. Here, we report the generation of topology-induced spin polaritons in a monolithic bound state in the continuum (BIC) perovskite metasurface with broken inversion symmetry. Upon condensation, spin-momentum locking enables the generation of a pair of half-vortex within the polariton fluid, which display mutual attraction due to the connecting polarization string linking their opposite spins. We find that an increase in polariton density, enhancing the characteristic blueshift of the emission spectrum, leads to a narrowing of the inter-vortex separation, revealing deterministic interactions pinned to the cavity topology. By harnessing structural control alone, our approach enables robust engineering of the intrinsic pseudospin texture of the polariton fluid, offering a versatile platform for manipulating vortex nucleation, interaction, and annihilation without employing external fields.

Abstract: This paper introduces fly-by transit (FBT), a novel mobility system that employs modular mini-electric vehicles (mini-EVs) to provide door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops. Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy.
  As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research.

Abstract: A particle on a substrate supporting a surface acoustic wave can experience horizontal drift excited by the dry friction force. The effect is referred to as vibrational transportation, or as a surface acoustic wave motor. A traditional theory of vibrational transportation considers a particle as a material point moving on a rigid substrate. A more realistic representation is a contact model based on Cattaneo-Mindlin (also called Hertz-Mindlin) mechanics applicable to an axisymmetric deformable particle. A recent semi-analytical extension of the Cattaneo-Mindlin solution called the Method of Memory Diagrams allows one to compute the hysteretic friction force for an arbitrary loading history in terms of contact displacements, and, subsequently, to numerically solve the equations of motion. Depending on the materials' and excitation parameters, the particle can stay in permanent contact with the substrate or experience multiple jumps. In the former case, the particle can slide along the surface, during each wave period, advancing and receding with different efficiencies, which finally results in a drift. The drift can occur both in the wave propagation direction and against it. In the regime of multiple jumps, directed horizontal motion is also possible. It is based on synchronization between the wave period and rebounding events. A rebound occurs once per period and consistently at the same phase. At the beginning of the process, the particle moves with an acceleration that decreases and finally disappears. Exactly the same type of motion against the wave has been observed in our preliminary experiments. We demonstrate that a point mass behaves differently: in a regime of permanent contact, negative and positive sliding are equilibrated, which produces no drift, whereas multiple rebounds of a point mass are always chaotic, at least for fully conservative collisions.

TL;DR: This paper unifies two perspectives on the number of fundamental constants in relativistic spacetime, demonstrating that only one is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the minimal number of fundamental constants in spacetime is a key question in theoretical physics, particularly in theories aiming to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. This paper addresses this question by exploring the relationship between different approaches to counting constants.

Method: The authors build on two existing frameworks: one by Matsas, Pleitez, Saa, and Vanzella, which posits that spacetime requires only one fundamental constant, and another by Alexandrov and Zeeman, which mathematically demonstrates that the light-cone structure determines spacetime geometry up to a conformal factor. The authors combine these perspectives to show that the normalization of a single clock worldline uniquely determines the metric within the conformal class.

Result: The authors prove that the normalization of a single clock worldline is sufficient to select a unique metric from the conformal class. This result clarifies that only one fundamental constant is needed to describe relativistic spacetime.

Conclusion: By synthesizing insights from the MPSV and AZ frameworks, the authors conclusively demonstrate that relativistic spacetime can be described by only one fundamental constant, narrowing the debate on the necessary number of constants in a fully deterministic spacetime model.

Abstract: We unify two complementary viewpoints on relativistic spacetime and the counting of fundamental constants. Operationally, Matsas, Pleitez, Saa, and Vanzella (MPSV) have recently argued that relativistic spacetime requires only a single fundamental dimensional constant. Mathematically, theorems due to Alexandrov and Zeeman demonstrate that the light-cone structure determines the spacetime geometry only up to a conformal factor. We show that these approaches are mutually reinforcing: the Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems establish the rigid conformal structure of spacetime, while the ``bona fide clock'' required by MPSV serves the necessary mathematical role of breaking the dilation symmetry. We provide a formal derivation proving that the normalization of a single clock worldline is sufficient to select a unique metric from the conformal class, thereby clarifying that the number of fundamental constants is exactly one.

Abstract: Gravitational wave denoising is an ongoing task for revealing the events of compact binary objects in the universe. Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage. Our work suggests the possibility of a better methodological design for gravitational wave data analysis.

Abstract: In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the formation of traversable wormholes within effective field theory frameworks is crucial for exploring quantum gravity and spacetime structure.

Method: The analysis focuses on the perturbative construction of wormhole solutions around black hole horizons

Result: Apparent no-go theorems are established; wormholes cannot be formed perturbatively without introducing novel ingredients or reduced symmetry.

Conclusion: The results imply limitations on wormhole formation through effective field theory corrections to black hole physics.

Abstract: We reformulate the construction of wormhole solutions as perturbations around near-horizon geometries of near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes in four dimensions and equal-angular-momenta Myers-Perry black holes in five dimensions. When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordström or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach. Their realization would require either new ingredients, such as Casimir energy, or black holes with reduced symmetry.

Abstract: We consider the optical appearance of a non-singular, spherically symmetric black hole from Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity coupled to anisotropic fluids. Such a black hole has a single (external) horizon located very near the Schwarzschild radius, $r_h=2M$, while its surface of unstable bound geodesics (photon sphere) is located at a moderately shortened radius than its Schwarzschild counterpart. Relying on a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk with a monochromatic emission described by suitable adaptations of Standard Unbound profiles previously employed in the literature, we generate images of this solution, which displays relevant modifications to the typical photon ring and central brightness depression features found in black hole images. In this sense, we fit the width of the two first photon rings in order to reconstruct the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound geodesics characterizing the theoretical ratio of successive rings. Such an exponent is tightly attached to observational features of photon rings such as their relative intensities in time-averaged images and the time-scale of hot-spots. Our results point out that non-singular black holes of this type are hard to distinguish from their Schwarzschild counterparts using this method alone, since the theoretical, numerical, disk-modeling, and observational uncertainties are too entangled with one another to allowing a neat distinction of such an exponent. It also points out to the need of incorporating dynamical settings such as hot-spots or quasi-normal modes from gravitational wave ringdowns as a way to circumvent such difficulties.

Abstract: We present a unified investigation of black hole shadows, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and greybody factors (GBFs) for a static, spherically symmetric black hole within a composite environment of a modified Chaplygin-like dark fluid (MCDF) and a cloud of strings (CoS). We examine the structure of critical photon orbits and the corresponding optical appearance under spherical accretion. Using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, we compute the quasinormal frequencies and greybody spectra, and explore their correspondence with the black hole shadows in the eikonal limit. A systematic parameter study demonstrates that the CoS intensity has the primary influence on the shadows, QNMs and GBFs, while the MCDF parameters introduce more complex but characterizable modifications to each. Our results demonstrate that these environmental components imprint distinct yet interrelated signatures on key observables, offering specific predictions for probing exotic black hole environments.

Abstract: The scattering of charged massive scalar waves by Kerr-Newman black holes, with incidence along the equatorial plane, is investigated in this work. The differential scattering cross section is computed using the partial wave method, with the forward divergence handled via the series reduction technique. For the first time, we systematically examine the influence of the black hole charge, electromagnetic interactions, and field mass on the equatorial cross section. Our results reveal that regardless of whether the electromagnetic interaction is present or not, the frame-dragging effect shifts the glory away from the exact backward direction and can place interference minima there, contrasting with the on-axis scattering case. The average scattered flux intensity at the medium to large scattering angles exhibits a large enhancement as the Lorentz attraction or field mass increases, particularly in the slowly rotating regime, with the enhancement being frequency-dependent. When superradiance occurs, we observe that the cross section in the prograde scattering angles ($\sim 135^{\circ} < φ< 270^{\circ}$) increases as the black hole spin increases, due to enhanced prograde partial wave contributions. Meanwhile, the superradiant scattering cross section increases in all (except the forward) directions when the Lorentz force becomes more repulsive. These findings highlight unique equatorial-plane signatures of charged, rotating spacetimes, distinguishing them from prior on-axis analyses.

Abstract: In order to detect the quantum nature of gravity, the quantum gravity induced entanglement of masses(QGEM) has been proposed both in flat and curved spacetime. In this paper we propose an analogous QGEM protocol using photons produced in astronomical processes as the quantum systems. Unlike massive particles, the gravitational interaction between photons-intrinsically relativistic particles-simultaneously satisfies both the event and system localities. So it can provide a clear test of whether the gravitational mediator must be nonclassical based on the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) principle. Although the gravitationally induced entanglement between massless relativistic photons is extremely small, our quantitative calculations clarify the characteristic features of the entanglement induced by the photon's own gravitational field in astronomical process and may inspire other photon entanglement experiments.

Motivation: To compare and validate numerical results from two studies on the late-time dynamics of collapsing self-gravitating charged scalar fields.

Method: Analyzed abstracts of HP (1993) and AVV (2021) to identify discrepancies and errors.

Result: HP's analytical and numerical results about inverse power law tails are consistent. AVV's numerical results for oscillatory tails show discrepancies in decay rates and amplitudes.

Conclusion: AVV's findings contain critical inaccuracies that should be addressed in future research.

Abstract: The asymptotically decaying tails that characterize the late-time dynamics of collapsing self-gravitating charged massless scalar fields were studied three decades ago by Hod and Piran (HP). In particular, it was shown, both analytically and numerically, that the late-time behavior of these collapsing charged massless scalar fields is governed by oscillatory inverse power law tails, which decay more slowly than the familiar tails of neutral massless fields. Recently Álvares and Vaño-Viñuales (AVV) have investigated the same model numerically. While most of their results are in very good agreement with the earlier findings of HP, there are also some discrepancies between the original results of HP and those reported by AVV. In this compact comment, we wish to highlight a number of inaccurate claims and critical errors in the analysis and results presented by AVV.

Abstract: In this article, we performed Simpson-Visser (SV)-regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes and then studied thermal properties of the resulting spacetime geometry. We considered the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics in this case and derived an entropy formula consistent with this new regular geometry. Next, we carried out the free energy analysis and studied the phase structure of these black holes. We discovered non-trivial phase transition properties dependent on the SV-regularization parameter. We also considered the validity of the second law of black hole thermodynamics and analyzed a merger scenario of two equal mass SV-regular black holes. In particular, we investigated the impact of the SV-regularization parameter on the constraints on post-merger black hole mass. Intrestingly, we found that the bounds initially increase and then fall sharply with increasing the SV-regularization parameter. All results are compared with standard black holes for vanishing SV-regularization parameter.

Abstract: The tidal forces experienced on an orbit contain, in principle, information about the underlying spacetime an object is moving through. Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.

*Florin Manea*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper calculates the first-order correction to the entanglement entropy of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction across a Schwarzschild black hole's horizon, deriving an explicit analytic expression for the renormalized Newton constant and entropy correction. Using Euclidean action, replica trick, and heat kernel methods, the expression depends on the horizon area, scalar mass, interaction strength, and curvature coupling. The correction has a logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. After renormalization, the entropy follows the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite value. The correction is influenced by model parameters, with light fields, strong interactions, and curvature affecting the outcome. The result shows how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how quantum fields modify black hole entropy is a fundamental question in quantum gravity and black hole thermodynamics. This paper contributes to that understanding by considering a scalar field with a quartic self-interaction, providing insights into the role of interactions and renormalization in entropy corrections.

Method: The authors employ a combination of advanced mathematical techniques including Euclidean path integral formalism, replica trick, and heat kernel methods. These tools allow them to compute the entanglement entropy correction and handle the divergences that arise, particularly the logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence.

Result: The paper presents a fully explicit analytic expression for the first-order correction to the entanglement entropy. The correction depends on several key parameters and exhibits a logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. After renormalization, the entropy assumes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite value. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of how the correction varies with model parameters, such as the scalar mass, interaction strength, curvature coupling, and horizon area. Their results demonstrate that light fields, strong interactions, and curvature significantly influence the magnitude of the entropy correction.

Conclusion: This paper provides a clear and rigorous analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions affect black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant. The results not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of black hole thermodynamics but also open the door for further studies on how different quantum field configurations modify black hole entropy in various spacetime scenarios.

Abstract: We compute the first-order correction to the entanglement entropy of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction across the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.

Abstract: Recently, a remarkable new class of spacetimes describing black holes immersed in a non-aligned electromagnetic field has been found. While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Plebański--Demiański family. Here we demonstrate that the whole class admits a hidden symmetry encoded in the non-degenerate conformal Killing--Yano 2-form. Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Plebański--Demiański class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full "tower of symmetries". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics. Moreover, as we shall show, the novel spacetimes provide an interesting test-ground for studying the recently defined Penrose charges whose existence is intrinsically related to hidden rather than explicit symmetries.

Abstract: We study the cosmological consequences of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) by deriving modified Friedmann equations through thermodynamic arguments. The evolution of the effective equation of state induced by EUP corrections is analyzed and characterized using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization. We then examine the fulfillment of classical energy conditions, including the null, weak, strong, and dominant conditions. The dynamical and thermodynamic stability of the model is investigated, showing that the EUP cosmology admits a late-time de Sitter attractor. Finally, we evaluate the effective speed of sound associated with the model and discuss implications for perturbative stability. Our findings indicate that EUP-induced corrections can produce a consistent late-time acceleration without requiring a cosmological constant.

Abstract: The detection of the gravitational waves produced after the coalescence of two neutron stars is greatly anticipated because it will be able to provide information about matter in extreme conditions, especially if the remnant turns out to go through a hypermassive or a supermassive neutron star state before collapsing into a black hole. Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation. One possibility would be to improve the sensitivity in a frequency range that allows us to determine whether or not a black hole was formed in the coalescence.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate relativistic tidal forces around a black hole sourced by a cloud of strings, described by the generalized Letelier-Alencar solution. We first review the original Letelier spacetime and its recent generalization, computing the Kretschmann scalar, and showing that the generalized model exhibits a stronger curvature divergence at $r \to 0$ than both Letelier and Schwarzschild cases. We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components.

Conclusion: 该研究为减少计算成本、降低能耗、扩展RQA应用提供了新的思路，具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is a widely used tool for studying complex dynamical systems, but its standard implementation requires computationally expensive calculations of recurrence plots (RPs) and line length histograms. This study introduces strategies to compute RQA measures directly from time series or phase space vectors, avoiding the need to construct RPs. The calculations can be further accelerated and optimised by applying a random sampling procedure, in which only a subset of line structures is evaluated. These modifications result in shorter run times, less memory use and access, and lower overall energy consumption during analysis while maintaining accuracy. This makes them especially appealing for large-scale data analysis and machine learning applications. The ideas are not limited to diagonal line measures, but can likewise be applied to vertical line-based measures and to recurrence network measures. By lowering computational costs, the proposed strategies contribute to energy saving and sustainable data analysis, and broaden the applicability of recurrence-based methods in modern research contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding lithium diffusion in solid-state batteries is essential for improving battery performance and safety, making it a key focus for researchers in the field.

Method: The methodology involves a bottom-up approach using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), and Markov state models (MSMs) to bridging atomistic and mesoscale modeling for lithium transport analysis.

Result: The developed framework integrates ABINIT, MLFFs, and MSMs to accurately simulate lithium diffusion, which aligns with experimental data even for rare events occurring beyond typical AIMD time scales.

Conclusion: This integrated approach provides a scalable and transferable method to study lithium transport in solid-state battery anodes, which can enhance the design of next-generation battery materials.

Abstract: Lithium diffusion in solid-state battery anodes occurs through thermally activated hops between metastable sites often separated by large energy barriers, making such events rare on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) timescales. Here, we present a bottom-up multiscale workflow that integrates AIMD, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), and Markov state models (MSMs) to establish a quantitatively consistent link between atomistic hopping mechanisms and mesoscale transport. MLFFs fine-tuned on AIMD reference data retain near-DFT accuracy while enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations extending to tens of nanoseconds. These extended trajectories remove the strong finite-size bias present in AIMD and yield diffusion coefficients in excellent agreement with experiment. Furthermore, from these long MLFF trajectories, we obtain statistically converged lithium jump networks and construct MSMs that remain Markovian across more than two orders of magnitude in the lag times used for their construction. The resulting MSMs faithfully reproduce mean-square displacements and recover rare diffusion processes that do not occur on AIMD timescales. In addition to propagating lithium distributions, the MSM transition matrices provide mechanistic insight: their eigenvalues and eigenvectors encode characteristic relaxation timescales and dominant transport pathways. Although demonstrated for defect-free crystalline Li$_x$Si$_y$ phases, the AIMD$\rightarrow$MLFF$\rightarrow$MSM framework is general and provides a transferable approach for describing lithium transport in amorphous materials, defect-mediated diffusion, and next-generation solid-state anodes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The reported ''dissociation times'' for the Br$_{2}$ C ($^{1}Π_{u}$ $1_{u}$) state by various measurement methods differ widely across the literature (30 to 340 fs). We consider this issue by investigating attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at the Br M4,5 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges (66 to 80 eV), tracking core-to-valence (3d to 4p) and core-to-Rydberg (3d to ns, np, n $\geq$ 5) transitions from the molecular to atomic limit. The progress of dissociation can be ascertained by the buildup of the atomic absorption in time. Notably, the measured rise times of the 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ to 4p transitions depend on the probed core level final state, 38 $\pm$ 1 and 20 $\pm$ 5 fs for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ at 64.31 and 65.34 eV, respectively. Simulations by the nuclear time-dependent Schrödinger equation reproduce the rise-time difference of the 3d to 4p transitions, and the theory suggests several important factors. One is the transition dipole moments of each probe transition have different molecular and atomic values for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ versus $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ that depend on the bond length. The other is the merger of multiple molecular absorptions into the same atomic absorption, creating multiple timescales even for a single probe transition. Unfortunately, the core-to-Rydberg absorptions did not allow accurate atomic Br buildup times to be extracted due to spectral overlaps with ground state bleaching, otherwise an even more comprehensive picture of the role of the probe state transition would be possible. This work shows that the measured probe signals accurately contain the dissociative wavepacket dynamics but also reveal how the specific probe transition affects the apparent progress toward dissociation with bond length. Such potential probe-transition-dependent effects need to be considered when interpreting measured signals and their timescales.

Motivation: Gas sensing is essential for monitoring environmental regulations and industrial safety. Adaptable materials like GaPS4 hold potential for conformal integration.

Method: The paper investigates GaPS4's layered structure and mechanical properties, tests its sensitivity, and evaluates its flexibility.

Result: GaPS4-based sensor shows excellent sensitivity for NO2, conforms well to curved surfaces, and maintains electrical stability.

Conclusion: GaPS4 enables new applications for plastic inorganic semiconductors in gas sensing with conformal integration potential.

Abstract: This paper reports the first gas sensor based on the plastic inorganic semiconductor GaPS4, pioneering the application of plastic inorganic semiconductors in the field of gas sensing. Unlike traditional rigid sensors, this device leverages the unique layered structure and ultra-wide bandgap of GaPS4 to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting NO2. The intrinsic plastic deformability of the material enables it to conform tightly to complex curved pipelines like an "electronic bandage," completely eliminating monitoring blind spots. Nanoindentation tests reveal that its extremely low hardness (0.20 GPa) confers exceptional flexibility while maintaining stable electrical characteristics even under bent states. The device exhibits a linear response to NO2 concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 ppm at room temperature. Although the limited defects in the single-crystal material result in pA-level response currents, defect engineering offers a viable pathway for performance enhancement. This study breaks through the conventional boundaries of plastic inorganic semiconductors confined to photoelectric and thermoelectric applications, opening new avenues for their use in gas sensing and advancing gas monitoring technology toward "conformal integration."

Abstract: This study is due to various applications in physics, chemistry and especially in biology, where both bounded configuration domain and chemical anisotropy could play a great part. In fact we generalize the well-known Berg theory, which describes diffusion-controlled reactions occurring within a spherically symmetric absorber-cavity system. The trapping probability and the reaction rate at which a small diffusing particle is captured by an axially symmetric one reactive patch absorber inside a spherical cavity were found semi-analytically and numerically by means of the dual series relations method. This approach leads to such incredibly fast convergence, that it may rightly be referred to as exact one. The results obtained can be used to test numerical programmes that describe diffusion-controlled reactions in real physical systems for reactants with arbitrary anisotropic reactivity, which are located inside of various cavities as well as in the unbounded domains. Moreover, we managed to find a close connection between the dual series relations method and the generalized method of separation of variables.

Abstract: We present an efficient relativistic implementation of the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) theory up to third order, incorporating Cholesky decomposition (CD) and frozen natural spinor (FNS) techniques to address electronic ionization, attachment, and excitation problems in heavy-element systems. The exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian has been employed to balance accuracy with computational efficiency, and a state-specific frozen natural spinor (SS-FNS) extension has been developed to improve excited-state descriptions. The present implementation accurately reproduces canonical four-component third-order ADC results while significantly lowering computational demands. The efficiency and performance of the present implementation are demonstrated through calculations on larger systems, with the largest system successfully treated comprising more than 2600 basis functions.

Conclusion: 该研究为 cuprate 材料中的双层系统色动力学提供了一个全面的分析框架，预期将推动进一步实验和理论研究。

Abstract: Recently plasmon excitations in bilayer lattice systems were studied extensively in the weak-coupling regime. Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $ω_{\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $ω_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this.

Abstract: Hund's coupling plays a decisive role in shaping electron correlations of multi-orbital systems, giving rise to a class of materials--Hund's metals--that combine local-moment physics with metallic transport. Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The recent development of bootstrap methods based on semidefinite relaxations of positivity constraints has enabled rigorous two-sided bounds on local observables directly in the thermodynamic limit. However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We performed field-angle-resolved magnetostriction and thermal-expansion measurements on PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$, a cubic non-Kramers compound exhibiting antiferroquadrupolar order below $T_{\rm Q}=0.125$ K. Thermal expansion exhibits two qualitatively different anomalies under magnetic fields applied along the $[001]$ direction, providing experimental support for the existence of an intermediate A phase previously reported. Furthermore, comparison between the experimental results and theoretical modeling indicates a strong anisotropic coupling of the $O_{20}$ quadrupolar moment, which plays a key role in stabilizing the A phase. These findings demonstrate that multipolar states in non-Kramers systems can be effectively tuned by magnetic-field orientation, providing insights into the anisotropic nature of quadrupolar interactions.

Abstract: We study relaxation spectra of a quadratic spinless--fermion helical chain with an Aubry--Andre--type quasiperiodic potential and a single N--th neighbor (helical) hopping. Dissipation and pumping are introduced via local linear Lindblad jump operators and treated exactly using the third--quantization / Majorana covariance formalism. Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization. Our results highlight Liouvillian rapidities as compact, experimentally relevant diagnostics of relaxation and sensitivity in engineered open quantum lattices.

TL;DR: Graphene and related materials may be enhanced towards a Kekulé Valence Bond Solid phase through controls of e-ph coupling or Hubbard repulsion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphene's unique electronic properties make it a focal point for research, necessitating understanding of factors influencing its phase transitions.

Method: Sign-problem-free DQMC of the oSSH-Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice, analyzing phase diagrams with finite-size scaling.

Result: The phase diagram includes semi-metal, KVBS, and AFM phases. e-ph coupling and Hubbard repulsion promote KVBS over AFM.

Conclusion: By tuning e-ph coupling or Hubbard repulsion, graphene can be steered towards KVBS, enhancing its properties.

Abstract: The precise role of e-ph coupling in graphene and related materials on a honeycomb lattice is not yet fully understood, despite extensive research on these systems. Here, we perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (oSSH)-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, focusing on the parameters relevant to graphene. Performing finite-size scaling analyzes, we obtain the model's ground state phase diagram, which includes the semi-metal (SM), Kekulé Valence Bond Solid (KVBS), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phases, as well as indications of a small KVBS/AFM coexistence region. We find that a weak to moderate Hubbard repulsion, tuned toward the SM-AFM critical value in the pure honeycomb Hubbard model, enhances KVBS correlations and can even stabilize the KVBS phase. Estimating the effective parameters for graphene places it in the SM region of the phase diagram, but near the SM-KVBS phase boundary. Notably, we predict that increasing either the on-site Hubbard repulsion or the e-ph coupling strength drives graphene toward the KVBS phase rather than the AFM phase, highlighting a synergistic effect that can be exploited to further control the remarkable properties of graphene and related materials.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the thermalization of optically excited charge carriers through their coupling to magnetic excitations in the Kondo lattice model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how optically excited charge carriers relax and thermalize through magnetic excitations is essential for explaining ultrafast dynamics in solid-state systems.

Method: The study employs the real-time dynamics of the Kondo lattice model using the time-dependent Lanczos method, analyzing spin polarization, spin-spin correlations, and electronic momentum distribution.

Result: Thermalization occurs in the model when either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet state. Simulations are cross-validated with finite-temperature methods and spectral gap ratio analysis.

Conclusion: The established mechanism enhances our understanding of how optically excited charge carriers relaxation and thermalization pathways manifest in one-dimensional Kondo lattice systems.

Abstract: A generic question in the field of ultrafast dynamics is concerned with the relaxation dynamics and the subsequent thermalization of optically excited charge carriers. Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector. Our real-time simulations using the time-dependent Lanczos method are corroborated by a direct comparison with finite-temperature expectation values and an analysis of the spectrum in terms of the gap ratio.

Abstract: High magnetic fields provide a direct route to probe the anisotropies that govern spin dynamics in layered magnets. Using the SU(3) bond operator framework for spin 1 systems, we derive analytic expressions for the magnon spectrum and the critical fields delimiting the field induced ordered phase. We show that the upper critical field $h_{c2}$ carries a simple and quantitative fingerprint of both exchange anisotropy and single ion symmetry breaking, enabling high field experiments to serve as sensitive probes of microscopic anisotropy. We further map how these anisotropies, together with interlayer coupling, control the extent and location of the magnon Bose Einstein condensation dome. Our results provide experimentally accessible criteria for identifying symmetry breaking mechanisms in real spin 1 materials.

Abstract: Motivated by the search for unconventional orders in frustrated quantum magnets, we present a multi-method investigation into the nature of the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice with three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor interactions. It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.

Abstract: We review the theoretical modelling of moiré materials, focusing on various aspects of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MA-TBG) viewed through the lens of Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moiré bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized "chiral-flat" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moiré superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ansätze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first "case study". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications. Used either as a standalone reference or alongside the accompanying open-source code, this review should enable readers with a basic knowledge of band theory and many-body physics to systematically build and analyze detailed models of generic moiré systems.

Abstract: We report on high-resolution laser spectroscopy of $^{255}$Fm ($T_{1/2} = 20$h), one of the heaviest nuclides available from reactor breeding. The hyperfine structures in two different atomic ground-state transitions at 398.4~nm and 398.2~nm were probed by in-source laser spectroscopy at the RISIKO mass separator in Mainz, using the PI-LIST high-resolution ion source. Experimental results were combined with hyperfine fields from various atomic ab-initio calculations, in particular using MultiConfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory, as implemented in GRASP18. In this manner, the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments were derived to be $μ= -0.75(5)~ μ_\textrm{N}$ and $Q_\textrm{S} = +5.84(13)$~eb, respectively.
  The magnetic moment indicates occupation of the $ν$~7/2[613] Nilsson orbital, while the large quadrupole moment confirms strong, stable prolate deformation consistent with systematics in the heavy actinides. Comparisons with available expectation values from nuclear theory show good agreement, providing a stringent benchmark for the used theoretical models.
  These results revise earlier data and establish $^{255}$Fm as a reference isotope for future high-resolution studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the fundamental physics of polarization-dependent interference patterns and probe the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.

Method: The study employs an attosecond streaking camera technique, combining XUV attopulses and IR femtopulses, and uses numerical simulations to analyze the interference patterns.

Result: The results show that a loss of contrast in the interference fringes occurs predominantly along the polarization axis of the IR field and is sensitive to its waveform. This confirms the wave-particle duality.

Conclusion: The proposed streak camera provides a new tool to probe time-resolved quantum interference and supports the idea of which-way information in wave-particle duality.

Abstract: Attosecond streaking camera is an ex situ technique in which a linearly polarized (LP) XUV attopulse produces an electron wavepacket by photoionization in the presence of an IR femtopulse. By moving the two synchronous oppositely circularly polarized XUV pulses (that make the ionizing LP pulse) apart in time, we propose an attosecond double-slit streak camera scheme to see information loss in polarization-dependent two-slit phenomena. Such streaking interferogram is then composed of several Feynman's thought experiments in time domain, in which electrons are affected by the IR pulse as they exit the two attoslits upon XUV ionization processes to form Archimedean spiral patterns. As a proof-of-principle, when the IR femtofield and first XUV attopulse are synchronous, a loss of contrast through dephasing is seen in the simulated momentum and energy distributions of the photoelectron. It is shown that the contrast between bright and dark interference fringes diminishes predominantly along the IR-field polarization axis and is sensitive to the IR-field waveform. Our which-time information scheme provides further confirmation of the wave-particle duality.

Abstract: Nucleation and wetting transitions are studied in a three-component Bose-Einstein condensate mixture within Gross-Pitaevskii theory. For special cases of intermediate segregation between components 1 and 2, the nucleation phase transition of a surfactant film of component 3 is obtained by exact solution. Additional exact results for the nucleation transition are derived in the limit of strong segregation between components 1 and 2. In this limit the exact first-order wetting phase boundary is obtained using analytical and numerical methods, and is contrasted with the exact nucleation and wetting phase boundary derived previously for a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate mixture at a hard optical wall. Exact results for the three-component mixture are compared with results from the double-parabola approximation used in an earlier work.

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting bosons in a two-leg ring ladder pierced by an artificial magnetic flux, where the particles are initially localized in the central sites of both rings, and the ac-driven local energy shifts are applied to the remaining lattice sites. Within the mean-field approximation, we demonstrate the emergence of nonlinear self-trapping for strong interparticle interactions, and characterize the distinct excitation regimes in the absence of the inter-ring tunneling. The artificial magnetic flux typically introduces Peierls phase factors, which induces complex-valued hopping amplitudes and leads to directed net particle currents along the chains. By further incorporating the finite inter-ring coupling and biased intra-ring hopping, we reveal that the tuning of the drive frequency and Peierls phase allows the precise control over both the intensity and direction of particle currents, which facilitates the transition between chiral and antichiral dynamics. These findings offer insights into the coherent manipulation of matter-wave transports in closed-loop lattice configurations and the exploration of nonequilibrium synthetic quantum systems in related fields.
