Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A chaotic system is called ultra-chaos when its statistics have sensitivity
dependence on initial condition and/or other small disturbances. In this paper,
using two-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow as an example, we illustrate
that tiny variation of initial condition of Navier-Stokes equations can lead to
huge differences not only in spatiotemporal trajectory but also in flow
symmetry and its statistics. Here, in order to avoid the influence of
artificial numerical noise, we apply ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS) which
can guarantee that the numerical noise can be reduced to such a desired low
level that they are negligible in a time interval long enough for calculating
statistics. This discovery highly suggests that the Navier-Stokes turbulence
(i.e. turbulence governed by the Navier-Stokes equations) might be an
ultra-chaos, say, small disturbances must be considered even from viewpoint of
statistics. This however leads to a paradox in logic, since small disturbances,
which are unavoidable in practice, are unfortunately neglected by the
Navier-Stokes turbulence. Some fundamental characteristics of turbulence model
are discussed and suggested in general meanings.

### [2] [Interpretation of measured 3x3 partial depolarizing Mueller matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06305)
*Jose J. Gil,Ignacio San Jose,Monica Canabal-Carbia,Juan Campos,Angel Lizana,Irene Estevez*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A method to reconstruct incomplete 3x3 Mueller matrices into complete 4x4 matrices for polarimetric imaging and materials characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation of instrumental constraints in Mueller polarimetry often leads to incomplete data, requiring a systematic solution to ensure physically consistent results.

Method: The method uses covariance matrix formalism to select the completion with maximal polarimetric purity, ensuring the least random (most deterministic) model compatible with measurements.

Result: The procedure is general, reliable, and provides a physically grounded reconstruction tool for polarimetric imaging and materials analysis.

Conclusion: This approach addresses a significant limitation in Mueller polarimetry, offering a robust solution for dealing with incomplete data.

Abstract: Mueller polarimetry is a powerful technique with broad applications in
astronomy, remote sensing, advanced material analysis, and biomedical imaging.
However, instrumental constraints frequently restrict the measurement to an
incomplete Mueller matrix limited to its upper-left 3x3 submatrix. Simply
padding the missing entries with zeros to form a 4x4 matrix can produce
physically inconsistent results, even for nondepolarizing systems. To address
this issue, we present a systematic procedure to complete 3x3 measured Mueller
matrices into physically consistent 4x4 matrices. The method relies on the
covariance matrix formalism and selects, among the infinitely many admissible
completions, the one with maximal polarimetric purity. This criterion ensures
that the synthesized matrix corresponds to the least random (most
deterministic) model compatible with the measurement. The procedure is fully
general and can be applied to any 3x3 partial Mueller polarimetric data,
providing a reliable and physically grounded reconstruction tool for
polarimetric imaging and materials characterization.

Motivation: 随着空间探索任务的增加，光学元件的高精度和重量限制成为了瓶颈。为了满足空间中的微重力环境中的复杂化要求，开发新型光学制造技术变得至关重要。

Abstract: In-space manufacturing technologies are vital for enabling advanced space
missions and addressing logistical limitations of space exploration. While
additive manufacturing has progressed rapidly, it still falls short of
delivering the ultra-smooth surfaces required for optical elements. Fluidic
Shaping is a novel method that harnesses surface tension under microgravity to
form optical components with exceptionally smooth surfaces. This study
demonstrates the feasibility and potential of Fluidic Shaping as a method for
manufacturing optical components in space through two experiments performed
aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Ax-1 mission. The first
experiment involved fabricating centimeter-scale polymer lenses, solidifying
them via ultraviolet (UV) curing, and analyzing the resultant optics upon their
return to Earth. While sub-nanometric surface smoothness was achieved, some
polymer lenses displayed unexpected thermo-chemical deformations, indicating
complex polymerization dynamics unique to the microgravity environment. In the
second experiment, a large-scale, 172 mm diameter water lens was deployed,
confirming Fluidic Shaping's scalability and demonstrating basic optical
functionality through image analysis. These experiments collectively underline
the technique's relevance for both small-scale optics and large-aperture
applications. Our results highlight critical considerations for future
research, including optimizing polymerization processes and refining
liquid-handling methods to advance practical, in-space optical manufacturing
capabilities.

### [4] [A laser with instability reaching $4 \times 10^{-17}$ based on a 10-cm-long silicon cavity at sub-5-K temperatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06636)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确 metrology 和基础科学方面的研究得以广泛开展，优化超稳激光器的长期性是关键。

Method: 首次采用动态冷却平静测量法 ✔️ 并开发 cryostat 振动噪声抑制方法 ✔️。

Conclusion: 成功设定期限 ✔️，为未来研究提供了原型系统 ✔️。

Abstract: The realization of ultra-stable lasers with $10^{-17}$-level frequency
stability has enabled a wide range of researches on precision metrology and
fundamental science, where cryogenic single-crystalline cavities constitute the
heart of such ultra-stable lasers. For further improvements in stability,
increasing the cavity length at few-kelvin temperatures provides a promising
alternative to utilizing relatively short cavities with novel coating, but has
yet to be demonstrated with state-of-the-art stability. Here we report on the
realization of a relatively long ultra-stable silicon cavity with a length of
10 cm and sub-5-K operating temperatures. We devise a dynamical protocol of
cool-quiet quench measurement that reveals the inherent $10^{-17}$-level
frequency instability of the silicon cavity despite the substantially larger
frequency noise induced by the cryostat vibration. We further develop a method
for suppressing the cryostat-vibration-induced frequency noise under continuous
cooling, and observe an average frequency instability of $4.3(2) \times
10^{-17}$ for averaging times of 4 to 12 seconds. Using the measured noise
power spectral density, we compute a median linewidth of 9.6(3) mHz for the
silicon cavity laser at 1397 nm, which is supported by an empirically
determined linewidth of 5.7(3) mHz based on direct optical beat measurements.
These results establish a new record for optical cavities within a closed-cycle
cryocooler at sub-5-K temperatures and provide a prototypical system for using
long cryogenic cavities to enhance frequency stabilities to the low-$10^{-17}$
or better level.

Conclusion: 该方法为通过饮料瓶直接检测乙醇含量提供了一种实用且可靠的技术，有助于消费者保护和饮料供应链的自动化筛查。

Abstract: Food and beverage contamination poses a persistent global threat. A prime
example is the presence of methanol in counterfeit or illicit spirits, causing
severe and often fatal poisoning worldwide. Rapid, non-destructive, and on-site
screening methods capable of molecular analysis directly through commercial
packaging are therefore urgently needed for quality control and consumer
safety. Here, we introduce a non-invasive optical approach based on Raman
spectroscopy that judiciously combines wavefront shaping with wavelength
modulation to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and enable quantification of
methanol in unopened bottled spirits. A limit of detection of 0.2% (v/v)
methanol in 40% ethanol was achieved, well below the 2% (v/v) threshold for
safe human consumption. This truly non-invasive method remains robust through
coloured glass bottles, with calibration validated in a real spirit sample. By
enabling through-container methanol detection, the technique offers a practical
tool to protect consumers and streamline routine screening across the beverage
supply chain. Moreover, this Raman geometry establishes a versatile platform
for assessing authenticity, composition, and contaminants directly through
packaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Build a low-cost, reliable optical spectrometer for instructional and practical uses.

Method: Constructed from a webcam, diffraction grating (DVD), and Python./calibrated using a RED TIDE fiber optic spectrometer.

Result: High-precision measurements similar to industry standards. Captured live data for real-time analysis.

Conclusion: Simple, cost-effective, and effective for teaching and practical applications.

Abstract: The paper demonstrates the design and execution of a low-cost optical
spectrometer that employs a webcam, diffraction grating & Python (a free,
open-source programming language). The device's design prioritized economy and
usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase
measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split
light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the
camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic
Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which
ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the
former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light
sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs,
as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high
level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer
measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which
allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition,
the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live
spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its
simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for
instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in
cost-constrained situations.

Conclusion: 光的极化特性对临界耦合性能至关重要，未来研究应保留非轴对称谐波的全极化信息，以更全面地理解光-结构相互作用。

Abstract: Critical coupling has emerged as a prominent area of research in recent
years. However, most theoretical models are based on scalar theories (and
occasionally coupled mode theories), which inadequately account for the
polarization states of the incident light. To bridge this gap, we revisit the
concept of critical coupling in planar multilayer structures using a full
vectorial theory, where conventional plane wave illumination is replaced by
well-defined vector beams with and without orbital angular momentum (OAM). Our
investigation explores the possibility of complete absorption of monochromatic
beams without and with intrinsic OAM (such as Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian
(LG)), incident on the multilayer structure at normal or oblique incidence. A
two-component metal-dielectric composite film is chosen as the absorbing layer
in the system. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in the
intensities of the reflected and transmitted beams at normal incidence, with
reduced efficiency for oblique incidence due to the lack of spatial overlap of
multiply reflected components. Interestingly, we also observe super-scattering
from the same structures when conditions for constructive interference of the
various reflected components are satisfied. This work highlights the need to
incorporate the vector nature of beams by retaining the complete polarization
information of off-axis spatial harmonics in future studies.

### [8] [Versatile 3D reconstruction framework for hard X-ray grazing incidence imaging of nanostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06877)
*Luke Besley,P. S. Jørgensen,A. Diaz,C. Detlefs,S. De Angelis,M. Carlsen,B. Chang,C. Silvestre,J. W. Andreasen*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper presents a new ptychographic reconstruction framework for coherent imaging that addresses limitations in conventional methods by incorporating multislice wave propagation for grazing incidence, enabling better reconstruction of complex nanostructures with multiple scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the accuracy of ptychographic imaging techniques, particularly for grazing incidence, by addressing the limitations of conventional methods that rely on single-scattering models.

Method: The framework replaces the single-scattering model with a multislice wave-propagation formalism tailored for grazing incidence. It supports simultaneous phase retrieval and reconstruction, and can handle multiple incidence angles, rotation angles, and experimental geometries in a single inversion process.

Result: The reconstruction framework shows potential for initializing reconstructions from random guesses without strong structural priors. The framework has been tested with both experimental and simulated datasets, demonstrating its versatility.

Conclusion: This advancement could significantly enhance the capabilities of ptychography in imaging nanostructures with high sensitivity and complexity, especially under grazing incidence conditions.

Abstract: Coherent imaging techniques such as ptychography offer powerful capabilities
for 3D resolution of nanoscale structures. By application in grazing incidence,
such techniques may achieve exceptional surface sensitivity as demonstrated by
grazing incidence small angle scattering. This requires however an extension of
the conventional analysis based on the Distorted Wave Born Approximation which
is typically limited to stratified-layer models and statistical descriptions of
in-plane structures. The prevailing implementations of reconstruction
algorithms for ptychography based on the projection approximation fails to
capture the significant multiple scattering that occurs in grazing incidence.
We present a ptychographic reconstruction framework that replaces the
single-scattering model with a multislice wave-propagation formalism tailored
to grazing incidence. The framework supports simultaneous phase retrieval and
reconstruction, and can incorporate multiple incidence angles, multiple
rotation angles, and flexible experimental geometries into a single inversion.
Reconstructions can be initialized from a random guess without strong
structural priors, enabling the recovery of complex surface and near-surface
nanostructures. This reconstruction framework is applied to both experimental
and simulated datasets, demonstrating its versatility.

Abstract: Controlling the polarization state of light with sub-picosecond speed and
subwavelength precision remains a key challenge for next-generation
nanophotonic devices. Conventional methods such as birefringent crystals,
liquid crystals, or electro-optic Pockels cells are limited in speed,
compactness, and energy efficiency. While structured materials and
two-dimensional heterostructures offer potential for on-chip ultrafast
performance, achieving all-optical control remains an open problem. Here we
introduce an all-optical scheme that employs femtosecond pumping of low-index,
subwavelength isotropic films to achieve ultrafast control over birefringence,
dichroism, and optical activity within a single material platform. When the
material is probed near its crossover wavelength, linearly polarized pumping
induces a transient phase retardation up to 0.1{\pi} per micrometer,
accompanied by a dichroic absorption ratio of approximately twenty. Under
circularly polarized excitation, the probe experiences nonreciprocal optical
activity, leading to polarization rotation of about 1.1 degrees per micrometer.
A universal hydrodynamic model quantitatively reproduces these effects and
attributes them to pump-induced symmetry breaking in the photoexcited carrier
plasma. This symmetry breaking enables coupling between orthogonal probe
polarization components, mediated by a modified time-dependent damping term,
which connects to the inverse Faraday effect induced by a circularly polarized
pump. Our combined experimental and theoretical study establishes a
reconfigurable, deep-subwavelength polarization-control mechanism operating on
sub-picosecond timescales, suitable for compact ultrafast modulators, dynamic
metasurfaces, and tunable nonreciprocal photonic devices, with implications for
quantum optics, ultrafast logic, and time-resolved sensing.

Abstract: The growing interest in exciton-polaritons has driven the need to manipulate
their motion and engineer their band structures to the forefront of
contemporary research. This study explores the band structures that emerge from
a spatially modulated potential, ingeniously realized through the use of an
optical conveyor belt. By leveraging Bloch theory and conducting a meticulous
analysis of the time evolution of polariton intensity in Fourier space, we have
derived the energy dispersion relations both analytically and numerically
within the context of a static lattice model. For time-dependent potentials, we
employ the Lagrange variational method to elucidate the dynamics of polariton
motion. Our results reveal that polaritons exhibit linear dispersion and follow
linear trajectories with minor oscillations superimposed. This investigation
not only deepens our fundamental understanding of exciton-polaritons but also
provides a robust tool for advancing photonic devices and exerting precise
control over current transport in quantum computing. Our findings pave the way
for future innovations in high-speed and high-performance technologies.

Abstract: We explore rogue wave formation in multimode silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$)
waveguides with multimode nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation-based simulations.
Pure fundamental-mode excitation produces smooth propagation without extreme
events, whereas higher-order modes or multimode superpositions yield
heavy-tailed statistics with bursts exceeding the $8\sigma$ threshold. These
results reveal that rogue wave generation in integrated waveguides is
controlled not only by material properties such as nonlinearity and dispersion
but also by modal excitation and intermodal nonlinear interactions. Our results
identify modal control as a new degree of freedom for engineering extreme
spatiotemporal events on photonic chips, with implications for on-chip
supercontinuum generation, frequency combs, and nonlinear wave management.

Motivation: the paper demonstrates the development and optimization of a liquid-core dye laser, which has potential applications in laser tagging, medical ablation, and flow cytometry. advancements in dye laser technology could lead to more efficient and compact laser systems for miniaturized and integrated optical systems.

Method: rhodamine B was dissolved in glycerol and injected into FEP tubing, which served as the waveguide. photoluminescence and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) studies were used to determine optimal rhodamine B concentrations for low-threshold laser operation. mode confinement and spectral characteristics were analyzed with 1/16 inch and 1/32 inch inner diameter tubing. cavity mirrors were added to improve emission coherence and assess laser mode characteristics.

### [15] [Advanced mirror shapes for mode enhancement in plano-concave cavities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07251)
*William James Hughes,Peter Horak*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Plano-concave cavities can be enhanced via shaped mirrors to improve emitter-cavity interaction performance while maintaining their practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on modifying plano-concave cavities to enhance interaction between emitters and the cavity, particularly for sensitive systems like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms.

Method: Numerical simulations were used to evaluate the effect of mirror shaping on the coupling strength between the cavity and the central emitter.

Result: Simple mirror shaping significantly improves the interaction strength, even in systems sensitive to mirror alignment.

Conclusion: Shaped mirrors in plano-concave cavities offer a practical solution to improve interaction strength without compromising the cavity's inherent benefits.

Abstract: Optical cavities are frequently used in quantum technologies to enhance light
matter interactions, with applications including single photon generation and
entanglement of distant emitters. The Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator is a popular
choice for its high optical access and large emitter-mirror separation. A
typical configuration, particularly for emitters that should not be placed
close to the mirror surface like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms, features two
spherical mirrors placed around a central emitter, but this arrangement can put
demanding requirements on the mirror alignment. In contrast, plano-concave
cavities are tolerant to mirror misalignment and only require the manufacture
of one curved mirror, but have limited ability to focus light in the centre of
the cavity. Here we show how mirror shaping can overcome this limitation of
plano-concave cavities while preserving the key advantages. We demonstrate
through numerical simulations that simple mirror shaping can increase coupling
between a plano-concave cavity and a central emitter by an order of magnitude,
even rivalling misalignment-sensitive concave-concave counterparts for
achievable interaction strength. We use these observations to establish the
conditions under which plano-concave cavities with shaped mirrors could improve
the performance and practicality of emitter-cavity systems.

Abstract: The spectral properties, momentum dispersion, and broadening of bulk
plasmonic excitations of 25 elemental metals are studied from first principles
calculations in the random-phase approximation. Spectral band structures are
constructed from the resulting momentum- and frequency-dependent inverse
dielectric function. We develop an effective analytical representation of the
main collective excitations in the dielectric response, by extending our
earlier model based on multipole-Pad\'e approximants (MPA) to incorporate both
momentum and frequency dependence. With this tool, we identify plasmonic
quasiparticle dispersions exhibiting complex features, including non-parabolic
energy and intensity dispersions, discontinuities due to anisotropy, and
overlapping effects that lead to band crossings and anti-crossings. We also
find good agreement between computed results and available experiments in the
optical limit. The results for elemental metals establish a reference point
that can guide both fundamental studies and practical applications in
plasmonics and spectroscopy.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过引入磁性势，磁性角型器在传输特性上具有更大的调制空间，为波滤波和成像应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent work by Lawrie et al. [PRR 7, 023209 (2025)] introduced a
non-diffracting resonant angular filter on a network of thin channels (modelled
via quantum graph theory) that exhibits unit transmission of acoustic waves at
a discrete, symmetry-paired set of incidence angles determined solely by the
graph topology, while transmission at all other angles is strictly forbidden.
In the present work, we study the same filtering geometry for waves governed by
the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation rather than the classical wave equation.
Using a phase shift induced by non-reciprocal wave propagation due to the
presence of the magnetic potential and tuning $\delta$-type vertex boundary
conditions, we make the previously topology-fixed discrete pass directions
continuously tunable: both the transmission angle and the transmission
coefficient become control parameters. The resulting flux-tunable angular
filtering device replaces topology-constrained passbands with a programmable
steering device, broadening the scope for wave-filter and beam-shaping
applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of fast neutron irradiation and
post-radiation electro-thermal annealing on the electrical performance of
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky barrier diodes. Devices irradiated with 1 MeV
neutrons at a high fluence of 1E15 n/cm^2 exhibited substantial degradation,
including a drastic reduction in on-current and an increase in on-resistance.
Electrothermal testing, conducted through simultaneous current-voltage (J-V)
measurements and thermal annealing, resulted in significant recovery. After
four cycles of electro-thermal testing, the devices demonstrated significant
improvements in performance, with a substantial recovery of on-current and a
reduction in on-resistance compared to the post-radiation condition,
approaching pre-radiation levels. Most recovery occurred during the first two
cycles, with diminishing improvements in later cycles, indicating that most
thermally recoverable traps were mitigated early. Capacitance-voltage (C-V)
measurements revealed a substantial reduction in carrier concentration,
decreasing from 3.2E16 cm^-3 pre-radiation to 5.5E15 cm^-3 after the first
electro-thermal testing cycle, indicating an over 82% reduction. Following the
third cycle, the carrier concentration partially recovered to 9.9E15 cm^-3,
reflecting a carrier removal rate of ~22 cm^-1. The breakdown voltage exhibited
a remarkable enhancement, increasing from approximately 300 V to 1.28 kV (a
~325% improvement) after the first electro-thermal testing, attributed to the
reduction in carrier concentration by compensating radiation-induced traps.
Subsequent testing reduced breakdown voltage slightly to 940 V due to partial
recovery of carrier concentration, but it remained significantly higher than
pre-radiation levels, highlighting the promise of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ power
devices for high-power applications in radiation-intense environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reprogrammable mechanical metamaterials, composed of a lattice of discretely
adaptive elements, are emerging as a promising platform for mechanical
intelligence. To operate in unknown environments, such structures must go
beyond passive responsiveness and embody traits of mechanical intelligence:
sensing, computing, adaptation, and memory. However, current approaches fall
short, as computation of the required adaptation in response to changes in
environmental stimuli must be pre-computed ahead of operation. Here we present
a physical learning approach that harnesses the structure's mechanics to
perform computation and drive adaptation. The desired global deformation
response of nonlinear metamaterials with adaptive stiffness is physically
encoded as local strain targets across internal adaptive elements. The
structure adapts by iteratively interacting with the environment and updating
its stiffness distribution using a model-free algorithm. The resulting system
demonstrates autonomous real-time adaptation (~seconds) to previously unknown
loading conditions without pre-computation. Physical learning inherently
accounts for manufacturing imperfections and is robust to sensor noise and
structural damage. We also demonstrate scalability to complex metamaterial
structures and different metamaterial architectures. By uniting sensing,
computation, and actuation in a mechanical framework, this work makes key
strides towards embodying the traits of mechanical intelligence into adaptive
structures. We expect our approach to open pathways towards in-situ adaptation
to unknown environment for applications in hypersonic flight, adaptive
robotics, and exploration in extreme environments.

### [20] [Low and high frequency noise in LEDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06833)
*Danylo Bohomolov,Vita Ivanova,Ulrich T. Schwarz*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines LED degradation linked to active region defects via noise analysis, presenting a model with components: 1/f-type, generation-recombination, and white noise. They model 1/f^gamma noise as a superposition of generation-recombination noise at various defect lifetimes and find three current-dependent noise components with a developed temperature model for low frequencies. However, the model doesn't fully align with high-frequency results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LED reliability through noise analysis is crucial for improving product lifespan and performance, especially in applications where long-term stability is essential.

Method: The authors conduct optical noise measurements across a broad frequency spectrum (kHz to MHz) using blue LEDs. They decompose the noise spectra using a theoretical model comprising three noise types: 1/f-type, generation-recombination, and white noise. For the 1/f^gamma noise, they model it as a combination of generation-recombination noise originating from defects with a wide range of relaxation lifetimes. The experimental results are compared to this model, and they identify three noise components that vary with current. Additionally, they develop a temperature-dependent model for low-frequency noise and validate it in part by comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions across different temperatures. High-frequency measurements, however, show discrepancies from the expected Lorentzian behavior.

Result: The study successfully correlates noise characteristics with LED degradation, identifying three significant noise components influenced by current and providing a detailed model for the temperature dependence of low-frequency noise. While the model fits low-frequency and low-current data well, it falls short at higher frequencies, indicating the need for further refinement to capture the full noise spectrum behavior.

Conclusion: This comprehensive noise analysis offers valuable insights into LED material quality assessment, particularly focusing on defects and their impact on LED degradation across different operating frequencies and temperatures. The model provides a foundation for predicting LED reliability under various conditions but may require adjustments to better match high-frequency noise behavior.

Abstract: LED degradation is usually associated with defects in the active region.
Whereby the noise analysis can be a strong instrument to reveal them. The
results of optical noise measurements for commercially available blue LED
samples in a wide frequency range from kHz to MHz are reported. Noise spectra
were decomposed into components according to the presented theoretical model
which includes 1/f-type noise, generation-recombination noise, and white noise.
The 1/f$^\gamma$-type noise was modeled as a superposition of
generation-recombination noise components at defects with a continuous wide
distribution of relaxation lifetimes. The coincidence of the experimental
results with 1/f$^\gamma$ model for the low frequency range is proved and a
fitting is made. We identified three noise components that are highly
current-dependent. The corresponding model of temperature dependence for the
low-frequency range was developed. At low currents, the model partially matched
the experimental results in the temperature range from 100 K to 300 K at low
frequencies. However, high-frequency measurements showed deviations from the
expected Lorentzian behavior.

Conclusion: 本研究通过稀疏单元阵列和CNN相结合的方法，解决了管道缺陷高精度定位和成像的挑战，具有较高的应用价值。

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in ultrasonic guided wave (UGW) technology
for pipe signal processing and defect imaging recently. However, developing a
defect localization and imaging algorithm that requires fewer parameters,
offers a wide imaging range, and achieves high positioning accuracy remains a
considerable challenge. Traditional direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation
methods primarily focus on the single-angle estimation with low resolution,
failing to satisfy the spatial localization requirements for pipeline defects.
Therefore, a high-resolution spatial spectrum estimation algorithm is
introduced to realize the two-dimensional DOA estimation. By distributing
multiple sensors in a specific geometric configuration to form an array, this
method employs the array signal processing technology to accurately obtain the
DOA of spatial signals. A uniform circular array (UCA) is employed in the
present study to receive signals from pipe defects, and high-precision
localization and imaging of defects are achieved based on the two-dimensional
minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming algorithm, with a
relative positioning error of less than 1%. An image classification method
based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) is further developed to
distinguish the defect types. By constructing a novel CNN model to extract
defect features and perform classification, this model achieves a prediction
accuracy of 97.50%, which effectively distinguishes between defect types.

TL;DR: Highly precise measurement of microwave transition frequencies for Lu+ is reported with applicability to quantum metrology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise measurement of atomic transitions is crucial for fundamental constants, metrology, and quantum lexicons.

Method: Microwave spectroscopy analysis is coupled with hyperfine transitions to calculate quadrupole moments.

Result: Quadrupole moment of Lu+ is measured as -2.48e-4 e a0^2.

Conclusion: This advancement enhances atomic clocks' precision and metrology accuracy.

Abstract: We report precision measurement of the unperturbed ${^{3}}D_1$ microwave
transition frequencies in $^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$ to a fractional uncertainty of
$4\times10^{-14}$. We find the $|F,m_F\rangle=|8,0\rangle$ to $|7,0\rangle$
hyperfine transition frequency to be $10\,491\,519\,945.228\,82(38)\,$Hz and
the $|7,0\rangle$ to $|6,0\rangle$ transition frequency to be
$11\,290\,004\,289.881\,61(36)\,$ Hz. At this precision we are able to observe
the hyperfine-mediated effects in the ratio of the quadrupole shifts, from
which we can directly infer the residual quadrupole moment after $^3D_1$
hyperfine averaging. We find a residual quadrupole moment of
${-2.48(23)\times10^{-4}}\,e a_0^2$, consistent with a previous assessment
using a different and less direct method. With the unperturbed microwave
frequencies accurately known, the residual quadrupole shift for a
$^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$ ($^3D_1$) optical frequency standard can henceforth be
readily evaluated to $<10^{-20}$ uncertainty by routine ${^{3}}{D}_1$ microwave
spectroscopy.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper studies the information entropies (entropic moments, Renyi, and Tsallis) for the quantum Darboux III oscillator, a nonlinear system with position-dependent mass. Analytical expressions for entropic quantities in position space are derived, while numerical calculations are used for Fourier transforms. The interplay between entropy parameter α and nonlinearity parameter λ is analyzed, recovering known results for limits α→1 and λ→0. The paper also provides approximations for probability densities in momentum space for large λ and excited states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding information measures for nonlinear systems is crucial for quantum information theory and has implications in various fields like condensed matter physics and quantum optics.

Method: The authors derived analytical expressions in position space and performed numerical Fourier transforms. They analyzed the relationship between α and λ by recovering known results for specific limits and provided approximations for momentum space probabilities.

Result: The study reveals how entropy measures depend on both α and λ, with significant non-linear effects observed in high λ and excited states. The approximations for momentum space probabilities help explain these effects.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive analysis of information entropies for the Darboux III oscillator, advancing our understanding of nonlinear quantum systems and their information-theoretic properties.

Abstract: The Darboux III oscillator is an exactly solvable $N$-dimensional nonlinear
oscillator defined on a radially symmetric space with non-constant negative
curvature. Its one-dimensional version can be seen as a position dependent mass
system whose mass function $\mu = (1 + \lambda x^2)$ depends on the
nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$, such that in the limit $\lambda \to 0$ the
harmonic oscillator is recovered. In this paper, a detailed study of the
entropic moments and of the R\'enyi and Tsallis information entropies for the
quantum version of the one-dimensional Darboux III oscillator is presented. In
particular, analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities in
position space are obtained. Since the Fourier transform of the Darboux III
wave functions does not admit a closed form expression, a numerical analysis of
these quantities has been performed. Throughout the paper the interplay between
the entropy parameter $\alpha$ and the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$ is
analysed, and known results for the Shannon entropy of the Darboux III and for
the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies of the harmonic oscillator are recovered in
the limits $\alpha \to 1$ and $\lambda \to 0$, respectively. Finally, motivated
by the strong non-linear effects arising when large values of $\lambda$ and/or
highly excited states are considered, an approximation to the probability
density function valid in those regimes is presented. From it, an analytical
approximation to the probability density in momentum space can be obtained, and
some of the previously observed effects arising from the interplay between
$\alpha$ and $\lambda$ can be explained.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the
speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform
matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a
Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to
maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations
can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes
$\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix
addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer
scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for
both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm
to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators,
analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our
Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula
and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian
singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation,
where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the
constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire
unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares
Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging
the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In
particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted
Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further
improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve
this with $1$ ancilla qubit.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of distributed quantum machine learning across clients with heterogeneous quantum resources.

Method: Proposes Quorus, a layerwise loss function and model designs optimized for shot budget, qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space.

Result: Simulations and real-hardware results show 12.4% improvement in testing accuracy over the state-of-the-art and increased gradients for higher-depth clients.

Conclusion: Quorus presents a scalable and adaptable solution for quantum federated learning across diverse quantum clients.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically
intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private
clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning
(QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access
to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them
to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL
problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training
of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for
high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents
various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget,
qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and
real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of
gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on
average over the state-of-the-art.

*Thomas Iadecola*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Hilbert-space fragmentation in quantum many-body systems with kinetically constrained dynamics arises when the Hilbert space splits into exponentially many disconnected sectors. Symmetries, particularly charge conservation with charge conjugation and translation symmetries, play a crucial role in this fragmentation. The non-Abelian algebra of these symmetries leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded in degenerate eigenstate pairs, which are highly entangled. This structure provides necessary conditions for experimental signatures such as late-time density imbalance persistence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum many-body systems is crucial for understanding complex quantum phenomena. Hilbert-space fragmentation is a phenomenon that can lead to exotic states of matter and has implications for quantum computing and simulation. Understanding how symmetries influence this phenomenon is essential for both fundamental science and potential applications.

Method: The authors analyze a model of charge-conserving systems with charge conjugation and translation symmetries. They study the algebraic structure of the symmetries and the projectors onto the fragmented subsectors. By examining this algebra, they derive conditions for the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded in degenerate eigenstate pairs. They also use these conditions to predict experimental signatures such as the persistence of density imbalances at late times.

Result: The authors demonstrate that the non-Abelian algebra of the symmetries and projectors leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits. These qubits are encoded in degenerate pairs of eigenstates, which are highly entangled. This result provides a framework for experimental verification of Hilbert-space fragmentation, such as observing the persistence of density imbalances at late times.

Conclusion: The study reveals that Hilbert-space fragmentation in quantum many-body systems with symmetries can give rise to exponentially many logical qubits with significant entanglement. The underlying algebraic structure offers a pathway for both theoretical analysis and experimental detection of such phenomena.

Abstract: In quantum many-body systems with kinetically constrained dynamics, the
Hilbert space can split into exponentially many disconnected subsectors, a

non-Abelian algebra of these symmetries and the projectors onto the fragmented
subsectors leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded
in degenerate pairs of eigenstates, which can be highly entangled. This algebra
also provides necessary conditions for experimental signatures of Hilbert-space
fragmentation, such as the persistence of density imbalances at late times.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for quantum time transfer based on
commuting families of Hamiltonians and synchronization observables. The
synchronization subspace is defined as the kernel of a difference operator
between local clocks, and we show that this subspace is preserved exactly by a
commutative $*$-subalgebra of Hamiltonians compatible with the clocks. Our
first main result establishes \emph{perturbative stability}: for
$\epsilon$-compatible dynamics, where the commutator with the synchronization
operator is bounded in norm by $\epsilon$, we prove quantitative drift bounds
showing that timing correlations degrade at most linearly in time with slope
proportional to $\epsilon$. Our second main result provides a
\emph{representation-theoretic classification}: in the presence of a finite
group symmetry, the synchronization subspace coincides with the diagonal
isotypic component in the tensor product decomposition, and synchronization
preservation is characterized by the commutant algebra of the group action.
These results identify synchronization as a structural invariant of operator
algebras, connecting approximate commutation, kernel-preserving dynamics, and
symmetry protection. Beyond quantum time transfer, the framework suggests
categorical and resource-theoretic generalizations and contributes to the
broader study of operator-algebraic invariants in multipartite quantum
dynamics.

alleviated by inference-based decoders. To date, such machine-learning (ML)
decoders lack two key properties crucial for practical fault tolerance:
reliable uncertainty quantification and robust generalization to previously
unseen codes. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{QuBA}, a Bayesian graph
neural decoder that integrates attention to both dot-product and multi-head,
enabling expressive error-pattern recognition alongside calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Building on QuBA, we further develop \textbf{SAGU
}\textbf{(Sequential Aggregate Generalization under Uncertainty)}, a multi-code
training framework with enhanced cross-domain robustness enabling decoding
beyond the training set. Experiments on bivariate bicycle (BB) codes and their
coprime variants demonstrate that (i) both QuBA and SAGU consistently
outperform the classical baseline belief propagation (BP), achieving a
reduction of on average \emph{one order of magnitude} in logical error rate
(LER), and up to \emph{two orders of magnitude} under confident-decision bounds
on the coprime BB code $[[154, 6, 16]]$; (ii) QuBA also surpasses
state-of-the-art neural decoders, providing an advantage of roughly \emph{one
order of magnitude} (e.g., for the larger BB code $[[756, 16, \leq34]]$) even
when considering conservative (safe) decision bounds; (iii) SAGU achieves
decoding performance comparable to or even outperforming QuBA's domain-specific
training approach.

### [30] [Asymptotic Vanishing of the Success Probability in Shor's Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06271)
*João P. da Cruz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Shor's factoring algorithm's success probability guarantee for any modulus N = pq diminishes asymptotically as N increases. The probability of successful quantum states diminishes as 1/phi(N), leading to a loss of ergodicity in the algorithm's behavior. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate this trend, showing no stationary success probability in large-N scenarios. This implies that while Shor's algorithm is efficient for small N, its scalability is fundamentally limited for large N in quantum computing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper delves into the foundational aspects of Shor's algorithm, exploring its behavior as N grows large, which is crucial for understanding the scalability and practical limitations of quantum computing.

Method: The study employs rigorous mathematical analysis, leveraging concepts from number theory and asymptotic probability, combined with numerical Monte Carlo simulations to model and validate theoretical findings.

Result: The critical finding is that the success probability of Shor's algorithm diminishes asymptotically as 1/phi(N), suggesting that the expected polynomial-time performance is locally valid but not globally consistent. This has profound implications for the practical implementation of Shor's algorithm for large prime numbers.

Conclusion: The research conclusively demonstrates that Shor's algorithm's success probability decreases without bound as N increases, underscoring a fundamental limitation of quantum factoring for large numbers. This conclusion is supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical simulation results.

Abstract: Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one
half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that
this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -> infinity, the
multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability
spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases,
proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble
of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an
asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N <= 10^6 confirm
this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results
demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only
locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain
expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical
absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental
limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.

Abstract: Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum
technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon
emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths,
molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor
their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the
characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are
challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and
computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by
integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model
system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach
identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter.
Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines
hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular

Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a variety of boson sampling overcoming the
stable single-photon preparation difficulty of the later. However, like those
in the original version, noises in GBS will also result in the deviation of
output patterns and the reduction of classical simulation complexity. We extend
the pattern recognition validation, together with the correlation approach as a
comparison, on GBS using photon number resolving detectors with noises of both
photon loss and distinguishability, to quantificationally evaluate noise
levels. As for the classical simulation with noises to be used during
validations, it is actually a simulation of mixed states where we employ an
existing photon-pair strategy to realize polynomial speedup locally.
Furthermore, we use an output-binning strategy to realize validation speedup.
Our simulation indicates that the pattern recognition protocol is robust on
noise evaluations of GBS even when noises are sufficiently low.

Abstract: Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will
realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for
large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key
distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum
communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical
devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable
performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they
appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a
general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD
with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of
trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work
is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and
passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and
wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels.
Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under
varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical
protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the
wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing
that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can
outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate
that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is
essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between
rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.

Abstract: A bottleneck for analyzing the interplay between magic and entanglement is
the computation of these quantities in highly entangled quantum many-body magic
states. Efficient extraction of entanglement can also inform our understanding
of dynamical quantum processes such as measurement-induced phase transition and
approximate unitary designs. We develop an efficient classical algorithm to
compute the von Neumann entropy and entanglement spectrum for such states under
the condition that they have low stabilizer nullity. The algorithm exploits the
property of stabilizer codes to separate entanglement into two pieces: one
generated by the common stabilizer group and the other from the logical state.
The low-nullity constraint ensures both pieces can be computed efficiently. Our
algorithm can be applied to study the entanglement in sparsely $T$-doped
circuits with possible Pauli measurements as well as certain classes of states
that have both high entanglement and magic. Combining with stabilizer learning
subroutines, it also enables the efficient learning of von Neumann entropies
for low-nullity states prepared on quantum devices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Classical hardness-of-sampling results are largely established for random
quantum circuits, whereas analog simulators natively realize time evolutions
under geometrically local Hamiltonians. Does a typical such Hamiltonian already
yield classically-intractable dynamics? We answer this question in the
affirmative for the ensemble of geometrically-2-local Hamiltonians with
Gaussian coefficients, evolved for constant time. This naturally leads to a
quantum advantage scheme with clear prospects for experimental realization,
necessitating only course-grained control.
  We give strong evidence of hardness for this physically-relevant ensemble. We
develop the first worst-to-average-case reduction for approximating output
probabilities of (time-independent) geometrically-2-local Hamiltonian
evolutions. Our reduction proceeds by nonstandard means: while we also leverage
polynomial interpolation, unlike previous works, we reduce directly to an
evaluator for the exact distribution over Hamiltonians, from which we are
trying to prove that sampling is hard. Previous works instead sampled from
various perturbations of the true distribution, introducing additional
constraints meant to keep the perturbation, measured in total variation
distance, under control. We dispense with this step.
  Our reduction consists in a robust multivariate polynomial interpolation,
reduced to sequential robust univariate interpolations via the symmetries of
the Gaussian. We circumvent the fact that random Hamiltonians lack a hiding
symmetry, a key property in previous proofs. We also contribute an algorithmic
version of Berlekamp-Welch to deal with errored evaluations, solving an open
problem from the RCS literature. We expect the machinery we develop to find use
in average-case Hamiltonian complexity, filling in a gap in this literature
which has thus far focussed on worst-case hardness results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entanglement distribution between distant qubits is a key challenge for scalable quantum computing and networks, and this paper presents an innovative solution to this problem.

Method: The method involves using a Josephson parametric converter to produce a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated superconducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. The study also demonstrates the use of superconducting qubits to directly certify two-mode squeezing with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction.

Result: The results show that this fully autonomous process allows for the generation of entanglement between two remote qubits without the need for active control or measurement and postselection. Additionally, the method enables the certification of two-mode squeezing with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These findings establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.

Conclusion: This research opens up new possibilities for scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing and communication by providing a robust, autonomous method for generating and distributing entanglement across distant qubits.

Abstract: The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge
for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum
networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or
probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and
postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process,
where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a
quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson
parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state
of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated
superconducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled
state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting
qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher
sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These
results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed
continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both

Abstract: We discuss how blind quantum computing generalizes to multi-level quantum
systems (qudits), which offers advantages compared to the qubit approach. Here,
a quantum computing task is delegated to an untrusted server while
simultaneously preventing the server from retrieving information about the
computation it performs, the input, and the output, enabling secure cloud-based
quantum computing. In the standard approach with qubits, measurement-based
quantum computing is used: single-qubit measurements on cluster or brickwork
states implement the computation, while random rotations of the resource qubits
hide the computation from the server. We generalize finite-sized approximately
universal gate sets to prime-power-dimensional qudits and show that qudit
versions of the cluster and brickwork states enable a similar server-blind
execution of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we compare the overheads of
different resource state architectures and discuss which hiding strategies
apply to alternative qudit resource states beyond graph states.

Abstract: We present a framework for preparing quantum states from matrix product
states (MPS) with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices. The
MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into
native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions
(pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits
and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the
success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori.
The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we
prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics
under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time
evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on
quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited
states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a
scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient
simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.

Abstract: While quantum computing can accomplish tasks that are classically
intractable, the presence of noise may destroy this advantage in the absence of
fault tolerance. In this work, we present a classical algorithm that runs in
$n^{\rm{polylog}(n)}$ time for simulating quantum circuits under local
depolarizing noise, thereby ruling out their quantum advantage in these
settings. Our algorithm leverages a property called approximate Markovianity to
sequentially sample from the measurement outcome distribution of noisy
circuits. We establish approximate Markovianity in a broad range of circuits:
(1) we prove that it holds for any circuit when the noise rate exceeds a
constant threshold, and (2) we provide strong analytical and numerical evidence
that it holds for random quantum circuits subject to any constant noise rate.
These regimes include previously known classically simulable cases as well as
new ones, such as shallow random circuits without anticoncentration, where
prior algorithms fail. Taken together, our results significantly extend the
boundary of classical simulability and suggest that noise generically enforces
approximate Markovianity and classical simulability, thereby highlighting the
limitation of noisy quantum circuits in demonstrating quantum advantage.

Abstract: We study the classical simulability of noisy random quantum circuits under
general noise models. While various classical algorithms for simulating noisy
random circuits have been proposed, many of them rely on the anticoncentration
property, which can fail when the circuit depth is small or under realistic
noise models. We propose a new approach based on the exponential decay of
conditional mutual information (CMI), a measure of tripartite correlations. We
prove that exponential CMI decay enables a classical algorithm to sample from
noisy random circuits -- in polynomial time for one dimension and
quasi-polynomial time for higher dimensions -- even when anticoncentration
breaks down. To this end, we show that exponential CMI decay makes the circuit
depth effectively shallow, and it enables efficient classical simulation for
sampling. We further provide extensive numerical evidence that exponential CMI
decay is a universal feature of noisy random circuits across a wide range of
noise models. Our results establish CMI decay, rather than anticoncentration,
as the fundamental criterion for classical simulability, and delineate the
boundary of quantum advantage in noisy devices.

Abstract: We (re)evaluate recent claims of quantum advantage in annealing- and
gate-based algorithms, testing whether reported speedups survive rigorous
end-to-end runtime definitions and comparison against strong
classicalbaselines. Conventional analyses often omit substantial overhead
(readout, transpilation, thermalization, etc.) yielding biased assessments.
While excluding seemingly not important parts of the simulation may seem
reasonable, on most current quantum hardware a clean separation between "pure
compute" and "overhead" cannot be experimentally justified. This may distort
"supremacy" results. In contrast, for most classical hardware total time
$\approx$ compute $+$ a weakly varying constant leading to robust claims.
  We scrutinize two important milestones: (1) quantum annealing for approximate
QUBO [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.160601],
which uses a sensible time-to-$\epsilon$ metric but proxies runtime by the
annealing time (non-measurable); (2) a restricted Simon's problem
[https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021082] , whose
advantageous scaling in oracle calls is undisputed; yet, as we demonstrate,
estimated runtime of the quantum experiment is $\sim 100 \times$ slower than a
tuned classical baseline. Finally, we show that recently claimed "runtime
advantage" of the BF-DCQO hybrid algorithm (arXiv:2505.08663) does not
withstand rigorous benchmarking. Therefore, we conclude that runtime-based
supremacy remains elusive on NISQ hardware, and credible claims require a
careful time accounting with a proper reference selections, and an adequate
metric.

Abstract: Given two families of quantum states $A$ and $B$, called the null and the
alternative hypotheses, quantum hypothesis testing is the task of determining
whether an unknown quantum state belongs to $A$ or $B$. Mistaking $A$ for $B$
is a type I error, and vice versa for the type II error. In quantum Shannon
theory, a fundamental role is played by the Stein exponent, i.e. the asymptotic
rate of decay of the type II error probability for a given threshold on the
type I error probability. Stein exponents have been thoroughly investigated --
and, sometimes, calculated. However, most currently available solutions apply
to settings where the hypotheses simple (i.e. composed of a single state), or
else the families $A$ and $B$ need to satisfy stringent constraints that
exclude physically important sets of states, such as separable states or
stabiliser states. In this work, we establish a general formula for the Stein
exponent where both hypotheses are allowed to be composite: the alternative
hypothesis $B$ is assumed to be either composite i.i.d. or arbitrarily varying,
with components taken from a known base set, while the null hypothesis $A$ is
fully general, and required to satisfy only weak compatibility assumptions that
are met in most physically relevant cases -- for instance, by the sets of
separable or stabiliser states. Our result extends and subsumes the findings of
[BBH, CMP 385:55, 2021] (that we also simplify), as well as the 'generalised
quantum Sanov theorem' of [LBR, arXiv:2408.07067]. The proof relies on a
careful quantum-to-classical reduction via measurements, followed by an
application of the results on classical Stein exponents obtained in [Lami,

Conclusion: 随机几何局部量子回路浅层经典模拟性在所有常数噪声下成立, 未来研究是否能降低到常数深度

Abstract: It has been known for almost 30 years that quantum circuits with interspersed
depolarizing noise converge to the uniform distribution at $\omega(\log n)$
depth, where $n$ is the number of qubits, making them classically simulable. We
show that under the realistic constraint of geometric locality, this bound is
loose: these circuits become classically simulable at even shallower depths.
Unlike prior work in this regime, we consider sampling from worst-case circuits
and noise of any constant strength. First, we prove that the output
distribution of any noisy geometrically local quantum circuit can be
approximately sampled from in quasipolynomial time, when its depth exceeds a
fixed $\Theta(\log n)$ critical threshold which depends on the noise strength.
This scaling in $n$ was previously only obtained for noisy random quantum
circuits (Aharonov et. al, STOC 2023). We further conjecture that our bound is
still loose and that a $\Theta(1)$-depth threshold suffices for simulability
due to a percolation effect. To support this, we provide analytical evidence
together with a candidate efficient algorithm. Our results rely on new
information-theoretic properties of the output states of noisy shallow quantum
circuits, which may be of broad interest. On a fundamental level, we
demonstrate that unitary quantum processes in constant dimensions are more
fragile to noise than previously understood.

Abstract: Estimating extensive combinations of local parameters in distributed quantum
systems is a central problem in quantum sensing, with applications ranging from
magnetometry to timekeeping. While optimal strategies are known for sensing
non-interacting Hamiltonians in quantum sensor networks, fundamental limits in
the presence of uncontrolled interactions remain unclear. Here, we establish
optimal bounds and protocols for estimating a linear combination of local
parameters of Hamiltonians with arbitrary, unknown interactions. In the
process, we more generally establish bounds for learning any linear combination
of Hamiltonian coefficients for arbitrary, commuting terms. Our results unify
and extend existing bounds for non-interacting qubits and multimode
interferometers, providing a general framework for distributed sensing and
Hamiltonian learning in realistic many-body systems.

TL;DR: We introduce an autonomous charging paradigm for quantum batteries that do not require external control, relying solely on coherent dynamics and environmental interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and practical quantum batteries that can operate in noisy environments.

Method: We demonstrate an autonomous charging mechanism using an ensemble of identical two-level systems coupled to a thermal environment. The common bath mediates interference between emission and absorption pathways, enabling the system to achieve non-zero extractable work without coherent drives.

Result: The charging dynamics and steady-state expressions are derived, showing favorable scaling with the number of cells. The mechanism is robust to local noise, even when the collective and local dissipation rates are comparable.

Conclusion: This work establishes a scalable, noise-tolerant approach for quantum batteries, demonstrating their feasibility for circuit- and cavity-QED platforms, with potential applications in quantum computing technologies.

Abstract: Quantum hardware increasingly relies on energy reserves that can later be
converted into useful work; yet, most battery-like proposals demand coherent
drives or engineered non-equilibrium resources, limiting practicality in noisy
settings. We develop an autonomous charging paradigm in which an ensemble of
identical two-level units, collectively coupled to a thermal environment,
acquires work capacity without any external control. The common bath mediates
interference between emission and absorption pathways, steering the many-body
state away from passivity and into a steady regime with nonzero extractable
work. The full charging dynamics and closed-form expressions are obtained for
the steady-state, showing favorable scaling with the number of cells that
approach the many-body optimum. We show that the mechanism is robust to local
noise: under a convex mixture of collective and local dissipation, non-zero
steady-state ergotropy persists, exhibits counterintuitive finite-temperature
optima, and remains operative when the collective channel is comparable to or
stronger than the local one. We show that environmental fluctuations can be
harnessed to realize drive-free, scalable quantum batteries compatible with
circuit- and cavity-QED platforms. Used as local work buffers, such batteries
could potentially enable rapid ancilla reset, bias dissipative stabilizer
pumps, and reduce syndrome-extraction overhead in fault-tolerant quantum
computing.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的出现，虽然它可以解决某些经典计算机很难处理的问题，但由于制造完整的量子计算机仍面临巨大挑战，而现有设备又高度不稳，因此研究受噪声影响的量子算法及其与经典算法的区分变得尤为重要。

Method: 该论文采用傅里叶增长的水平方法研究量子算法的特性。他们构建了一个新矩阵分解引理，并使用此引理分析了不同噪声模型（如DQC_1和1/2 BQP）中量子算法的傅里叶增长，得出了相关下限。

Conclusion: 该研究对理解受噪声影响的量子算法能力以及区分不同量子计算模型具有重要意义，可能推动更高效、更鲁棒的量子计算方法的发展。

Abstract: Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet
fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are
inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the
landscape between $\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$. We build on a powerful
technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the
level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients
of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate
quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise
acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately
linked to the type of noise.
  Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed
states are prevalent, namely: $\mathsf{DQC}_k$ algorithms, where $k$ qubits are
clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf {BQP}$
algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is
given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We
establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of $\mathsf{DQC}_k$,
$\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BQP}$ algorithms and leverage the
differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these
models. In particular, we show that 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation require
$N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the $\mathsf{DQC}_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$
models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition
lemma that might be of independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum phase transitions and their critical behavior is fundamental for advancing quantum physics and applications in quantum computing.

Method: The authors use a variational family of operator algebras, generalized tensor product structures, parameter-dependent Hamiltonians, and a quantum scrambling functional. They minimize this functional to induce a metric and identify singularities characterizing phase transitions.

Result: The framework successfully identifies quantum phase transitions and their critical points, as demonstrated by analytical and numerical examples.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel geometric approach to quantum phase transitions, offering a promising tool for future studies in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We introduce the novel concept of mereological quantum phase transition
(m-QPTs). Our framework is based on a variational family of operator algebras
defining generalized tensor product structures (g-TPS), a parameter-dependent
Hamiltonian, and a quantum scrambling functional. By minimizing the scrambling
functional, one selects a g-TPS, enabling a pullback of the natural
information-geometric metric on the g-TPS manifold to the parameter space. The
singularities of this induced metric -- so-called algebra susceptibility -- in
the thermodynamic limit characterize the m-QPTs. We illustrate this framework
through analytical examples involving quantum coherence and operator
entanglement. Moreover, spin-chains numerical simulations show susceptibility
sharp responses at an integrability point and strong growth across
disorder-induced localization, suggesting critical reorganizations of emergent
subsystem structure aligned with those transitions.

Abstract: We study the existence and limitations for hyperinvariant tensor networks
incorporating a local SU(2) symmetry. As discrete implementations of the anti
de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have
created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum
gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection
to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum
gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be
interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity.
We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in
certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from
first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP
06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but
also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that
exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic
codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation
values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a
consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.

Abstract: We express the probabilistic character associated to the wave function by
treating it as a stochastic variable. This is accomplished by means of a
stochastic equation for the wave function whose noise changes the phase of the
wave function but not its absolute value, so that the norm of the wave function
is strictly conserved along a stochastic trajectory. We show that the density
matrix that obeys the quantum Liouville equation is the covariance matrix
associated to the stochastic wave function.

Abstract: Qudits offer significant advantages over qubit-based architectures, including
more efficient gate compilation, reduced resource requirements, improved
error-correction primitives, and enhanced capabilities for quantum
communication and cryptography. Yet, one of the most promising family of
quantum error correction codes, namely quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes, have been so far mostly restricted to qubits. Here, we generalize recent
advancements in LDPC codes from qubits to qudits. We introduce a general
framework for finding qudit LDPC codes and apply our formalism to several
promising types of LDPC codes. We generalize bivariate bicycle codes, including
their coprime variant; hypergraph product codes, including the recently
proposed La-cross codes; subsystem hypergraph product (SHYPS) codes;
high-dimensional expander codes, which make use of Ramanujan complexes; and
fiber bundle codes. Using the qudit generalization formalism, we then
numerically search for and decode several novel qudit codes compatible with
near-term hardware. Our results highlight the potential of qudit LDPC codes as
a versatile and hardware-compatible pathway toward scalable quantum error
correction.

*Colin Vendromin,Samuel E. Fontaine,J. E. Sipe*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A model for non-Gaussian state generation via SPDC in InGaP microring resonators is developed. The system Hamiltonian includes a phantom channel for scattering loss, and initial quantization issues are resolved using a non-Gaussian but asymptotic Hamiltonian. The model allows for the generation of non-Gaussian Wigner function negativity but shows that non-Gaussian features might be masked by excessive squeezing, requiring inverse Gaussian operations in low-loss scenarios to enhance non-Gaussian characteristics. The scope of on-chip non-Gaussian generation opens promising future possibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper contributes to the field of quantum optics and non-Gaussian state generation, particularly in integrated photonic devices. The investigation of SPDC in microring resonators under pump depletion is relevant for advancing quantum applications such as quantum computing and metrology.

Method: The researchers employed a modeling approach using a Hamiltonian framework, incorporating a phantom channel to account for scattering losses. They derived the system's full state by applying Gaussian and non-Gaussian unitary transformations and analyzed the results using Wigner functions.

Result: The model predicts that non-Gaussian states can be generated in SPDC processes, characterized by negativity in the Wigner function. However, excessive squeezing is required for their detectability, and in low-loss scenarios, inverse Gaussian transformations are necessary to reveal intrinsic non-Gaussianity.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational framework for analyzing pump-depleted SPDC in integrated lossy systems, suggesting scalable on-chip non-Gaussian sources for subsequent applications.

Abstract: We develop a model for non-Gaussian state generation via spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in InGaP microring resonators. The nonlinear
Hamiltonian is written in terms of the asymptotic fields for the system, which
includes a phantom channel to handle scattering loss. The full ket for the
system is written as a Gaussian unitary acting on a residual non-Gaussian ket,
which is vacuum initially and evolves according to a non-Gaussian Hamiltonian.
We show that for realistic parameters we can access the pump depletion regime,
where the Wigner function for the residual non-Gaussian ket has negativity. But
we find that the non-Gaussian features for the full ket could be unobservable
due to the large amount of squeezing required to lead to pump depletion. We
show that a potential solution in the low-loss regime is to implement an
inverse Gaussian unitary on the accessible modes to remove most of the
squeezing and reveal the non-Gaussian features. This work provides a foundation
for modeling pump-depleted SPDC in integrated lossy microring resonators,
opening a path toward a scalable on-chip non-Gaussian source.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove several new results concerning the pure quantum polynomial hierarchy
(pureQPH). First, we show that QMA(2) is contained in pureQSigma2, that is, two
unentangled existential provers can be simulated by competing existential and
universal provers. We further prove that pureQSigma2 is contained in QSigma3,
which in turn is contained in NEXP.
  Second, we give an error reduction result for pureQPH, and, as a consequence,
prove that pureQPH = QPH. A key ingredient in this result is an improved
dimension-independent disentangler.
  Finally, we initiate the study of quantified Hamiltonian complexity, the
quantum analogue of quantified Boolean formulae. We prove that the quantified
pure sparse Hamiltonian problem is pureQSigma-complete. By contrast, other
natural variants (pure/local, mixed/local, and mixed/sparse) admit nontrivial
containments but fail to be complete under known techniques. For example, we
show that the exists-forall mixed local Hamiltonian problem lies in NP^QMA \cap
coNP^QMA.

Motivation: 随着量子位数的增加，高效可靠的量子错误纠正是至关重要的。MLD虽然最优，但计算成本高，因此寻找更高效的近似方法具有重要意义。

Method: 该方法通过系统地修改解码图并找到这些图中的K个MWM来实现，还可以在X和Z错误相关的情况下通过研究子图中的MWM来近似MLD。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何在保持较高性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度，为实际量子计算机中的高效错误纠正提供了可行方法。

Abstract: The minimum weight matching (MWM) and maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) are
two widely used and distinct decoding strategies for quantum error correction.
For a given syndrome, the MWM decoder finds the most probable physical error
corresponding to the MWM of the decoding graph, whereas MLD aims to find the
most probable logical error. Although MLD is the optimal error correction
strategy, it is typically more computationally expensive compared to the MWM
decoder. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that approximates MLD with $K$
MWMs from the decoding graph. Taking the surface code subject to graphlike
errors as an example, we show that it is possible to efficiently find the first
$K$ MWMs by systematically modifying the original decoding graph followed by
finding the MWMs of the modified graphs. For the case where the $X$ and $Z$
errors are correlated, despite the MWM of the decoding hypergraph cannot be
found efficiently, we present a heuristic approach to approximate the MLD by
finding the $K$ MWMs in the $X$ and $Z$ subgraphs. We benchmark the efficacy of
our algorithm for the surface code subject to graphlike errors, the
surface-square Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and surface-hexagonal GKP
code subject to the Gaussian random displacement errors, showing that the
fidelity approaches that of the exact MLD (for the first two cases) or the
tensor-network decoder (for the last case) as $K$ increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing advances enable quick prototyping of quantum NLP, but devices are limited in qubits and depth, and classical attention is heavy on resources. This drives the need for efficient quantum solutions like compact token mixers.

Method:  Laboratoires CLAQS introduces a compact, fully quantum token mixer using complex-valued mixing and nonlinear transformations. It employs l1 normalization for stable optimization and a two-stage architecture to decouple shared embeddings from feed-forward modules. Using a sliding window with document-level aggregation, it achieves efficient performance with limited qubits and shallow circuits.

Result: CL'AQS achieves 91.64% accuracy on SST-2 and 87.08% on IMDB, outperforming classical Transformer baselines and hybrid quantum-classical counterparts.

Conclusion: This work advances quantum NLP by providing an efficient token mixer architecture that enhances both performance and scalability, paving the way for practical quantum advantages in NLP tasks.

Abstract: Quantum compute is scaling fast, from cloud QPUs to high throughput GPU
simulators, making it timely to prototype quantum NLP beyond toy tasks.
However, devices remain qubit limited and depth limited, training can be
unstable, and classical attention is compute and memory heavy. This motivates
compact, phase aware quantum token mixers that stabilize amplitudes and scale
to long sequences. We present CLAQS, a compact, fully quantum token mixer for
text classification that jointly learns complex-valued mixing and nonlinear
transformations within a unified quantum circuit. To enable stable end-to-end
optimization, we apply l1 normalization to regulate amplitude scaling and
introduce a two-stage parameterized quantum architecture that decouples shared
token embeddings from a window-level quantum feed-forward module. Operating
under a sliding-window regime with document-level aggregation, CLAQS requires
only eight data qubits and shallow circuits, yet achieves 91.64% accuracy on
SST-2 and 87.08% on IMDB, outperforming both classical Transformer baselines
and strong hybrid quantum-classical counterparts.

Abstract: Filtering is commonly used in quantum optics to reject noise photons, and
also to enable interference between independent photons. However, filtering the
joint spectrum of photon pairs can reduce the inherent coincidence probability
or loss-independent heralding efficiency. Here, we investigate filtering for
multiphoton applications based on entanglement and interference (e.g., quantum
teleportation). We multiplex C-band entangled photons and C-band classical
communications into the same long-distance fibers, which enables scalable
low-loss quantum networking but requires filtering of spontaneous Raman
scattering noise from classical light. Using tunable-bandwidth filters,
low-jitter detectors, and polarization filters, we co-propagate
time-bin-entangled photons at wavelengths compatible with erbium-ion quantum
memories (1536.5 nm) and 10-Gbps C-band classical data over 25 km/25 km of
standard fiber. Narrow filtering enables mW-level C-band power, which exceeds
comparable studies by roughly an order of magnitude and could feasibly support
Tbps classical rates. We evaluate how performance depends on pump and filter
bandwidths, multipair emission, filter shapes, loss, phase matching, and how
quantum information is measured. We find a trade-off between improving noise
impact and single-mode purity and discuss mitigation methods toward optimal
multiphoton applications. Importantly, these results apply to noise in free
space and in quantum devices (sources, frequency converters, switches,
detectors, etc.) and provide insight on filter-induced degradation of
single-photon purity and rates even in noise-free environments.

Abstract: Recent research on excitonic insulator has progressed mainly based on narrow
bandgap semiconductor or semimetal. Herein, we realize excitonic insulator
based on two-dimensional (2D) wide band gap diamond with transition temperature
as high as 220K. The resistance rises dramatically by more than three orders,
which can be explained by the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons.
While cooling down below transition temperature, the wavelength of the bound
excitons caused by boron and nitrogen centers becomes highly overlapped,
leading to BEC process. Furthermore, the variable range hopping mechanism is
used to simulate the resistance as a function of temperature, which reveals the
formation of excitonic insulator. When temperature drops down further, a sudden
drop of resistance over three orders was observed around 60K, possibly due to
the formation of non-equilibrium excitonic superfluid resulting from highly
overlap of wavelength of the large density bound excitons at lower temperature.
This study provides evidences for excitonic insulator and possible superfluid
phase based on wide bandgap semiconductor.

Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) defines a duality that pairs decoding
problems with optimization problems. The original work on DQI considered
Reed-Solomon decoding, whose dual optimization problem, called Optimal
Polynomial Intersection (OPI), is a polynomial regression problem over a finite
field. Here, we consider a class of algebraic geometry codes called Hermitian
codes, which achieve block length $q^3$ using alphabet $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$
compared to Reed-Solomon's limitation to block length $q$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$,
requiring approximately one-third fewer qubits per field element for quantum
implementations. We show that the dual optimization problem, which we call
Hermitian Optimal Polynomial Intersection (HOPI), is a polynomial regression
problem over a Hermitian curve, and because the dual to a Hermitian code is
another Hermitian code, the HOPI problem can also be viewed as approximate list
recovery for Hermitian codes. By comparing to Prange's algorithm, simulated
annealing, and algebraic list recovery algorithms, we find a large parameter
regime in which DQI efficiently achieves a better approximation than these
classical algorithms, suggesting that the apparent quantum speedup offered by
DQI extends beyond Reed-Solomon codes to a broader class of polynomial

Abstract: We apply the combined technique of postselected amplification and
photon-recycling to an optical setup of magnetic field precision measurement.
We propose two recycling schemes and carry out analytic expressions for the
amplified signal and measurement sensitivity. The results show significant
improvement of performance over conventional measurement. The underlying reason
is twofold. On one aspect, introducing the technique of recycling eliminates
the shortcoming of data discarding in postselection, thus maintains similar
noise level of conventional measurement (without postselection). On the other
aspect, performing intentional postselection within the recycling framework,
which was originally proposed in the context of gravitational wave detection,
can amplify the signal. Thus, the measurement signal-to-noise ratio is
enhanced.

Abstract: We investigate layer codes, a family of three-dimensional stabilizer codes
that can achieve optimal scaling of code parameters and a polynomial energy
barrier, as candidates for self-correcting quantum memories. First, we
introduce two decoding algorithms for layer codes with provable guarantees for
local stochastic and adversarial noise, respectively. We then prove that layer
codes constitute partially self-correcting quantum memories which outperform
previously analyzed models such as the cubic code and the welded solid code.
Notably, we argue that partial self-correction without the requirement of
efficient decoding is more common than expected, as it arises solely from a
diverging energy barrier. This draws a sharp distinction between partially
self-correcting systems and partially self-correcting memories. Another novel
aspect of our work is an analysis of layer codes constructed from random
Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes. We show that these random layer codes have
optimal scaling (up to logarithmic corrections) of code parameters and a
polynomial energy barrier. Finally, we present numerical studies of their
memory times and report behavior consistent with partial self-correction.

Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of symmetries in Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms to prepare the ground or specific low-lying states
of quantum Hamiltonians. We examine two spin problems, one with random
all-to-all couplings inspired by neutrino flavor evolution in supernovae, and
the standard Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian on a $4 \times 3$ lattice. The
neutrino Hamiltonian has the total spin $J$ and third component $J_{\rm{z}}$ as
its only symmetries. The Heisenberg model has these symmetries plus
translational invariance and reflection symmetry.
  We demonstrate that the convergence of variational methods is dramatically
improved by keeping all symmetries. In both cases a nearly exact solution can
be obtained in cases where standard unconstrained variational algorithms fail.
Since variational algorithms can use standard Trotter steps as part of the
optimization, allowing additional correlations that obey all the symmetries of
the Hamiltonian will speed convergence of variational algorithms. This will
lead to faster convergence than standard projection algorithms.

Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate holonomies using the Quantum Zeno effect,
enabling logical unitary operations on quantum stabilizer codes purely through
measurements. The quantum error-correcting code space is adiabatically rotated
by measuring a succession of rotated stabilizer generators. When the rotation
is sufficiently slow, the state remains confined to the instantaneous code
space by the Zeno effect; otherwise, measurement-induced jumps can occur into a
rotated orthogonal subspace. If the rotation completes a closed loop, the code
state is transformed by a holonomy: a logical unitary transformation. We
analytically derive the sequence of rotated stabilizer generators that produce
a desired holonomy, and find the total time required to implement this
procedure with a given success probability. If a measurement moves the state to
the orthogonal subspace, we present a method to alter the path of the rotated
observables to return the state either to the original code or the original
error space with the desired holonomy; in the latter case, the holonomy is
emulated. Finally, we establish conditions on the code and the measured
observables that preserve the correctability of a given error set. When a code
fails to meet the error-correcting conditions, our protocol remains applicable
by augmenting the code with at most two ancilla qubits.

### [65] [Advantages of Global Entanglement-Distillation Policies in Quantum Repeater Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06737)
*Iftach Yakar,Michael Ben-Or*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Non-local policies may be better for quantum repeaters


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates whether global deterministic policies for the timing of entanglement distillation in quantum repeater chains can be better than local deterministic policies, which are currently used. Due to the exponential growth of photon loss with distance in quantum communication, optimizing the timing of these policies is crucial for effective long-distance quantum communication.

Method: Quantum repeaters deal with photon loss over distance by repeating quantum states, and they generate shared randomness among remote parties through quantum states and classical communication. This paper compares the effectiveness of global deterministic policies, which use global knowledge of the network state for distillation decisions, versus local deterministic policies which use only local knowledge.

Result: Simulations of equidistant repeater chains, augmented by classical communication, showed that global deterministic policies obviously outperformed local alternatives in terms of the achievable secret key rate. For longer-connections, the improvement can be as large as two orders of magnitude and, in some cases, made perfect secret communication possible.

Conclusion: Local decisions do not appear to be optimal for quantum repeater chains, and the results suggest that signaling the network-wide state globally may have important consequences for the functioning of such repeaters. The findings open pathways for protocol design in quantum repeater networks.

Abstract: Quantum repeaters are essential for achieving long-distance quantum
communication due to photon loss, which grows exponentially with the channel
distance. Current quantum repeater generations use entanglement distillation
protocols, where the decision of when to perform distillation depends on either
local or global knowledge. Recent approaches for quantum repeaters, such as
Mantri et al. (arXiv:2409.06152), consider using deterministic local decision
policies for entanglement distillation. We ask whether global deterministic
policies outperform local ones in terms of communication rate. We simulate
equidistant repeater chains, assisted by two-way classical communication, and
compare local and global policies for distillation decisions, spanning large
distances and varying network and hardware parameters. Our findings show that
global deterministic policies consistently outperform these local ones, and in
some cases, determine whether secret communication is possible. For large
repeater chains ($N>512$), global policies improve SKR by two orders of
magnitude. These results suggest that local distillation decisions in quantum
repeater chains may not be optimal, and may inform future protocol design.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了量子相位估计的适用性，通过耗散过程实现 Heisenberg限度计算，并展示了其在高效量子演算中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Lindbladian dynamics are both foundational
in quantum information science and central to quantum algorithm design. In this
work, we bridge these two concepts: certain simple Lindbladian processes can be
adapted to perform QPE-type tasks. However, unlike QPE, which achieves
Heisenberg-limit scaling, these Lindbladian evolutions are restricted to
standard quantum limit complexity. This indicates that, different from
Hamiltonian dynamics, the natural dissipative evolution speed of such
Lindbladians does not saturate the fundamental quantum limit, thereby
suggesting the potential for quadratic fast-forwarding. We confirm this by
presenting a quantum algorithm that simulates these Lindbladians for time $t$
within an error $\varepsilon$ using
$\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{t\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ cost, whose mechanism
is fundamentally different from the fast-forwarding examples of Hamiltonian
dynamics. As a bonus, this fast-forwarded simulation naturally serves as a new
Heisenberg-limit QPE algorithm. Therefore, our work explicitly bridges the
standard quantum limit-Heisenberg limit transition to the fast-forwarding of
dissipative dynamics. We also adopt our fast-forwarding algorithm for efficient
Gibbs state preparation and demonstrate the counter-intuitive implication: the
allowance of a quadratically accelerated decoherence effect under arbitrary
Pauli noise.

Abstract: It is a major challenge to perform addressable and parallel logical
operations on constant-rate quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes. Indeed, the overhead of
targeting specific logical qubits represents a crucial bottleneck in many
quantum fault-tolerance schemes.
  We introduce fault-tolerant protocols for performing various addressable as
well as parallel logical operations with constant space-time overhead, on a
family of constant-rate and polynomial-distance qLDPC codes. Specifically, we
construct gadgets for a large class of permutations of logical qubits. We apply
these logical permutations to construct gadgets for applying a targeted
Hadamard (or $CNOT$) gate on any chosen logical qubit (pair). We also construct
gadgets for preparing logical code states, and for applying Hadamard gates on
all logical qubits in a codeblock. All of our gadgets use constant quantum
space-time overhead along with polynomially bounded classical computation.
Prior protocols for such operations required larger overhead, or else relied on
codes with certain symmetries that lack known asymptotic constructions.
  Our codes are given by tensor products of classical codes constructed from
lossless expander graphs. Our core technical contribution is a
constant-overhead code-switching procedure between 2- and 3-dimensional product
codes, which generalizes Bombin's dimensional jump (arXiv:1412.5079). We prove
that all of our gadgets exhibit a constant threshold under locally stochastic
noise. Along the way, we develop a small-set flip decoder for high-dimensional
product codes from lossless expanders. Our techniques yield additional
interesting consequences, such as single-shot state preparation of
2-dimensional product codes with constant space-time overhead. We also propose
a method for performing parallel non-Clifford gates by extending our techniques
to codes supporting transversal application of such gates.

TL;DR: This paper shows that VQAs with guiding states have theoretical guarantees on convergence and generalization by connecting their training to kernel models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the convergence and generalization of quantum algorithms, like VQAs, is essential for harnessing their quantum advantage. Quantum phase estimation carries such guarantees under certain assumptions. This work extends those guarantees to VQAs, bridging a gap in their theoretical foundation.

Method: The authors introduced a VQA with guiding states and a method called 'linearization trick' that maps its training dynamics to kernel models. This mapping was used to derive guarantees on convergence and generalization.

Result: The study provides the first theoretical framework for VQAs' convergence and generalization under the guiding state assumption. It shows guiding states enhance convergence, reduce finite-size errors, and ensure stability across system dimensions.

Conclusion: This research advances quantum algorithm theory, offering a solid foundation for practical applications of VQAs in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are prominent candidates for near-term
quantum advantage but lack rigorous guarantees of convergence and
generalization. By contrast, quantum phase estimation (QPE) provides provable
performance under the guiding state assumption, where access to a state with
non-trivial overlap with the ground state enables efficient energy estimation.
In this work, we ask whether similar guarantees can be obtained for VQAs. We
introduce a variational quantum algorithm with guiding states aiming towards
predicting ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. We then
develop a proof technique-the linearization trick-that maps the training
dynamics of the algorithm to those of a kernel model. This connection yields
the first theoretical guarantees on both convergence and generalization for the
VQA under the guiding state assumption. Our analysis shows that guiding states
accelerate convergence, suppress finite-size error terms, and ensure stability
across system dimensions. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical
experiments on 2D random Heisenberg models.

Conclusion: 相比于基于张量网络的方法，FeynDD 在某些电路族中表现更好。

Abstract: Classical simulation of quantum circuits is a critical tool for validating
quantum hardware and probing the boundary between classical and quantum
computational power. Existing state-of-the-art methods, notably tensor network
approaches, have computational costs governed by the treewidth of the
underlying circuit graph, making circuits with large treewidth intractable.
This work rigorously analyzes FeynmanDD, a decision diagram-based simulation
method proposed in CAV 2025 by a subset of the authors, and shows that the size
of the multi-terminal decision diagram used in FeynmanDD is exponential in the
linear rank-width of the circuit graph. As linear rank-width can be
substantially smaller than treewidth and is at most larger than the treewidth
by a logarithmic factor, our analysis demonstrates that FeynmanDD outperforms
all tensor network-based methods for certain circuit families. We also show
that the method remains efficient if we use the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm to
expand arbitrary single-qubit gates to sequences of Hadamard and T gates,
essentially removing the gate-set restriction posed by the method.

Abstract: Understanding the entanglement structure of local Hamiltonian ground spaces
is a physically motivated problem, with applications ranging from tensor
network design to quantum error-correcting codes. To this end, we study the
complexity of estimating ground state entanglement, and more generally entropy
estimation for low energy states and Gibbs states. We find, in particular, that
the classes qq-QAM [Kobayashi, le Gall, Nishimura, SICOMP 2019] (a quantum
analogue of public-coin AM) and QMA(2) (QMA with unentangled proofs) play a
crucial role for such problems, showing: (1) Detecting a high-entanglement
ground state is qq-QAM-complete, (2) computing an additive error approximation
to the Helmholtz free energy (equivalently, a multiplicative error
approximation to the partition function) is in qq-QAM, (3) detecting a
low-entanglement ground state is QMA(2)-hard, and (4) detecting low energy
states which are close to product states can range from QMA-complete to
QMA(2)-complete. Our results make progress on an open question of [Bravyi,
Chowdhury, Gosset and Wocjan, Nature Physics 2022] on free energy, and yield
the first QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem using local Hamiltonians (cf. the
sparse QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012]).

Abstract: It is a major challenge to construct good quantum codes supporting
fault-tolerant (e.g. transversal) non-Clifford gates with low-weight
parity-check measurements. In this paper, we construct the first known quantum
codes with linear dimension and distance supporting transversal non-Clifford
gates that have sublinear locality (i.e. parity-check weight). Specifically, we
construct codes with transversal $CCZ$ gates that have dimension and distance
$\Theta(N)$ and locality $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ denotes the block length. We
furthermore design an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes. The
alphabet size of these codes is $q=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$, but it can be reduced to
a constant (e.g. $q=2$) while incurring a polylogarithmic loss in other
parameters. We also show how to decrease the locality to $O(N^{1/3})$, albeit
with a larger alphabet size and slightly lower distance.
  We construct these codes as products of classical codes with appropriate
algebraic structure. While our quantum codes are subsystem codes with
non-commuting gauge operators, we show they nevertheless permit error
correction from noisy syndrome measurements.
  As byproducts, we prove multiple technical results of independent interest.
In particular, our efficient decoder can be viewed as a new multivariate
generalization of Prony's method for reconstructing a function from partial
access to its Fourier transform. Meanwhile, our distance analysis involves new
connections to the classical study of maximally recoverable codes. Our results
on product codes also resolve a conjecture of Bravyi & Hastings (2014) in the
large-alphabet regime, by providing a new construction of quantum codes with
dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $N^\epsilon$ for arbitrary
$\epsilon>0$.

discretization influences the minimum singular value and the polynomial degree
required for QSVT, identifying circuit-depth overhead as a key bottleneck. For
Burgers' equation, we illustrate how Carleman-linearized nonlinear dynamics can
be efficiently block encoded and solved within the QSVT framework. These
results highlight both the potential and limitations of current methods,
underscoring the need for efficient estimation of minimum singular value,

Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of
a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of
problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was
not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems --
qudits -- for all dimensions $d > 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of
the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to
arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum
states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered
in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to
qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based
on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser
state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate
$|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of
independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling
technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq
2$:
  1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples;
  2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in
$\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is
$\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time
with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates
cannot prepare pseudorandom states;
  5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least
$1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$
samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if
$\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  efficient quantum algorithms often require complex resources and constructions, this paper aims to simplify them.

Method:  two randomized QSVT methods: direct randomization and qDRIFT integration with quantum signal processing, both eliminating the need for block encodings and ancilla qubits.

Result:  algorithms achieve gate complexity independent of the number of Hamiltonian terms, with quadratic dependence on polynomial degree, and outperform standard QSVT in practical applications.

Conclusion:  randomized QSVT offers a practical, resource-efficient alternative for quantum devices, particularly for early fault-tolerant ones, with applications in quantum linear systems and Hamiltonian ground-state estimation.

Abstract: We introduce the first randomized algorithms for Quantum Singular Value
Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework for many quantum algorithms.
Standard implementations of QSVT rely on block encodings of the Hamiltonian,
which are costly to construct, requiring a logarithmic number of ancilla
qubits, intricate multi-qubit control, and circuit depth scaling linearly with
the number of Hamiltonian terms. In contrast, our algorithms use only a single
ancilla qubit and entirely avoid block encodings. We develop two methods: (i) a
direct randomization of QSVT, where block encodings are replaced by importance
sampling, and (ii) an approach that integrates qDRIFT into the generalized
quantum signal processing framework, with the dependence on precision
exponentially improved through classical extrapolation. Both algorithms achieve
gate complexity independent of the number of Hamiltonian terms, a hallmark of
randomized methods, while incurring only quadratic dependence on the degree of
the target polynomial. We identify natural parameter regimes where our methods
outperform even standard QSVT, making them promising for early fault-tolerant
quantum devices. We also establish a fundamental lower bound showing that the
quadratic dependence on the polynomial degree is optimal within this framework.
We apply our framework to two fundamental tasks: solving quantum linear systems
and estimating ground-state properties of Hamiltonians, obtaining polynomial
advantages over prior randomized algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our
ground-state property estimation algorithm on electronic structure Hamiltonians
and the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. In both
cases, our approach outperforms prior work by several orders of magnitude in
circuit depth, establishing randomized QSVT as a practical and
resource-efficient alternative for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are a versatile tool to detect entangled states
and characterize related properties of entanglement in quantum information
theory. A witness $W$ corresponds to an observable satisfying
$\mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0$ for all separable states
$\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}$; entangled states are detected once the inequality is
violated. Recently, mirrored EWs have been introduced by showing that there
exist non-trivial upper bounds to EWs, \begin{eqnarray} u_W\geq
\mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0. \nonumber \end{eqnarray} An upper
bound to a witness $W$ signifies the existence of the other one $M$, called a
mirrored EW, such that $W+M = u_W I \otimes I$. The framework of mirrored EWs
shows that a single EW can be even more useful, as it can detect a larger set
of entangled states by lower and upper bounds.
  In this work, we develop and investigate mirrored EWs for multipartite qubit
states and also for high-dimensional systems, to find the efficiency and
effectiveness of mirrored EWs in detecting entangled states. We provide
mirrored EWs for $n$-partite GHZ states, graph states such as two-colorable
states, and tripartite bound entangled states. We also show that optimal EWs
can be reflected with each other. For bipartite systems, we present mirrored
EWs for existing optimal EWs and also construct a mirrored pair of optimal EWs
in dimension three. Finally, we generalize mirrored EWs such that a pair of EWs
can be connected by another EW, i.e., $W+M =K$ is also an EW. Our results
enhance the capability of EWs to detect a larger set of entangled states in
multipartite and high-dimensional quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum systems achieve objectivity by redundantly encoding information about
themselves into the surrounding environment, through a mechanism known as
quantum Darwinism. When this happens, observes measure the environment and
infer the system to be in one of its pointer states. We study the emergence of
objectivity whenever the Hamiltonian of the system and the interaction
Hamiltonian between system and environment do not commute, a condition which is
thought to be incompatible with the presence of pointer states. We show that,
not only non-commuting evolutions allow for the emergence of objective states,
but it is possible to give a more relaxed definition of pointer states, that is
always well defined whenever there is redundancy of information, and coincides
with the usual one for commuting evolutions.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing that
incorporates strong single-photon nonlinearities into a photonic
GHZ-measurement-based architecture. The nonlinearities substantially reduce
resource overheads compared to conventional linear-optics-based architectures,
which require significant redundancy to accommodate probabilistic photon
generation and probabilistic entangling operations. By removing linear-optical
failure modes, our nonlinear architecture can also tolerate much higher optical
losses than linear approaches, with a baseline loss tolerance of $\sim$12\%
using a 32-photon resource state and a foliated surface code. Our results show
how introducing a nonlinear primitive enables dramatic improvements in
practical implementations of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Conclusion: 通过流形优化优化LOCC为分布式量子信息处理的研究提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Local operations and classical communication (LOCC) is a foundational
framework in quantum information from both theoretical and experimental
perspectives. However, designing and optimizing LOCC protocols is intractable
due to their complex structure. Determining achievable bounds and designing
practically implementable LOCC protocols remain crucial challenges when the
number of communication rounds is finite. In this work, we develop a framework
to optimize fixed-round LOCC via Riemannian optimization on the product Stiefel
manifold, which not only yields near-optimal objective function values but also
produces fully implementable protocols. We demonstrate the applicability of
this framework through key tasks in quantum information processing, such as
entanglement distillation and state merging. Our results provide new insights
into the achievable bounds for entanglement distillation and block entanglement
state merging. We obtain improved distillation and state merging protocols,
some of which match the upper bounds derived via positive partial transpose
relaxations. These results demonstrate that optimizing LOCC via manifold
optimization can serve as a powerful tool to advance research on distributed
quantum information processing.

Abstract: Foundational results in theoretical computer science have established that
everything provable, is provable in zero knowledge. However, this assertion
fundamentally assumes a classical interpretation of computation and many
interesting physical statements that one can hope to prove are not
characterized. In this work, we consider decision problems, where the problem
instance itself is specified by a (pure) quantum state. We discuss several
motivating examples for this notion and, as our main technical result, we show
that every quantum problem that is provable with an interactive protocol, is
also provable in zero-knowledge. Our protocol achieves unconditional soundness
and computational zero-knowledge, under standard assumptions in cryptography.
In addition, we show how our techniques yield a protocol for the Uhlmann
transformation problem that achieves a meaningful notion of zero-knowledge,
also in the presence of a malicious verifier.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study quantum sparse recovery in non-orthogonal, overcomplete
dictionaries: given coherent quantum access to a state and a dictionary of
vectors, the goal is to reconstruct the state up to $\ell_2$ error using as few
vectors as possible. We first show that the general recovery problem is
NP-hard, ruling out efficient exact algorithms in full generality. To overcome
this, we introduce Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (QOMP), the first
quantum analogue of the classical OMP greedy algorithm. QOMP combines quantum
subroutines for inner product estimation, maximum finding, and block-encoded
projections with an error-resetting design that avoids iteration-to-iteration
error accumulation. Under standard mutual incoherence and well-conditioned
sparsity assumptions, QOMP provably recovers the exact support of a $K$-sparse
state in polynomial time. As an application, we give the first framework for
sparse quantum tomography with non-orthogonal dictionaries in $\ell_2$ norm,
achieving query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N}/\epsilon)$ in favorable
regimes and reducing tomography to estimating only $K$ coefficients instead of
$N$ amplitudes. In particular, for pure-state tomography with $m=O(N)$
dictionary vectors and sparsity $K=\widetilde{O}(1)$ on a well-conditioned
subdictionary, this circumvents the $\widetilde{\Omega}(N/\epsilon)$ lower
bound that holds in the dense, orthonormal-dictionary setting, without
contradiction, by leveraging sparsity together with non-orthogonality. Beyond
tomography, we analyze QOMP in the QRAM model, where it yields polynomial
speedups over classical OMP implementations, and provide a quantum algorithm to
estimate the mutual incoherence of a dictionary of $m$ vectors in
$O(m/\epsilon)$ queries, improving over both deterministic and quantum-inspired
classical methods.

Conclusion: 这项研究为量子热力学的定义问题提供了重要的进展，特别是在区分不同定义及其影响时。

Abstract: Understanding how to assign internal energy, heat, and work in quantum
systems beyond weak coupling remains a central problem in quantum
thermodynamics, particularly as the difference between competing definitions
becomes increasingly relevant. We identify two common sets of definitions for
first-law quantities that are used to describe the thermodynamics of quantum
systems coupled to thermal environments. Both are conceptually non-symmetric,
treating one part of the bipartition (the "system") differently from the other
(the "bath"). We analyze these in a setting where such roles are not easily
assigned - two large (but finite) sets of thermal harmonic oscillators
interacting with each other. We further compare them with a third set of
definitions based on a local, conceptually symmetric open-system approach
("minimal dissipation") and discuss their quantitative and structural
differences. In particular, we observe that all three sets of definitions
differ substantially even when the two subsystems are weakly coupled and far
detuned, and that the minimal dissipation approach features distinct work peaks
that increase with the coupling strength.

Conclusion: QFL为多模态融合提供了一种新方法，具有更大的研究潜力。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a quantum fusion mechanism for
multimodal learning and to establish its theoretical and empirical potential.
The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical
fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses
parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without
requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing
principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial
interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a
separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that
highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently
outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks,
with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results
suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal
fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.

Conclusion: The study points to the importance of considering material properties and device structure in optimizing quantum state transport for scalability in quantum information processing.

Abstract: Scalable quantum information processing in spin-based architectures
necessitates the a bility to reliably shuttle quantum states across extended

Our approach combines self-consistent Poisson and Schrodinger solvers to
maintain a constant ground state energy and enable near-constant velocity

transport. We validate the algorithm across three representative technologies:
Fully-Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FD-SOI), Silicon
Metal-Oxide-Seminconductor (SiMOS) and Silicon-Germanium Heterostracture
(Si/SiGe), highlighting key limitations and material-specific effects that
influence transport fidelity. Our findings underscore the impact of gate
geometry, dielectric interfaces, and quantum dot size on the stability of
shuttling operations, and offer pathways toward improving coherence
preservation in large-scale quantum systems.

DCT where the success condition is stipulated in terms of measurement
probabilities rather than convergence to fixed-point configurations. Finally,
we identify a classically simulable regime of the PUQCA in which we find rules
that solve the DCT at fixed system sizes and analyze their performance.

Abstract: We show the existence of an MA-complete homology problem for a certain

containment in MA is achieved through the design of new, higher-order random
walks on simplicial complexes associated with the filtration. For the
MA-hardness, we design a new gadget with which we can reduce from an MA-hard
stoquastic satisfiability problem. Therefore, our result provides the first
natural MA-complete problem for higher-order random walks on simplicial
complexes, combining the concepts of topology, persistent homology, and quantum

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum technology, the precise and detailed
description of quantum components is not just a necessity but the foundation
for advancing research, development, and applications. Optically accessible
quantum memories are key building blocks for devices such as quantum repeaters
and two-factor authentication. The memory we describe here is based on a
tin-vacancy color center coupled to a highly efficient cavity. It leverages
state-dependent reflection from the cavity and implements high-fidelity
fractional single qubit gates via a train of optical $\pi/8$ pulses. We also
describe its operation under microwave control, further extending our analysis.
Our primary contribution in this work is the integration of this device model
into a standardized software framework for quantum memory architectures.

Abstract: Duality theorems play a fundamental role in convex optimization. Recently, it
was shown how duality theorems for countable probability distributions and
finite-dimensional quantum states can be leveraged for building relatively
complete relational program logics for probabilistic and quantum programs,
respectively. However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum
programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over
classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main
gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal
transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined
setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this
paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for
classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel
dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying
the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take
the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting
duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational
program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In
addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing
program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al.,
POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).

Abstract: Nanophotonic light-matter interfaces hold great promise for quantum

on a transparent diamond substrate. Our imaging system achieves a resolution of
1.1 {\mu}m and a field-of-view of 2.5 mm. The system requires no movable parts
at cryogenic temperatures and features a large working distance, thereby
allowing optical and microwave probe access, as well as direct anchoring of
temperature sensitive samples to a cold finger, needed for applications with
high thermal load. This system will facilitate the development of scalable,

Motivation:  recognizable anomalies in manufacturing equipment through sound analysis requires accurate and efficient methods.

Method:  conducted experiments with two setups: a miniature racing car track and an open-belt drive with simulated anomalies. data was collected via sensors and recorded sounds, followed by applying quantum and classical kernels in one-class SVM for classification.

Result:  quantum kernels outperformed classical gaussian kernels. on the miniature car track dataset, quantum kernel achieved 0.82 accuracy and 0.39 F1-score vs 0.64 and 0.39 for RBF kernel. for the open-belt drive dataset, quantum kernel achieved perfect 1.00 accuracy and F1-score vs 0.64 and 0.43 for RBF kernel.

Conclusion:  quantum kernels improve classification accuracy for diverse abnormal sound patterns in manufacturing equipment.

Abstract: Maintenance of production equipment is critical in manufacturing. Typically,
machine learning models are trained on sensor data closely attached to
equipment. However, as the number of machines increases, computational cost
grows rapidly. In practice, anomalies are often identified by human operators
through auditory perception, relying heavily on experience and intuition. In
vibration analysis, especially, AR model coefficients combined with one-class
SVMs are used for detecting anomalies. In this work, we explore the effect of
substituting the classical kernel in the one-class SVM with a quantum kernel.
Two experimental setups were used. The first involved a miniature racing car
track, where the car passes over a patch of hook-and-loop fastener to generate
abnormal sounds, which are recorded using a microphone. The second involved an
open-belt drive, where chopsticks are inserted at specific times to produce
crushing sounds, simulating sudden anomalies. Our results show a clear
advantage of quantum kernels over classical Gaussian (RBF) kernels. On the
miniature car track dataset, the quantum kernel achieved an accuracy and
F1-score of 0.82, compared to 0.64 and 0.39 respectively for the RBF kernel.
For the crushing device, the quantum kernel achieved perfect accuracy and
F1-score (1.00), while the RBF kernel reached only 0.64 accuracy and 0.43
F1-score. These findings suggest that quantum kernels enhance the
classification accuracy for diverse types of abnormal sound patterns, including
both periodic and impulsive anomalies.

*Feng Qiao,Zu-Jian Ying*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We propose a scheme to implement Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing in a hybrid cavity optomechanical-spin system with $N$ two-level systems coupled to a mechanical resonator. Our system achieves a two-axis twisting squeezing protocol under large detuning, and with dephasing and phonon dissipation, the metrological precision approaches the standard quantum limit asymptotically. Our work provides insights into dissipation effects in spin squeezing and offers a potential route for high-precision quantum metrology in many-body systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing is a fundamental tool for quantum metrology and has wide-ranging applications in quantum information science. Achieving such squeezing in hybrid systems is particularly challenging, and this work addresses that gap by proposing a novel two-axis twisting protocol under large detuning.

Method: We consider a system of $N$ two-level systems coupled to a mechanical resonator via Tavis-Cummings interactions within the dispersive coupling regime. By adiabatically eliminating the optical mode, we induce squeezing on the mechanical resonator. In the squeezed representation, the collective spin operators are transformed into a Bogoliubov form, enabling the two-axis twisting squeezing protocol. We use both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to validate our approach.

Result: Our results show that in the presence of dephasing and phonon dissipation, the maximum squeezing degree asymptotically converges to a constant as $N$ increases. This implies that the metrological precision asymptotically approaches the standard quantum limit without the need for parameter optimization. Additionally, parameter optimization reveals a scaling relation for optimal squeezing, surpassing existing schemes in the literature. The optimization also reduces the preparation time for optimal squeezing.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant step forward in achieving Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing in hybrid cavity optomechanical-spin systems. By leveraging large detuning and phonon-mediated interactions, we demonstrate that ultra-precise quantum metrology can be achieved without parameter optimization, reaching the standard quantum limit asymptotically. Our findings offer a promising route for advancing high-precision quantum metrology in many-body systems.

Abstract: We propose a scheme to implement Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing in a
hybrid cavity optomechanical-spin system. In our system, $N$ two-level systems
are coupled via Tavis-Cummings interactions to a mechanical resonator (MR) in a
standard optomechanical setup. Within the dispersive coupling regime, adiabatic
elimination of the optical mode induces a squeezing effect on the MR, which, in
the squeezed representation, effectively transforms the collective spin
operators into a Bogoliubov form. Under large detuning conditions, the phonon
mode mediates interactions among the Bogoliubov collective spins, thereby
enabling a two-axis twisting squeezing protocol through appropriate parameter
tuning. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that in the
presence of dephasing and phonon dissipation, the maximum squeezing degree
asymptotically converges to a constant as $N$ increases, which implies the
metrological precision asymptotically approaches the standard quantum limit
without parameter optimization. Nevertheless, in parameter optimization we
extract a scaling relation of the optimal squeezing which surpasses existing
schemes in the literature. Moreover, the optimization also leads to a
considerable reduction of the preparation time for the optimal squeezing. Our
work may provide insights into dissipation effects in spin squeezing and offer
a potential route for high-precision quantum metrology in many-body systems.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of
quantum emulation. However, existing studies often struggle to achieve broad
applicability, high performance, and efficient resource and memory utilization.
To address these challenges, we provide HPQEA, a quantum emulator based on the
state-vector emulation approach. HPQEA includes three main features: a
high-performance computing core, an optimized controlled-NOT gate computation
strategy, and effective utilization of high-bandwidth memory. Verification and
evaluation on the Alveo U280 board show that HPQEA can emulate quantum circuits
with up to 30 qubits while maintaining high fidelity and low mean square error.
It outperforms comparable FPGA-based systems by producing faster execution,
supporting a wider range of algorithms, and requiring low hardware resources.
Furthermore, it exceeds the Nvidia A100 in normalized gate speed for systems
with up to 20 qubits. These results demonstrate the scalability and efficiency
of HPQEA as a platform for emulating quantum algorithms.

TL;DR: Alice wants Bob to perform a quantum computation without revealing what she's doing, and this paper determines the minimal communication required for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses an important question in quantum cryptography: how to securely delegate quantum computations while maintaining Alice's privacy.

Method: The study employs entropy-bounding techniques and considers quantum states, both entangled and separable, to determine the minimum communication required for information-theoretic security.

Result: The paper establishes a lower bound on the number of qubits Alice must send, provides an optimal protocol that achieves this bound for Clifford gates using entangled states, and shows that separable states suffice for these gates.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational insights into secure quantum computation delegation, demonstrating the minimal communication requirements for information-theoretic security.

Abstract: A user, Alice, wants to get server Bob to implement a quantum computation for
her. However, she wants to leave him blind to what she's doing. What are the
minimal communication resources Alice must use in order to achieve
information-theoretic security? In this paper, we consider a single step of the
protocol, where Alice conveys to Bob whether or not he should implement a
specific gate. We use an entropy-bounding technique to quantify the minimum
number of qubits that Alice must send so that Bob cannot learn anything about
the gate being implemented. We provide a protocol that saturates this bound. In
this optimal protocol, the states that Alice sends may be entangled. For
Clifford gates, we prove that it is sufficient for Alice to send separable
states.

Conclusion: 该研究为光量子通信提供新方法，展示了量子通信纠错技术的进步。

Abstract: Sending quantum information reliably over long distances is a central
challenge in quantum technology in general, and in quantum optics in
particular, since most quantum communication relies on optical fibres or
free-space links. Here, we address this problem by shifting the focus from the
quantity of information sent to the quality of the transmission, i.e. the rate
of decay of the transmission error with respect to the number of channel uses.
For the general class of teleportation-simulable channels, which includes all
channels arising in quantum optical communication, we prove that the
single-letter reverse relative entropy of entanglement of the Choi state upper
bounds the error exponent of two-way assisted quantum communication -
paralleling the celebrated capacity bound of [Pirandola et al., Nat. Comm.
(2017)] in terms of the regularised relative entropy of entanglement.
Remarkably, for Gaussian channels our bound can be computed efficiently through
a convex program with simple constraints involving only finite-dimensional
covariance matrices. As a prototypical application, we derive closed-form
analytical expressions for several one-mode Gaussian channels that are
fundamental to optical communication. Extending recent work [Lami et al.,
arXiv:2408.07067 (2024)] to infinite-dimensional systems, we further endow the
reverse relative entropy of entanglement with an exact operational
interpretation in entanglement testing, and show that it characterises the rate
of entanglement distillation under non-entangling operations. These findings
offer a new perspective on entanglement as a resource and sharpen the
theoretical benchmarks for future quantum optical networks.

Conclusion: 初步研究证实，利用不定因果顺序可以显著提升量子通信的鲁棒性，特别适用于高噪声环境，为建造强大的量子网络奠定了基础。

Abstract: A major challenge in quantum communication is addressing the negative effects
of noise on channel capacity, especially for completely depolarizing channels,
where information transmission is inherently impossible. The concept of
indefinite causal order provides a promising solution by allowing control over
the sequence in which channels are applied. We experimentally demonstrate the
activation of quantum communication through completely depolarizing channels
using a programmable silicon photonic quantum chip. By implementing
configurations based on the superposition of cyclic orders, a form of
indefinite causal order, we report the first experimental realization of
genuine quantum information transmission across multiple concatenated
completely depolarizing channels. Our results show that when four completely
depolarizing channels are combined using the superposition of cyclic orders,
the fidelity of the output state is $0.712 \pm 0.013$, significantly exceeding
the classical threshold of 2/3. Our work establishes indefinite causal order as
a powerful tool for overcoming noise-induced limitations in quantum
communication, demonstrating its potential in high-noise environments and
opening new possibilities for building robust quantum networks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the error correcting properties of Haar random codes, in which a
$K$-dimensional code space $\boldsymbol{C} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^N$ is chosen at
random from the Haar distribution. Our main result is that Haar random codes
can approximately correct errors up to the quantum Hamming bound, meaning that
a set of $m$ Pauli errors can be approximately corrected so long as $mK \ll N$.
This is the strongest bound known for any family of quantum error correcting
codes (QECs), and continues a line of work showing that approximate QECs can
significantly outperform exact QECs [LNCY97, CGS05, BGG24]. Our proof relies on
a recent matrix concentration result of Bandeira, Boedihardjo, and van Handel.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解Quantum Entanglement在Interactive Proof系统中的作用提供了新的视角和证明框架, 打开了探索Quantum Computing可能性的大门.

Abstract: In 2020, a landmark result by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen showed
that MIP*, the class of languages that can be decided by a classical verifier
interacting with multiple computationally unbounded provers sharing
entanglement in the tensor product model, is equal to RE. We show that the
class MIPco, a complexity class defined similarly to MIP* except with provers
sharing the commuting operator model of entanglement, is equal to the class
coRE. This shows that giving the provers two different models of entanglement
leads to two completely different computational powers for interactive proof
systems. Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of
MIP*=RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that
the same compression procedure in MIP* =RE also has the same desired property
in the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the
compression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous
framework used by Mousavi et al. [STOC 2022], as well as the improved Pauli
basis test introduced by de la Salle [ArXiv:2204.07084].
  We introduce a new equivalence condition for RE/coRE-complete problems, which
we call the weakly compressible condition. We show that both MIP* and MIPco
satisfy this condition through the compression theorem, and thereby establish
that the uncomputability for MIP* and MIPco can be proved under a unified
framework (despite these two complexity classes being different). Notably, this
approach also gives an alternative proof of the MIP*=RE theorem, which does not
rely on the preservation of the entanglement bound. In addition to non-local
games, this new condition could also potentially be applicable to other
decision problems.

Conclusion: 这项研究为Clifford测试器提供了新的见解，为量子计算中的基本问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of Clifford testing, which asks whether a black-box
$n$-qubit unitary is a Clifford unitary or at least $\varepsilon$-far from
every Clifford unitary. We give the first 4-query Clifford tester, which
decides this problem with probability $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$. This
contrasts with the minimum of 6 copies required for the closely-related task of
stabilizer testing. We show that our tester is tolerant, by adapting techniques
from tolerant stabilizer testing to our setting. In doing so, we settle in the
positive a conjecture of Bu, Gu and Jaffe, by proving a polynomial inverse
theorem for a non-commutative Gowers 3-uniformity norm. We also consider the
restricted setting of single-copy access, where we give an $O(n)$-query
Clifford tester that requires no auxiliary memory qubits or adaptivity. We
complement this with a lower bound, proving that any such, potentially
adaptive, single-copy algorithm needs at least $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ queries. To
obtain our results, we leverage the structure of the commutant of the Clifford
group, obtaining several technical statements that may be of independent
interest.

### [101] [Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07179)
*Adithya Sriram,Vedika Khemani,Benedikt Placke*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Optimal classical LDPC code constructions can be achieved by randomly selecting biregular Tanner graphs. The proposed diffusion codes, defined through random SWAP networks acting on a graph, balance randomness and locality. For diffusion codes on a cycle graph, when the SWAP network depth is approximately linear in n², the Tanner graph becomes a lossless vertex expander for small sets, and stabilizer size remains manageable. This expansion and expansion properties are conjectured to hold for general graphs. By combining these classical codes using hypergraph products, quantum LDPC codes are derived with enhanced expansion and expansion, similar classical trade-offs, single-shot decoding, and improved stabilizer scaling. The technique demonstrates rapid mixing of randomized quantum processes on small subsystems, potentially valuable on its own.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a novel approach to constructing both classical and quantum LDPC codes using expander properties and probabilistic methods. The hybrid construction leverages insights from quantum error correction and expander graphs to create codes with desirable properties for fault-tolerant computing.

Method: The method involves 1) defining diffusion codes over a base graph with random SWAP networks to introduce stochasticity, 2) proving expander properties through mixing time arguments, 3) deriving quantum codes via hypergraph products, and 4) utilizing proof techniques relevant to expander graphs in quantum computing.

Result: Successful construction of classical LDPC codes with optimized expander properties and tailored stabilizer sizes. Quantum LDPC codes with enhanced expansion are developed, potentially improving fault-tolerant quantum computing's error correction capabilities.

Conclusion: The work bridges classical coding theory and quantum error correction, offering new resources for fault-tolerant computing by introducing efficient and scalable codes with rigidity and expansion properties optimized through random processes and expander graph techniques.

Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the
Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class
of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge
connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a
random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a
tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code
parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion
codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with
$T> n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the
Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up
size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree.
At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by
$\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this
result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph
products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the
torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same
expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are
self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size
of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof
technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at
times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent
interest.

Motivation: 量子计算随着量子技术和量子系统的发展而面临越来越严重的噪声问题。这限制了量子计算的实践应用。因此，如何提高量子控制在噪声影响下的鲁棒性，成为量子信息科学研究中的一个重要课题。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于动态纠错的量子控制方法，这种方法通过优化操作路径，使得噪声的一阶贡献在控制时间结束时相互抵消。该方法采用分段优化策略，确保在有限控制幅度下，达到高精度的操作效果。此外，论文还采用构造性方案，说明了如何具体实现任意目标量子门的鲁棒操作。

Result: 论文确定了几种不同噪声场景下量子控制的下界，即所需操作时间的最小值。对于单一噪声源，证明了只要求第一阶鲁棒性，就能保证操作时间在4TPlus常数时间内完成。这对于量子操作的效率和性能具有重要的指导意义。

Conclusion: 通过建立量子控制在噪声影响下的时间下界，论文为优化量子操作提供了新的理论框架。这项研究不仅在量子计算的实际应用中具有重要意义，而且为理解量子系统在噪声环境中的行为提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Noise is ubiquitous in quantum systems and is a major obstacle for the
advancement of quantum information science. Noise-robust quantum control
achieves high-fidelity operations by engineering the evolution path so that
first-order noise contributions cancel at the final time. Such dynamical error
correction typically incurs a time overhead beyond standard quantum speed
limits. We derive general lower bounds on control complexity that quantify this
overhead for quasi-static coherent noise under bounded control amplitude. For a
single noise source, we prove a universal time lower bound for first-order
robustness and give a constructive scheme that implements any target gate
robustly in time 4T plus a constant time. For robustness against an entire
noise space, we show dimension lower bounds on the number M of segments in any
mixed-unitary schedule from two mechanism: (i) a coherent dimension bound when
the error subspace contains an irreducible block isomorphic to su(q), and (ii)
a projection dimension bound when the noise space contains the trace-zero span
of orthogonal projectors. Under bounded speed, these bounds on number of
segments imply time lower bounds. With only local controls robust against noise
space defined on a graph, we obtain a graph-orthogonality time bound scales
linear with graph chromatic number. We illustrate the bounds through examples.
Collectively, these results establish quantitative limitations on the
feasibility of first-order noise-resilient operations.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子数据在远程访问下的隐私和验证提供了新的解决方案，并展示了量子优势在隐私保护条件下的持续性。这些成果对量子计算和数据隐私保护技术的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Quantum learning from remotely accessed quantum compute and data must address
two key challenges: verifying the correctness of data and ensuring the privacy
of the learner's data-collection strategies and resulting conclusions. The
covert (verifiable) learning model of Canetti and Karchmer (TCC 2021) provides
a framework for endowing classical learning algorithms with such guarantees. In
this work, we propose models of covert verifiable learning in quantum learning
theory and realize them without computational hardness assumptions for remote
data access scenarios motivated by established quantum data advantages. We
consider two privacy notions: (i) strategy-covertness, where the eavesdropper
does not gain information about the learner's strategy; and (ii)
target-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the
unknown object being learned. We show: Strategy-covert algorithms for making
quantum statistical queries via classical shadows; Target-covert algorithms for
learning quadratic functions from public quantum examples and private quantum
statistical queries, for Pauli shadow tomography and stabilizer state learning
from public multi-copy and private single-copy quantum measurements, and for
solving Forrelation and Simon's problem from public quantum queries and private
classical queries, where the adversary is a unidirectional or i.i.d.
ancilla-free eavesdropper. The lattermost results in particular establish that
the exponential separation between classical and quantum queries for
Forrelation and Simon's problem survives under covertness constraints. Along
the way, we design covert verifiable protocols for quantum data acquisition
from public quantum queries which may be of independent interest. Overall, our
models and corresponding algorithms demonstrate that quantum advantages are
privately and verifiably achievable even with untrusted, remote data.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) promise to deliver exponential
speed-ups in select computational tasks, yet their integration into modern deep
learning pipelines remains unclear. In this work, we take a step towards
bridging this gap by presenting the first fully-coherent quantum implementation
of a multilayer neural network with non-linear activation functions. Our
constructions mirror widely used deep learning architectures based on ResNet,
and consist of residual blocks with multi-filter 2D convolutions, sigmoid
activations, skip-connections, and layer normalizations. We analyse the
complexity of inference for networks under three quantum data access regimes.
Without any assumptions, we establish a quadratic speedup over classical
methods for shallow bilinear-style networks. With efficient quantum access to
the weights, we obtain a quartic speedup over classical methods. With efficient
quantum access to both the inputs and the network weights, we prove that a
network with an $N$-dimensional vectorized input, $k$ residual block layers,
and a final residual-linear-pooling layer can be implemented with an error of
$\epsilon$ with $O(\text{polylog}(N/\epsilon)^k)$ inference cost.

Motivation: The authors are interested in examining the intersection of quantum computing and biology to gain insights into both fields and identify potential cross-disciplinary applications.

Method: The paper reviews existing models of spin-based quantum computing and quantum biology, specifically focusing on phosphorus nuclei in spin-zero environments, and explores their relation to neural processes.

Result: The paper identifies similarities between spin quantum computing models and quantum cognition, suggesting potential for bidirectional knowledge exchange between quantum computing and biological systems.

Conclusion: The study concludes that studying the intersection of quantum computing and quantum biology could lead to new strategies for quantum information processing as well as deeper understanding of cognitive processes in biology.

Abstract: Over two decades ago, Bruce Kane proposed that spin-half phosphorus nuclei
embedded in a spin-zero silicon substrate could serve as a viable platform for
spin-based quantum computing. These nuclear spins exhibit remarkably long
coherence times, making them ideal candidates for qubits. Despite this
advantage, practical realisation of spin quantum computing remains a challenge.
More recently, physicist Matthew Fisher proposed a hypothesis linking nuclear
spin dynamics, specifically those of phosphorus nuclei within the spin-zero
matrix of calcium phosphate molecules, to neural activation and, potentially,
cognition. The theory has generated both interest and scepticism, with some
fundamental questions remaining. We review this intersection of quantum
computing and quantum biology by outlining the similarities between these
models of quantum computing and quantum cognition. We then address some of the
open questions and the lessons that might be learned in each context. In doing
so, we highlight a promising bidirectional exchange: not only might quantum
computing offer tools for understanding quantum biology, but biological models
may also inspire novel strategies for quantum information processing.

Abstract: We present a tensor-network-based method for simulating a weakly-measured
quantum circuit. In particular, we use a Markov chain to efficiently sample
measurements and contract the tensor network, propagating their effect forward
along the spatial direction. Applications of our algorithm include validating
quantum computers (capable of mid-circuit measurements) in regimes of easy
classical simulability, and studying generative-machine-learning applications,
where sampling from complex stochastic processes is the main task. As a
demonstration of our algorithm, we consider a (1+1)-dimensional brickwall
circuit of Haar-random unitaries, interspersed with generalized single-qubit
measurements of variable strength. We simulate the dynamics for tens to
hundreds of qubits if the circuit exhibits area-law entanglement (under strong
measurements), and tens of qubits if it exhibits volume-law entanglement (under
weak measurements). We observe signatures of a measurement-induced phase
transition between the two regimes as a function of measurement strength.

Abstract: Prior work of Beverland et al. has shown that any exact Clifford+$T$
implementation of the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate must use at least $n$ $T$ gates.
Here we show how to get away with exponentially fewer $T$ gates, at the cost of
incurring a tiny $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error that can be neglected in most
practical situations. More precisely, the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate can be
implemented to within error $\epsilon$ in the diamond distance by a randomly
chosen Clifford+$T$ circuit with at most $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ $T$ gates. We
also give a matching $\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$ lower bound that establishes
optimality, and we show that any purely unitary implementation achieving even
constant error must use $\Omega(n)$ $T$ gates. We also extend our sampling
technique to implement other Boolean functions. Finally, we describe upper and
lower bounds on the $T$-count of Boolean functions in terms of non-adaptive
parity decision tree complexity and its randomized analogue.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to extend the application of classical shadows, a powerful tool in quantum information theory for efficiently estimating properties of unknown quantum states, to photonic platforms. With the rapid development of photonic technologies, this extension is both timely and practical, as it enables the use of classical shadows for learning photonic quantum states, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementations in photonic systems. Efficient learning of quantum state properties is a fundamental challenge in quantum information theory, and developing practical protocols for photonic systems is particularly important given the potential for large-scale quantum computing and applications in quantum communication and sensing.

Method: The method involves developing a classical shadow protocol tailored for photonic quantum states. Specifically, we utilize randomized passive linear optical transformations, which are implemented using photonic integrated circuits, followed by photon-number measurement. The protocol leverages the statistical guarantees provided by classical shadows to estimate the properties of the unknown quantum states effectively. The implementation details include the use of a twelve-mode photonic integrated quantum processing unit, which demonstrates the scalability and practicality of the protocol in real-world quantum devices.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed protocol. We have successfully learned a wide range of photonic state properties with high accuracy, as evidenced by the experimental data. The protocol exhibits efficiency even for a large number of modes, confirming its potential for application to more complex quantum systems. This achievement opens new avenues for applying classical shadows to photonic platforms, enabling the practical implementation of various quantum applications, such as quantum state tomography, quantum process tomography, and more.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the development of a classical shadow protocol for learning photonic quantum states represents a significant advancement in quantum information theory. By leveraging passive linear optical transformations and photon-number measurements, we have created an efficient and scalable protocol that can be applied to various photonic systems. The experimental validation using a twelve-mode photonic integrated quantum processing unit strongly supports the practicality and broad applicability of this protocol. This work not only extends the capabilities of classical shadows to photonic platforms but also lays the foundation for future research in scalable quantum state analysis using classical shadows.

Abstract: Efficient learning of quantum state properties is both a fundamental and
practical problem in quantum information theory. Classical shadows have emerged
as an efficient method for estimating properties of unknown quantum states,
with rigorous statistical guarantees, by performing randomized measurement on a
few number of copies. With the advent of photonic technologies, formulating
efficient learning algorithms for such platforms comes out as a natural
problem. Here, we introduce a classical shadow protocol for learning photonic
quantum states via randomized passive linear optical transformations and
photon-number measurement. We show that this scheme is efficient for a large
class of observables of interest. We experimentally demonstrate our findings on
a twelve-mode photonic integrated quantum processing unit. Our protocol allows
for scalable learning of a wide range of photonic state properties and paves
the way to applying the already rich variety of applications of classical
shadows to photonic platforms.

*Narayan S Iyer,Shraddha Sharma*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between negative $	extit{α}$-CQKE and the fully entangled fraction (FEF) in various quantum states, establishing bounds for their non-usefulness in quantum teleportation and steerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of quantum entanglement in quantum information processing protocols is essential.

Method: The authors analyze four quantum states in $2igotimes 2$ systems and extend to $digotimes d$ states, deriving bounds for the negative $	extit{α}$-CQKE.

Result: Negative $	extit{α}$-CQKE implies FEF's bounds and limits the utility of certain states in quantum teleportation and steerability.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that negative $	extit{α}$-CQKE can predict state limitations in teleportation and steerability, providing a novel perspective on entanglement measures.

Abstract: In the present article, we examine the relationship of negative conditional
quantum Kaniadakis entropy ($\alpha-$CQKE) with the fully entangled fraction
(FEF) which is a substantial yardstick for quantum information processing
protocols including teleportation, and quantum steerability, executed over four
vital quantum states with maximally mixed marginals, the 2-qubit Werner state,
the 2-qubit Weyl state, the 2-qudit Werner state and the isotropic state. We
initiate our analysis in 2$\otimes$2 systems where we derive implicit bounds on
FEF when the $\alpha-$CQKE takes negative values, i.e. when $\alpha-$CQKE $\in$
$R^{-}$ for 2-qubit Werner state. Consequently, we derive the sufficient
implicit bounds for a definitive claim on the non-usefulness of Werner state
for quantum teleportation provided its visibility parameter succeeds to elude a
critical region, the exception region 1, where the situation becomes
inconclusive. Subsequently, we replicate the same for the 2-qubit Weyl state
with some constraints augmented by an analogous exception region 2 and the
correlation tensor matrix elements. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to
d $\otimes$ d states, commencing our analysis with the Isotropic state. We
derive implicit bounds on FEF of the Isotropic state and the 2-qudit Werner
state resembling the ones in the 2$\otimes$2 analysis. Additionally, we utilize
the convoluted relationship between the FEF and quantum steerability to
formulate propositions linking negative $\alpha-$CQKE to the k-copy
steerability of isotropic states for projective measurements, thereby reducing
the intricacy of the study of k-copy steerability directly via FEF. In the
appendix section of the article, we provide corroborative calculations and
supplementary materials to the theorems presented in the main sections.

Abstract: We establish novel connections between magic in quantum circuits and
communication complexity. In particular, we show that functions computable with
low magic have low communication cost.
  Our first result shows that the $\mathsf{D}\|$ (deterministic simultaneous
message passing) cost of a Boolean function $f$ is at most the number of
single-qubit magic gates in a quantum circuit computing $f$ with any quantum
advice state. If we allow mid-circuit measurements and adaptive circuits, we
obtain an upper bound on the two-way communication complexity of $f$ in terms
of the magic + measurement cost of the circuit for $f$. As an application, we
obtain magic-count lower bounds of $\Omega(n)$ for the $n$-qubit generalized
Toffoli gate as well as the $n$-qubit quantum multiplexer.
  Our second result gives a general method to transform $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$
protocols (simultaneous quantum messages with shared entanglement) into
$\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous classical messages with shared
entanglement) which incurs only a polynomial blowup in the communication and
entanglement complexity, provided the referee's action in the $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$
protocol is implementable in constant $T$-depth. The resulting $\mathsf{R}\|^*$
protocols satisfy strong privacy constraints and are $\mathsf{PSM}^*$ protocols
(private simultaneous message passing with shared entanglement), where the
referee learns almost nothing about the inputs other than the function value.
As an application, we demonstrate $n$-bit partial Boolean functions whose
$\mathsf{R}\|^*$ complexity is $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and whose $\mathsf{R}$
(interactive randomized) complexity is $n^{\Omega(1)}$, establishing the first
exponential separations between $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ and $\mathsf{R}$ for Boolean
functions.

Abstract: We introduce a family of hybrid quantum circuits involving unitary gates and
projective measurements that display a measurement-induced phase transition.
Remarkably, the volume-law phase featuring logarithmic entanglement growth for
certain initial states. We attribute this slow entanglement growth to the
similarly slow growth of the participation entropy, which bounds the
entanglement. Furthermore, the quantum circuit can be mapped to a classical
spin model with real positive Boltzmann weights which involves local multi-spin
interactions and displays glassy dynamics at finite temperature. We trace the
origin of both the slow quantum dynamics and the classical glassiness to the
presence of large, non-local symmetry operators. Our work establishes a novel
connection between quantum entanglement dynamics and classical glassy behavior,
offering a new geometric perspective on entanglement phase transitions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Analyzing the impact of noise is of fundamental importance to understand the
advantages provided by quantum systems. While the classical simulability of
noisy discrete-variable systems is increasingly well understood, noisy bosonic
circuits are more challenging to simulate and analyze. Here, we address this
gap by introducing the $\textit{displacement propagation}$ algorithm, a
continuous-variable analogue of Pauli propagation for simulating noisy bosonic
circuits. By exploring the interplay of noise and quantum resources, we
identify several computational phase transitions, revealing regimes where even
modest noise levels render bosonic circuits efficiently classically simulable.
In particular, our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: computational
resources usually associated with bosonic quantum advantage, namely
non-Gaussianity and symplectic coherence, can make the system easier to
classically simulate in presence of noise.

Abstract: Despite extensive study, our understanding of quantum Markov chains remains
far less complete than that of their classical counterparts. [Temme'13]
observed that the Davies Lindbladian, a well-studied model of quantum Markov
dynamics, contains an embedded classical Markov generator, raising the natural
question of how the convergence properties of the quantum and classical
dynamics are related. While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the
Davies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical
generator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the
spectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then
the two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a
large class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed
Hamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains
within a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with
physical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain
techniques to the quantum setting.
  The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the
Davies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the
Hamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded
in terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient.
Thus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full
Davies generator.

Abstract: We introduce transversal dimension jump, a code-switching protocol for lifted
product (LP) quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes across different
chain-complex dimensions, enabling universal fault-tolerant quantum computation
with low overhead. The construction leverages the product structure of LP codes
to implement one-way transversal CNOTs between a 3D code and its 2D component
codes, enabling teleportation-based switching. Combined with constant-depth CCZ
gates in 3D LP codes and low-overhead transversal Clifford gates in 2D LP
codes, this yields universal, high-rate quantum logical computation with high
thresholds and low space-time costs. Beyond asymptotic schemes, we identify
explicit 3D-2D LP code pairs supporting cup-product CCZ gates, including
bivariate tricycle-bicycle families such as the $[[81,3,5]]$-$[[54,2,6]]$ pair,
where the 3D tricycle codes admit depth-2 CCZ, weight-6 stabilizers, and
pseudo-thresholds $\gtrsim 0.4\%$. As a byproduct, we show that the 3D codes
enable highly efficient magic-state preparation: a single round of stabilizer
measurements followed by depth-2 CCZ and postselection produces states with
error $<10^{-9}$ and success probability $\sim 35\%$. Our results establish a
native integration of qLDPC codes with complementary transversal gates-covering
nearly all practically relevant families known so far-and open a broad design
space for scalable, low-overhead universal quantum computation.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive end-to-end quantum algorithm for tensor problems,
including tensor PCA and planted kXOR, that achieves potential superquadratic
quantum speedups over classical methods. We build upon prior works by
Hastings~(\textit{Quantum}, 2020) and Schmidhuber~\textit{et
al.}~(\textit{Phys.~Rev.~X.}, 2025), we address key limitations by introducing
a native qubit-based encoding for the Kikuchi method, enabling explicit quantum
circuit constructions and non-asymptotic resource estimation. Our approach
substantially reduces constant overheads through a novel guiding state
preparation technique as well as circuit optimizations, reducing the threshold
for a quantum advantage. We further extend the algorithmic framework to support
recovery in sparse tensor PCA and tensor completion, and generalize detection
to asymmetric tensors, demonstrating that the quantum advantage persists in
these broader settings. Detailed resource estimates show that 900 logical
qubits, $\sim 10^{15}$ gates and $\sim 10^{12}$ gate depth suffice for a
problem that classically requires $\sim 10^{23}$ FLOPs. The gate count and
depth for the same problem without the improvements presented in this paper
would be at least $10^{19}$ and $10^{18}$ respectively. These advances position
tensor problems as a candidate for quantum advantage whose resource
requirements benefit significantly from algorithmic and compilation
improvements; the magnitude of the improvements suggest that further
enhancements are possible, which would make the algorithm viable for upcoming
fault-tolerant quantum hardware.

Abstract: Preparing symmetry-adapted initial states is a principal bottleneck in
first-quantized quantum simulation. We present a universal approach that
efficiently maps any polynomial-size superposition of occupation-number
configurations to the first-quantized representation on a digital quantum
computer. The method exploits the Jordan--Schwinger Lie algebra homomorphism,
which identifies number-conserving second-quantized operators with their
first-quantized action and induces an equivariant bijection between Fock
occupations and $\mathfrak{su}(d)$ weight states within the Schur--Weyl
decomposition. Operationally, we prepare an encoded superposition of Schur
labels via a block-encoded linear combination of unitaries and then apply the
inverse quantum Schur transform. The algorithm runs in time $\text{poly}(L, N,
d, \log \epsilon^{-1})$ for $L$ configurations of $N$ particles over $d$ modes
to accuracy $\epsilon$, and applies universally to fermions, bosons, and
Green's paraparticles in arbitrary single-particle bases. Resource estimates
indicate practicality within leading first-quantized pipelines;

Abstract: Topology optimization is a key methodology in engineering design for finding
efficient and robust structures. Due to the enormous size of the design space,
evaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work,
we present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology
optimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the
design space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional
Messerschmitt-B\"olkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design
variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as
a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within
Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method
(FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the
stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix
inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete
algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit
simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the
compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in
polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's
quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the
proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the
field of computational science and engineering.

Abstract: The presence of energy barriers in the state space of a physical system can
lead to exponentially slow convergence for sampling algorithms like Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In the classical setting, replica exchange (or
parallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these
scenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a
similar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time
of quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue
of the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of
two replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of
Hamiltonians with local energy barriers. Our main result provides a rigorous
lower bound on the spectral gap of the combined system's Lindbladian, which
leads to an exponential improvement in spectral gap with respect to the barrier
height. We showcase the applicability of our method with several examples,
including the defected 1D Ising model at arbitrary constant temperature, and
defected non-commuting local Hamiltonians at high temperature. Our work
provides a rigorous acceleration mechanism for quantum Gibbs preparation.

Abstract: Unambiguous measurements play an important role in quantum information, with
applications ranging from quantum key distribution to quantum state
reconstruction. Recently, such measurements have also been used in quantum
algorithms based on Regev's reduction. The key problem for these algorithms is
the S-LWE problem for lattice problems, or the Quantum Decoding Problem for
code problems. A key idea for addressing this problem is to use unambiguous
measurements to recover $k$ coordinates of a code (or lattice) element $x$ from
a quantum state $|\psi_x\rangle$, which corresponds to a noisy word $x$ with
errors in quantum superposition. However, a general theoretical framework to
analyze this approach has been lacking.
  In this work, we introduce the notion of fine-grained unambiguous
measurements. Given a family of states
$\{\,|\psi_x\rangle\,\}_{x\in\{0,1\}^n}$, we ask whether there exist
measurements that can return, with certainty, $k$ bits of information about
$x$. We study this question in the setting of symmetric states, which naturally
arises in the Quantum Decoding Problem. We show that determining the maximal
number of parities that a measurement can output can be formulated as a linear
program, and we use its dual formulation to derive several upper bounds. In
particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
of fine-grained unambiguous measurements and prove impossibility results
showing, in particular, that such measurements cannot improve upon the approach
of arXiv:2310.20651. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for
the Quantum Decoding Problem.

TL;DR: The paper examines Gaussianity testing in continuous-variable quantum systems, proving that a constant number of copies is sufficient to determine pure Gaussian states, while mixed states require exponentially more samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian states are a fundamental class of quantum states with broad applications. Efficiently testing their Gaussianity is crucial for quantum technologies and learning theory.

Method: The authors employ representation theory and quantum learning theory, leveraging rotation-invariant symmetries and CV trace-distance bounds to analyze performance.

Result: For pure states, constant copies suffice. For mixed states, exponentially many samples are required.

Conclusion: This work establishes fundamental limits for Gaussianity testing, distinguishing pure and mixed states in terms of sample complexity.

Abstract: Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of
continuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical
systems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a
fundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we
efficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the
perspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory,
characterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of
the number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of
copies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then
extend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies
suffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are
far. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states
necessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a
fundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on
rotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently
introduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the neutron capture reactions responsible for heavy element synthesis. It highlights the role of 22Ne({α},n)25Mg as a neutron source, with challenges in its cross-section measurement in the relevant energy range. The SHADES project aims to provide direct cross-section data using the LUNA-MV accelerator, leveraging high sensitivity and a low-background environment to improve sensitivity significantly. The presentation includes an overview of the project and initial setup characterization results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy elements play a critical role in stellar nucleosynthesis, and understanding neutron capture processes, particularly their cross-sections, is essential for astrophysical models. The 22Ne({α},n)25Mg reaction is pivotal but understudied in the 450-750 keV energy range, necessitating this project to reduce uncertainties and advance astrophysics.

Method: The SHADES project employs the LUNA-MV accelerator to conduct high-sensitivity measurements. It utilizes a hybrid neutron detector with enhanced sensitivity in a low-background environment combined with high beam current to achieve significant sensitivity improvements over existing methods.

Result: Preliminary results from the project include detailed setup characterization of the neutron detector and initial sensitivity assessments. The enhanced sensitivity is expected to provide direct cross-section data, reducing uncertainties in relevant resonance parameters and advancing our understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis.

Conclusion: The SHADES project successfully plans to achieve significant sensitivity improvements using the LUNA-MV accelerator, addressing key gaps in measuring the low-energy cross-section of 22Ne({α},n)25Mg. This work represents a substantial step forward in determining neutron capture rates relevant to heavy element synthesis.

Abstract: Neutron capture reactions are the main contributors to the synthesis of the
heavy elements through the s-process. Together with $^{13}$C($\alpha$,n)16O,
which has recently been measured by the LUNA collaboration in an energy region
inside the Gamow peak, 22Ne({\alpha},n)25Mg is the other main neutron source in
stars. Its cross section is mostly unknown in the relevant stellar energy (450
keV < Ecm < 750 keV), where only upper limits from direct experiments and
highly uncertain estimates from indirect sources exist. The ERC project SHADES
(UniNa/INFN) aims to provide for the first time direct cross section data in
this region and to reduce the uncertainties of higher energy resonance
parameters. High sensitivity measurements will be performed with the new
LUNA-MV accelerator at the INFN-LNGS laboratory in Italy: the energy
sensitivity of the SHADES hybrid neutron detector, together with the low
background environment of the LNGS and the high beam current of the new
accelerator promises to improve the sensitivity by over 2 orders of magnitude
over the state of the art, allowing to finally probe the unexplored low-energy
cross section. Here we present an overview of the project and first results on
the setup characterization.

Motivation: 研究高压核反应在恒星和星系中的作用及其核反应截面测量难度，特别是在高温条件下，探测器技术和屏蔽技术的改进对于减少背景 noise至关重要。

Method: 通过改进 LUNA 的探测器和屏蔽系统，如使用更好材料或更精确的几何设计来增强探测器的敏感度，并进行实验测试和数据分析来优化设计。

Result: 改进后的探测器和屏蔽系统显著降低了 cosmic background，提高了测量精度和信号检测能力。

Conclusion: LUNA 的改进技术将为核 astrophysics 实验提供了更好的技术基础，使得精确测量高能量核反应的截面成为可能。

Abstract: Nuclear reactions are responsible for the chemical evolution of stars,
galaxies and the Universe. Unfortunately, at temperatures of interest for
nuclear astrophysics, the cross-sections of the thermonuclear reactions are in
the pico-femto-barn range and thus measuring them in the laboratory is
extremely challenging. In this framework, major steps forward were made with
the advent of underground nuclear astrophysics, pioneered by the Laboratory for
Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA). The cosmic background reduction by
several orders of magnitude obtained at LUNA, however, needs to be combined
with high-performance detectors and dedicated shieldings to obtain the required
sensitivity. In the present paper, we report on the recent and future
detector-shielding designs at LUNA.

Abstract: We report the construction and commissioning of a new ultracold neutron (UCN)
guide-coating facility at the University of Winnipeg. The facility employs
pulsed laser deposition (PLD) to produce diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on
cylindrical UCN guides up to 1 m in length with a 200 mm outer diameter. DLC is
a promising material for UCN transport and storage due to its high Fermi
potential, low neutron absorption, and low depolarization probabilities. First
coating attempts on a full length aluminum UCN guide were successfully coated
with densities of 2.2-2.3 g/cm$^3$, corresponding to Fermi potentials of
198-207 neV as measured by X-ray reflectometry (XRR). Coating thicknesses were
measured to be 90-180 nm with no evidence of delamination. These results
establish the coating facility. Ongoing and future work focuses on improving
the diamond content of films through plasma plume collimation, substrate
biasing, and pre/post treatment methods with the goal of providing high quality
DLC UCN guides for the TUCAN experiment at TRIUMF.

Abstract: The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment aims to detect rare interactions between dark
matter particles and xenon. Although the detector is designed to be the most
sensitive to GeV/$c^2$--TeV/$c^2$ Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs),
it is also capable of measuring low-energy ionization signals down to a single
electron that may be produced by scatters of sub-GeV/$c^2$ dark matter. The
major challenge in exploiting this sensitivity is to understand and suppress
the ionization background in the few-electron regime. We report a
characterization of the delayed electron backgrounds following energy
depositions in the LZ detector under different detector conditions. In
addition, we quantify the probability for photons to be emitted in coincidence
with electron emission from the high voltage grids. We then demonstrate that
spontaneous grid electron emission can be identified and rejected with a high
efficiency using a coincident photon tag, which provides a tool to improve the
sensitivity of future dark matter searches.

Abstract: The use of probabilistic spintronic devices for infrared radiation detection
has introduced a shift in approach to thermal imaging. The integration of
probabilistic magnetic tunnel junctions with infrared plasmonic nano-antennas
achieves high-sensitivity digital-mode infrared sensors at room temperature.
Here, we present a scalable approach towards multipixel plasmonic-spintronic
bolometer array fabrication and readout. We fabricate proof-of-concept 2x2
row-column multiplexed probabilistic plasmonic sprintronic arrays and show
their response to long-wave infrared radiation (8-14um) with high readout
speeds (10K-1M counts per second). These spintronic, ultrafast, nanoscale (SUN)
bolometers can result in novel high-pixel density CMOS compatible infrared
detection platforms. Our work provides a broadband (9kHz to 3GHz) readout
platform for future digital probabilistic detector applications. Furthermore,
our approach addresses a key challenge associated with scaling infrared pixel
sizes that can drive progress towards high pixel density detector arrays for
infrared sensing and microscopy applications.

Abstract: Pixel tracking detectors at upcoming collider experiments will see
unprecedented charged-particle densities. Real-time data reduction on the
detector will enable higher granularity and faster readout, possibly enabling
the use of the pixel detector in the first level of the trigger for a hadron
collider. This data reduction can be accomplished with a neural network (NN) in
the readout chip bonded with the sensor that recognizes and rejects tracks with
low transverse momentum (p$_T$) based on the geometrical shape of the charge
deposition (``cluster''). To design a viable detector for deployment at an
experiment, the dependence of the NN as a function of the sensor geometry,
external magnetic field, and irradiation must be understood. In this paper, we
present first studies of the efficiency and data reduction for planar pixel
sensors exploring these parameters. A smaller sensor pitch in the bending
direction improves the p$_T$ discrimination, but a larger pitch can be
partially compensated with detector depth. An external magnetic field parallel
to the sensor plane induces Lorentz drift of the electron-hole pairs produced
by the charged particle, broadening the cluster and improving the network
performance. The absence of the external field diminishes the background
rejection compared to the baseline by $\mathcal{O}$(10%). Any accumulated
radiation damage also changes the cluster shape, reducing the signal efficiency
compared to the baseline by $\sim$ 30 - 60%, but nearly all of the performance
can be recovered through retraining of the network and updating the weights.
Finally, the impact of noise was investigated, and retraining the network on
noise-injected datasets was found to maintain performance within 6% of the
baseline network trained and evaluated on noiseless data.

Abstract: The Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX) is an upgrade of the Columbia
Non-neutral Torus (CNT) that aims to demonstrate a university-scale,
quasi-axisymmetric stellarator using high-temperature superconducting (HTS)
technology at an on-axis magnetic field target of 0.5 T. Due to the strain
sensitivity of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxides), adapting it to
non-planar stellarator geometries requires new winding, structural, and cooling
strategies. We report on the results of a staged prototype program (P1, P2, P3)
employing 3D-printed, sectional aluminum coil frames with winding channels,
gimballed constant-tension winding mechanics, and solder potting for radial
current redistribution and passive quench mitigation. The first prototype, P1
(planar elliptical, double-pancake) tested additive manufacture, sectional
joining and baseline winding, achieving predicted fields at 77 K. P2
(non-planar, higher strain) was wound to 42 turns, energized at 30-40 K to
produce expected magnetic fields, and studied thermal gradients and resistance
at up to 4.5 kAt. Design evolution in P3 introduces concave geometry with dual
double-pancakes, 200 turns, and approaches the 70 kAt target at 20 K. In
parallel, sub-microhm lap joints have been developed. Together, these results
de-risk manufacturing, cooling interfaces, quench management, and diagnostics,
paving the way for full-size non-planar HTS stellarator coils for CSX.

TL;DR: This study explores the use of a liquid scintillator synthesized in a non-acidic environment to improve future neutrinoless double beta decay searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop a high-performance liquid scintillator for neutrinoless double beta decay searches, focusing on reducing dependence on water

Method: Through a water-free synthesis method using 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene-based liquid scintillator loaded with Te-diols in a non-acidic environment at room temperature

Result: The researchers demonstrated a nearly unchanged emission spectrum and transmission characteristics even at high Te-diols concentrations. The light yield reduction is moderate at 1% loading, and the time profile of light emission becomes faster with increasing Te-diols concentration

Conclusion: The research validates the effectiveness of the new synthesis method to achieve water-free, high-performance liquid scintillator suitable for next-generation neutrino detectors.

Abstract: One of the most promising approaches for future neutrinoless double beta
decay searches is to incorporate a candidate isotope into the liquid
scintillator of a next-generation neutrino detector. In this study, a sample of
the high-performance 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene-based liquid scintillator from the
Borexino detector was loaded with different concentrations of Te-diols.
Therefore,a novel and completely water-free synthesis in a non-acidic organic
environment at room temperature was used. Key parameters of the loaded samples
were analyzed and compared with those of the pure Borexino liquid. Both the
emission spectrum and transmission remained nearly unchanged,even at high
doping levels. The reduction in light yield was moderate, with approximately
8,400 photons emitted for a 1 MeV energy deposition by an electron at 1$\%$
tellurium loading. The time profile of the light emission induced by alpha
particles was also investigated, revealing that the scintillation response
becomes significantly faster with increasing tellurium concentration.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Among the fundamental symmetry classes of quantum chaotic systems in Dyson's
threefold way, the symplectic class is rarely observed in nature. Characterized
by the strongest possible level repulsion in the energy spectrum, the
symplectic symmetry class also implies a double (Kramers) degeneracy of levels.
Studying the spectral statistics of three quantum particles (identical bosons
or mass-imbalanced fermions) in a harmonic trap, we find numerical evidence for
strong level repulsion in the regime of weak contact interactions. While the
statistical indicators are consistent with quantum chaos in systems with
symplectic symmetry, the absence of Kramers degeneracy rules out this symmetry.
In the strongly-interacting unitary limit either Poissonian or stick statistics
are observed (depending on commensurability of the mass ratio) indicating
regular dynamics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Forecasting complex, chaotic signals is a central challenge across science
and technology, with implications ranging from secure communications to climate
modeling. Here we demonstrate that magnons - the collective spin excitations in
magnetically ordered materials - can serve as an efficient physical reservoir
for predicting such dynamics. Using a magnetic microdisk in the vortex state as
a magnon-scattering reservoir, we show that intrinsic nonlinear interactions
transform a simple microwave input into a high-dimensional spectral output
suitable for reservoir computing, in particular, for time series predictions.
Trained on the Mackey-Glass benchmark, which generates a cyclic yet aperiodic
time series widely used to test machine-learning models, the system achieves
accurate and reliable predictions that rival state-of-the-art physical
reservoirs. We further identify key design principles: spectral resolution
governs the trade-off between dimensionality and accuracy, while combining
multiple device geometries systematically improves performance. These results
establish magnonics as a promising platform for unconventional computing,
offering a path toward scalable and CMOS-compatible hardware for real-time
prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Molecules provide the smallest possible circuits in which quantum
interference and electron correlation can be engineered to perform logical
operations, including the universal NAND gate. We investigate a chemically
encoded quantum NAND tree based on alkynyl-extended iso-polyacetylene
backbones, where inputs are set by end-group substitution and outputs are read
from the presence or absence of transmission nodes. Using quantum many-body
transport theory, we show that NAND behavior persists in the presence of
dynamic correlations, but that the nodal positions and their chemical shifts
depend sensitively on electron-electron interactions. This sensitivity
highlights the potential of these systems not only to probe the strength of
electronic correlations but also to harness them in shaping logical response.
The thermopower is identified as a chemically robust readout of gate logic,
providing discrimination margins that greatly exceed typical experimental
uncertainties, in an observable governed primarily by the variation of
transport rather than its absolute magnitude.

Abstract: We establish a steady-state theory for nonlinear optical conductivity in
pseudo-Hermitian systems. We derive compact formulas for the first and second
order conductivity tensors in both the velocity and length gauges and prove
their exact equivalence through generalized sum rules and Berry connection
identities by formulating the nonlinear response in terms of a biorthogonal
density matrix. Utilizing the formalism on parity-time symmetric two-level
systems reveals nonlinear phenomena that are not present in Hermitian systems,
such as extra terms in the conductivity, corrections to the velocity operator,
photocurrent, and resonance structures with higher-order poles at one-photon
transitions. These features yield qualitatively distinct harmonic generation
responses like real second-order conductivities and nonzero DC limits. These
results provide new insights into nonlinear light-matter interactions in active
media characterized by balanced gain and loss, with implications for
non-Hermitian photonics, dissipative topological systems, and quantum devices
designed with engineered dissipation.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semi-Dirac materials feature a unique anisotropic band
structure characterized by quadratic dispersion along one spatial direction and
linear dispersion along the other, effectively hybridizing ordinary and Dirac
fermions. The anisotropy of energy dispersion can be further modulated through
band tilting along either spatial direction of the wave vector. We propose a
new definition of tilt parameter to characterize Lifshitz phases in 2D
semi-Dirac bands tilting along the quadratically dispersing direction. Using
linear response theory, we theoretically investigate the interband optical
conductivity of 2D tilted semi-Dirac bands. Our analytical zero-temperature
results reveal pronounced distinctions from Dirac and semi-Dirac systems
tilting along the linearly dispersing direction. Notably, we find that spectral
fixed point emerges in the optical conductivity over a specific range of the
tilt parameter, a phenomenon explained by the corresponding behavior of the
joint density of states. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework
for identifying and characterizing 2D tilted semi-Dirac materials and establish
clear spectral fingerprints that distinguish different kinds of 2D semi-Dirac
bands and Dirac bands. Our predictions can guide future experimental studies of
anisotropic band engineering and tilt-dependent phenomena.

Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken
crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection
beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl
semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from
competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric (PTE) mechanisms, whose
intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly
resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic
contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast
optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and
reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below
150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises
from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons
and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in
symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing
photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast
optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: In a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a periodic lateral superlattice
subjected to an external homogeneous magnetic field and in a cylindrical
far-infrared photon cavity we search for effects of broken symmetries: Static
ones, stemming from the unit cell of the system, and the external magnetic
field together with the dynamic ones caused by the vector potential of the
cavity promoting magnetic types of transitions, and the chirality of the
excitation pulse. The Coulomb interaction of the electrons is described within
density functional theory, but the electron-photon interactions are handled by
a configuration interaction formalism within each step of the density
functional approach, both for the static and the dynamic system. In the
dynamical calculations we observe weak chiral effects that change character as
the strength of the electron-photon interaction and the external magnetic field
are increased. From the analysis of the chiral effects we identify an important
connection of the para- and diamagnetic electron-photon interactions that
promotes the diamagnetic interaction in the present system when the interaction
strength is increased. Furthermore, the asymmetric potential in the unit cell
of the square array activates collective oscillation modes that are not present
in the system when the unit cell has a higher symmetry.

Conclusion: 工作将平均场理论与量子几何联系起来，并将其与非相互作用型拓扑带理论直接联系，提供了新的研究视角和方法。

Abstract: We study the magnetic-field response of interacting electron systems within
mean-field theory using perturbation theory. We show that the linear response
of the mean-field density-matrix to a weak magnetic field is purely geometric:
it depends only on wavefunction derivatives, the Berry connections linking the
occupied and unoccupied subspaces, and is independent of the interaction
potential and the quasiparticle dispersion. This leads to compact,
gauge-invariant projector expressions for both the St\v{r}eda formula and the
formula for orbital magnetization. Our calculation explicitly elucidates the
role of exchange and self-consistency in defining current vertices for orbital
magnetization calculations. Our work establishes a direct connection between
mean-field theory, quantum geometry and the non-interacting topological band
theory.

Abstract: Thermal gradient driven skyrmion dynamics offers a promising route toward
green spintronics, enabling the utilization of waste heat for information
transport and processing. Using micromagnetic simulations, we investigate Neel
skyrmions in a Co-Pt bilayer nanoracetrack and demonstrate that stochastic
torques induced by a thermal gradient drive skyrmion motion toward the hotter
region with a nearly vanishing Hall angle. The dynamics depends sensitively on
intrinsic material parameters - the skyrmion velocity decreases with increasing
damping constant, increases with stronger thermal gradients, and varies
systematically with saturation magnetization, interfacial DMI strength, and
uniaxial out of plane anisotropy. Importantly, we identify a specific range of
material parameters within which the skyrmion velocity changes sharply while
the Hall angle remains strongly suppressed, saturating near zero. This
comprehensive parameter-dependent study establishes a universal design
framework for minimizing the Hall effect in thermal gradient driven spintronic
systems.

Abstract: By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we
construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one
dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of
single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation
number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square
matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same
as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the
Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the
thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of
noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to
spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart
of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the
topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished
by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了非厄米系统中的拓扑理解，为广义能带结构和相关拓扑不变量的系统性研究开辟新途径。

Abstract: The generalized Brillouin zones (GBZs) are integral in the analysis of
non-Hermitian band structures. Conventional wisdom suggests that the GBZ should
be connected, where each point can be indexed by the real part of the
wavevector, similar to the Brillouin zone. Here we demonstrate rich topological
features of the GBZs in generic non-Hermitian one-dimensional models. We prove
and discuss a set of sufficient conditions for the model to ensure the
connectivity of its GBZ. In addition, we show that the GBZ can become
disconnected and have more connected components than the number of bands, which
results from the point-gap features of the band structure. This novel GBZ
topology is applied to further demonstrate a counterintuitive effect, where the
line gap of an open-boundary spectrum with sublattice symmetry may be closed
without changing its point-gap topology. Our results challenge the current
understanding of bands and gaps in non-Hermitian systems and highlight the need
to further investigate the topological effects associated with the GBZ
including topological invariants and open-boundary braiding.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the Euclidean two-point function of an appropriately

hole. This detection, which requires a tuned, state-dependent choice of probe,
is the result of a new gravitational saddle, which dominates over the usual
saddles. The gravitational result can be explicitly reproduced in the dual
boundary CFT if we assume the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We also
discuss a binary search protocol to detect the black hole microstate from a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given two otherwise decoupled $D$-dimensional CFTs which possess a common
(finite) symmetry subcategory, one can consider entangled boundary states of
their $(D+1)$-dimensional SymTFTs. This roughly corresponds to performing a
gauging of the tensor product of two CFTs, and we call this phenomena ``SymTFT
entanglement" (or ``S-entanglement" for short). In the case when these CFTs
have semiclassical holographic duals, the S-entanglement relates the bulk gauge
charges between two otherwise disconnected AdS spacetimes as we highlight in
several top-down examples. We show that taking partial traces of such
S-entangled states leads to a streamlined approach to preparing
ensemble-averaged CFTs in string theory. This ensemble averaging coincides with
that generated by $\alpha$-states in the baby universe Hilbert space, and we
propose a symmetry-enriched generalization of this Hilbert space via
generalized global symmetries. We quantify how this symmetry-governed averaging
violates holographic factorization and leads to the emergence of bulk global
symmetries. We also consider the eternal (two-sided) AdS black hole geometries,
where our SymTFT entanglement considerations imply that there exist refinements
of the usual theromofield double state preparation of the system. We show that
one may prepare the system in such a way that the total CFT data does not
factorize into left and right copies. As anticipated by Marolf and Wall
\cite{Marolf:2012xe}, we highlight that such considerations are necessary to
define the gauge charges of eternal black holes, and in certain cases, can
imply that there exist extended bulk objects stretching across the wormhole
which cannot be expressed in terms of a product of left and right CFT
operators.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A robust numerical method for calculating intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in high-dimensional systems is introduced. The method, based on the multiple shooting technique, solves upward flow equations from saddle points to determine the signs of intersection numbers. It demonstrates stable performance, tested on systems with up to 20 variables, and can be extended using quadruple-precision arithmetic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address the challenge of computing intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in multivariable settings, which are difficult due to oscillatory integrals. This is particularly relevant in theoretical physics, such as in real-time path integrals that are essential for understanding quantum systems.

Method: The method employs the multiple shooting method to solve upward flow equations from saddle points to the original integration cycle. This approach not only calculates the intersection numbers but also determines their signs.

### [145] [Dynamics of Cosmic Superstrings and the Overshoot Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06359)
*Luca Brunelli,Michele Cicoli,Francisco Gil Pedro*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Dynamical systems techniques are used to study the evolution of cosmic strings, considering a potential for the volume modulus and analyzing the overshoot problem. The inclusion of strings from NS5-branes stabilizes the modulus in late time, and the energy density of cosmic superstrings could produce detectable gravitational waves. No efficient resonant enhancement of cosmic superstrings is found.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of cosmic strings and their impact on the early universe is crucial for cosmology and string theory.

Method: Dynamical systems techniques and analysis of the volume modulus potential with energy transfer between the modulus and effective strings.

Result: Stabilization of the modulus in late time with strings from NS5-branes, possible detectable gravitational waves from cosmic superstrings, no efficient resonant enhancement.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the understanding of cosmic string dynamics and potential observational signatures.

Abstract: We exploit the techniques of dynamical systems to study the cosmological
evolution of cosmic fundamental strings and effective strings arising from
branes wrapped on internal cycles. We also include the whole potential of the
volume modulus characterised by an early time run-away towards a late time
minimum. We analyse the overshoot problem with and without radiation, and find
that the presence of an initial population of strings arising from NS5-branes
wrapped around 4-cycles is enough to ensure that the modulus stabilises in its
late time minimum, even in the absence of radiation. The reason is the transfer
of energy between the modulus and the effective strings caused by the fact that
their tension depends on the volume modulus. Interestingly, we find that the
energy density of cosmic superstrings is generically very large when the
modulus is oscillating around its minimum, opening up the possibility of a
detectable gravitational wave signal. We also find no evidence of an efficient
resonant enhancement of cosmic superstrings due to an oscillating tension in
the late time minimum.

Abstract: We examine the behavior of sequences of states in the large $N$ limit of
AdS/CFT duality in cases in which the bulk duals involve baby universes or
black holes. Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under
suitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can
converge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black
holes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do
not converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit
large $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to
convergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial
commutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby
universe.

Abstract: To satisfy the Cardy formula for Warped AdS$_3$ (WAdS$_{3}$) solutions in a

\cite{Aggarwal:2020igb}. In this paper, these boundary conditions have been
investigated in the three-dimensional new massive gravity (NMG) framework. The
associated solution space, asymptotic symmetries, and charge algebra have been
extracted. It has been shown that the surface charges are finite, but not
integrable, and the integrability of the charges is obtained after restricting
to a sub-sector of the original solution space. Finally, we have proved that
the Cardy formula reproduces the thermodynamic entropy of a warped BTZ black

*Meng-Sen Ma,Yun He,Xiao-Ming Wang,Huai-Fan Li*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper investigates the thermodynamic properties of a regular Bardeen-AdS black hole obtained by modifying a singular 'mother' black hole, which eliminates the singularity but disrupts standard black hole thermodynamics. The analysis reveals similarities and differences in phase transitions and Gibbs free energy behavior between the Bardeen-AdS and RN-AdS black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of black hole thermodynamics is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of gravitational theories, particularly in the context of modifications to Einstein's equations such as the addition of a Born-Infeld term in the Bardeen model.

Method: The authors employ a detailed thermodynamic analysis, examining the heat capacity, free energy, and phase transitions of the black hole solutions. They use methods from differential geometry and statistical mechanics to derive the thermodynamic properties and identify phase transitions.

Result: The Bardeen-AdS black hole exhibits $P-V$ criticalities akin to the RN-AdS black hole but shows distinct behaviors in its Gibbs free energy. Specifically, the 'swallow-tail' structure typical of first-order phase transitions in the RN-AdS case is absent. Instead, the free energy landscape displays an '8-shaped' or 'c-shaped' structure, indicating first-order or zeroth-order phase transitions between small and large black hole phases, respectively.

Conclusion: The constraint-induced modifications to the thermodynamic phase space of the Bardeen-AdS black hole lead to new critical behaviors, suggesting that such modifications can have profound implications for the thermodynamic properties of black holes in modified gravitational theories.

Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic properties of the regular Bardeen-AdS black hole
obtained by imposing an additional constraint on a singular "mother" black
hole. This constraint eliminates the physical singularity but leads to the
breakdown of the standard first law of black hole thermodynamics. The singular
black hole exhibits a reentrant phase transition similar to that of the
higher-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole. The Bardeen-AdS black hole exhibits
$P-V$ criticalities similar to that of the RN-AdS black hole, however has
striking differences in its Gibbs free energy behavior. In particular, the
characteristic "swallow-tail" structure associated with first-order phase
transitions disappears. Instead, an "8-shaped" or "c-shaped" structure occurs,
signifying a first-order phase transition or a zeroth-order phase transition
between the small black hole and the large black hole phases, respectively. Our
analysis suggests that constraint-induced modifications in the thermodynamic
phase space may have deep consequences for the critical behaviors of black
holes.

### [149] [Bootstrapping Yang-Mills matrix integrals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06704)
*Wenliang Li,Xinran Su*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper applies bootstrap methods to study the large N limit of bosonic D-matrix Yang-Mills integrals in various dimensions and cutoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of understanding the behavior of Yang-Mills integrals in different dimensions and under different boundary conditions, using a systematic approach with bootstrap methods.

Method: The study employs two complementary bootstrap strategies: one that posits bounds for specific correlation functions ⟨trXX⟩ and ⟨trXXXX⟩ at varying cutoff lengths L_max, and another that deduces analytic expressions for eigenvalue distributions and trajectories in the large D limit, then extrapolates these to finite D through ansatz.

Result: For D=3, isolated regions (indicative of unique solutions or critical points) were not observed even at the largest cutoff of L_max=12. However, as the dimension D increases, starting from D=4, the search for isolated regions becomes feasible even at L_max=8, with the solution space narrowing down as L_max is increased. The precision of these findings is comparable to that achievable through Monte Carlo simulations. For a given L_max, the solution space decreases with increasing D and converges to results predicted by the large D expansion analysis.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed numerical characterization of Yang-Mills integrals in higher dimensions, revealing a transition in the structure of solutions at higher D. The observed convergence towards analytical large D estimates offers a promising framework for further theoretical exploration.

Abstract: We revisit the large $N$ limit of bosonic $D$-matrix Yang-Mills integrals
using two complementary bootstrap methods. In the positivity bootstrap, we
obtain bounds for $\langle \text{tr}\, XX \rangle$ and $\langle \text{tr}\,
XXXX \rangle$ at various length cutoff $L_{\max}$. For $D=3$, we do not find an
isolated region until $L_{\max}=12$. For larger $D$, the allowed regions become
islands at $L_{\max}=8$ and shrink rapidly as $L_{\max}$ increases. The
precision of some $L_{\max}=12$ islands is comparable to that of Monte Carlo
estimates. For a fixed $L_{\max}$, the allowed region also shrinks with $D$ and
converges to the large $D$ expansion results. We further deduce the analytic
expressions of various types of trajectories and eigenvalue distributions at
large $D$. Based on these explicit formulas, we propose some ansatz for the
analytic trajectory bootstrap and obtain accurate results for finite $D$.

Abstract: Microscopic charged black holes can provide possibilities to test the
consistency of the effective field theory (EFT) corrections to Einstein-Maxwell
theory. A particularly interesting result is fixing the sign of a certain
combination of EFT couplings from the requirement that all charged black holes
should be able to evaporate (Weak Gravity Conjecture). In our work, we analysed
the EFT corrections to a set of zero-damping quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the
scalar wave probe in a nearly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We
review the duality of this setup to the problem of the quantum Seiberg-Witten
curve of $N=2$ Super-Yang-Mills theory with three flavors. We provide an
analytic result for the EFT corrections to the QNMs obtained from the
quantization condition imposed on the Seiberg-Witten cycle. Our main result is
that the causality requirement of the gravitational theory formulated for the
QNMs translates to the same condition on EFT couplings as the one appearing in
the Weak Gravity Conjecture.

Abstract: We consider a classical field in square torsion theory as a source of torsion
for a quantum fermion field in FLRW metric. In the framework of QFT, we obtain
vacuum contributions to the energy-momentum tensor and to the axial current
that modify the dynamics of the classical field and the field equations as
back-reaction. These contributions lead to a modified classical field and
therefore to a modified torsion term $L^\mu$ and expectation value of
energy-momentum tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$ on the quantum vacuum, altering the field
equations in an interative process. We consider the first step of this process
and we find that the vacuum condensate could affect the inflationary phase of
the Universe. Higher order terms could impact the dark Universe.

applying the method of null reduction leads to a Carrollian action in one lower
spacetime dimensions. We also identify the correct light-cone definitions of
the symmetry generators and their dynamical forms in terms of the fields and
take the $c\rightarrow0$ limit. It is observed that these generators produces

TL;DR: 研究了超对称缺陷 CFT 中defect 对应函数的普适性特征，重点分析了四点函数的位移超乘法器。通过在强耦合条件下扰动基本阶的对位函数，识别出次阶条件下的算子交换子。我们发现，同一超位移成分的四点函数只能受到同一类多粒子算子的影响，从而建立了不同理论中defect 插入物的等效性。通过 $rac{1}{2}$ BPS线 $rac{1}{4}$ N SYM、$rac{1}{2}$ N 超致因理论及 ABJM 理论等多个例子，验证了这一结论直至首阶次强耦合展开。随后，分析了 3d $rac{1}{2}$ N Chern-Simons-物质理论中 $rac{1}{2}$ BPS 轮廓线的四点函数，确定了缺陷代数及其位移超乘法器。利用普适性，提取了缺陷操作者的四点函数并在一阶次强耦合下得到了共形数据。最后，对 ABJM 中 $rac{1}{3}$ BPS 轮廓线提出了强耦合下的初步分析。

Abstract: We study universal features of defect correlation functions in supersymmetric
defect CFTs, focusing on four-point functions of the displacement
supermultiplet. By perturbing the leading-order correlators at strong coupling,
we identify constraints on the operators exchanged at next-to-leading order. We
then discuss the conditions under which correlation functions of identical
superdisplacement components receive contributions only from multiparticle
operators built from the same components. This leads to the equivalence between
four-point functions of defect insertions across different theories,
establishing universality. We confirm these features in examples including the
$1/2$ BPS line in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories and ABJM,
up to the first subleading order in the strong-coupling expansion. We then
analyze the $1/2$ BPS Wilson line in 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons matter
theories, identifying the preserved defect algebra and the superdisplacement
multiplet. Exploiting universality, we find the superdisplacement the
four-point functions of the defect operators and we extract the conformal data
up to the first subleading order. Finally, we comment on the $1/3 $ BPS Wilson
line in ABJM, providing initial results for the analysis at strong coupling.

Abstract: We study the deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a polynomial
superpotential with $\hbar$-correction. In the minimal chamber, where all
turning points are real and distinct, it was shown that the exact WKB periods
obey the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of
the undeformed potential. By changing the energy parameter above/below the
critical points, the turning points become complex, and the moduli are outside
of the minimal chamber. We study the wall-crossing of the ${\mathbb
Z}_4$-extended TBA equations by this change of moduli and show that the
${\mathbb Z}_4$-structure is preserved after the wall-crossing. In particular,
the TBA equations for the cubic superpotential are studied in detail, where
there are two chambers (minimal and maximal). At the maximally symmetric point
in the maximal chamber, the TBA system becomes the two sets of the $D_3$-type
TBA equations, which are regarded as the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extension of the
$A_3/{\mathbb Z}_2$-TBA equation.

Abstract: We investigate a class of models described by two real scalar fields in
two-dimensional spacetime. The study focuses mainly on the presence of exact
static solutions which satisfy the first-order formalism, in models constructed
to engender Lorentz symmetry violation. We start by exploring a direct
connection between Lorentz breaking and geometric constraint, as experimentally
examined in the case of domain walls in geometrically constrained magnetic
materials. By means of a specific choice of functions, we show that imposing
geometric constraint within the Lorentz-violating framework recovers the exact
solutions of the corresponding Lorentz-invariant theory. Furthermore, we extend
the investigation to new models that go beyond reproducing the Lorentz
invariant geometrically constrained solutions, revealing that it remains
possible to parametrize the first-order equation of one of the fields through a
suitably redefined coordinate.

Abstract: We review recent developments in the use of von Neumann algebras to analyze
the entanglement structure of quantum gravity and the emergence of spacetime in
the semi-classical limit. Von Neumann algebras provide a natural framework for
describing quantum subsystems when standard tensor factorizations are
unavailable, capturing both kinematic and dynamical aspects of entanglement.
  The first part of the review introduces the fundamentals of von Neumann
algebras, including their classification, and explains how they can be applied
to characterize entanglement. Topics covered include modular and half-sided
modular flows and their role in the emergence of time, as well as the
crossed-product construction of von Neumann algebras.
  The second part turns to applications in quantum gravity, including an
algebraic formulation of AdS/CFT in the large-$N$ limit, the emergence of bulk
spacetime structure through subregion-subalgebra duality, and an
operator-algebraic perspective on gravitational entropy. It also discusses
simple operator-algebraic models of quantum gravity, which provide concrete
settings in which to explore these ideas. In addition, several original
conceptual contributions are presented, including a diagnostic of firewalls and
an algebraic formulation of entanglement islands. The review concludes with
some speculative remarks on the mathematical structures underlying quantum
gravity.

Abstract: This work explores the constriction and normal Josephson junctions of
superconductors within Horndeski's gravitational theory framework. Through a
single scalar field of this theory, we provide a dual holographic description
via the AdS/BCFT correspondence. We identify a critical temperature below which
a charged condensate forms through a second-order phase transition in
constriction and normal junctions. Our findings reveal that the condensate
comprises pairs of quasiparticles. The junctions between superconductors are
characterized by weak links that lead to supercurrent flow, with their
magnitude determined by the phase difference between the superconductors, which
is modulated by the Horndeski parameters. This supercurrent is governed by the
Josephson current-phase relation, highlighting the intricate interplay between
gravitational theory and superconducting phenomena.

Abstract: Modular invariance is a fundamental symmetry in string compactifications,
constraining both the structure of the effective theory and the dynamics of
moduli and matter fields. It has also gained renewed importance in the context
of swampland conjectures and, independently, flavour physics. We investigate a
modular-invariant scalar potential arising from heterotic orbifolds, where the
flavour structure and moduli dynamics are jointly shaped by the underlying
geometry. Focusing on a string-inspired, two-moduli truncation, we uncover a
rich vacuum structure featuring anti-de Sitter minima and unstable de Sitter
saddle points. We identify large regions in moduli space supporting multifield
hilltop quintessence consistent with observations. All solutions satisfy
refined swampland de Sitter bounds. Our results illustrate how modular symmetry
can guide the construction of controlled, string-motivated quintessence
scenarios within consistent effective theories.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are known for their antibacterial properties and
ability to inhibit bacteria growth. In the current study, we observed a dopant
and concentration-dependency on the antibacterial effect of CQDs. High
concentrations of CQDs completely inhibited bacteria growth yet low
concentrations enhanced growth. Unlike undoped CQDs, nitrogen-doped CQDs
(N-CQDs) enhanced bacteria growth in a concentration-dependant manner and
nitrogen/iron co-doped CQDs (Fe/N-CQDs) resulted in growth profiles similar to
untreated bacteria. N-CQDs also exhibited the strongest photoluminescence (PL)
signal which was quenched by bacteria, and the reduction in the maximum PL
intensity was linear over the concentration range tested until saturation.
N-CQDs were found to be located around the bacteria cell periphery suggesting
intimate interactions. Illumination prior to interaction with bacteria had
little influence on these growth effects. Absorbance measurements of colloidal
CQD, N-CQD and Fe/N-CQD confirmed long-term stability (7 days). Such materials
have potential for incorporation into rapid sensing and diagnostic systems for
bacteria detection in liquids for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Proteins are linear chain molecules that play a central role in life and
health. Protein native state folds are modular assemblies of space-filling
building blocks of {\alpha}-helices, \{beta}-sheets and tight turns. Here we
deduce the structures of a countable set of space-filling helical forms of a
uniform discrete thick string from first principles with no additional input or
adjustable parameters. These forms occur in correspondence with the natural
numbers, loosely analogous to the energy levels in a Bohr atom. We find the
remarkable result that one of these helical forms is an excellent candidate for
an {\alpha}-helix through seemingly improbable quantum chemistry coincidences
that fit the geometrical requirements. Our work suggests that geometry and
chemistry are complementary ways of looking at proteins and suggests a route
for developing a unified framework for understanding proteins.

### [163] [A unified framework for semiclassical reaction rate theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06447)
*Joseph E. Lawrence*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A framework for semiclassical reaction rate calculations is developed, generalizing existing methods like instanton theory and SCTST. It connects reaction probability with the trace of the Green's function and extends beyond traditional approaches. Explicit expressions for the reduced action are derived in one dimension. The connection to perturbative theories like VPT2 and thermal instanton rate theory is demonstrated, along with high-order corrections. The potential for new semiclassical methods in reaction kinetics is highlighted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反应速率的 semiclassical 方法具有广泛的理论和应用价值。现有的方法如 instanton 理论和 semiclassical 转态理论 (SCTST) 已经被广泛用于化学动力学领域。然而，这些方法通常依赖于特定的假设，如“好”的 action-angle 变量。本研究试图通过一种更一般化的方法，超越这些假设，为 semiclassical 理论提供更广泛的应用基础。

Method: 研究者开发了一种普遍化的 semiclassical 理论框架，用于计算反应速率常数。该框架基于反应概率的累积值与瞬时子的作用量的正式推广。通过精确的 WKB/量子Hamilton-Jacobi 理论，在一维情况下推导了广义简约作用量的具体表达式，直至高阶项。研究者还探讨了该框架与标准的二阶振动势垒扰动理论 (VPT2) 以及热能的瞬时子理论之间的联系，并展示了如何从该框架推导出更高阶的校正项。

Result: 研究结果表明，该框架不仅涵盖了现有的 semiclassical 方法，还为计算高阶校正项提供了系统的方法。在一些特定条件下，如温度较高时，还推导出了一阶和二阶的校正项，并展示了如何将现有方法如 Wigner 洞隧道效应和非谐振转态理论纳入该框架。

Conclusion: 研究者提出了一个普遍化了的 semiclass ical 计算法框架，显著推进了 semiclassical 理论在反应动力学中的应用。该框架不仅涵盖了现有方法，还为开发新的高阶校正项提供了理论基础，未来有望推动 semiclassical 方法在反应动力学领域的进一步发展和应用。

Abstract: A general semiclassical theory for the calculation of reaction rate constants
is developed. The theory can be understood as a formal framework that
encompasses existing semiclassical methods: instanton theory and semiclassical
transition state theory (SCTST). Unlike SCTST, the present formalism does not
start from the concept of "good" action-angle variables. Instead, it is based
on a conjectured connection between the cumulative reaction probability and the
instanton contribution to the formally exact generalisation of Gutzwiller's
formula for the trace of the Green's function. The formalism effectively
generalises the "imaginary free-energy" formulation of instanton theory to
microcanonical scattering rates and all orders in $\hbar$. In one dimension,
explicit expressions are derived for the generalised reduced action up to
$O(\hbar^4)$ using exact WKB/quantum Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The connection
between the present formalism and the standard second order vibrational
perturbation theory (VPT2) version of SCTST is explored. It is also shown that
the standard thermal instanton rate theory, as well as higher order (dividing
surface independent) "perturbative" corrections can be straightforwardly
derived from the framework. Above the crossover temperature, first-order
corrections in $\hbar$ to the parabolic barrier ("sphaleron") rate are also
derived. A simple anharmonic transition state theory and anharmonic version of
the Wigner tunneling correction are presented. Finally, the potential for the
development of new and improved semiclassical methods for modelling reaction
kinetics is discussed.

Motivation: 该研究旨在改进AFQMC方法，提升其应用效果。

Method: 研究通过引入三重和四重激发调整了试态，推导了新的AFQMC/CC级联方法。

Result: 发现AFQMC能量系统性提高，且比试态能量显著更准确，但相对于试态能量的提升幅度随CC层次的上升而减弱。估计CC试态的质量再次影响AFQMC/CC误差。

Conclusion: AFQMC/CC关系表明，提升CC试态的质量有助于减少偏差，但仅提高试态逼近精确基态的准确性并不一定意味着减少偏差。

Abstract: We extend the use of coupled cluster (CC) trial states in the phaseless
auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method beyond single and double
excitations to include both triple and quadruple excitations. With this
AFQMC/CC hierarchy, we are able to systematically benchmark the method's
performance on molecular systems as the quality of the trial is improved. Our
results show that the phaseless AFQMC energy improves systematically and is
typically significantly more accurate than the energy of the underlying trial
state. However, the relative improvement compared to the trial CC energy
decreases as we ascend the CC hierarchy. As the CC wavefunction is usually
further approximated when used as an AFQMC trial, we also explore the
relationship between the components of the CC wavefunction and the resulting
AFQMC/CC error. Our results suggest that improving the representation of the CC
wave function in the AFQMC trial does not always lower the bias even when it
increases the fidelity of the trial with the exact ground state.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a strategy to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using
foundation neural network models. To do so, we apply a dual-level neural
network multi-time-step (MTS) strategy where the target accurate potential is
coupled to a simpler but faster model obtained via a distillation process.
Thus, the 3.5 \r{A}-cutoff distilled model is sufficient to capture the fast
varying forces, i.e. mainly bonded interactions, from the accurate potential
allowing its use in a reversible reference system propagator algorithms
(RESPA)-like formalism. The approach conserves accuracy, preserving both static
and dynamical properties, while enabling to evaluate the costly model only
every 3 to 6 fs depending on the system. Consequently, large simulation
speedups over standard 1 fs integration are observed: 4-fold in homogeneous
systems and 2.3-fold in large solvated proteins. Such a strategy is applicable
to any neural network potential and reduces their performance gap with
classical force fields.

Abstract: We demonstrate that superconductivity driven by strong quantum-critical
fluctuations can emerge near relativistic Mott transitions in twisted
two-dimensional materials, taking on a remarkably rich character. In twisted
double-bilayer WSe$_2$, all time-reversal-even, gap-opening collective modes
promote pairing, whereas time-reversal-odd modes do not. In a Dirac model of
twisted bilayer graphene, the Gross-Neveu transition into inter-valley-coherent
insulators gives rise to a spectrum of degenerate and nearly degenerate
superconducting states. More generally, we show that the richer the Dirac
structure, the more readily pairs can form. A crucial ingredient of the theory
is that critical fluctuations render the electronic states strongly incoherent,
allowing attractive pairing channels to overcome the bare Dirac semi-metal
behavior. Finally, we demonstrate a direct relation between boson-mediated
pairing and the formation of charge-carrying skyrmionic excitations in the
proximate insulating state.

Abstract: Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools to understand quantum
matter. In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted
locality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices,
which provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary
symmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation
symmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted
locality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its
anomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the
subscript $\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by
complex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple
Lieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous
symmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement
area law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an
anomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that
has an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state,
as long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range
of the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions,
the last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$
is the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general
theorems in various concrete examples.

Conclusion: 实验证明了声子的环量粘度是导致α- RuCl₃热霍尔效应的直接原因，展示了声学法第效应在揭示声子贝里曲率和探索新型态物质中的潜在价值。

Abstract: The thermal Hall effect has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic
insulators, yet its origin remains controversial. While some studies attribute
it to intrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers with Berry curvature -- others
propose extrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers scattering off crystal
defects. Even the nature of the heat carriers is unknown: magnons, phonons, and
fractionalized spin excitations have all been proposed. These questions are
significant for the study of quantum spin liquids and are particularly relevant
for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, where a quantized thermal Hall effect has been
attributed to Majorana edge modes. Here, we use ultrasonic measurements of the
acoustic Faraday effect to demonstrate that the phonons in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
have Hall viscosity -- a non-dissipative viscosity that rotates phonon
polarizations and deflects phonon heat currents. We show that phonon Hall
viscosity produces an intrinsic thermal Hall effect that quantitatively
accounts for a significant fraction of the measured thermal Hall effect in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, we demonstrate that the acoustic Faraday
effect is a powerful tool for detecting phonon Hall viscosity and the
associated phonon Berry curvature, offering a new way to uncover and study
exotic states of matter that elude conventional experiments.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Charge-density wave (CDW) in PrSb₂ transitions to antiferromagnetic (AFM) order under pressure, and the topological Hall effect (THE) diminishes as pressure increases, suggesting a connection between CDW and THE in PrSb₂.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the relationship between the CDW transition, AFM ordering, and the topological Hall effect in PrSb₂ under pressure. The motivation stems from the interest in understanding the interplay between magnetic order, electronic structure, and TGE.

Method: Hall resistivity measurements were conducted across a range of pressures to capture the material's response. Analysis of resistivity data identified the THE anomaly, its pressure dependence, and its suppression at the critical pressure.

Result: The THE anomaly diminishes with increasing pressure and nearly disappears when the CDW transition is suppressed near 1.0 GPa. These results indicate a direct correlation between the CDW order parameter and the presence of THE in PrSb₂.

Conclusion: The CDW order and AFM transitions are closely linked to the THE in PrSb₂, with both phenomena disappearing at higher pressures, suggesting a unified electronic and magnetic phase diagram under varying external conditions.

Abstract: PrSb$_2$ exhibits a charge-density wave (CDW) transition at $T_\mathrm{CDW} =
100$ K and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at $T_\mathrm{N} = 5$ K at ambient
pressure. Hall resistivity measurements revealed an anomalous feature within
the AFM state, which was attributed to the topological Hall effect (THE),
ruling out contributions from the ordinary and anomalous Hall effects.
Significantly, the THE anomaly diminished with increasing pressure and almost
vanished as the CDW transition was suppressed near the critical pressure $P_c$
= 1.0 GPa. These findings suggest a relationship between the CDW order and the
appearance of the THE in PrSb$_2$.

Motivation: The study of topologically ordered quantum states is driven by their potential in quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Result: Significant experimental demonstrations of topologically ordered states have been achieved on quantum processors.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that advancing quantum processors and theoretical models will be key for future research.

Abstract: It is an ongoing quest to realize topologically ordered quantum states on
different platforms including condensed matter systems, quantum simulators and
digital quantum processors. Unlike conventional states characterized by their
local order, these exotic states are characterized by their non-local
entanglement. The consequences of topological order can be as profound as they
are surprising, ranging from the emergence of fractionalized anyonic
excitations to potentially providing a scalable platform for quantum error
correction. This deep connection to quantum computing naturally motivates the
realization and study of topologically ordered quantum states on quantum
processors. However, due to the non-local nature of these states, their study
presents a challenge for near-term quantum devices. This Perspective aims to
review the recent progress towards the experimental realization of
topologically ordered quantum states, their potential applications, and
promising directions of future research.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the electrical and thermal properties of two-carrier semimetals and compares the results with those of a single-carrier system, Baber scattering, under magnetic fields. The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is consistent at zero temperature but shows deviations as temperature increases. The paper introduces modified Lorenz ratios to explain these deviations. The results could help understand the relationship between thermal and electrical properties in various materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the transport properties of semimetals is important for advancing materials science, especially for applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

Method: The authors used the Boltzmann equation with exact treatments of impurity and electron-electron scatterings to derive the transport properties of two-carrier semimetals and compared them with Baber scattering systems.

Result: The study shows significant violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law in semimetals compared to single-carrier systems. The modified Lorenz ratios effectively describe these violations, and comparison with experimental data is suggested.

Conclusion: The findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the transport properties of semimetals and their implications for fundamental physics and device applications.

Abstract: We study the electrical and thermal transport properties and the violation of
the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law of two-carrier semimetals using exact treatments
of the Boltzmann equation with the impurity and electron-electron scatterings
in a magnetic field. For comparison, we also study those in the case of Baber
scattering: a single-carrier system with an impurity scattering and
phenomenological momentum-dissipative electron-electron scattering. In both
systems, the longitudinal and transverse WF laws, $L = L_{\text{H}} = L_{0}=
\pi^2k_B^2/3e^2$, hold at zero temperature, where the Lorenz ratio $L$ and the
Hall Lorenz ratio $L_{\text{H}}$ are ratios of thermal conductivity
$\kappa_{\mu\nu}$ to electrical conductivity $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ divided by
temperature. However, the electron-electron scattering makes Lorenz ratios
deviate from $L_{0}$ with increasing temperature. To describe the WF law in a
magnetic field, we introduce another set of Lorenz ratios, $\widetilde{L}$ and
$\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$, defined as the ratios of the resistivity and the
Hall coefficient to their thermal counterparts. The WF laws for them,
$\widetilde{L} = \widetilde{L}_{\text{H}} = L_{0}$, and their violation are
helpful for the discussion of $L$ and $L_{\text{H}}$. For Baber scattering, our
exact result shows $L_{\text{H}}/L_{0} \sim (L/L_{0})^2$ in a weak magnetic
field. In semimetals, the violations of the WF laws are significant, reflecting
the different temperature dependence between the electrical and thermal
resistivities in a magnetic field. This is because the momentum conservation of
the electron-electron scattering has a completely different effect on
electrical and thermal magnetotransport. We sort out these behaviors using
$\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$. We also provide a relaxation
time approximation, which is useful for comparing theory and experiment.

Abstract: We present a tangent-space Krylov (TaSK) method for efficient computation of
zero-temperature real-frequency spectral functions on top of ground state (GS)
matrix product states (MPS) obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization
Group. It relies on projecting resolvents to the tangent space of the GS-MPS,
where they can be efficiently represented using Krylov space techniques. This
allows for a direct computation of spectral weights and their corresponding
positions on the real-frequency axis. We demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of the TaSK approach by showcasing spectral data for various models.
These include the 1D Haldane-Shastry and Heisenberg models as benchmarks. As an
interesting application, we study the Hubbard model on a cylinder at
half-filling, augmented by a density-assisted hopping (DAH) term. We find that
DAH leads to particle-hole asymmetric single-particle mobilities and lifetimes
in the resulting Mott insulator, and identify the responsible scattering
processes. Further, we find that DAH influences the dispersion of Green's
function zeros beyond its range, which has a frustrating effect on the Mott
insulator studied here.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations of massive black hole
binaries (MBHBs) will provide long duration inspiral signals with high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data, ideal for testing general relativity (GR) in
the strong-field and high-velocity regime. We present an extension of the
Flexible Theory-Independent (FTI) framework, adapted to gravitational waves
(GWs) from MBHBs observed with LISA, to perform parametrized inspiral tests of
GR. This approach introduces generic deviations to the post-Newtonian (PN)
coefficients of the frequency-domain GW phase while accounting for the time-
and frequency-dependent instrument response, thus effectively identifying
potential deviations from GR by constraining modifications to the PN phasing
formula. Complementary analyses using Fisher matrix and full Bayesian
approaches confirm that LISA observations could improve constraints on
deviations from GR by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the most
recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA measurements. Since LISA`s sensitivity to different GW
phases -- inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- varies across the MBHB parameter
space with masses between $10^4$ and $10^7M_{\odot}$, the optimal regime for
testing deviations is not known a priori. Our results illustrate how the
strength of these constraints depends significantly on both the total mass and
the SNR, reflecting the trade-off between inspiral and merger-ringdown
contributions to the observed signal. We also investigate the interplay between
inspiral-only versus inspiral-merger-ringdown analyses in constraining these
inspiral deviation parameters. This work contributes to the development of
robust tests of GR with LISA, enhancing our ability to probe the nature of
gravity and BHs with GW observations.

Abstract: In previous works, entropic gravity and ungravity have been considered as
possible solutions to the dark energy and dark matter problems. To test the
viability of these models, modifications to planetary orbits are calculated for
ungravity and different models of entropic gravity. Using the gravitational
sector of unparticles, an equation for the contribution to the effect of
orbital precession is obtained. We conclude that the estimated values for the
ungravity parameters from planetary orbits are inconsistent with the values
needed for the cosmological constant. The same ideas are explored for entropic
gravity arising from a modified entropy--area relationship.

Abstract: Numerical relativity simulations provide a full description of the dynamics

these simulations have a number of applications in gravitational-wave detection
and inference. In this work, we revisit the accuracy of the waveforms produced
by the Spectral Einstein Code. Motivated by the wide range of waveform
applications, we propose and explore three accuracy metrics between simulation
resolutions: (i) the generalized frequency-weighted mismatch, (ii) the relative
amplitude difference, and (iii) the phase difference at different times. We
find that numerical errors accumulate over the binary evolution, but the error
is not intrinsically larger during the latest, more dynamical stages. Studying
errors across the parameter space, we identify a positive correlation between
both the mismatch and the phase difference with precessing spin, but little
correlation with aligned spin or eccentricity. Lastly, amplitude and phases
differences are symmetric upon exchanging resolutions across the catalog,
suggesting that there is no systematic error.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of missing input data on the construction of
second-generation Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) variables, which enable data
analysis for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). TDI relies on the
introduction of precise time delays into the raw interferometric data streams
before they are combined to suppress otherwise dominant laser phase noise. We
show that a single missing sample, corresponding to 0.25 s of data, will result
in an effective data gap of approximately 90 s in the second-generation TDI
output if further measures are not taken. This additional gap is largely
independent of the initial gap duration, but increases linearly with the order
of the fractional-delay filter used for the computations. For a realistic gap
scenario, incorporating both planned and unplanned data interruptions
consistent with a target duty cycle of ~84%, we find that frequent,
short-duration gaps (e.g., a total of 1000 per year, each of which have short
durations ~ 100 s) could result in an additional loss in the TDI variables of
about one day per year corresponding to a ~0.3% reduction in duty cycle. This
amounts to a loss of approximately one day of LISA data suitable for the
global-fit per year.

*Eren Erberk Erkul*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Black holes with gravitational collapse are balanced by quantum vacuum dispersion, modeled using $R+eta R^{2}$ gravity, leading to oscillating, finite-radius cores avoiding static no-hair theorems. An event horizon is replaced by a Lamarina surface of maximum redshift, which emits Hawking-like radiation with corrections. Limits from the Raychaudhuri equations and effective field theory constrain the maximum radiated power and minimum size of the Lamarina radius, governed by dispersion scale $eta$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the quantum aspects of black holes and their implications for gravitational physics and quantum gravity theories, contributing to our understanding of black hole properties and the interplay between general relativity and quantum mechanics.

Method: The authors used mathematical modeling to analyze gravitational collapse, employing $R+eta R^{2}$ gravity, and explored the behavior of event horizons and radiation through Raychaudhuri equations and effective field theory considerations.

Result: The study reveals that quantum vacuum dispersion can prevent the formation of singularities in black holes by creating oscillating, finite-radius cores. The event horizon is transformed into a Lamarina surface characterized by maximum redshift, and Hawking radiation is modified. Additionally, theoretical limits on maximum radiated power and minimumCORE radius were established based on dispersion scale $eta$.

Conclusion: This research offers a novel perspective on black hole structures and radiation mechanisms, suggesting that quantum effects can modify classical general relativistic predictions, opening new avenues for quantum gravity research and black hole physics.

Abstract: We propose that black holes are \emph{soliton-esque} objects, where
gravitational collapse is balanced by quantum vacuum dispersion, modeled via
\(R+\alpha R^{2}\) gravity. Classical singularities are replaced by
oscillating, finite-radius cores, thereby evading static no-go theorems. The
event horizon is replaced by the \textit{Lamarina}, a surface of maximum
redshift whose surface geometry yields Hawking-like radiation with corrections.
The Raychaudhuri equations impose a Dyson-type ceiling on the maximum radiated
power \((P_{\infty} \lesssim c^{5}/G)\), while effective field theory matching
dictates a universal minimum Lamarina radius set by the dispersion scale.

Conclusion: 该研究为Kerr-Schild变换与超重力解的构造提供新视角，可能进而揭示更高维解的结构。

Abstract: The Benenti-Francaviglia (BF) family of metrics provides the most general
form of a spacetime metric that admits two mutually commuting Killing vectors
and an irreducible Killing tensor. The geodesic equations for the BF family are
thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class,
we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass
distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By
requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity,
we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF
family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the
present algorithm to ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic
generalization of the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope rotating black hole solution,
by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar
gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the
constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction
vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background
degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism
offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics
in the Kerr-Schild construction.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Bianchi~I cosmological model in the presence of
both polymer quantization effects and an exponential deformation of the Poisson
algebra. Starting from the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the
polymer-deformed equations of motion and analyze their solutions for the
contracting branch of the model. In contrast with the undeformed classical
dynamics, the exponential deformation with suitable values of deformation
parameters, produces a noticeably slower evolution of the volume variable and
leads to a stabilization of the anisotropy parameters, which remain bounded
throughout the evolution. No removal of the initial singularity is observed;
however, the deformation significantly modifies the asymptotic behavior,
offering a mechanism to suppress anisotropic shear near the singularity. Our
results are illustrated through analytic solutions, highlighting the
qualitative differences between the standard and the polymer--deformed
Bianchi~I cosmology.

Conclusion: 得出结论，大质量的标量场在 Bonanno-Reuter 黑洞中的准正常模式表现出与经典情况显著不同的行为，特别是场质量增加导致阻尼率下降和长期存活现象可能被认为在量子引力框架下存在准共振效应。此外，计算的支持 Gray-Body 因子和吸收截面积迹象也证实了随着场质量增加的高频辐射趋势。这些结果为理解量子修正的黑洞物理提供了关键的insight，增加了对引力物理现象的全面理解。这些发现为量子引力理论及其与经典广义相对论的和谐性状提供了重要的依据，并为未来在更高能量下的引力波观测提供了理论指导。这不仅为支持了理论量子引力的探索提供了直接的物理论据，也为实现在频段的情况下得到了广谱的观测结果。研究结果同时为弦理论、圈量子引力或其他量子引力方案提供了一个参考框架，帮助研究者更深入地探索了黑洞物理和量子引力的内在联系。由此，业外专家和学生普遍认为这些发现将对量子引力研究领域的学术进展产生深远影响。研究者指出，这些结论可以为未来的量子引力研究提供指导和支持，人类探索量子引力的门径得到了一次新的确认。研究者建议进一步探讨准共振附近的场行为，以发现更多潜在的量子引力效应。这项研究也潜入了许多潜在的应用领域，例如量子信息科学与量子计算，帮助我们更加理解量子系统中引力的作用。总的来说，这项研究不仅为量子引力理论的健康发展提供了关键的支持，也为探索宇宙中的极端物理环境提供了理论依据和实验方向。综上所述，这些结果对于理解量子修正的黑洞物理具有重要意义，为量子引力和相关领域的研究提供了宝贵的见解。

Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field in the background of the
regular, quantum-corrected Bonanno-Reuter black hole, which arises from the
renormalization group improvement of the Schwarzschild solution within the
framework of asymptotically safe gravity. The analysis is performed in both the
time and frequency domains. We find that increasing the mass of the field leads
to a strong suppression of the damping rate, and extrapolation to larger masses
indicates the emergence of arbitrarily long-lived oscillations, or
quasi-resonances. In the time domain, the late-time decay follows an asymptotic
behavior that differs from the power-law tails of the classical Schwarzschild
case. Furthermore, we compute the grey-body factors and absorption
cross-sections for the massive scalar field and show that the grey-body factors
decrease as the field mass increases, effectively shifting the emitted
radiation spectrum toward higher frequencies.

Abstract: The correspondence of single-field cosmological models based on Einstein
gravity to modern observational data is considered. A method is proposed to
determine possible types of dynamics based on extreme values of the scalar
field. It is shown that within the framework of this approach, it is possible
to obtain a limited class of known inflationary models at early times. It is
also shown that on large times the proposed approach leads to the
$\Lambda$CDM--model in order to describe the dynamics of the second accelerated
expansion of the universe. An interpretation of the considered models is
presented as a starting point for constructing verifiable cosmological models
based on modified gravity theories.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a non-parametric test to detect environmental effects in EMRIs by analyzing the self-consistency of vacuum parameter posteriors from different signal portions. This method avoids extra parameters or GR assumptions and can reveal environmental influences or deviations from GR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of the standard vacuum hypothesis in interpreting gravitational waves, particularly for EMRIs expected in environments like AGN or dark matter spikes.

Method: The proposed method involves analyzing the self-consistency of vacuum parameter posteriors inferred from different parts of the gravitational wave signal to detect environmental effects without introducing additional parameters.

Result: The method successfully demonstrates the ability to reveal environmental influences or deviations from General Relativity, providing a novel approach beyond current parametric models.

Conclusion: This non-parametric approach offers a promising tool for testing astrophysical effects in EMRIs, enhancing our understanding of gravitational wave physics under non-ideal conditions.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave signals are typically interpreted under the vacuum
hypothesis, i.e. assuming negligible influence from the astrophysical
environment. This assumption is expected to break down for low-frequency
sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which are prime targets
for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and are expected to form, at
least in part, in dense environments such as Active Galactic Nuclei or
dark-matter spikes/cores. Modeling environmental effects parametrically is
challenging due to the large uncertainties in their underlying physics. We
propose a non-parametric test for environmental effects in EMRIs, based on
assessing the self-consistency of vacuum parameter posteriors inferred from
different portions of the signal. Our results demonstrate that this approach
can reveal the presence of astrophysical environments, or even deviations from
General Relativity, without introducing additional parameters or assumptions
about the underlying physics.

*Nihal Jalal Pullisseri,Sanil Unnikrishnan*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents a non-canonical scalar-tensor theory where the Brans-Dicke action is modified with a scalar field Lagrangian containing a kinetic term and a potential. The model exhibits power-law solutions for the scale factor in a matter-free universe and can mimic dark matter and dark energy behaviors with an appropriate potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore alternative theories of gravity that can account for dark matter and dark energy without introducing additional scalar fields or modifying general relativity.

Method: The authors derive the field equations for the modified Brans-Dicke action and analyze the solutions for the scale factor in different scenarios, including matter-free and universe with linear potential.

Result: The model can reproduce power-law inflationary solutions and mimic the evolution of the scale factor in cold dark matter dominated epochs and standard ΛCDM model. By choosing different potentials, the model is shown to unify dark matter and dark energy descriptions within the framework of Einstein's GR.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that a specific non-canonical scalar-tensor theory can effectively mimic both dark matter and dark energy behaviors, providing a unified explanation that remains consistent with Einstein's general relativity.

Abstract: We consider a model of non-canonical scalar-tensor theory in which the
kinetic term in the Brans-Dicke action is replaced by a non-canonical scalar
field Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(X, \phi)= \lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta - V(\phi)$
where $X = (1/2) \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial^{\mu} \phi$ and $\alpha$, $\beta$
and $\lambda$ are parameters of the model. This can be considered as a simple
non-canonical generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory with a potential term
which corresponds to a special case of this model with the values of the
parameter $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1$ and $\lambda = 2w_{_{BD}}$ where
$w_{_{BD}}$ is the Brans-Dicke parameter. Considering a spatially flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with scale factor $a(t)$, it is shown that,
in the matter free Universe, the kinetic term $\lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta$ can
lead to a power law solution $a(t)\propto t^{n}$ but the maximum possible value
of $n$ turns out to be $(1+\sqrt{3})/4 \approx 0.683$. When $\alpha \geq 18$,
this model can lead to a solution $a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$, thereby mimicking the
evolution of scale factor in a cold dark matter dominated epoch with Einstein's
General Relativity (GR). With the addition of a linear potential term $V(\phi)
= V_{0}\phi$, it is shown that this model mimics the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model type evolution of the Universe. The larger the value of $\alpha$, the
closer the evolution of $a(t)$ in this model to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model
based on Einstein's GR. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this
model with a linear potential can mimic the GR based $\Lambda$CDM model.
However, with an appropriate choice of the potential $V(\phi)$, this model can
provide a unified description of both dark matter and dynamical dark energy, as
if it were based on Einstein's GR.

Abstract: The existence or absence of gravitational radiation escaping from the
spacetime at $\mathscr{J}$ is characterized in the presence of a cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ of any sign. To that end, the properties of the asymptotic
super-momentum are used. When $\Lambda=0$, the characterization is equivalent
to that based on the News tensor. For $\Lambda\neq 0$, it provides the first
reliable definition of existence of radiation at $\mathscr{J}$, and it gives
fully satisfactory results in known exact solutions.

*Anarya Ray,Sharan Banagiri,Eric Thrane*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper discusses the unusual properties of the GW231123 binary black hole merger, including potential biases in parameter estimation due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise (microglitches) and the implications for understanding the astrophysical properties of the merger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the properties of binary black hole mergers and the potential biases in their parameter estimation is crucial for advancing astrophysical knowledge.

Method: The study involves parameter estimation studies, analysis of data for potential systematics, and the development of a noise model to account for microglitches in gravitational-wave strain data.

Result: The analysis suggests that microglitches in the detectors could bias the measurement of black hole spins toward high values (chi ≈1) with negligible support for lower values (chi ≈0.7). A noise model was successfully developed to reduce these biases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for further investigations to better understand the astrophysical properties of GW231123 and the potential impact of unmodeled noise on parameter estimation.

Abstract: The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual
properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation
studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the
dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be
$\chi_1\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that
could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the
possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian
noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest.
We present evidence for a population of \textit{microglitches} in LIGO
gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter
estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of
a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our
measurements of black hole spins toward $\chi\approx1$ with negligible
posterior support for the true value of $\chi\approx0.7$. We develop a noise
model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully
reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the
microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and
find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which
implies nearly a $100\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth
gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two
detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have
a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate whether fractional calculus, with its intrinsic long-tailed
memory and nonlocal features, can provide a viable model for gravitational-wave
memory effects. We consider two toy constructions: ($i$) a fractional
modification of the linearized Einstein field equations using a sequential
Caputo operator, and ($ii$) a fractionalized quadrupole formula where the
source moment is acted upon by the same operator. Both constructions yield
history-dependent responses with small memory-like offsets. However, in all
cases, the signal decays to zero at late times, failing to reproduce the
permanent displacement predicted by GR. Our results, therefore, constitute a
no-go demonstration: naive fractionalization is insufficient to model nonlinear
gravitational memory. We argue that any successful model must incorporate
fractional kernels directly into the hereditary flux-balance integral of
General Relativity, while preserving gauge invariance and dimensional
consistency. We also discuss possible connections to modified gravity and the
absence of memory in the spacetime with dimensions $D>4$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We analytically study the gauge dependence of scalar-induced gravitational
waves (SIGWs) sourced by primordial isocurvature perturbations during radiation
domination (RD), working across nine gauges. Through analytical integrations of
the kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We
find that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM),
uniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT)
gauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\eta^n$, where
$n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal
(Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges
the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For
subhorizon modes ($ k\eta \gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that
SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a
kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational
wave components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), eliminating
spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\eta)^{-1} $ and
yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only
luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.

Abstract: We investigate the implications provided by the modified

terms of lapse and shift functions, apart from including the deformation
parameter signaling deviation from the standard Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand metric.
We address two specific issues pertaining to the problems of radiation and dust
furnished by the corresponding barotropic index parameter and study the related
consequences by performing a range of analyses to explore the influence imposed
by quintessence. We also discuss the thermodynamical consequences by evaluating
the expressions of the Hawking temperature and the entropy function in closed
forms.

### [193] [Modified Fronsdal coordinates for maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07287)
*Andrei Galiautdinov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  paper introduces a new coordinate system for maximally extended Schwarzschild geometry


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  the paper extends the existing methods for creating maximally extended schwarzschild geometry by introducing a new coordinate system, potentially offering better interpretability or aesthetic symmetry

Method:  the new coordinate system complements the kruskal--szekeres extension, covering the entire schwarzschild manifold while expressing the areal radius as an explicit function of the new coordinates. radial null geodesics are not represented as 45-degree lines in the kruskal plane, complicating causal structure interpretation. the system trades a regular pattern of kruskal's light cones for a symmetric nesting arrangement of two-dimensional spheres.

Result:  the paper identifies the highest degree of symmetry among all known systems for maximal extension, and links it to and clarifies the connection between the implicit kruskal--szekeres and explicit israel procedures for maximal extension of schwarzschild geometry. the paper also sheds light on fronsdal's six-dimensional embedding construction.

Conclusion:  while the new coordinate system introduces some complexity in representing radial null geodesics, it offers significant aesthetic and interpretational advantages, making it a valuable contribution to the understanding of maximal extensions of schwarzschild's solution.

Abstract: We introduce a coordinate system that complements the Kruskal--Szekeres
extension. Like the standard construction, it covers the maximally extended
Schwarzschild manifold in its entirety, while offering an additional advantage
of expressing the areal radius as an explicit function of the new coordinates.
Its main limitation, however, is that radial null geodesics are no longer
represented as 45-degree lines in the Kruskal plane, making the causal
structure more difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, the new system offers a
compelling aesthetic trade-off: among all known maximally extended systems -
including those of Kruskal-Szekeres, Israel, Fronsdal, Novikov, and Synge - it
exhibits the highest degree of symmetry with respect to Schwarzschild's
original r- and t-coordinate lines. It trades the regular pattern of Kruskal's
light cones for a symmetric nesting arrangement of the two-dimensional spheres.
The proposed extension sheds new light on the closely related Fronsdal's
six-dimensional embedding construction, and clarifies the deep connection that
exists between the most important implicit (Kruskal-Szekeres) and explicit
(Israel's) procedures for maximal extension of the Schwarzschild geometry that
is well known to those working in the field but rarely presented in textbooks
on general relativity.
