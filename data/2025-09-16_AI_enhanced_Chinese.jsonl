We present a phase-field model for simulating\nthe motility of deformable, non-adherent cells driven by contractile surface\ninstabilities of the cell cortex. This model couples surface and bulk\nhydrodynamics, accommodates large shape deformations and incorporates a\ndiffusible contraction-generating molecule (myosin) that drives cortical flows.\nThese capabilities enable a systematic exploration of how mechanical cues\ndirect cell polarization and migration. We first demonstrate that spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of cortical activity can lead to persistent and directed\nmovement in channels. We then investigate how various physical cues - including\ngradients in friction, viscosity, and channel width as well as external flows\nand hydrodynamic interactions between cells - steer migration.

Phys. 26, 093014 (2024)] established a direct link between\nthe photoionization cross section and the attosecond time delay near Cooper\nminima (CM) in the valence shells of noble-gas atoms. This link is based on the\nanalytic properties of the ionization amplitude in the complex plane of the\nphotoelectron energy, and is particularly sensitive to the winding number of\nthe amplitude around the origin of the complex energy plane. Here, we\ndemonstrate an analogous relation for photoionization of the valence $ns$\nshells of alkali-metal atoms (AMA), from Na ($n=3$) to Cs ($n=6$), as well as\nalkaline-earth-metal atoms (AEMA), from Mg ($n=3$) to Ba ($n=6$). To this end,\nwe employ a fully relativistic formalism that separates the two complementary\n$ns_{1/2} \\to Ep_{1/2}$ and $Ep_{3/2}$ ionization channels. Each of these\nchannels exhibits a phase variation close to $\\pi$, but in opposite directions,\nnear their respective Cooper minima.

Understanding the Wigner crystal\nat zero magnetic field is a long-sought goal in physics, thanks to its\nfundamental simplicity and possible connection to the density-driven\nmetal-insulator transition. To date, evidence for such a crystal has been\nreported across various platforms. However, the AC conductivity of a zero-field\nWigner crystal, a key observable characterizing its electrodynamics, has never\nbeen measured. Here, we develop an ultrasensitive on-chip terahertz (THz)\nspectroscopy technique to probe the AC conductivity in electrostatically gated\nmonolayer MoSe2 encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observe a sub-THz\nresonance corresponding to the pinning mode of a zero-field Wigner crystal,\nwhose frequency is orders of magnitude higher than those under high magnetic\nfields. Using the pinning mode as an indicator, we reveal that moderate\ndisorder notably stabilizes the Wigner crystal. With increasing density towards\nmelting, we find that the pinning mode of the Wigner crystal coexists with a\ngrowing Drude component characteristic of an electron liquid, and the\ncompetition between these two components in the conductivity spectra leads to\nthe insulator-metal transition of the 2D electron system.

Under resonant excitation, several coherent modes are\ngenerated by external alternating fields, whose frequencies are tuned to\nresonance with some transition frequencies of the trapped system. A Bose system\nof trapped atoms with Bose-Einstein condensate can display two types of the\nJosephson effect, the standard one, when the system is separated into two or\nmore parts in different locations or when there are no any separation barriers,\nbut the system becomes nonuniform due to the coexistence of several coherent\nmodes interacting with each other, which is termed internal Josephson effect.\nThe mathematics in both these cases is similar. We concentrate on the internal\nJosephson effect. Systems with nonlinear coherent modes demonstrate rich\ndynamics, including Rabi oscillations, Josephson effect, and chaotic motion.\nUnder Josephson effect, there exist dynamic transitions that are similar to\nphase transitions in equilibrium systems. The bosonic Josephson effect is shown\nto be realizable not only for weakly interacting systems, but also in\nsuperfluids, with not necessarily weak interactions. Sufficiently strong\nnonresonant excitation can generate several types of nonequilibrium states\ncomprising vortex germs, vortex rings, vortex lines, vortex turbulence, droplet\nturbulence, and wave turbulence.

A deterministic property\nmeans that identical random perturbations at the inlet lead to identical\npatterns downstream; during this stage, the non-identical, stochastic component\ngrows and eventually dominates the flow further downstream. We argue that these\nproperties can be explained by exploring the concept of convective space-time\nchaos, where secondary perturbations on top of a chaotic state grow but move\naway in the laboratory reference frame. We illustrate this with two simple\nmodels of convective space-time chaos, one is a partial differential equation\ndescribing waves on a film flowing down a plate, and the other is a set of\nunidirectionally coupled ordinary differential equations. To prove convective\nspace-time chaos, we calculate the profiles of the convective Lyapunov\nexponent.

Porous silicates such as MCM-41 have a pore radius larger than the\ncoherence length of 4He, and in this work we systematically explore the\npossibility of pre-plating pores with different elements to reduce the pore\nsize without localizing the confined superfluid. Through a direct solution of\nthe few-body Schrodinger equation combined with quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we explore the behavior of helium confined inside cylindrical\nnanopores for a range of pre-plating elements, including rare gases and alkali\nmetals. For rare gases, we find that helium remains strongly attracted to the\npore walls and any atoms in the core form an incompressible liquid. For alkali\nmetals such as Cs, weak interactions between helium and the pre-plating\nmaterial prevent localization near the walls and enable delocalization in the\npore center. Our results extend previous results for helium wetting on flat two\ndimensional coated substrates to the curved geometry inside nanopores, and\ndemonstrate that alkali pre-plated nanopores may enable a tunable\none-dimensional confined quantum liquid of helium.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While the symmetry groups of\ncompact attractors are well understood, the corresponding analysis for\nnon-compact basins and their boundaries has remained underdeveloped. We\nestablish a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating the hierarchical\ninclusion of a chain of symmetry groups, showing that boundary symmetries can\nstrictly exceed those of attractors and their basins. To determine admissible\nsymmetry groups of basin boundaries, we propose three complementary approaches:\n(i) thickening transfer, which connects admissibility results from compact\nattractors to basins; (ii) algebraic constraints, which exploit the closed\nnature of boundaries to impose structural restrictions; and (iii) connectivity\nand flow analysis, which analyzes how the system's dynamics permute states.\nNumerical experiments on the Thomas system confirm these theoretical results,\nillustrating that cyclic group actions permute basins while preserving their\ncommon boundary, whereas central inversion leaves both basins and boundaries\ninvariant. These findings reveal that basin boundaries often exhibit higher\nsymmetry than the attractors they separate, providing new insights into the\ngeometry of multistable systems and suggesting broader applications to physical\nand biological models where basin structure determines stability and\npredictability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u539f\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u80fd\u62e5\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u8d28\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9010\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u7fa4\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u53ca\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7f6e\u6362\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "1. \u5438\u5f15\u57df\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u88ab\u5438\u5f15\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u30022. \u5438\u5f15\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u30023. \u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u8f6c\u79fb\u6cd5\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u4ee3\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u786e\u5b9e\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5438\u5f15\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in\ncollective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum\nemitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures,\nfocusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay\namong quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a\nrich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been\nwidely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters\nmodelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting\nsuperradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly\nconnecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to\nthe Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical\nstudies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity,\nphoton statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology.\nThe sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving\nstrength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging.\nUnexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population\nthrough dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we\ndevelop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We\nalso analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying\nfive mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced\nhere. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables\nscalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as\nquantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous\nbroadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing\ncooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction\nlocalization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify \"sweet\nspots\" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is\nminimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon\ncoupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with\nstrong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near\n$B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing\nspin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design\nguidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV\nsemiconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Commonly used approaches such as Density Functional Theory (DFT)\nfrequently fail for this task due to deficiencies that are well recognized.\nHowever, for high-fidelity approaches, creating large datasets of energies and\nforces for reactive processes to train machine learning interatomic potentials\nor force fields is daunting. For example, the use of the unrestricted coupled\ncluster level of theory has previously been seen as unfeasible due to high\ncomputational costs, the lack of analytical gradients in many computational\ncodes, and additional challenges such as constructing suitable basis set\ncorrections for forces. In this work, we develop new methods and workflows to\novercome the challenges inherent to automating unrestricted coupled cluster\ncalculations. Using these advancements, we create a dataset of gas-phase\nreactions containing energies and forces for 3119 different organic molecules\nconfigurations calculated at the gold-standard level of unrestricted CCSD(T)\n(coupled cluster singles doubles and perturbative triples). With this dataset,\nwe provide an analysis of the differences between the density functional and\nunrestricted CCSD(T) descriptions. We develop a transferable machine learning\ninteratomic potential for gas-phase reactions, trained on unrestricted CCSD(T)\ndata, and demonstrate the advantages of transitioning away from DFT data.\nTransitioning from training to DFT to training to UCCSD(T) datasets yields an\nimprovement of more than 0.1 eV/{\\AA} in force accuracy and over 0.1 eV in\nactivation energy reproduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any\nnondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the\nShannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a\ndoubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the\ntransverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies\nmaps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length\n$2L$.

For the scalar exchange, we find that the trispectrum\nsignal in the equisided configuration grows with the exchange momentum and\nreaches its maximum in the flattened limit.

Unfortunately, simulating interacting bosonic fields involves a high\nboson-to-qubit encoding overhead. Furthermore, when mapping to qubits, the\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosons is necessarily truncated, with\ntruncation errors that grow with energy and time. A qubit-based quantum\ncomputer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic,\nand mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for\nsimulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a\nhybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in\nthe internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states.\nSpecifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa\nmodel, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure\nfermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities. These dynamics populate high\nbosonic-field excitations starting from an empty state, and the experimental\nresults capture well such high-occupation states.

Vibrational strong\ncoupling (VSC) has been reported to impact ground-state chemical reactivity,\nbut its influence on electronic excited-state dynamics remains unexplored.\nHere, we take a first step towards excited-state VSC by demonstrating optical\nmodulation of the ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy), (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) complex under VSC\nusing femtosecond ultraviolet (UV)-pump/infrared (IR)-probe spectroscopy. We\nestablish ground-state VSC of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) in a microfluidic Fabry-P\\'erot\ncavity equipped with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated mirrors. ITO is effectively\ndichroic as it is reflective in the IR and transmissive in the UV-visible and\ntherefore minimizes optical interference. Excitation with UV pump light drives\nReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) into a manifold of electronic excited states which\nsubsequently undergo non-radiative relaxation dynamics. We probe the transient\nresponse of the strongly-coupled system in the mid-IR, observing both Rabi\ncontraction and cavity-filtered excited state absorption signatures. We\nreconstruct the intrinsic response of intracavity molecules from the transient\ncavity transmission spectra to enable quantitative comparison with extracavity\ncontrol experiments.

This Haldane state, arising\nfrom underscreening of the $S=3/2$ chain, is stable against small $D$ and\ncharacterized by topological edge modes. The nature of the $D$-driven\ntransitions out of this state depends on the environment. Coupling to a metal\n(semi-metal) is a relevant (irrelevant) perturbation at the decoupled fixed\npoint between the spin-1 chain and the two-dimensional electron gas. In the\nlarge positive $D$ limit, the system maps onto an anisotropic spin-$1/2$ Kondo\nsystem. For large negative $D$, in the Ising phase, spins are frozen. For small\n$J_k$, the nature of the metallic phase dominates. On a two-dimensional\nsemi-metal, the Kondo coupling is irrelevant at the decoupled fixed point\n($J_k= 0$), leading to a Kondo breakdown phase at weak coupling, irrespective\nof $D$. In contrast, on a two-dimensional metal, the resulting dissipative\nOhmic bath is a marginally relevant perturbation, inducing antiferromagnetic\nordering along the chain. In this case, $D$ drives a spin-flop transition\nbetween Ising and XY ordered phases. At $D=0$, we observe continuous\ntransitions between the Kondo breakdown or dissipation-induced long-range\nordered phases and the underscreened Haldane phase.

We describe three ways in which scalars that arise as duals\ncan differ from their garden-variety counterparts. Two of these -- the\ninterchange of weak and strong couplings and utility in bringing topological\ninformation to the low-energy theory -- are relatively well-known, but to these\nwe add a third: dualities that map derivative interactions to non-derivative\ninteractions seem not to commute with the general power-counting arguments that\nquantify control over the low-energy approximation within any EFT involving\ngravity. Since both sides of the duality must agree on their low-energy limit,\nthe non-derivative interactions on the scalar side of the duality turn out to\nbe suppressed relative to what would generically be assumed.

These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated\ntheoretical and experimental identification of active nanocatalysts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u6d3b\u6027\u7eb3\u7c73\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u901f\u7eb3\u7c73\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7b5b\u9009\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u52a8\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86Pt\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7eb3\u7c73\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

These properties are shared with the conifold locus in\nmoduli space, rather than the large complex-structure locus. The conifold locus\nis well-known to arise from integrating out a charged BPS state, and so the\nsimilarities suggest that the K-point also arises from integrating out a BPS\nstate.

The state behaves as\nif it had complex charges, or as if it couples to the self-dual and anti\nself-dual parts of the graviphoton differently.

In contrast to conventional approach, where the\nseparation of regions is performed via dimensional regularization which breaks\nthe dual conformal invariance (DCI) of separate contributions, we use the\nregularization which is sufficiently generic combination of dimensional and\nanalytic regularizations which preserves the DCI. Within this regularization,\nthe contribution of each region becomes DCI. We show that our method\ndramatically simplifies the calculations.

Specifically, we introduce a special operation that transfers the\nprobability amplitude of the quantum state into its orthogonal complement. This\noperation is followed by a measurement performed on this orthogonal subspace,\nenabling the undisturbed original quantum state to be regained. Remarkably,\nthis recovery is achieved without dependence of the post-measurement operation\non the measurement outcome, thus allowing the recovery without historical\ndependence. This constitutes a highly nontrivial phenomenon. From the\noperational perspective, as the no-cloning theorem forbids perfect and\nprobabilistic cloning of arbitrary quantum states, and traditional\npost-measurement reversal methods typically rely on operations contingent on\nthe measurement outcomes, it questions fundamental assumptions regarding the\nnecessity of historic dependence. From an informational perspective, since this\nrecovery method erases the information about the measurement outcome, it's\nintriguing that the information can be erased without accessing the measurement\noutcome.

We first discuss quantum field theory on a Schwarzschild background\nin the Boulware and Unruh vacua, and introduce the corresponding $S$-matrices.\nWe use this information to determine on-shell absorptive amplitudes describing\nprocesses where a black hole transitions to a different mass state by absorbing\nor emitting quanta, to all orders in gravitational coupling. This on-shell\napproach allows for a universal description of black holes, with their\nintrinsic differences encapsulated in the discontinuities of the amplitudes,\nwithout suffering from off-shell ambiguities such as gauge freedom.\nFurthermore, the absorptive amplitudes serve as building blocks to describe\nphysics beyond that of isolated black holes. As applications, we find that the\nHawking thermal spectrum is well understood by three-point processes.

To theoretically tackle the diverse correlated\nand topological states emerging from moir\\'e superlattices, one usually adopts\nan effective low-energy continuum model based on which the electron-electron\neffects are further considered. However, the construction of an accurate\ncontinuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moir\\'e\nsuperlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work,\nwe develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in\nprinciple applicable for arbitrary moir\\'e superlattices and are extrapolatable\nto any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic\nproperties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain\ninvariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external\ninputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the\ncoupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition\nenables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model\nusing a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we\ndesign a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density\nfunctional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer\nMoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately\nreproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures,\ncharge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist\nangles. Furthermore, the model extrapolates robustly to smaller twist angles.\nOur work not only provides a more precise understanding of the microscopic\nproperties of moir\\'e superlattices, but also lays a foundation for future\ntheoretical studies of low-energy electronic properties in generic moir\\'e\nsuperlattice systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The ANC geometry enables strong\ndipolar coupling at sub-50 nm separations while preserving independent current\nbias for each oscillator. We first characterize the auto-oscillation of a\nsingle ANC-SHNO, revealing a broad frequency tuning range and a\nfield-controlled crossover between negative and positive nonlinearities. We\nthen demonstrate that two such oscillators can mutually synchronize solely via\ndipolar stray fields, without electrical or spin-wave coupling.

We address this challenge by developing a\nhidden variable formulation that reveals hidden correlations in individual\ntrials. We represent jump sequences as logical propositions on energy\neigenstate occupations, where logical variables describe their truth values and\nchain operators describe their probabilities. To circumvent established no-go\ntheorems, we introduce a proposition selection rule that requires well-defined\njoint probabilities for a given density operator. This rule unifies\ncompatibility criteria for quantum and hidden variable theories, eliminating\nincompatible propositions that lead to value assignment paradoxes. Unlike\nconventional criteria mandating operator commutativity, it permits propositions\nthat become deterministic for specific initial conditions. This framework\nsystematically captures deterministic relations in individual trials, including\nthe exclusivity of state occupation implied by the observed jumps.

While machine learning\n(ML) decoders have demonstrated impressive performance for quantum memory,\ntheir use in algorithmic decoding - where logical gates create complex error\ncorrelations - remains limited. We introduce a modular attention-based neural\ndecoder that learns gate-induced correlations and generalizes from training on\nrandom circuits to unseen multi-qubit algorithmic workloads. Our decoders\nachieve fast inference and logical error rates comparable to most-likely-error\n(MLE) decoders across varied circuit depths and qubit counts. Addressing\nrealistic noise, we incorporate loss-resolving readout, yielding substantial\ngains when qubit loss is present. We further show that by tailoring the decoder\nto the structure of the algorithm and decoding only the relevant observables,\nwe can simplify the decoder design without sacrificing accuracy.

This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt\ncoefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking\nentanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a\ngeneralized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central\nprinciple of many-body physics to general interactions.

In contrast to equilibrium quantum critical\ntransitions, where entanglement is short-ranged, MIPTs possess long-range\nk-party genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) characterized by an infinite\nhierarchy of entanglement exponents for k >= 2. First, we represent the average\nspread of entanglement with \"entanglement clusters\", and use them to conjecture\ngeneral exponent relations: 1) classical dominance, 2) monotonicity, 3)\nsubadditivity. We then introduce measure-weighted graphs to construct such\nclusters in general circuits. Second, we obtain the exact entanglement\nexponents for a 1d MIPT in a measurement-only circuit that maps to percolation\nby exploiting non-unitary conformal field theory. The exponents, which we\nnumerically verify, obey the inequalities. We also extend the construction to a\n2d MIPT that maps to classical 3d percolation, and numerically find the first\nentanglement exponents. Our results provide a firm ground to understand the\nmultiparty entanglement of MIPTs, and more general ensembles of quantum\ncircuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
