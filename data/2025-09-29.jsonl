We evaluate the device performance through both single-beam and\ndual-beam atomic magnetometry measurements. Magnetic sensitivities better than\n200 fT/sqrt(Hz) are demonstrated along each of the three orthogonal axes,\nconfirming the potential of the approach for tri-axis magnetic field sensing at\nsub-picotesla resolution.

For this to happen, there must be, of course,\nsome asymmetry between their worldlines, along which the elapsed proper times\nare evaluated; such asymmetry might not be, however, so intuitively apparent.\nOur primary objective is to present, in a concise and didactic manner, some\nlesser-known results and derive novel ones from a modern, geometrical, and\ncovariant standpoint, which aims to clarify the issue and dispel related\nmisconceptions. First, we recall that: (i) the original ``twin paradox'' may be\nperfectly dealt with in special relativity (physics in a flat spacetime) and\ndoes not necessarily involve an accelerated twin. We then explore the issue of\ndifferential aging in general relativity (physics in a curved background) in\nthe prototypical case of the vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime, considering\nseveral pairs of twins. In this context, we show that: (ii) it is not true that\na twin which gets closer to the Schwarzschild horizon, by being subject to a\nstronger gravitational field, where time sort of slows down, should always get\nyounger than a twin that stays further away, in a region of weaker\ngravitational field, and (iii) it is also false that an accelerated twin always\nreturns younger than a geodesic one.

To address this, we optimized the Lennard-Jones 12-6 model for\nmonovalent ions for 1D-RISM with the partial series expansion of order 3\nclosure by fitting to experimental values of ion-oxygen distance (IOD),\nhydration free energy (HFE), partial molar volume (PMV) and mean activity\ncoefficient.

A second optimization step was necessary to account for the\ncation-anion interactions that affect the mean activity coefficients. The new\nparameters were validated at finite salt concentrations against experimental\ndata for 16 ion pairs and showed improved accuracy for 14 of them, while the\nresults for CsI and CsF were the second best. 1D-RISM results obtained with the\nnew NaCl parameters were used to calculate the preferential interaction\nparameter of the ions around the 24L B-DNA using 3D-RISM.

For fermions with contact interactions, these states are\nexact eigenstates of a paradigmatic model of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH)\nstates described by a single Haldane pseudopotential ($V_1$ for spin-polarized\nand $V_0$ for spinful systems), which realizes exact Laughlin and Haldane wave\nfunctions. We suggest that recently developed excitation and imaging techniques\nfor rotating few-fermion systems allow for a detailed experimental\ninvestigation of FQH wave functions and to study the crossover to large\nparticle number. We illustrate this for $N = 6$ spin-balanced fermions"}

By employing the matrix product\nstate (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we\nmitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically\nencountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power\nof these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair\nsystems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple\nradical pairs using Lindblad jump operators.

An entangled state is a nonlocal superposition of\nrealities that belong to a physical system. The common test of such a state has\nbeen done through Bell measurements. In this work, we attempt to look at this\nnotion from a different perspective. We study the evolution of the orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertia reference frames under a Lorentz\nboost. We consider two specific motions for the observers of the entanglement.\nFirst, we consider observers with zero relative motion (Zero-RM). Second, we\nchoose to have a non-zero relative motion (Non-Zero RM) for them. In the second\ncase, we distinguish between observer's perspective of the amplitude\nprobability from the perspective of rest (Non-Zero RM1) and moving (Non-Zero\nRM2) observers. As a result, the transition probability amplitudes are altered.\nWe observe that entanglement undergoes significant changes and is not preserved\nmaximally from the viewpoint of the stationary observers at the rest frame and\nasymptotically approaches a minimum close to the light cone (LC). However, from\nthe viewpoint of moving observer in the Non-Zero RM2, entanglement will not\nsurvive, and the final state is separable. This is an extremely important\nobservation since the concept of entanglement is supposed to be non-local, and\ntherefore free from any spacetime transformation. Our results demonstrated\nthrough the entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity show\nthat an entangled state is not non-local and hence the so-called collapse of\nthe wavefunction in quantum mechanics does not occur spontaneously in\nspacetime.

A\ntextbook example is the estimation of a classical field's amplitude using a\ntwo-level probe, as described by the semi-classical Rabi model. In this work,\nwe explore the fully quantum analogue, where the amplitude of a coherent\nquantized field is estimated by letting it interact with a two-level atom. For\nboth metrological scenarios, we focus on the quantum Fisher information (QFI)\nof the reduced state of the atomic probe. In the semi-classical Rabi model, the\nQFI is independent of the field amplitude and grows quadratically with the\ninteraction time $\\tau$. In contrast, when the atom interacts with a single\ncoherent mode of the field, the QFI is bounded by 4, a constant dictated by the\nnon-orthogonality of coherent states.

In the limit of large amplitude $\\alpha$, the\nQFI is found to attain its maximal value $1.47$ at $\\tau =O(1)$ and $\\tau\n=O(\\alpha^2)$, and also shows periodic revivals at much later times.

The wavefunction is discretised across a finite grid represented by\nsystem qubits, and the squared momentum operator is expressed using the\nfinite-difference method based on quantum translation operations. The\nrelativistic kinetic energy is approximated through a perturbative expansion of\nthe total kinetic Hamiltonian, incorporating higher-order momentum terms. The\napproach would allow variational optimisation of appropriate ansatz states to\nestimate both non-relativistic and relativistic ground-state energies on a\nquantum computer. This work offers a practical route to simulating relativistic\neffects on near-term quantum devices, supporting future developments in quantum\nphysics and chemistry."}

Similar\nto the original Hamiltonian model introduced by Fendley, these circuits are\ndefined by the fact that the Floquet operator corresponding to a single time\nstep can not be diagonalized by means of any Jordan-Wigner transformation, but\nstill displays a free-fermionic spectrum. Our construction makes use of\nsuitable non-local transfer matrices commuting with the Floquet operator,\nallowing us to establish the free fermionic spectrum. We also study the\ndynamics of these circuits after they are initialized in arbitrary product\nstates, proving that the evolution of certain local observables can be\nsimulated efficiently on classical computers. Our work proves recent\nconjectures in the literature and raises new questions on the classical\nsimulability of free fermions in disguise."}

One\nprominent example is the quantum double-slit experiment due to Feynman (1951,\n1966). A related non-quantum example, inspired by Boole (1862) and Vorob$'$ev\n(1962), has three two-valued random variables $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, where the pairs\n$X, Y$ and $X, Z$ are perfectly correlated, yet $Y, Z$ are perfectly\nanti-correlated. Such examples can be accommodated using a ``multi-measurable''\nspace with several different $ \\sigma $-algebras of measurable events. This\nconcept due to Vorob$'$ev (1962) allows construction of: 1) a measurable\nmeta\\-space whose elements combine a point in the original sample space with a\nvariable ``contextual'' Boolean algebra; 2) a parametric family of probability\nmeta\\-spaces, each of which is a Kolmogorov probability space that represents a\ntwo-stage stochastic process where a random choice from the original sample\nspace is preceded by the random choice of a contextual Boolean algebra in the\nmulti-measurable space. Subsequent work will explore how quantum experimental\nresults can be described using a quantum measurement tree with one or more\npreparation nodes where an experimental configuration is determined that\ngoverns the probability distribution of relevant quantum observables."}

Here any\nsuch observable is identified with: (i) an ``ortho-measurable'' function\ndefined on the Boolean ``ortho-algebra'' generated by the eigenspaces that form\nan orthogonal decomposition of $ \\C^n $; (ii) a ``numerically identified''\northogonal decomposition of $ \\C^n $. The latter means that each subspace of\nthe orthogonal decomposition can be uniquely identified by its own attached\nreal number, just as each eigenspace of a Hermitian matrix can be uniquely\nidentified by the corresponding eigenvalue. Furthermore, any density matrix on\n$ \\C^n $ is identified with a Bayesian prior ``ortho-probability'' measure\ndefined on the linear subspaces that make up the Boolean ortho-algebra induced\nby its eigenspaces. Then any pure quantum state is identified with a degenerate\ndensity matrix, and any mixed state with a probability measure on a set of\northogonal pure states.
