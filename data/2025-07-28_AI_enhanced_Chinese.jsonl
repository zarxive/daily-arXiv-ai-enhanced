Recent advances, most notably the incorporation\nof large ensembles of $^{229}$Th nuclei in transparent crystals and the\ndevelopment of pulsed vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) lasers, have enabled initial\nlaser spectroscopy of this transition. However, the lack of an intense,\nnarrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation. Here we\nintroduce and demonstrate the first continuous-wave laser at 148.4 nm,\ngenerated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in cadmium vapor. The source delivers 100\nnW of power with a linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength\ntunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth\nover all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm, marking a major advance\nin laser technology. We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique to\nplace a stringent upper bound on the phase noise induced by the FWM process and\ndemonstrate sub-hertz linewidth capability. These results eliminate the final\ntechnical hurdle to a $^{229}$Th-based nuclear clock, opening new directions in\nquantum metrology, nuclear quantum optics and precision tests of the Standard\nModel.

The two main factors modifying the PCI interaction in\ncondensed media is the screening of Coulombic interactions, and scattering of\nthe electrons. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a\npreviously reported semi-classical PCI theory modified to account for screening\nand scattering.

Bouncing cosmology has\nemerged as a promising alternative to standard cosmological models, offering a\nnon-singular approach to early universe dynamics by facilitating a \"bounce\"\nrather than a singular beginning. In this study, we explore the feasibility of\nmodeling specific bouncing scenarios within the framework of $ f(T,\n\\mathcal{T}) $ gravity, allowing for a comprehensive coupling between the\ntorsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\\mathcal{T}$.\nWe analyze two $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$ models: a linear model $f(T, \\mathcal{T}) =\n\\alpha T + \\beta \\mathcal{T}$ and a non-linear model $f(T, \\mathcal{T}) =\n\\alpha \\sqrt{-T} + \\beta \\mathcal{T}$, with a parameterized scale factor $a(t)\n= \\sqrt{a_0^2 + \\gamma^2 t^2}$ to capture the bounce behavior. The analysis\nconfirms a cosmic bounce at $t = 0 $, where the Hubble parameter $H = 0$\nsignals a transition from contraction to expansion. A crucial condition for\nachieving the bounce is the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near\nthe bounce, enabling the equation of state (EoS) parameter to enter the phantom\nregion ($\\omega < -1$).

Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has\nrecently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully\ncooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable\nfluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing\nof electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly\nunderstood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects\nand non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation\nof a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard\nmodels with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas\nmicroscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the\nhigh-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the\nground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data\ndemonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously\npair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing\npattern.

In this work, we investigate how these\ntwo forms of non-reciprocity interact in networks of neuronal populations. At\nthe local level, each population is modeled by a non-reciprocally coupled set\nof excitatory and inhibitory neural populations exhibiting transient\namplification and reactivity. At the network level, these populations are\ncoupled via directed, asymmetric connections that introduce structural\nnon-normality. Since non-reciprocal interactions generically lead to non-normal\nlinear operators, we frame both local and global asymmetries in terms of\nnon-normal dynamics. Using a modified Wilson-Cowan framework, we analyze how\nthe interplay between these two types of non-normality shapes the system's\nbehavior. We show that their combination leads to emergent collective dynamics,\nincluding fluctuation-driven transitions, dimensionality reduction, and novel\nnonequilibrium steady states.

One is the defining string equation of\nthe model and the other is the Gel'fand-Dikii equation satisfied by the\ndiagonal resolvent of an auxiliary Hamiltonian used to compute correlators of\nmacroscopic loops. In concert, when applied to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, the\nrecursive expansion of these two ODEs efficiently define, order by order in\ngenus, the Weil-Petersson volumes $V_{g,1}(b)$ for bordered hyperbolic Riemann\nsurfaces with one geodesic boundary (length $b$) and genus $g$. The method\nworks equally well for both ordinary and ${ N}{=}1$ supersymmetric JT gravity\ncases.

These effects could be\npartially mitigated using an array of antennas and by parallel transmission\nallowing for control of the radio-frequency field distribution in the region of\ninterest. All commonly-used radio-frequency arrays for ultra-high field MRI\nconsist of resonant elements: dipoles, TEM-resonators, loops and individual\nslots. All these elements rely on standing wave excitation, in the sense that\nthey are resonant devices that produce a field pattern with a constant phase\ndistribution along the commensurable conductor elements. However, it was shown\npreviously, that a non-uniform phase of surface current is required to reach\nthe ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio or a maximized signal in the\ndesired region of interest. In our work we propose to use a previously\ndemonstrated non-resonant leaky-wave approach to control the phase of currents\nin radio-frequency coil conductors to increase the B1+ field in the center or\nin the region of interest. Using this approach, we developed a radio-frequency\ncoil based on a leaky-wave antenna approach with optimized surface current\ndistribution resulting in stronger B1+ in the desired region compared to e.g. a\nfractionated dipole.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8d85\u9ad8\u78c1\u573aMRI\u4e2d\u653e\u5c04\u9891\u7387\u573a\u7684\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f0f\u6ce2\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u975e\u5171\u632f\u653e\u5c04\u9891\u7387\u7ebf\u5708\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6240\u9009\u533a\u57df\u7684\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u5f3a\u5ea6B1+\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u9ad8\u78c1\u573aMRI\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u653e\u5c04\u9891\u7387\u573a\u7684\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6f0f\u6ce2\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u975e\u5171\u632f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u9891\u7387\u7ebf\u5708\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u6240\u9009\u533a\u57df\u7684B1+\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5206\u6bb5\u78c1\u68d2\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u7ebf\u5708\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684B1+\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d85\u9ad8\u78c1\u573aMRI\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u9891\u7387\u573a\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As a specific example, we apply this formalism to\nan exact four dimensional asymptotically flat hairy black hole, namely the\ngeneralized Kaluza Klein (KK) black hole when the dilaton potential is\nincluded, and show that it is thermodynamically stable and has a non-trivial\ncritical behaviour corresponding to an inverted swallowtail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165'\u865a\u62df\u51e0\u4f55'\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u548c\u5170\u9053-\u76d6\u8328\u6bd4\u578b\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86'\u865a\u62df\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u52bf'\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e0e\u5305\u542b\u989d\u5916\u9879\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\u76f8\u5bb9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u6b21\u5bfc\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u529f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6848\u4f8b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u56db\u7ef4\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u79fb\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u9ed1\u4f53\uff0c\u5373\u5e7f\u4e49\u5e93\u62c9\u6cfd\u7f57\u5229\u9ed1\u8272\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5012\u7f6e\u7684\u53cc whistleblower.", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005 aims to\u62d3\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u62df\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u62df\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u865a\u62df\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u52bf\u53ca\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u6765\u5206\u6790\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7269\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u56db\u7ef4\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u79fb\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u9ed1\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a1. \u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u865a\u62df\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u52bf\u6ee1\u8db3\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\u30022. \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u660e\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u865a\u62df\u529f\u30023. \u5f53\u4e00\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a\u96f6\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0e\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u65b9\u7a0b\u5728\u89c6\u754c\u5904\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u30024. \u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u6d88\u5931\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u53cc\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u9006\u8f6c\u7f6e\u53cc\u5cf0\u76f8\u53d8\u30025. \u5e94\u7528\u5177\u4f53\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5373\u5e7f\u4e49\u5e93\u62c9\u6cfd\u7f57\u5229\u9ed1\u8272\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5176\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u548c\u7269\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u865a\u62df\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected\nnano-sized spin textures that can enable high-density low-power spin-based\nelectronics. Despite increasing interest in the discovery of new skyrmion hosts\nand their characterization, the electronic origins of the skyrmion formation\nremain unknown.

The nature\nof the electronic structure of GdRu2X2 is characterized by chemical bonding,\nFermi surface analysis, and density of energy function. As X-p orbitals become\nmore extended from Si-3p to Ge-4p and Sn-5p, improved interactions between the\nGd spins and the [Ru2X2] conduction layer and increased destabilizing energy\ncontributions are obtained.

This approach effectively provides a balance\nbetween the experimental viability of device-dependent (DD-QKD) and the minimal\ntrust assumptions of device-independent (DI-QKD). An analytical lower bound on\nthe asymptotic key rate is derived to provide security against collective\nattacks, in which the eavesdropper's information is limited only by the\nfunction of observed violation of a linear quantum steering inequality,\nspecifically the three-setting Cavalcanti--Jones--Wiseman--Reid (CJWR)\ninequality. We provide a closed-form key rate formula by reducing the security\nanalysis to mixtures of Bell-diagonal states by utilizing symmetries of the\nsteering functional. We show that the protocol tolerates higher quantum bit\nerror rates (QBER) than present DI-QKD protocols by benchmarking its\nperformance under depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we explore the impact of\ndetection inefficiencies and show that, in contrast to DI-QKD, which requires\nnear-perfect detection, secure key generation can be achieved even with lower\ndetection efficiency on the untrusted side.

In this work, we investigate the adiabatic radial\noscillation stability of neutron stars within the framework of Starobinsky\ngravity. We find that gravitational modifications can significantly impact\nstellar stability. Specifically, the higher-derivative nature of the theory\ncauses the exterior spacetime to dynamically respond to fluid oscillations, in\ncontrast to general relativity where Birkhoff's theorem ensures a static\nexterior. For stellar models with low central densities, the fundamental\nfrequency becomes nearly independent of the central density when the coupling\nconstant is large.

In particular, the\nexistence of disorder-order or order-order transitions has been increasingly\nreported in experimental and simulation studies, and the electrode potential\nidentified as the corresponding driving force. The microscopic mechanisms and\nthe stages of the process are, however, poorly understood, and the free energy\nvariation during the transition remain insufficiently characterized. To fill\nthis gap, we investigate the crystallization of the adsorbed layer in a\nprototypical molten salt-metal interface. We demonstrate that the transition\nfrom the disordered to ordered structures proceeds in two stages. Pre-ordering\neffects are observed across a wide range of potentials, resulting in the\nformation of a poly-crystalline structure on the electrode surface, before an\nabrupt ordering transition finally occurs. The pre-ordering displays signature\nof a continuous transition.

The computations also shed light on the renormalization procedure, ensuring consistency with the symmetries of the system.", "conclusion": "The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior of massless fields with arbitrary spin at null infinity, particularly in the context of supertranslation symmetries. The method used and the results are consistent with existing theories and provide a framework for future studies on renormalization and asymptotic symmetries in higher spin theories."}}

Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that\ncenter-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent\nSSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative\nptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR\nconverges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a\nvalue consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by\nrecent quantum Fisher information bounds.

In particular, we investigate how JQ, as a function of temperature\n$T$, chemical potential $\\mu$, and magnetic field $c_B$, serves as a probe for\nidentifying first-order phase transitions within the $(T,\\mu,c_B)$ parameter\nspace of holographic QCD. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of JQ\non the parameter $\\nu$, which characterizes longitudinal versus transverse\nanisotropy relative to the heavy-ion collision axis. By analyzing the\ndependence of the JQ parameters on these thermodynamic variables, we map\ncritical regions associated with phase boundaries. We compare our findings to\nearlier studies of the running coupling constant's behavior within the\ngauge-gravity duality framework. This approach provides new insights into the\ninterplay between non-perturbative dynamics and phase structure in strongly\ncoupled systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ee5\u89c4\u8303/\u5f15\u529b\u5bf9\u5076\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41Quench\u6548\u5e94\uff08JQ\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u52bf\u4e0b\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u9ea6\u514b\u65af\u97e6\u5c14- democracy\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8f7b\u91cd\u5b50\u548c\u91cd\u5b50\u7684QCD\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86JQ\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u52bf\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u56fe\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u7684Running\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41Quench\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u78b0\u649e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u8303/\u5f15\u529b\u5bf9\u5076\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u89c4\u8303/\u5f15\u529b\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u9ea6\u514b\u65af\u97e6\u5c14-\u6c11\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u52bf\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u6d41Quench\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86JQ\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0JQ\u53c2\u6570\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u52bf\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u7684Running\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u6d41Quench\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89c4\u8303/\u5f15\u529b\u5bf9\u5076\u5728\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, due to inevitable theoretical\napproximations and experimental imperfections, generating exact $k$-uniform\nstates is neither feasible nor necessary in practice. In this work, we initiate\nthe study of approximate $k$-uniform states, demonstrating that they are\nlocally indistinguishable from their exact counterparts unless massive\nmeasurements are performed. We prove that such states can be constructed with\nhigh probability from the Haar-random ensemble and, more efficiently, via\nshallow random quantum circuits.

This\nselection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the\ncircuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as\ncircuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally\nexpensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors\nincreases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based\npredictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic\nGraph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498\nquantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using\nQiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv,\nIBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte).\nPerformance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate\nfidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on\nthe trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting\nplatforms.

When local environments\nexhibit internal correlations, the structure of the noise determines which\ncollective modes become decoherence-protected. This leads to steady-state\nentanglement, phase locking, and exceptional points (EPs) in the Liouvillian\nspectrum, signaling a collapse of the mode basis and the emergence of\nnon-dissipative stabilized dynamics. Using a Lindblad framework, we show that\nsymmetry in the noise correlations acts as a control parameter, protecting\nsymmetric or antisymmetric modes depending on the sign of the correlation. In\nthe pure-dephasing limit, coherence decay mirrors the Anderson-Kubo model,\nwhere the effective fluctuation strength scales as $\\sigma^2(1 \\pm \\xi)$, and\nthe dynamical regime (Gaussian vs. Lorentzian) is set by the ratio \\( \\sigma /\n\\gamma \\). Thus, the environment not only drives decoherence but can also\nselectively suppress it through symmetry filtering.

While there exist the no-hiding and\nno-masking theorems, approximate quantum information masking (AQIM) offers a\npromising means of circumventing the constraints. Despite its potential, AQIM\nstill remains underexplored, and constructing explicit approximate maskers\nremains a challenge. In this work, we investigate AQIM from multiple\nperspectives and propose using random isometries to construct approximate\nmaskers. First, different notions of AQIM are introduced and we find there are\nprofound intrinsic connections among them. These relationships are\ncharacterized by a set of figures of merit, which are introduced to quantify\nthe deviation of AQIM from exact QIM. We then explore the possibility of\nrealizing AQIM via random isometries in bipartite and multipartite systems. In\nbipartite systems, we identify a fundamental lower bound for a key figure of\nmerit, implying that almost all random isometries fail to realize AQIM. This\nsurprising result generalizes the original no-masking theorem to the\nno-random-AQIM theorem for bipartite systems. In contrast, in multipartite\nsystems, we show almost all random isometries can realize AQIM. Remarkably, the\nnumber of physical qubits required to randomly mask a single logical qubit\nscales only linearly. We further explore the implications of these findings.
