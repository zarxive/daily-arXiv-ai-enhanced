This study introduces strategies to compute RQA measures directly from time series or phase space vectors, avoiding the need to construct RPs. The calculations can be further accelerated and optimised by applying a random sampling procedure, in which only a subset of line structures is evaluated. These modifications result in shorter run times, less memory use and access, and lower overall energy consumption during analysis while maintaining accuracy. This makes them especially appealing for large-scale data analysis and machine learning applications. The ideas are not limited to diagonal line measures, but can likewise be applied to vertical line-based measures and to recurrence network measures. By lowering computational costs, the proposed strategies contribute to energy saving and sustainable data analysis, and broaden the applicability of recurrence-based methods in modern research contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

On the other hand, interactions are rarely uniform in real systems. By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^\u03b1$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $\u03b1$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $\u03b1$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $\u03b1=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $\u03b1\\rightarrow \\infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $\u03b1$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $\u03b1=0$, we find that for small $\u03b1$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $\u03b1=0$. At intermediate $\u03b1$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $\u03b1$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $\u03c4$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $\u03b1$ when $\u03c4$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $\u03b1$. We further confirm these results using effective dimension and spectral statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While single-crystal studies have demonstrated excellent timing resolution by leveraging prompt Cherenkov photons, practical detector modules based on pixelated arrays introduce a high prevalence of inter-crystal scattering (InterCS) events, complicating timing accuracy. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impact of InterCS on BGO Cherenkov timing using a dual-pixel detector coupled to a segmented SiPM readout. Events were classified into full-energy deposition (FED; primary crystal 511 keV absorption), InterCS, and penetration types via energy-weighted positioning and validated using GATE simulations, which also revealed that over 25% of the experimentally identified full-energy events involved intra-crystal scatter (IntraCS). For InterCS events, the optimal timestamp selection was achieved by choosing the earlier of the two timestamps, yielding a coincidence timing resolution of 221 ps FWHM (831 ps FWTM)-markedly worse than the 184 ps (603 ps FWTM) obtained for FED events. Furthermore, prompt photon yield was found to decrease measurably due to energy splitting: InterCS events averaged 4.73 detected photons in the first 1 ns, compared to 5.76 for FED events.

Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $\u03c9_{\\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum.

Recent results on Haar random encoding suggest a breakdown of complementary recovery, in which no logical operators can be reconstructed from individual bipartite subsystems. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretation where a baby universe emerges as logical degrees of freedom that cannot be accessed from either boundary alone, assuming pseudorandom dynamics in holographic CFTs. We then analyze two conceptual puzzles: an apparent cloning of baby-universe microstates and its eventual fate at the singularity. Both puzzles are avoided because no single boundary observer can access the baby-universe degrees of freedom, be it classical or quantum, reflecting an emergent form of complementarity due to the structure of random encoding. In this interpretation, observers arise naturally: the same heavy operator that prepares the baby-universe geometry also serves as observer-like degrees of freedom that define an observer-dependent baby-universe microstate.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods.

Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms.

The local thermal conductivity is proposed to describe the non-uniform spatial distribution of heat transport capability in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems. The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots. Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of hotspot spacing on thermal transport are investigated, showing that reducing the hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%.

The artificial magnetic flux typically introduces Peierls phase factors, which induces complex-valued hopping amplitudes and leads to directed net particle currents along the chains. By further incorporating the finite inter-ring coupling and biased intra-ring hopping, we reveal that the tuning of the drive frequency and Peierls phase allows the precise control over both the intensity and direction of particle currents, which facilitates the transition between chiral and antichiral dynamics.

By moving the two synchronous oppositely circularly polarized XUV pulses (that make the ionizing LP pulse) apart in time, we propose an attosecond double-slit streak camera scheme to see information loss in polarization-dependent two-slit phenomena. Such streaking interferogram is then composed of several Feynman's thought experiments in time domain, in which electrons are affected by the IR pulse as they exit the two attoslits upon XUV ionization processes to form Archimedean spiral patterns. As a proof-of-principle, when the IR femtofield and first XUV attopulse are synchronous, a loss of contrast through dephasing is seen in the simulated momentum and energy distributions of the photoelectron.

Here, we report an electrically pumped, room-temperature, broadband, compact, and tunable TFC by integrating an actively mode-locked resonant tunneling diode (RTD) in a metallic waveguide.

Moreover, we show that the repetition frequency of the TFC can be tuned from 0.9 to 50 GHz by the injected RF signal, and a 120 Gbps (16 Gbps per channel) data rate can be achieved in the TFC-based high-speed single-channel (multi-channel) wireless communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We consider this issue by investigating attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at the Br M4,5 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges (66 to 80 eV), tracking core-to-valence (3d to 4p) and core-to-Rydberg (3d to ns, np, n $\\geq$ 5) transitions from the molecular to atomic limit. The progress of dissociation can be ascertained by the buildup of the atomic absorption in time. Notably, the measured rise times of the 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ to 4p transitions depend on the probed core level final state, 38 $\\pm$ 1 and 20 $\\pm$ 5 fs for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ at 64.31 and 65.34 eV, respectively. Simulations by the nuclear time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation reproduce the rise-time difference of the 3d to 4p transitions, and the theory suggests several important factors. One is the transition dipole moments of each probe transition have different molecular and atomic values for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ versus $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ that depend on the bond length. The other is the merger of multiple molecular absorptions into the same atomic absorption, creating multiple timescales even for a single probe transition. Unfortunately, the core-to-Rydberg absorptions did not allow accurate atomic Br buildup times to be extracted due to spectral overlaps with ground state bleaching, otherwise an even more comprehensive picture of the role of the probe state transition would be possible. This work shows that the measured probe signals accurately contain the dissociative wavepacket dynamics but also reveal how the specific probe transition affects the apparent progress toward dissociation with bond length. Such potential probe-transition-dependent effects need to be considered when interpreting measured signals and their timescales.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates bond-breaking dynamics of Br\u2082 using attosecond XUV spectroscopy, revealing variation in dissociation times across methods and providing insights into transition dependence on bond length.", "motivation": "Understanding reaction mechanisms at the atomic scale requires precise measurement of bond-breaking dynamics, which are crucial for fields like quantum chemistry and materials science.", "method": "Attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy was used to study core-to-valence and core-to-Rydberg transitions at the Br M4,5 edges.", "result": "Probe transition dynamics affect observed timescales: 3d to 4p transitions have rise times of ~38-20 fs, while 3d to Rydberg transitions show complex, multiple timescale features due to spectral overlaps.", "conclusion": "Dissociation dynamics depend significantly on the choice of probe transition, offering a nuanced understanding that must be considered in future experiments and data interpretations."}}

However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects.

Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral.

In this study, we demonstrate coherent spin-wave propagation in an hybrid ASI system, which is based on a multilayered ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetized nanoelements embedded within it. We show that this system enables spin-wave transmission over a one-micrometer distance via exchange-mediated coupling between subsystems and evanescent spin-wave tunneling through the out-of-plane magnetized parts. This system overcomes the limitations of purely dipolar interactions in standard ASIs while preserving their fundamental properties.

Conventional approaches to generate and manipulate these excitations rely on external gauge fields and structured light modulation, or microcavity TE-TM polarization splitting. While the former can only access the polariton pseudospin indirectly, through separate coupling of the excitonic or photonic component, the latter suffers from a lack of deterministic control over the resulting topological defects. Here, we report the generation of topology-induced spin polaritons in a monolithic bound state in the continuum (BIC) perovskite metasurface with broken inversion symmetry. Upon condensation, spin-momentum locking enables the generation of a pair of half-vortex within the polariton fluid, which display mutual attraction due to the connecting polarization string linking their opposite spins. We find that an increase in polariton density, enhancing the characteristic blueshift of the emission spectrum, leads to a narrowing of the inter-vortex separation, revealing deterministic interactions pinned to the cavity topology. By harnessing structural control alone, our approach enables robust engineering of the intrinsic pseudospin texture of the polariton fluid, offering a versatile platform for manipulating vortex nucleation, interaction, and annihilation without employing external fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unlike traditional rigid sensors, this device leverages the unique layered structure and ultra-wide bandgap of GaPS4 to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting NO2. The intrinsic plastic deformability of the material enables it to conform tightly to complex curved pipelines like an \"electronic bandage,\" completely eliminating monitoring blind spots. Nanoindentation tests reveal that its extremely low hardness (0.20 GPa) confers exceptional flexibility while maintaining stable electrical characteristics even under bent states. The device exhibits a linear response to NO2 concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 ppm at room temperature. Although the limited defects in the single-crystal material result in pA-level response currents, defect engineering offers a viable pathway for performance enhancement. This study breaks through the conventional boundaries of plastic inorganic semiconductors confined to photoelectric and thermoelectric applications, opening new avenues for their use in gas sensing and advancing gas monitoring technology toward \"conformal integration.\"", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To this end, we conducted a three-day workshop to construct an operational 0.27T MRI scanner. The workshop hosted 16 participants, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows, trainers, and students, who collaborated to build the scanner using open-source hardware and software components. Teams were designated to focus on various subsystems, including the magnet, passive shimming, radiofrequency (RF) coils, gradient coils, data acquisition, and reconstruction. Pre-workshop preparation involved simulation-based design processes and fabrication techniques, which incorporated configuring MaRCoS and PyPulseq libraries, CNC machining, and 3D printing. During the workshop, participants assembled an H-shaped magnet, which achieved a peak magnetic field strength of 0.269T. Passive shimming effectively reduced the field inhomogeneity from 3mT to 2mT. A 3 cm diameter RF solenoid was built and tuned to 11.4 MHz. The gradients exhibited less than 5% non-linearity in simulations and were fabricated by CNC machining copper plates. The assembled system was used to acquire a 2D spin echo of a water phantom. Following the workshop, the system was further optimized to scan relaxometry phantoms. A post-workshop survey was carried out, revealing over 87% satisfaction.

When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach. Their realization would require either new ingredients, such as Casimir energy, or black holes with reduced symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations.

The feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware. This represents an \"offline closed-loop, online open-loop\" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value <Z>, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution.

Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy.\n  As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\\% savings in generalized system costs.

In fact we generalize the well-known Berg theory, which describes diffusion-controlled reactions occurring within a spherically symmetric absorber-cavity system. The trapping probability and the reaction rate at which a small diffusing particle is captured by an axially symmetric one reactive patch absorber inside a spherical cavity were found semi-analytically and numerically by means of the dual series relations method. This approach leads to such incredibly fast convergence, that it may rightly be referred to as exact one. The results obtained can be used to test numerical programmes that describe diffusion-controlled reactions in real physical systems for reactants with arbitrary anisotropic reactivity, which are located inside of various cavities as well as in the unbounded domains.

Such a black hole has a single (external) horizon located very near the Schwarzschild radius, $r_h=2M$, while its surface of unstable bound geodesics (photon sphere) is located at a moderately shortened radius than its Schwarzschild counterpart. Relying on a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk with a monochromatic emission described by suitable adaptations of Standard Unbound profiles previously employed in the literature, we generate images of this solution, which displays relevant modifications to the typical photon ring and central brightness depression features found in black hole images. In this sense, we fit the width of the two first photon rings in order to reconstruct the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound geodesics characterizing the theoretical ratio of successive rings. Such an exponent is tightly attached to observational features of photon rings such as their relative intensities in time-averaged images and the time-scale of hot-spots. Our results point out that non-singular black holes of this type are hard to distinguish from their Schwarzschild counterparts using this method alone, since the theoretical, numerical, disk-modeling, and observational uncertainties are too entangled with one another to allowing a neat distinction of such an exponent. It also points out to the need of incorporating dynamical settings such as hot-spots or quasi-normal modes from gravitational wave ringdowns as a way to circumvent such difficulties.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures).

Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series.

The effect is referred to as vibrational transportation, or as a surface acoustic wave motor. A traditional theory of vibrational transportation considers a particle as a material point moving on a rigid substrate. A more realistic representation is a contact model based on Cattaneo-Mindlin (also called Hertz-Mindlin) mechanics applicable to an axisymmetric deformable particle. A recent semi-analytical extension of the Cattaneo-Mindlin solution called the Method of Memory Diagrams allows one to compute the hysteretic friction force for an arbitrary loading history in terms of contact displacements, and, subsequently, to numerically solve the equations of motion. Depending on the materials' and excitation parameters, the particle can stay in permanent contact with the substrate or experience multiple jumps. In the former case, the particle can slide along the surface, during each wave period, advancing and receding with different efficiencies, which finally results in a drift. The drift can occur both in the wave propagation direction and against it. In the regime of multiple jumps, directed horizontal motion is also possible. It is based on synchronization between the wave period and rebounding events. A rebound occurs once per period and consistently at the same phase. At the beginning of the process, the particle moves with an acceleration that decreases and finally disappears. Exactly the same type of motion against the wave has been observed in our preliminary experiments. We demonstrate that a point mass behaves differently: in a regime of permanent contact, negative and positive sliding are equilibrated, which produces no drift, whereas multiple rebounds of a point mass are always chaotic, at least for fully conservative collisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9897\u7c92\u5728\u8868\u9762\u58f0\u6ce2\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u6f02\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eCattaneo-Mindlin\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6f02\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9897\u7c92\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u4f17\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528Cattaneo-Mindlin\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9897\u7c92\u8fd0\u52a8\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u9897\u7c92\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6bcf\u6b21\u63a5\u89e6\u5468\u671f\u5185\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8fdb\u9000\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a2a\u5411\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u52a0\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Dissipation and pumping are introduced via local linear Lindblad jump operators and treated exactly using the third--quantization / Majorana covariance formalism. Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization.

The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures.

For the first time, we systematically examine the influence of the black hole charge, electromagnetic interactions, and field mass on the equatorial cross section. Our results reveal that regardless of whether the electromagnetic interaction is present or not, the frame-dragging effect shifts the glory away from the exact backward direction and can place interference minima there, contrasting with the on-axis scattering case. The average scattered flux intensity at the medium to large scattering angles exhibits a large enhancement as the Lorentz attraction or field mass increases, particularly in the slowly rotating regime, with the enhancement being frequency-dependent. When superradiance occurs, we observe that the cross section in the prograde scattering angles ($\\sim 135^{\\circ} < \u03c6< 270^{\\circ}$) increases as the black hole spin increases, due to enhanced prograde partial wave contributions. Meanwhile, the superradiant scattering cross section increases in all (except the forward) directions when the Lorentz force becomes more repulsive.

We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u7fa4\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6676\u683c\u5bf9\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6cd5\u5219\u53ca\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6676\u683c\u5bf9\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7fa4\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BSE\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u9009\u4ee3\u89c4\u5219\u53ca\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6676\u4f53\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b50\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, they inherit a property of their non-relativistic counterpart that makes them divergent for models with multiple fields, unless a regularity condition is satisfied. This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line.

Intriguingly, the vertices of this non-relativistic theory are less constrained than the ones of the original $4d$ chiral massless theory since we do not have enough dynamical generators to fix the couplings uniquely. Anticipating higher-spin interactions should be suppressed, we propose a simple approximate mass-spin relation which interpolates between the relativistic and non-relativistic regimes. With the proposed mass-spin relation, we observe that that higher-spin interactions indeed become suppressed at large spins, consistent with low-energy physics.

We also show the performance of the technique in quantum experiments, highlighting its potential use in near-term applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684M0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5806\u53e0Ansatz\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6765\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u5931\u771f\u4e00\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u9664\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5f53\u524d\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408M0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5806\u53e0\u578bAnsatz\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u74f7\u7816M0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5806\u53e0\u578bAnsatz\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9M0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u57fa\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LiH\u3001H\u2082\u3001H\u2082O\u3001butadiene\u548cbenzene\uff084-12 qubits\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0eM0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8fd1-term\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u74f7\u7816M0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfM0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent breakthroughs in strong-coupling electro-optic modulation further expanded their accessible nonlinear dynamics, unlocking new phenomena and functionalities, but the underlying foundation remains largely unexplored. Here we establish a universal theoretical and experimental framework for nonlinear combs under arbitrary electro-optic modulation by introducing a general evolution equation (GEE) that transcends the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation. The GEE reduces to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian that provides a frequency-domain formalism unifying strong-coupling electro-optic modulation with photonic synthetic dimensions. Together with a band-wave correspondence linking modulation waveforms to synthetic band structures, the formalism enables programmable spectral control. We further show compatibility between Kerr nonlinearity and strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, highlighting their cooperative dynamics. Our work provides a foundational model for strong-coupling electro-optics in nonlinear combs, opening a route toward chip-integrated, microwave-programmable comb sources for metrology, spectroscopy, and emerging photonic technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7535\u5149\u8c03\u5236\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u5149_comb\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u8c03\u5236\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7535\u5149\u8c03\u5236\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u5149_comb\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u6ce2\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5408\u6210\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u901a\u7528\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08GEE\uff09\u6765\u6269\u5c55Lugiato-Lefever\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7535\u5149\u8c03\u5236\u4e0eKerr\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u534f\u540c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6750\u6599\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5fae\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u5408\u6210\u8bbe\u5907\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u5149\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5149\u9891\u7387\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector.

Draft submitting for \"Optics and Lasers in Engineering.\"", "summary": "Wavefront reconstruction in lateral shearing interferometry typically assumes that the shear amount is an integer multiple of the sampling interval. When the shear is fractional, approximating it with the nearest integer value leads to noticeable reconstruction errors. To address this, we propose a weighted integer shear averaging method. The approach combines reconstructions from nearby integer shears with carefully chosen weights designed to cancel the dominant error terms. Analytical error analysis shows that two-shear averaging removes first-order errors, while three-shear averaging removes second-order errors. Numerical simulations with a test wavefront confirm that the method achieves significantly lower RMS error than conventional single-shear reconstruction. The technique is simple, computationally efficient, and can be readily extended to two-dimensional interferometry.

In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Efficient tunable THz sources based on BiFeO3 with phonon-polariton coupling demonstrated.", "motivation": "Understanding and controlling THz generation in multiferroic materials for applications in optoelectronics and sensing.", "method": "Used epitaxial BiFeO3 films and Pt layers, likely employing optical rectification with different film thicknesses to tune emission wavelength.", "result": "Achieved sub-bandgap THz emission in 0.4-0.8 THz, tunable emission spectrum via modulating Pt layer thickness, and photocatalytic generation of polaritons for wave emission.", "conclusion": "Hybrid phonon-polariton systems in BiFeO3 provide versatile THz sources tunable by material and structural properties, opening new avenues in THz technology through multiferroic multilayers."}}

For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids.

We treat in detail the cases of $2$ and $4$ spacetime dimensions.}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5076\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea62n\u4e2d\u4e0eChern-Simons\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3aGL(2n)\u8054\u7edc\u548c\u5185\u7a7a\u95f4\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u5f53n=1\u65f6\uff0c\u57282\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675fBF\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728n>1\u65f6\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u57df\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u501f\u9274Chern-Simons\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5947\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u5076\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u62d3\u5c55\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7ef4\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6784\u9020\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165GL(2n)\u8054\u7edc\u548c\u5185\u7a7a\u95f4\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u6570\u6839\u636en\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790n=1\u548cn=2\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a2\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\uff08n=1\uff09\u4e2d\u7406\u8bba\u9610\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675fBF\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08n>1\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u57df\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5c40\u57df\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5076\u6570\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86GL(2n)\u8054\u7edc\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing DUV microscopes typically rely on specialized optics and DUV-sensitive cameras, which restrict field of view, increase system complexity and cost, and often require high illumination doses that risk photodamage. Here, we report a low-dose deep-UV lensless holographic microscopy platform that uses standard board-level CMOS sensors designed for visible light, eliminating all imaging optics and dedicated DUV detectors. Our system achieves large field-of-view (up to 116 mm2) DUV imaging with low illumination and label-free phase and chemically specific amplitude contrast. A specialized defocus/wavelength diverse pixel super-resolution reconstruction with total-variation regularization and robust autofocusing halves the effective sensor pixel pitch and yields down to 870 nm lateral resolution. We demonstrate chemically specific, label-free bioimaging on challenging specimens, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular vesicles and unstained mouse liver tissue. In liver sections, imaging at \u03bb = 330 nm reveals lipid- and retinoid-rich accumulations that co-localize with Oil Red O staining, enabling label-free identification of hepatic stellate (Ito) cells. This combination of low-dose operation, chemically specific contrast and standard CMOS hardware establishes DUV lensless holographic microscopy as a practical and scalable route to high-content submicron-resolution whole-slide preparation-free bioimaging without exogenous labels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u7684DUV\u65e0\u955c\u5934\u5e72\u6d89\u5149\u6805\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7684CMOS\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c6\u573a\uff08116 mm\u00b2\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u663e\u5fae\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002DUV\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56e0\u5176\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53d7\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709DUV\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684DUV\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u7126\u70b9\u5e72\u6d89\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7684CMOS\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u6210\u50cf\uff09\u6765\u91c7\u96c6DUV\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u6563\u7126\u548c\u591a\u6563\u7126\u50cf\u7d20\u8d85\u7ea7\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\uff08\u7ed3\u5408Total-Variation\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u81ea\u805a\u7126\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u50cf\u7d20\u5c3a\u5bf8\u51cf\u534a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea6870 nm\u7684\u95f4\u8ddd\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728 challenging\u6837\u672c\uff08\u5982\u9175\u6bcd\u83cc\u3001\u80de\u5916osome\u548c\u672a\u4e0a\u8272\u7684\u809d\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6837\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6210\u50cf\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u809d\u810f\u5207\u7247\u4e2d\uff0cDUV\u5149\u8c31\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u80fd\u591f\u6e05\u6670\u663e\u793a\u8102\u7c7b\u548c\u6297\u539f\u7684\u805a\u96c6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eOle festival\u67d3\u8272\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc6\u522b\u809d\u661f\u7ec6\u80de\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5149\u5b50\u6570\u3001\u65e0\u4f20\u7edf\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684DUV\u65e0\u7126\u70b9\u5e72\u6d89\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6CMOS\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u7269\u6210\u50cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u53cb\u578b\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u663e\u5fae\u6210\u50cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Dynamic and reconfigurable metalenses are key to next-generation flat-optics platforms, yet their practical realization remains limited by slow response, optical loss, and polarization sensitivity. The integration of chalcogenide phase-change materials with metasurface architectures offers a powerful platform for dynamic optical tunability, owing to materials such as Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) that can reversibly switch between amorphous and crystalline states with distinct refractive indices. However, the strong optical absorption of crystalline GST in the visible to near-infrared range has hindered its widespread use in reconfigurable metalenses. In this study, we design an all-dielectric polarization-insensitive metasurface based on hybrid Si--GST nanostructures to realize a dynamically tunable bifocal metalens operating at 1.55 \u03bcm. The device achieves a variable focal length from 70 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm, with focusing efficiencies of 30% in the amorphous state and 20% in the crystalline state, as validated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we show that flat-top laser excitation enables uniform, reversible phase transitions within tens of nanoseconds -- amorphization in approximately 13~ns and crystallization in approximately 90~ns -- without mechanical motion or electrical bias. For next-generation metasurfaces intended for uses including beam steering, dynamic holography, optical routing, multi-depth imaging, and optical communication, this method shows great promise due to its control and stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u5206\u5c42\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5e73\u9762\u5149\u5b66\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u53d1\u6325\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u7f13\u6162\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u635f\u8017\u548c\u6781\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6750\u6599\u914d\u5408\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u6805\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5229\u7528Ge\u2082Sb\u2082Te\u2085\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u53d8\u6750\u6599\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u81f3\u77ed\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6676\u4f53Ge\u2082Sb\u2082Te\u2085\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5438\u5149\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5c42\u955c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6742\u5316Si-GST\u7684\u5168\u7535\u4ecb\u8d28\u975e\u6781\u5316\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e1.55\u03bcm\u6ce2\u957f\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u53cc\u7126\u5206\u5c42\u955c\u3002\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece70\u03bcm\u5230200\u03bcm\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u7126\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u7b11\u72b6\u6548\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a30%\u548c20%\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u9762\u6fc0\u5149\u5747\u5300\u4e14\u53ef\u9006\u5730\u5728\u6570\u5341\u7eb3\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u76f8\u53d8\u3002COMSOL Multiphysics\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u53d8\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5168\u7535\u4ecb\u8d28\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5c42\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0 anyone\u5c42\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5149\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u52a8\u6001 rebuilding\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u7f13\u6162\u3001\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5bf9\u6781\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u6750\u6599\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6742\u5316Si-GST\u7684\u5168\u7535\u4ecb\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u8c03\u53cc\u7126\u5206\u5c42\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u65f6\u57df\u6a21\u62df(FDTD)\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528COMSOL Multiphysics\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u5c55\u793a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5e73\u9762\u6fc0\u5149\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bcc\u6587\u672c_distances \u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u65e0\u76f8\u4f4d\u53d8\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5149\u805a\u7126\u6548\u7387\u4e3a30%\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u76f8\u4f4d\u53d8\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u4e3a20%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5927\u7ea613ns\u81f390ns\u53ef\u9006\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u673a\u68b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6216\u7535\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6742\u5316Si-GST\u7684\u5168\u7535\u4ecb\u8d28\u975e\u6781\u5316\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5c42\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u675f\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u52a8\u6001 holography\u3001\u5149\u5bfc\u3001\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moir\u00e9 bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized \"chiral-flat\" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moir\u00e9 superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ans\u00e4tze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekul\u00e9 spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first \"case study\". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications.

Recent advances in solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) and nanophotonics have transformed the landscape of quantum photonic technologies, enabling scalable generation of quantum states of light and matter. A new frontier in solid-state quantum photonics is the engineering of many-body interactions between QEs and photons to achieve robust coherence and controllable many-body entanglement. These entangled states, including photonic graph and cluster states, superradiant emission, and emergent quantum phases, are promising for quantum computation, sensing, and simulation. However, intrinsic inhomogeneities and decoherence in solid-state platforms pose significant challenges to realize such complex entangled states. This review provides an overview of the fundamental many-body interactions and dynamics at the light-matter interfaces of solid-state QEs, and discusses recent advances in mitigating decoherence and harnessing robust many-body coherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper reviews the preparation and control of quantum states in solid-state quantum emitters and nanophotonics, highlighting recent advances in many-body interactions and coherence while addressing challenges from inhomogeneities and decoherence.", "motivation": "It's a comprehensive review paper focusing on the state-of-the-art progress in solid-state quantum photonics, emphasizing the engineering of many-body interactions and coherence for quantum applications.", "method": "The paper presents a systematic review, discussing theoretical models, experimental techniques, and applications of solid-state quantum states.

The tensionless (Carrollian) limit induces a universal gluing between the worldsheet oscillators, which we generalize to include the effects of a constant $B$-field. We derive the modified mixed boundary conditions, construct the corresponding gluing matrix and obtain the generalized induced vacuum as a squeezed boundary state. This vacuum continuously emerges from the closed string vacuum through a Bogoliubov transformation, providing a precise realization of the closed-to-open string transition. We further extend the analysis to toroidal compactifications, and show that the mechanism of worldsheet Bose-Einstein condensation persists unaltered. In the second part of the paper, we give a unified symplectic derivation of the open string noncommutative parameter. We show that the boundary symplectic form alone determines the noncommutative geometry, and that in the tensionless limit the $B$-field term becomes the unique surviving contribution. Its inverse produces a noncommutative parameter similar to the Seiberg-Witten result, but arising intrinsically from the Carrollian worldsheet dynamics. Our results establish a coherent picture in which the emergence of open strings, boundary noncommutativity, and generalized vacuum structure all arise naturally from the worldsheet geometry of null strings in a $B$-field background.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f20\u529b\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684 bosonic \u5f26\u5728 Kalb-Ramond \u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f26\u5728 tensionless \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ece\u95ed\u5f26\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e sting\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 worldsheet \u7684Bogoliubov \u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u95ed\u5f26\u7684 vacuum \u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u5f26\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u8fb9\u7f18\u771f\u7a7a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 Toroidal \u7d27\u81f4\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0 worldsheet \u7684 Bose-Einstein \u51dd\u805a\u4f9d\u7136\u662f\u9002\u7528\u7684\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 \u8fb9\u754c symplectic \u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86 open string \u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5728 tensionless \u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c$B$-\u573a\u9879\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e Seiberg-Witten \u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u5f26\u5206\u652f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728 tensionless \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u95ed\u5f26\u5230\u5f00\u653e\u5f26\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u51e0\u4f55\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u70ed\u95e8\u8bdd\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 Kalb-Ramond \u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u5f20\u529b\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684 bosonic \u5f26\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Carrollian \u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 worldsheet \u7684Bogoliubov \u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u6df7\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c gluing matrix\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u771f\u7a7a\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73af\u9762\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u7ee7\u7eed\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 worldsheet \u7684 Bose-Einstein \u51dd\u805a\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e symplectic derivation \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c symplectic \u5f62\u5f0f\u5355\u72ec\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5f20\u529b\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c$B$-\u573a\u9879\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f20\u529b\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 Kalb-Ramond \u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76 bosonic \u5f26\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u95ed\u5f26\u5230\u5f00\u653e\u5f26\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020 worldsheet \u7684 gluing matrix \u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u771f\u7a7a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c symplectic \u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86 open string \u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5f20\u529b\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d $B$-\u573a\u9879\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e Seiberg-Witten \u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u543b\u5408\u3002\u73af\u9762\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u9002\u7528 Bose-Einstein \u51dd\u805a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\uff0c\u5728\u5f20\u529b\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684 bosonic \u5f26\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728 Kalb-Ramond \u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 worldsheet \u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c Bogoliubov \u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u95ed\u5f26\u5230\u5f00\u653e\u5f26\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020 gluing matrix \u548c\u8fb9\u754c symplectic \u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86 open string \u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u5728\u73af\u9762\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u652f\u76f8\u543b\u5408\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5f20\u529b\u4e3a\u96f6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u652f\u548c\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u51e0\u4f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Exploiting the strong Raman activity and high second-order nonlinearity of LNOI, we engineered a dispersion-optimized microring with a loaded Q factor of 3.86X10^6, facilitating on-chip efficient broadband coherent light source. A novel phase-matching configuration with all the waves of the same ordinary polarization was realized for the first time in this platform, feasibly enabling modal-phase matched Raman-quadratic nonlinear processes that extend lasing signals into the visible spectrum. Under continuous-wave laser pumping at 3.73 mW in the telecom band, we achieved a Raman-assisted soliton comb centered at 1624.49 nm with record-low pump threshold on the LNOI platform. Concurrently, multi-chromatic Raman lasing outputs were observed at ~1700, ~813, and ~535 nm within the same microring.

Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The classical soft photon theorem constrains the constant term and leading power-law fall-off of the emitted waveform at asymptotic times solely in terms of the momenta and charges of the incoming and outgoing particles. In this work, we extend the analysis to include the full tower of subleading corrections in the late-time and early-time expansion of the electric and magnetic waveforms, providing explicit expressions that depend only on the kinematic data and the electric and magnetic charges of the scattered objects. Using independent electric and magnetic potentials, we compute the full classical soft expansion for general dyonic scattering. We provide explicit, recursive expressions for the trajectory coefficients and the resulting electric and magnetic waveforms.

The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution.

While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Pleba\u0144ski--Demia\u0144ski family. Here we demonstrate that the whole class admits a hidden symmetry encoded in the non-degenerate conformal Killing--Yano 2-form. Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Pleba\u0144ski--Demia\u0144ski class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full \"tower of symmetries\". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics.

The momentum-energy representation $\u03c6(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert. Here we restore the fundamental symmetry between the conjugate pairs $(x,t)$ and $(k,E)$ by extending the quantum theory to an enlarged Hilbert space $\\mathcal H_{\\text{total}} = \\mathcal H_{xt} \\oplus \\mathcal H_{kE}$, within which the momentum-energy sector $\\mathcal H_{kE}=L^2(\\mathcal M_{kE})$ carries its own autonomous unitary evolution generated by a self-adjoint operator $\\hat{\\mathcal T}$. The resulting structure establishes a meta-symmetry: a symmetry between two conjugate dynamical projections of a single global quantum state. It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation.

In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $\u03a9_c \\approx 5\\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant.

This method leverages inherent information from the optical field, enabling precise beam alignment with a simple structure and minimal computational effort. In the 3D measurement experiment, the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.99 for transverse offsets in the x- and y-directions, and 0.98 for air gap in the z-direction. The RMSE in x-direction, y-direction and z-direction is respectively 0.135 \u03bcm, 0.128 \u03bcm and 2.42 \u03bcm. The time for a single 3D displacement calculation is 4.037e-4 seconds. Furthermore, it facilitates single-step displacement regulation with a deviation tolerance within 0.15 \u03bcm and modal content regulation with an accuracy of 4.67%.

Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios.

Interpreting the ADM mass as enthalpy, we derive the main thermodynamic quantities, Hawking temperature, entropy, thermodynamic volume, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat, and analyze how $(\\ell,\u03b1)$ jointly affect stability and phase structure. We obtain a Van der Waals--type equation of state, compute the critical point $(P_c,T_c,v_c)$, and show that, although the critical scales depend nontrivially on $\\ell$ and $\u03b1$, the universal ratio $P_c v_c/T_c = 3/8$ is preserved.

Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation. One possibility would be to improve the sensitivity in a frequency range that allows us to determine whether or not a black hole was formed in the coalescence.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates the precision of determining the maximum mass of a spinless neutron star (MTOV) from gravitational wave signals detected by next-generation observatories.

However, its potential has been limited to coherent state inputs. Here, we introduce a generalized heralded OPA protocol that unlocks a vastly expanded class of quantum phenomena by accepting arbitrary non-classical inputs. With a squeezed vacuum input, the setup functions as an integrated two-photon subtractor, deterministically generating high-fidelity, larger-amplitude squeezed Schr\u00f6dinger cat states -- an operation previously requiring complex, discrete setups. Furthermore, when fed a small-amplitude SC state, the protocol acts as a non-Gaussianity amplifier, distilling it into high-purity approximations of key quantum resources like specific photon-number superpositions.

We first review the original Letelier spacetime and its recent generalization, computing the Kretschmann scalar, and showing that the generalized model exhibits a stronger curvature divergence at $r \\to 0$ than both Letelier and Schwarzschild cases. We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u5f26\u4e91\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684Letelier-Alencar\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u6570\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u89e3\u7684Kretschmann\u6807\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e7f\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u5728$r\to 0$\u65f6\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u53d1\u6563\u6bd4Letelier\u548cSchwarzschild\u60c5\u51b5\u66f4\u5f3a\u70c8\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d4b\u5730\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5149\u901f\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u73af\u5f62 photon\u8f68\u9053\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901f\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5f84\u5411\u4e0b\u9003\u548c\u73af\u5f62\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5149\u73af\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u5185\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\u968f\u5f26\u4e91\u53c2\u6570$g_s$\u589e\u5927\u800c\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u968f\u957f\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6$l_s$\u51cf\u5c0f\u800c\u51cf\u5c0f\uff1b\u73af\u5f62\u8f68\u9053\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u67d0\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f84\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u548c tidal\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u62c9\u4f38\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u5185\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u7684 tidal\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f26\u4e91\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9065\u8fdc\u533a\u57df\u4e5f\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u9891\u7387\u548c tidal\u529b\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c tidal \u7684\u5206\u91cf\u6ca1\u6709\u53d8\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e26\u6709\u5947\u602a\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5982\u5f26\u4e91\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9759\u6001\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u548c tidal\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u89e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d1\u751f\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f tidal\u529b\u7684\u4f38\u7f29\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8fdc\u79bb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65f6\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u4e5f\u4f1a\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u663e\u8457\u7684 tidal\u6548\u5e94 modification\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f26\u4e91\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5305\u542b\u5947\u602a\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

This progress creates urgency for the development of compilation workflows that directly target the forthcoming generation of devices with thousands of physical qubits, for which algorithm execution becomes practical. We develop a pipeline for compiling logical algorithms to physical circuits implementing lattice surgery on the surface code, and use this pipeline to identify the requirements for achieving algorithmic break-even -- where quantum error correction improves the performance of a quantum algorithm -- for two prominent quantum algorithms: the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our pipeline integrates several open-source software tools, and leverages recent advances in error-aware unitary gate synthesis, high-fidelity magic state production, and the calculation of correlation surfaces in the surface code. We perform classical simulations of physical Clifford proxy circuits produced by our pipeline, and find that both 5-qubit QAOA and QPE can reach algorithmic break-even with 2517 physical qubits (surface code distance $d=11$) at physical error rates of $p=10^{-3}$, or 1737 physical qubits ($d=9$) at $p=5\\times 10^{-4}$.

A major challenge, however, lies in their inherently substantial sampling cost, primarily due to the individual measurement of each term in the Hamiltonian. While various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the sampling overhead remains a significant bottleneck, especially for practical large-scale electronic structure problems. In this work, we introduce an alternative method, dubbed mirror subspace diagonalization (MSD), which approaches the theoretical lower bound of the sampling cost for quantum Krylov algorithms. MSD leverages a finite-difference formula to express the Hamiltonian operator as a linear combination of time-evolution unitaries with symmetrically shifted timesteps, enabling efficient estimation of the Hamiltonian matrix within the Krylov subspace. In this scheme, the finite difference and statistical errors are simultaneously minimized by optimizing the timestep parameter and shifting the energy spectrum. Consequently, MSD attains the lower bound of the sampling cost of the quantum Krylov algorithms up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we employ classical post-processing to infer Hamiltonian moments, which are used to mitigate the ground state energy error based on the Lanczos scheme. Through theoretical analysis of the sampling cost, we demonstrate that MSD is particularly effective when the spectral norm of the Hamiltonian is significantly smaller than its 1-norm. Such a situation arises, for example, in high-accuracy simulations of molecules using large basis sets that incorporate strong electronic correlations. Numerical results for various molecular models reveal that MSD can achieve sampling cost reductions ranging from approximately 10 to 10,000 times compared to the conventional quantum Krylov algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mirror subspace diagonalization (MSD) significantly reduces the sampling cost of quantum Krylov algorithms for ground-state energy estimation.", "motivation": "The paper addresses the challenge of high sampling cost in quantum Krylov algorithms, which limits their practicality for large-scale electronic structure problems.

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We propose a scheme to generate multi-paths entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control. Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($\u03c6$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($\u03c6=\u03c0/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \\rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime.

This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $\u039b$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $\u039b$CDM at $1.5\u03c3$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4\u03c3$ when further adding low-redshift data.

This provides a precise local characterization of how entangled a given state is. At the same time, this local description naturally invites a set of complementary, more global questions about the structure of the space of pure states: How abundant are the states with a given amount of entanglement within the full state space? Do the manifolds of constant entanglement exhibit distinct geometric regimes? These questions shift the focus from assigning an entanglement value to a single state to understanding the global organization and geometry of entanglement across the entire manifold of pure states.\n  In this work, we develop a geometric framework in which these questions become natural. We regard the projective Hilbert space of pure states, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, as a Riemannian manifold and promote bipartite entanglement to a macroscopic functional on this manifold. Its level sets stratify the space of pure states into hypersurfaces of constant entanglement, and we define a geometric entanglement entropy as the log-volume of these hypersurfaces, weighted by the Fubini-Study gradient of entanglement. This quantity plays the role of a microcanonical entropy in entanglement space: it measures the degeneracy of a given entanglement value in the natural quantum geometry.\n  The framework is illustrated first in the simplest case of a single spin-1/2 and then for bipartite entanglement of spin systems, including a two-qubit example where explicit calculations can be carried out, along with a sketch of the extension to spin chains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7eaf\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5229\u7528Fubini-Study\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c06\u7eaf\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u4f4d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4f53\u79ef\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u51e0\u4f55\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7eaf\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d4b\u4e88Fubini-Study\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6052\u5b9a\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5355\u81ea\u65cb-1/2\u548c\u4e24\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002"}}

In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity.

In this study, we analyze the quantum properties of the entangled final states generated in the QGEM scheme. Our findings reveal that the photon emission rates (transition rates) are closely related to the degree of entanglement. Specifically, the transition rate decreases as the degree of entanglement increases when the distance between particle pairs is small, then it gradually approaches an asymptotic value that is independent of entanglement as the distance increases.

Building on the classical framework (Aumann, 1976), we define the modality of \"common certainty\" through a hierarchy of certainty operators acting on each agent's Hilbert space. In the commuting case -- when all measurements and event projectors commute -- common certainty leads to equality of the agents' conditional probabilities, recovering a QM analog of the classical theorem. By contrast, when non-commuting operators are allowed, the certainty recursion can stabilize with different probabilities. This yields common certainty of disagreement (CCD) as a distinctive QM phenomenon. Agreement is restored once measurement outcomes are recorded in a classical register. The classical Agreement Theorem can therefore be seen as emergent from the quantum world via recording.

Recent advances in quantum computing offer a promising alternative, leveraging quantum algorithms to efficiently explore complex solution spaces and potentially outperform classical methods in high-dimensional settings. However, conventional quantum approaches typically assume a one-to-one correspondence between qubits and variables (e.g. financial assets), which severely limits the applicability of gate-based quantum systems due to current hardware constraints. As a result, only quantum annealing-like methods have been used in realistic scenarios. In this work, we show how a gate-based variational quantum algorithm can be applied to a real-world portfolio optimization problem by assigning multiple variables per qubit. Specifically, we address a problem involving over 250 variables, where the market graph representing a real stock market is iteratively partitioned into sub-portfolios of highly correlated assets. This approach enables improved scalability compared to traditional variational methods and opens new possibilities for quantum-enhanced financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We find that even a weak spin relaxation can render the superradiant phase to a superradiant metastable phase, in which symmetry-breaking states are stable only for a finite time. This arises because each spin-jump induced by relaxation applies as a strong perturbation to the system, potentially driving the system from a symmetry-breaking state to the symmetry-preserving saddle point with finite probability, before it eventually relaxes back to a symmetry-breaking state.

The central innovation is a conserved coherence current operator constructed from the Noether mass current via operator-level coarse-graining. This current vanishes for classical matter distributions but is nonzero for spatial superpositions and entangled states, yielding a gauge interaction that is dormant in classical regimes but activated by quantum coherence. The framework predicts three distinctive signatures: (i) interferometric phase shifts scaling linearly with fringe visibility, (ii) decoherence rates with characteristic m^2 scaling and spatial dependence distinct from collapse models, and (iii) entanglement-selective forces between distant massive qubits. The theory maintains full gauge invariance, causality, and positive time evolution. We show that state-of-the-art atom interferometers and levitated nanoparticles can place first constraints on this interaction class, complementary to classical fifth-force searches. This approach provides a novel theoretical framework for probing coherence-selective fundamental interactions and their potential role in the quantum-classical transition.
