The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $\u03c3$, and take the limit $\u03c3\\to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $\u03c3> 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8c03\u8282\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u4f7f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u7aef\u6270\u52a8\u5f97\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6291\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53d1\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u4fdd\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a84\u9ad8\u65af\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u521d\u59cb\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\u53d6\u6781\u9650\u03c3\u21920\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u5728\u79ef\u5206\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u8c03\u6574\u5230\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5171\u632f\u548c\u4e0d\u6536\u655b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5f97\u5230\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548cphysical\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies.

Post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories are used to model the inspiral and ringdown parts of the waveform, respectively, while the merger phase has been modeled most accurately using numerical relativity (NR). Nevertheless, there have been several approaches used to model the merger phase using analytical methods. In this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). Prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-Newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from NR simulations during the ringdown. To obtain a better match with NR waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. Specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. The waveform is determined by evolving a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified Poschl-Teller potential. By tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match NR waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e8c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5.", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u4e8c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49.", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408post-Newtonian\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6270urbation\u7406\u8bba\u53caEffective-one-body\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e8c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684NR\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a10^{-3}\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e8c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram.

Meanwhile, state space model (e.g., Mamba) has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for long sequence modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various language and vision tasks. However, towards molecular ground-state conformation prediction, exploiting Mamba to understand molecular structure is underexplored. To this end, we strive to design a generic and efficient framework with Mamba to capture critical components. In general, molecular structure could be considered to consist of three elements, i.e., atom types, atom positions, and connections between atoms. Thus, considering the three elements, an approach of Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding (MPSU-Mamba) is proposed to localize molecular ground-state conformation. Particularly, for complex and diverse molecules, three different kinds of dedicated scanning strategies are explored to construct a comprehensive perception of corresponding molecular structures. And a bright-channel guided mechanism is defined to discriminate the critical conformation-related atom information. Experimental results on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets indicate that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods.

The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents evidence for a strong isotropic gravitational wave background using pulsar timing arrays, attributing it to supermassive black hole binaries.

Specifically, studying the variation of thermal resistance across grain boundaries is of critical importance in designing effective thermal interface materials for heterogeneous integration. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping at the micrometer length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantifying local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (<100 nm). However, challenges in accurately converting the raw signal to thermal conductivity and accounting for surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated modulation of thermal properties in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of parasitic heat transport pathways; this calibration enables accurate measurement of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature change to extract the thermal resistance of the film (Rth). Following calibration, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited by e-beam evaporation on a SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using a finite-element-modeling-based calibration approach, where the average of the pixel-level Rth values yields an effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W m^-1 K^-1, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks describing heat transport in ultrathin Al.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the thermal transport properties of nanostructured materials, specifically Al films, using advanced SThM and FDTR techniques.

However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\u03bc_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\u03bc_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\u03bc_s'$.

Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism,\" has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \\sim L^{-\u03b3}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($\u03c1\\sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($\u03c3(\u03c9) \\sim \u03c9^{\u03b3-1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We discuss how particle-hole excitations of a Fermi sea can induce long-range interactions between heavy impurities or atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate.

These mediated interactions exhibit different short-range and long-range scaling regimes with distance and, if strong enough, can induce fermion superfluidity. We discuss the prospects for observing new phenomena that could arise from mediated interactions. Experimentally, we outline recent studies of the 133Cs-6Li Bose-Fermi mixture, a platform well-suited for investigating fermion-mediated interactions. A Cs Bose-Einstein condensate immersed in a degenerate Li Fermi gas is prepared with tunable interspecies interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, precision measurements of condensate properties reveal fermion-mediated attractions between bosons, matching theoretical predictions.

However, these ML models generally do not incorporate the experimental measurements directly, such as X-ray crystallographic diffraction data. To this end, we explore an approach that more tightly couples these traditional crystallographic and recent ML-based methods, by training a hybrid 3-d vision transformer and convolutional network on inputs from both domains. We make use of two distinct input constructs / Patterson maps, which are directly obtainable from crystallographic data, and ``partial structure'' template maps derived from predicted structures deposited in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database with subsequently omitted residues.

Introducing an initial dataset of small protein fragments taken from Protein Data Bank entries and placing them in hypothetical crystal settings, we demonstrate that our method is effective at both improving the phases of the crystallographic structure factors and completing the regions missing from partial structure templates, as well as improving the agreement of the electron density maps with the ground truth atomic structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6676\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u786e\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u54083D Vision Transformer\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6676\u4f53\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684Patterson\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u901a\u8fc7AlphaFold\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u201c\u90e8\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u201d\u6a21\u677f\u56fe\u8c31\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6676\u4f53\u5b66\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728 trimming \u540e\u7684\u5c0f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7247\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u4f4d\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u533a\u57df\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0e\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62df\u5408\u5ea6\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

They have gained significant interest due to their potential as alternative energy resources and their applications in gas storage, transportation, and carbon sequestration. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation, especially the influence of gas bubbles, remain poorly understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how methane nanobubble size modulates hydrate formation in supercooled water. Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines.

Tight integration with the Bluesky control infrastructure at the NSLS-II Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline enables real-time, closed-loop scan orchestration. Applied to a chemically heterogeneous urban PM2.5 sample, X-AutoMap reduced high-resolution acquisition time from over 44 hours to approximately 10 hours by targeting compositionally significant features identified from coarse scans. High-resolution results revealed diverse particle types, including fully mixed, partially overlapping, and spatially distinct multi-element structures, demonstrating the ability of the framework to isolate chemically relevant features with minimal user intervention. The framework supports interactive and autonomous modes, operates within hardware constraints via grid-based scanning, and is robust across varying sample conditions.

Root Mean Square (RMS) Bandwidth is a generalization of bandwidth that overcomes some of the limitations encountered with conventional bandwidth, including the prerequisite of linearity, single-mode response, and light damping. However, its mathematical form does not reveal much about the physics behind it. In this paper, we extend RMS Bandwidth to multiple degree-of-freedom, linear, time-invariant, classically damped systems by deriving an Analytical Root Mean Square (ARMS) Bandwidth in terms of a system's modal parameters and initial modal energy distribution. We demonstrate that ARMS Bandwidth reliably and accurately computes a single measure for a practical structure's dissipative capacity. Also, a purely data-driven methodology for assessing the modal energy distribution is developed. We apply ARMS Bandwidth to single and multiple degree-of-freedom systems and an experimental model aircraft to demonstrate its broad applicability.

Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level.

Widefield interferometric approach provide a cost-effective, non-destructive solution for characterizing semiconductor optical waveguides, which are fundamental to nanophotonic devices. This work presents a Bayesian inference framework, implemented using Dynamic Nested Sampling, for estimating geometric parameters - such as width and height - of a semiconductor optical waveguide from a single widefield interferogram. The proposed framework reduces the need of leveraging near field scanning microscopy methods for measurements. The notable advantage is that Bayesian statistics not only provide the estimated parameter values but also quantify the uncertainty of the inference results and the fitness of the used model. The proposed full-field, single-shot interferometric approach, supported by Bayesian-based data analysis, achieves high accuracy and sensitivity - down to successful measurement of 8 nm rib waveguide - while remaining resilient to noise. Thus, the demonstrated methodology provides a cost-effective, robust, and scalable tool for semiconductor fabrication monitoring and process verification, as confirmed by both numerical simulations and experimental validation on optical waveguides. This method contributes to high-precision nanometrology by integrating advanced statistical modeling and inference techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5957\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u573a\u5355\u6b21\u5e72\u6d89\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5982\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6805\u626b\u63cf\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u7eb3\u7c73\u91cf\u5ea6\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5957\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u573a\u5355\u6b21\u5e72\u6d89\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f30\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u503c\uff0c\u8fd8\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf98\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea7\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5957\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u7eb3\u7c73\u91cf\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $\u03c0$ modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u53d7\u9a71\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53-\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6742\u5316\u7269\u4e2d\u7684Floquet\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u81ea\u80fd\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u89c2\u5bdfFloquet\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u548cMajorana \u03c0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "Floquet\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u53d7\u9a71\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9884\u6d4bFloquet\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u5384\u7c73\u90e8\u5206\u81ea\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e2d\u7a7a\u80fd\u5e26\u7684\u51c6\u80fd\u91cf\u8c31\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u81ea\u80fd\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u90e8\u5206\u5230\u51c6\u80fd\u91cf\u672c\u5f81\u6001\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u80fd\u5e26\u7684_decode\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86Floquet\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u76f8\u5e94\u80fd\u5e26\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u4ee5\u53ca\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230Floquet\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u548cMajorana \u03c0\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u53d7\u9a71\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53-\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6742\u5316\u7269Floquet\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u80fd\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This divergence arises from a null geodesic that bounces off the black hole singularity. At finite 't Hooft coupling, stringy corrections to the bulk dynamics cannot be neglected, and the fate of the bouncing geodesic is an open question. We propose a simple scenario in which the singularity in the two-point function is shifted slightly into the complex plane, thereby smoothing it out into a finite-size bump. We demonstrate this smoothing explicitly in a microscopic example, namely the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at infinite temperature, where the correlator is under analytic control.

The hard-core character of these effective models enables a duality between bosonic and fermionic molecules in real and spectral space, while their momentum distributions remain distinct. Our results have demonstrated an effective dimension reduction in microwave-shielded molecular systems, which is purely due to the intrinsic interaction anisotropy rather than any external confinement. Extending to large systems, our results suggest a self-bound single-molecule array as the ground state of both bosonic and fermionic molecular gases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model.

The well-known competitive exclusion principle (CEP) states that two species competing for the same resource cannot stably coexist, and more generally, that the number of consumer species is bounded by the number of resource species at steady state. However, the remarkable species diversity observed in natural ecosystems, exemplified by the paradox of the plankton, challenges this principle. Here, we show that interspecific social information use among predators provides a mechanism that fundamentally relaxes the constraints of competitive exclusion.

While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present.

Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2.

While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincar\u00e9 patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability for quantum field theories in and out of equilibrium.", "motivation": "Understanding renormalization in non-equilibrium systems is crucial for advancing quantum field theory applications in diverse physical scenarios.", "method": "The authors employ mutual information to analyze correlations between momentum shells, evaluating the logarithmic derivative at large mode separations to gauge renormalizability.", "result": "For Minkowski spacetime post-interaction quench, mutual information at late times aligns with the interacting vacuum.

Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We explore the reflection characteristics of generic polarized, non-paraxial light beams from a corrugated silver (Ag) interface, since surface corrugation can naturally couple the incident radiation modes to the surface excitations. In the vicinity of SPR, we report a significant enhancement in the beam shifts, attributed to the rapid variation of the specular reflection coefficient near its minima, resulting in amplified weak values. By carefully selecting the incident and projected polarization states of the beam, we achieve a pronounced spatial spin Hall effect. We also investigate vortex-induced beam shifts within this resonant regime, revealing distinctive signatures of the angular momentum of the beam. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis is also presented for the conical diffraction geometry, wherein polarization conversions between p and s states are fully incorporated.

We investigate both the asymptotic case, where the number of initial pairs goes to infinity, and the finite-size regime, where protocols are restricted to a finite number of weakly entangled pairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u5c06\u5f31\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e8c\u5143\u6001\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e8c\u5143\u6001\u5bf9\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e8c\u5143\u6001\u5bf9\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u6743\u8861\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u6240\u5173\u5fc3\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6700\u5927\u8f93\u7387\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8bae\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6548\u7387\u6216\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u7f3a\u4e00\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002"}}

We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D.

These capabilities enable enhanced optical performance and are essential for meeting non-optical constraints, such as those imposed by ergonomics, aerodynamics, or wearability. However, existing fabrication techniques such as direct electron or laser beam writing on curved substrates, and soft-stamp-based transfer or nanoimprint lithography suffer from limitations in scalability, yield, geometry control, and alignment accuracy. Here, we present a scalable fabrication strategy for curved and conformal metasurface optics leveraging thermoforming, an industry-standard, high-throughput manufacturing process widely used for shaping thermoplastics. Our approach uniquely enables wafer-scale production of highly curved metasurface optics, achieving sub-millimeter radii of curvature and micron-level alignment precision. To guide the design and fabrication process, we developed a thermorheological model that accurately predicts and compensates for the large strains induced during thermoforming.

Here we report the moir\u00e9-engineered electronic insulating states in a new 1D moir\u00e9 superlattice, by crystallographically aligning an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) to 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate.

Circuit-level simulations show that they can achieve the same logical error rate as surface codes with a reduced qubit overhead. They have been extensively optimized by importing classical techniques such as the progressive edge growth, or through random search, simulated annealing or reinforcement learning techniques. In this work, instead of machine learning (ML) algorithms that improve the code performance through local transformations, we impose additional global symmetries, that are hard to discover through ML, and we perform an exhaustive search. Precisely, we focus on the hypergraph product of two cyclic codes, which we call CxC codes and we study C2 codes which are the product a cyclic code with itself and CxR codes which are the product of a cyclic codes with a repetition code. We discover C2 codes and CxR codes that significantly outperform previously optimized HGP codes, achieving better parameters and a logical error rate per logical qubit that is up to three orders of magnitude better. Moreover, some C2 codes achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a smaller qubit overhead than state-of-the-art LDPC codes such as the bivariate bicycle codes, at the price of a larger block length.

However, its exponential measurement and computational demands limit scalability, motivating efficient alternatives such as classical shadows, which enable accurate prediction of many observables from randomized measurements. In this work, we introduce a bi-objective semidefinite programming approach for constrained shadow tomography, designed to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) from noisy or incomplete shadow data. By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization.

We show that the curvature of the banks is negligible and that such a system can be found.

This self-induced modulation enables unidirectional light transport below the optical gap and, near the epsilon-near-zero point, gives rise to collective parametric resonance and stimulated emission of volume plasmons.

Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u5411\u5149\u5076\u6781\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u7269\u8d28\uff08OM\uff09\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u7c92\u5b50\u805a\u96c6\u7684\u589e\u5927\uff0cOM\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f1a\u4ece Crystal-like \u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a liquid-like \u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u963b\u585e\u6216\u505c\u6b62\u6709\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u5f3a\u5149\u675f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5fae\u5c0f\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5982\u5fae\u6d41\u4f53\u548c\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u89c2\u5bdfOM\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u6a21\u5f0f\u968f\u7c92\u5b50\u805a\u96c6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u5c3a\u5bf8\u63a5\u8fd1\u5149\u675f\u7126\u70b9\u65f6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u7406\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0cOM\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6676\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u4f20\u9012\u5149\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7c92\u5b50\u805a\u96c6\u5230\u8fbe\u5149\u675f\u7126\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u65f6\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f1a\u5931\u5e8f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u65cb\u8f6c\u5fae\u5c0f\u673a\u5668\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5149\u6805\u5bf9OM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Diamagnets and paramagnets lack spontaneous long-range order, whereas ordered magnets develop such order below their Curie or N\u00e9el temperature and support single spin-wave excitations (magnons). Magnons have found applications in radio-frequency technologies and computation, magneto-optics, and foundational quantum experiments. Above the Curie/N\u00e9el temperature, long-range order is lost and the material transitions to a paramagnetic phase, with localised spin alignment in small patches, producing paramagnons with only short-range propagation.

In a symmetric subsector, we find agreement with previously known results and furthermore extend the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz to include massless modes.

This construction serves as a direct, non-Gaussian generalization of the canonical thermofield double (TFD) state, which is itself a single, Gaussian TMSS. We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of \"squeezing polynomials\" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external \"Janus phase.\" This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect. The TMJS provides a versatile, interference-enhanced platform for engineering Unruh-DeWitt detector responses and probing non-Gaussian physics in relativistic settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684Two-Mode Squeezed States\uff08TMSS\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5e72\u53e0\u52a0\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eTMJS\u7684\u4efb\u610fk\u9636\u5149\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u201c\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u201d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6240\u6709\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u77e9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u201cJanus\u76f8\u4f4d\u201d\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u8c03\u8282\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff08g^{(k)}\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5b8c\u5168\u70ed\uff08\u4e0eTFD\u8fb9\u7f18\u5339\u914d\uff09\u5207\u6362\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e9a\u6cca\u677e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\u7531\u5f3a\u5927\u7684Wigner\u8d1f\u6027\u6807\u5fd7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86TMJS\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001Casimir\u6548\u5e94\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u53e0\u52a0\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u7684Unruh\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u662f\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u3002TMJS\u4e3a\u6784\u5efaUnruh-DeWitt\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7269\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165TMJS\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684TMSS\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5e72\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u9020\u4e86TMJS\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790k\u9636\u5149\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6240\u6709\u77e9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001Casimir\u6548\u5e94\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u53e0\u52a0\u4f5c\u4e3aTMJS\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\u4ee5\u4e0b\u51e0\u70b9\uff1a1. \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eTMJS\u7684\u4efb\u610fk\u9636\u5149\u7edf\u8ba1\u30022. \u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6240\u6709\u77e9\u30023. \u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8Janus\u76f8\u4f4d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9TMJS\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u30024.

Post-Newtonian (PN) approximations capture the early inspiral dynamics analytically but break down near merger, while numerical relativity (NR) provides the accurate yet computationally expensive waveforms over limited parameter ranges. We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that learns corrections mapping PN dynamics and waveforms to their NR counterparts. As a demonstration of the approach, we use the TaylorT4 PN model as the baseline, and train the network on hybridized NR surrogate data (NRHybSur3dq8) to learn higher-order corrections to the orbital dynamics and waveform modes for nonspinning noneccentric systems. Physically motivated loss terms enforce known limits and symmetries, such as vanishing corrections in the Newtonian limit and suppression of odd-$m$ modes in equal-mass systems, promoting consistent and reliable extrapolation beyond the training region. We simultaneously incorporate corrections that account for the different meaning of mass parameters in PN and NR descriptions. The learned corrections significantly reduce the phase and amplitude error through the inspiral up to about $200M$ before the merger. This approach provides a differentiable and computationally efficient bridge between PN and NR, offering a path toward waveform models that generalize more robustly beyond existing NR datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, its practical imaging depth range is limited by the depth of focus (DOF). Although computational refocusing can potentially provide sharp images outside the DOF, signal reduction by the confocal effect still limits the imaging depth in practice in point-scanning OCT. In addition, standard OCT cannot visualize intra-tissue activities. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrated a spatially coherent full-field OCM (SC-FFOCM) with computational refocusing. In addition, a repetitive acquisition protocol was designed to visualize intra-tissue activities (i.e., dynamic OCT imaging). The in-focus lateral resolution is 1.4 um, and the axial resolution is 6.5 um (in air) at full-width at half-maximum intensity. Three-dimensional structure and the dynamic OCT imaging using SC-FFOCM with computational refocusing was applied to human breast adenocarcinoma spheroids (MCF-7 cell line).

Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport.

Here we present a theory of nonclassical lasing, demonstrating how incoherent electrons in photonic crystal cavities can coherently emit photons through collective dynamics. When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state). Notably, the frequency of the emitted photons can be readily tuned via the velocity of the injected electrons to match cavity modes.

In this work, we investigated atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC using a scanning tunneling microscope. Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule.

We obtain a family of BRST-related transformations generated by the discrete group of symmetries of the action.

For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency.

One such anomaly, known as the \"ballooning effect\" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper provides an in-depth overview of the interaction between a screw dislocation within a distorted magnetic lattice, exploring possible coupling mechanisms and establishing a promising link between two disparate topics in materials science: topological magnetism and topological elasticity. We first provide a classical analysis of skyrmion motion that reveals the dislocations as shallow traps on the magnetic texture. Afterwards, we provide an analysis of the quantized motion of the skyrmion and identify its quantum states.

The first-order gravitational perturbations backreact with the background metric at second-order, creating a wormhole opening. The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed. For superluminal sound channels, the wormhole opens for an extremely brief duration at late insertion times, rendering it non-traversable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies. Our study discovers that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets determines their nonlinear electric material properties, which could facilitate applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, communication networks, and energy harvesting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals.

In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u666e\u901a\u591a\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u7269\u8d28\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u662f\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u7535\u5b50\u5e03\u6d1b\u8d6b\u5e26\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u80fd\u9699\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u9644\u8fd1\u5f62\u6210\u4e2d\u7a7a\u6001\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u7f3a\u9677\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a2\u9488\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ca\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e2d\u90fd\u9002\u7528\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f15\u53d1 Majorana \u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6750\u6599\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cUnderstanding the role of defects in topology-probing\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u6001\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u666e\u901a\u7f3a\u9677\u5728\u65e0\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u65e2\u6709\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ef7\u503c\u4e5f\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c0f\u7f3a\u9677\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6750\u6599\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u642d\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u9636\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u4e0b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u70b9\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7f3a\u9677\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u4e2d\u7a7a\u6001\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u90e8\u5206\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u58f0\u5b66 Chern \u6676\u683c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u5143\u539f\u5b50\u548c Green \u51fd\u6570\u57fa\u5e95\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u7a7a\u6001\u3002\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u666e\u901a\u7f3a\u9677\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u666e\u901a\u70b9\u7f3a\u9677\u5728\u5e73\u5e38\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4f2a\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7f3a\u9677\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u4e2d\u7a7a\u6001\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7f3a\u9677\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e2d\u7a7a\u6001\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u8010\u53d7\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u8bf1\u5bfc\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u666e\u901a\u7f3a\u9677\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2dangible\uff0c\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22Chern\u7c7b\u53ca\u7c7b\u4f3c\u62d3\u6251\u7269\u8d28\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f3a\u9677\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u62d3\u6251\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u6001\u8bbe\u5907\u3002"}}

Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (<50 $\u03bc$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities. The model traces the system's transient chiro-optical response back to photoinduced modulations of the electric-magnetic dipole interaction in the nano-helicoid, elucidating the connection of near- and far-field dynamics in the non-equilibrium regime. We further investigate spin excitation, thermalization, and relaxation in a lead halide perovskite, establishing a novel approach to broadband time-resolved Faraday rotation. The simplicity, sensitivity, and wide applicability of this detection scheme provide a powerful platform for broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy, opening new opportunities in biochemistry, solid-state physics, and nanophotonics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u57df\u8d85\u5feb\u5706\u504f\u632f\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u548c\u5149\u6781\u5316\u6865\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7075\u654f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5149 polarization \u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u81ea\u8c03\u8c10\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u8d85\u5feb\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6fc0\u5149\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u591a\u4f59\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u9650\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91d1\u7eb3\u7c73\u624b\u6027\u58f3\u72b6\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u6ce2\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5149\u6fc0\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7535-\u78c1\u5076\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u5706\u504f\u632f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u3001thermal \u5316\u548c Relaxation\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5feb\u5706\u504f\u632f\u5149\u8c31\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u56fa\u6001\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740 Enablement \u5bf9\u8d85\u5feb\u5149\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e26\u6709\u5f31 chirality \u7684\u5149\u504f\u632f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8 spectroscopy \u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u94cc\u9178\u76d0\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u548c\u5149\u6781\u5316\u6865\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5149\u7684\u6781\u5316\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f4d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u81ea\u8c03\u8c10\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u5706\u504f\u632f\u548c optical rotatory dispersion\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u591a\u4f59\u6fc0\u5149\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728 Au \u7eb3\u7c73\u624b\u6027\u58f3\u72b6\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u548c Pb-doped perovskite \u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86 transient \u7684\u5706\u504f\u632f\u54cd\u5e94\u8ffd\u56e0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e7f\u57df\u8d85\u5feb\u5706\u504f\u632f\u5149\u8c31\u6cd5\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u8c03\u8c10\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u5feb\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u63a5\u8fd1\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u9650\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5feb\u5706\u504f\u632f\u5149\u8c31\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e7f\u57df\u3001\u8d85\u5feb\u3001\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u56fa\u6001\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings. Conceptually, this can be viewed as a \"compression\" of the information in the QPF algorithm, which enables period-finding from $n$ one-qubit marginals. Our results motivate the development of approximate simulations of reduced density matrices to design novel period-finding algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T(\\log L + d r \\log K)\\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise.

The supercritical regime of black hole thermodynamics remains a relatively unexplored area, and recent applications of this theory to charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes have initiated probes into this regime, revealing a simple structure partitioned by a single Widom line. In this paper, we apply Lee-Yang theory to charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, which feature complex phase diagrams (e.g., triple points), to determine how such structures are reflected in the supercritical regime.

We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2.

AlphaTensor-Quantum is a reinforcement learning-based method designed to optimize the T-count of quantum circuits by formulating the problem as a tensor decomposition task.

The resulting geometry takes the form of a fuzzy sphere, with quantum excitations in the fermionic sector accounting for the corresponding black hole entropy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In addition to the standard binary first quantized mapping, we investigate the unary first quantized mapping, which we show to be the most gate-efficient mapping for bosons in the general case, although less qubit-efficient than binary mappings. Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \\sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings. Nevertheless, a detailed numeric analysis reveals that the binary first quantized mapping still requires fewer gates than the binary and unary second quantized ones for realistic combinations of $N$ and $M$, while requiring exponentially fewer qubits than the unary mappings. Additionally, the number of CNOT and $R_z(\u03c6)$ gates necessary to express the exponential of the Hamiltonian in the binary first quantized mapping is comparable to the (overall most efficient) unary first quantized one when $M = 2^n$ for both the Bose-Hubbard model and the harmonic trap with short-range interactions. This suggests that this mapping can be both qubit- and gate-efficient for practical problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper compares different bosonic mappings, focusing on resource requirements for first and second quantized approaches in terms of qubits, gates, and efficiency.", "motivation": "Bosonic quantum systems are widely used in quantum computing and physics.

Working in the Hamiltonian formalism on the plane, we derive the symmetry algebra of the deformed theory, which consists of a local Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra in the left-moving sector and a non-local counterpart in the right-moving sector. This algebraic structure guides the definition of two operator classes: dressed operators, which transform as primaries under the deformed symmetries, and local physical operators. While dressed operators are local only in the left null direction, physical operators maintain locality in both directions and are constructed from dressed operators and currents. This formulation allows the powerful constraints of conformal symmetry to be leveraged for computing physical observables. Consequently, we employ conformal perturbation theory to compute the two-point and $N$-point functions of physical operators. In momentum space, we sum the most UV-sensitive contributions to all orders; the results show precise agreement with string theory predictions.

Experimental observation of backflow has remained elusive due to two main challenges: (i) the effect is intrinsically small, with less than 4% of the probability able to flow backward, and (ii) it requires wave packets with a well-defined momentum direction, which are difficult both to prepare and to verify under realistic, noisy conditions. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone. We show that this excess can reach nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow bound by more than a factor of three. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the closely related phenomenon of quantum reentry, provide explicit examples of quantum states exhibiting large general backflow and reentry, and discuss the foundational implications of these nonclassical effects. Our results open a pathway toward the experimental observation of quantum backflow in realistic settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another. Consequently, we argue any interacting quantum field theory that realizes an $SU(N)$ global symmetry must generate entanglement in at least one scattering channel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3SU(N)\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f2\u21922\u6563\u5c04\u4e2d\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5185\u5916\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a sledit\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u95e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002amen\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5fc5\u987b\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u7531\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5fc5\u7136\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7f20\u5b58\u5728\u5bc6\u5207\u5173\u8054\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u5916\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e3aqubit\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u95e8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u96c6\u3002\u5229\u7528SU(N)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6b65\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u627f\u8f7dSU(N)\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u5fc5\u987b\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002\u8fd9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c4\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u9a8c\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5982\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e34\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u65f6\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7ea0\u7f20\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301SU(N)\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ea0\u7f20\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u9a8c\u5df2\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u6563\u5c04\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Earlier work with Huang showed that all but 29,223 of these polytopes have such a fibration. We identify 2,264,992,252 distinct fibrations, and determine the fiber and base structure in each case; after accounting for automorphisms of the ambient polytope, these fibrations furnish 2,250,744,657 equivalence classes. We summarize generic features and identify exotic special cases among these fibrations. These fibrations illustrate many features that have been explored in the context of 6D F-theory, including gauge groups hosted on non-toric divisors, automatic enhancement of gauge groups, and implicit non-toric bases and high-rank 6D SCFTs associated with nonflat fibers, as well as novel geometric features such as singular bases for genus-one fibrations with multisections. This analysis illustrates the power of elliptic and genus-one fibrations, and the geometro-physical language of F-theory as a tool for understanding the structure of Calabi-Yau threefolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9 Kreuzer-Skarke \u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u6240\u6709 474 \u4ebf\u4e2a\u53cd\u5c04\u68f1\u955c\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u53cc\u8272\u692d\u7403\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u79ef\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u3002\u65e9\u524d\u4e0e\u9ec4\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9664 29,223 \u4e2a\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86 2,264,992,252 \u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6bcf\u79cd\u7ea4\u7ef4\u548c\u57fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u8003\u8651\u6bcd\u4f53\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 2,250,744,657 \u4e2a\u7b49\u6548\u7c7b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f8b\u5916\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u5728 6D F \u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u5706\u5f62\u9664\u6570\u4e0a herr \u7ec4\u7684\u5bbfuts\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u7684 Gauge \u7ec4\uff0c\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u6ed1\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u79e9 6D SCFT \u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u975e\u5706\u5f62\u57fa\u3002\u6b64\u5916\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7528\u4e8e\u5e26\u6709\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u57fa\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u692d\u5706\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u7684\u7684\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca F-\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55-\u7269\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3 Calabi-Yau \u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5927\u91cf\u53cd\u5c04\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u7ef4\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728 F-\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6784\u9020\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u53cd\u5c04\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u5bfc\u5165 Kreuzer-Skarke \u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u8272\u692d\u7403\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86 2,264,992,252 \u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6bcf\u79cd\u7ea4\u7ef4\u548c\u57fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6bcd\u4f53\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u62c9\u6251\u7fa4\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u7b49\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u5206\u4e3a 2,250,744,657 \u4e2a\u7b49\u6548\u7c7b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f8b\u5916\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u8272\u692d\u7403\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9 Calabi-Yau \u4e09\u7ef4\u4f53\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728 6D F-\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u4f8b\u5916\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u5706\u5f62\u9664\u6570\u4e0a\u7684 herr \u7ec4\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u7684 Gauge \u7ec4\uff0c\u548c\u5947\u5f02\u57fa\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u5f0f\u975e\u5706\u5f62\u57fa\u7684\u9ad8\u79e9 6D SCFT\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u5e26\u6709\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u57fa\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a F-\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u6784\u9020\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u53cc\u8272\u692d\u7403\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728 6D F-\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9 Calabi-Yau \u4e09\u7ef4\u4f53\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a F-\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\\{\\overline{H}_i, \\overline{H}_i, \\overline{C_i X_j}\\}_{i,j \\in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits. By adding a procedure for FT magic state preparation, we show quantitatively how to realize an FT universal gate set in $d=3$ LCS codes. Numerical simulations indicate that our gate constructions can attain pseudothresholds in the range $p_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 4.8\\cdot 10^{-3}-1.2\\cdot 10^{-2}$ for circuit-level noise.

These systems can be regarded as a solvable deformation of the standard Schr\u00f6dinger operators $p^2 + V_N(x)$, and they arise naturally from the quantization of the Seiberg-Witten curve of four-dimensional, $\\mathcal{N} = 2$, SU($N$) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Using the open topological string/spectral theory correspondence, we construct exact, analytic eigenfunctions of $H_N$, valid for arbitrary polynomial potentials and describing both bound and resonant states. Our solutions are entire in $x$ for generic values of the energy, and become $L^2$-normalizable only at a discrete set of energies. An interesting feature of these Hamiltonians is the existence of special loci in the parameter space of the potential, the so-called Toda points. The eigenfunctions exhibit enhanced decay at these points, leading to spectral degeneracies for confining potentials and to a real energy spectrum for unbounded ones.

The inelastic scattering of single photons by the GA realizes the single-photon frequency conversion. By applying the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the scattering coefficients for single photons incident from different directions are obtained, which present different scattering spectra in the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The conversion contrast characterizing the nonreciprocity is also analyzed in both regimes. It is found that the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion vanishes as long as the emission from either transition pathways for single photons is suppressed, but it is enhanced and even reach unity by introducing the nonreciprocity.

This two-point coupling configuration between the waveguide and resonator gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, which is induced by the photon transmission delay in the waveguide between the two coupled points. On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates. Then the correlations of the output field as well as the intracavity states can be modulated by the non-Markovian coupling between the microring resonator and waveguide.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53cc\u7aef\u53e3\u5fae\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4e0e\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6563\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5149\u5b50\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5149\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u53cc\u7aef\u53e3\u7684\u5fae\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5668-\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5229\u7528\u6563\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53cc\u7aef\u53e3\u5fae\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4e0e\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8026\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u8c03\u63a7\u5355\u4e2a\u6216\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u5149\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u7aef\u53e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u5149\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u4e0e\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6563\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ef\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware.

Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate.

For the single-excitation sector of the XY model (and its beam-splitter analogue), this convexity bound equals the negativity of the seed state and is saturated only when the excitation is fully localized. At intermediate times the sum lies strictly below the bound due to phase-space overlap in local mixtures, quantitatively accounting for entanglement growth as a redistribution of a finite, budgeted resource into shared correlations. We establish the result analytically for two bodies and corroborate it numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, where it reveals a coherence-enabled dark transport: the resource becomes locally invisible while being stored in multi-body coherences. The predicted trajectory of the summed local negativity provides a practical hardware metric: deviations from the ideal, budgeted curve diagnose decoherence and control error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6fc0\u53d1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u603bWigner\u53cd\u5e38\u6027\u53d7\u521d\u59cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u72b6\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6697\u8fd0\u8f93\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u6fc0\u53d1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08XY\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u5149\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff1a1.\u4e24\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u603bWigner\u53cd\u5e38\u6027\u4e25\u683c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff1b2.\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u88ab\u672c\u5730\u6291\u5236\uff1b3.\u4f53\u73b0\u4e3a\u6697\u8fd0\u8f93\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u4f46\u50a8\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5b58\u50a8\u4e8e\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u7684(non-)\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002"}}

We subsequently obtain the dynamical-lattice trajectories that enable atom transport using shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in the form of inverse engineering based on a dy- namical invariant of Lewis-Riesenfeld type.

However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6563\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u683c\u70b9\u6a21\u62df\u548c holographic duality ( Ryu-Takayanagi \u516c\u5f0f ) \u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "1. \u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u540e\uff0cmutual info \u548c tripartite info \u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b2.

In this paper, we advocate for a holistic design perspective in quantum computing, a perspective we argue is pivotal to unlocking innovative co-design opportunities and addressing the aforementioned key challenges. To equip readers with sufficient background for exploring co-optimization opportunities, we detail how interconnected computational methods and tools collaborate to enable end-to-end quantum computer design.

We then proceed to quantum system and software development, including quantum circuit synthesis, quantum error correction and fault tolerance, and logic verification and testing. Through these discussions, we illustrate with concrete examples -- including co-optimizing quantum instruction sets with algorithmic considerations, customizing error correction circuits to hardware-specific constraints, and streamlining quantum chip design through tailored code design, among others.

This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times.

Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u6d88\u901d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u73af\u5f62\u8154\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e2d\uff0c\u96c6\u4f53\u6d88\u901d\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u523a\u6fc0\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u800c\u53d8\u7a84\u3002", "motivation": "\u96c6\u4f53\u6d88\u901d\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u523a\u6fc0\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u96c6\u4f53\u6d88\u8247\u4e0e\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u64ad\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u73af\u5f62\u8154\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6ce2\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u6d88\u901d\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u6cf5\u5165\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u4e14\u96c6\u4f53\u6d88\u901d\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u503c\u5448\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u589e\u957f\u3002\u5728\u73af\u5f62\u8154\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u81ea\u65cb\u504f\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e2d\u5219\u51fa\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u5411\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96c6\u4f53\u6d88\u901d\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u523a\u6fc0\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u73af\u5f62\u8154\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u800c\u53d8\u7a84\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8d85\u5927\u57fa\u5e95\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The measurements fully satisfy relativistic causality and causal transparency, i.e., avoid unphysical superluminal signaling. We show explicitly how the measurement of time-extended observables back-reacts on itself and induces correlations between other measurements in its causal future. Our framework is fully compositional in spacetime and extends previous results on the measurement of instantaneous observables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u7c7b\u65f6\u7a7a\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8d85\u5149\u901f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u5c55\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u548c\u5176\u56e0\u679c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u672c\u7c92\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u7a7a\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u548c\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u66f2\u7ebf\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u5927\u7c7b\u65f6\u7a7a\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u89e3\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u5c55\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u65b9\u9762\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
