One of the key steps for proving classical\nhardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one\ncan ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of\nHaar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove\nthe hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed\nstates, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen\net al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states\nthat a $o(\\sqrt{M})\\times o(\\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\\times M$ circular\northogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex\nGaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\\to\\infty$. This is the first\nrigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant\nregime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a\nmaximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the\nconventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143\n(2013)]."}

Correlations in the brain are typically weak but\nwidespread, suggesting that a mean-field approach might be effective in\ndescribing real neural populations, and we explore a hierarchy of maximum\nentropy models guided by this idea. We begin with models that match only the\nmean and variance of the total population activity, and extend to models that\nmatch the experimentally observed mean and variance of activity along multiple\nprojections of the neural state. Confronted by data from several different\nbrain regions, these models are driven toward a first-order phase transition,\ncharacterized by the presence of two nearly degenerate minima in the energy\nlandscape, and this leads to predictions in qualitative disagreement with other\nfeatures of the data. To resolve this problem we introduce a novel class of\nmodels that constrain the full probability distribution of activity along\nselected projections. We develop the mean-field theory for this class of models\nand apply it to recordings from 1000+ neurons in the mouse hippocampus.

To resolve this puzzle, this work draws\ninspiration from recent frameworks for causal modelling in quantum theory to\npropose a \"causal view\" of quantum systems. The causal view defines quantum\nsystems purely in terms of the causal structure of the unitary dynamics. The\nalgebraic representation of quantum systems is derived from the causal view: it\nis proven that every quantum system corresponds to a unique von Neumann algebra\nof operators. The causal view is extended with a definition of a \"classical\nquantum system\" inspired by quantum Darwinism. It is shown that such a system\ncorresponds to a unique commutative von Neumann operator algebra, completing\nthe derivation of the traditional algebraic approach to quantum systems from\nthe causal view. The causal view is contrasted with the \"epistemic view\" of\nquantum systems, which is incompatible with the algebraic approach."}

The interaction between the scalar field and\nmatter is described by a general expression that depends on the Hubble\nparameter, the time derivative of the scalar field, and the energy densities of\ncold dark matter and dark energy. This formulation involves real parameters\nthat modulate the interaction, as well as a coupling constant with the\ndimensions of the Hubble parameter.

The first is a purely\ntransverse contribution to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), where circularly\npolarized light induces a DC magnetization by stirring the charged fluid. This\ncontribution dominates the IFE in the QH regime. The second is the orbital\ninverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME), in which linearly polarized light\ngenerates a DC magnetization. Since the applied field in the ICME does not\nbreak time-reversal symmetry, the induced magnetization directly probes the\nchiral orbital response of the fluid at the driving frequency. We estimate that\nthe resulting magnetization lies in the range of 0.5-10 Bohr magnetons per\ncharge carrier in materials such as graphene and transition-metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) in the QH regime.

In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative\nsystems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation.

We consider a situation in which the maximum flow\ntime can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped\nHubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of\nthis parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original\nintegration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature\nthat facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time\nmodest.

By\nimposing specific constraints on the black hole's parameters, we demonstrate\nthat the WGC and WCCC can be compatible in certain regions. We examine the\nproperties of the KNKL black hole for $q/m > (Q/M )_{ext}$, where $(Q/M\n)_{ext}$ is the charge-to-mass ratio of a large extremal black hole. We present\nfigures to test the validity of both conjectures simultaneously. Without the\nspin parameter \\(a\\), the cloud of string parameter \\(b\\), quintessence\nparameter \\(\\gamma\\), and equation of state parameter \\(\\omega\\), the black\nhole either has two event horizons if \\(Q^2/M^2 \\leq 1\\) or none event horizon\nif \\(Q^2/M^2 > 1\\) which leads to a naked singularity that contradicts the\nWCCC. However, when \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(\\gamma\\), and \\(\\omega\\) are present, the\nblack hole has event horizons in some regions in the \\(Q^2/M^2 > 1\\) that\nensure the singularity is covered and both the WGC and WCCC are fulfilled.\nActually, we face this issue in the extremality state of the black hole viz\nthese conjectures remain viable, with the black hole maintaining an event\nhorizon. We conclude that certain regions of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(\\gamma\\), and\n\\(\\omega\\) parameters can make the WGC and WCCC compatible, indicating their\nagreement when these parameters are present."}

The standard operational formulation, widely used in\nquantum information, imposes a definite, acyclic causal order on agents'\noperations, contrasting with time-symmetric dynamics. Two prominent extensions\nof this framework are the multi-time state (MTS) formalism, which incorporates\ntime symmetry via arbitrary pre- and post-selection, and the post-selected\nclosed timelike curve (P-CTC) framework, which enables cyclic causal influences\nthrough post-selection on maximally entangled states.
