Scans of\nsubstrate-transferred coatings with diameters between 18 and 194 millimeters\nshowed birefringence non-uniformity at a median level of $0.1$~mrad. A similar\nepitaxial multilayer that was not substrate transferred, but remained on the\ngrowth wafer, had by far the least birefringence non-uniformity of all mirrors\ntested at $0.02$~mrad. On the other hand, the average birefringence of the\nepi-on-wafer coating and substrate-transferred coatings was indistinguishable.\nExcluding non-uniformity found at the location of crystal and bonding defects,\nwe conclude that the observed non-uniformity was imparted during the substrate\ntransfer process, likely during bonding. Quantifying the impact on the scatter\nloss in a LIGO-like interferometer, we find that birefringence non-uniformity\nat the levels seen here is unlikely to have a significant impact on\nperformance. Nonetheless, future efforts will focus on improved process control\nto minimize and ultimately eliminate the observed non-uniformity."}

However, this fast industrialisation has had a\nsignificant impact on quality control. Several studies have been carried out to\ncharacterise and minimise different types of cutting defects. Reviews published\nbetween 2008 and 2022 highlight that research often focuses on single-criterion\n___quality' approaches, aiming to minimise specific defects such as the\nHeat-Affected Zone, surface roughness, or kerf geometry. Consequently, efforts\nhave been directed at optimising specific aspects of quality rather than\nadopting a complete approach. Furthermore, these reviews reveal that cutting\nquality can be enhanced through the careful selection of laser manufacturing\nparameters and part parameters. However, while parameters such as material and\nthickness have been investigated, the influence of part morphology on cutting\nquality remains underexplored.___ Although some studies have examined the\neffects of material and thickness, part morphology is often limited to simple\nsegments with varying cutting lengths or angles. While other research has\ninvestigated the impact of angle size on cutting quality, no established method\nexists to systematically determine the influence of each part morphology on\ncutting quality.______ In response to this gap, the present study proposes to\nevaluate the criticality of cutting defects, as defined by existing standards,\nacross various part morphologies using a method adapted from Failure Modes,\nEffects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). The objective is to develop a global\napproach that examines the influence of all morphologies on all types of\ncutting defects. An industrial application shows that cutting defects,\nparticularly thermal ones, are strongly influenced by morphologies, while\nthickness affects them irregularly. Improvement priorities target critical\ndefects shaped by both factors. Burrs and adherent slag are critical in angles\nand arcs, while segments, often used in studies, are less sensitive._________\nThese observations lead to the definition of design limits. This method offers\na detailed analysis of the influence of design data on quality, providing\npractical tools for improving industrial processes._________"}

High-precision density measurements\nwere obtained using a single-sinker magnetic suspension densimeter over a\ntemperature range of (250 to 350) K and pressures up to 20 MPa. The\nexperimental data were compared with EoS predictions to evaluate their\naccuracy. AGA8-DC92 and GERG-2008 showed excellent agreement with the\nexperimental data, with deviations within their stated uncertainty. In\ncontrast, SGERG-88 exhibited significantly larger deviations for this RLNG\nmixture, particularly at low temperatures of (250 to 260) K, where\ndiscrepancies reached up to 3 %. Even at 300 K, deviations larger than 0.4 %\nwere observed at high pressures, within the model's uncertainty, but notably\nhigher than those of the other two EoSs. The analysis was extended to three\nconventional 11-component natural gas mixtures (labeled G420 NG, G431 NG, and\nG432 NG), previously studied by our group using the same methodology. While\nSGERG-88 showed reduced accuracy for the RLNG mixture, it performed reasonably\nwell for these three mixtures, despite two of them have a very similar\ncomposition to the RLNG. This discrepancy is attributed to the lower CO2 and N2\ncontent typical in RLNG mixtures, demonstrating the sensitivity of EoS\nperformance to minor differences in composition.

Light\nfields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as\noptical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field\nof optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction\nprocess across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by\nthe presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found\na myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation\nto microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among\nothers.

By relating the\ncoupling constant of the sum over 2-complexes to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter\n$\\gamma$, we reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the range $0 < \\gamma\n\\lesssim 1/2$.

It introduces a novel framework, named spinfoam\nstack, to systematically sum spinfoam amplitudes over an infinite class of\n2-complexes. These complexes are generated by stacking an arbitrary number of\nfaces upon a simpler root complex. The central result is obtained by analyzing\nthe amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area\nof internal faces is taken to infinity. In this limit, the amplitude as an\nintegral localizes via a stationary phase mechanism onto a critical manifold.\nThis manifold is shown to be the space of SU(2) flat connections on the\nunderlying complex. This localization effectively reduces the bulk dynamics\nfrom a theory of quantum geometry to a topological theory akin to SU(2) BF\ntheory. For spinfoams on topologically trivial manifolds, this result has a\npowerful consequence: the spinfoam stack amplitude factorizes into a\ntriangulation-dependent normalization factor and a finite part that depends\nonly on the boundary data. Renormalizing the amplitude yields a finite result\nthat is manifestly independent of the bulk structure of the 2-complex.

The semi-device-independent (SDI) framework offers\na balance between needed assumptions and experimental feasibility. In this\nwork, we study the energy-constrained SDI scenario, where the only assumption\nin a prepare-and-measure setup is an upper bound on the energy of the prepared\nquantum states. In contrast to previous studies that restricted the preparation\nand measurement devices to be classically correlated, we show that allowing\nentanglement strictly enlarges the set of achievable correlations. We identify\ntwo operational consequences of this result. The first concerns randomness\ncertification, where we show that allowing the adversary to employ entangled\nstrategies may significantly reduce the amount of certifiable randomness. This\nincludes situations where the amount of randomness drops to zero in the\npresence of entanglement, while it remains positive when entanglement is\nexcluded. Second, for the task of distinguishing an arbitrary quantum channel\nfrom the identity, we show that the known dimension-independent bound on the\nadvantage conferred by entanglement is violated under an energy constraint."}

The two ingoing photons with\narbitrary frequency-polarization spectrum impinge onto the sphere along two\ndifferent directions and, as consequence of matter losses, their scattering\ninvolves the three independent processes where two, one and zero outgoing\nphotons survive. Non-collinearity of ingoing photons causes the existence of\ntwo different quantum paths they can follow upon scattering, this producing\ninterference effects in the detection of the above three processes which is\ngoverned by the wavepacket spectral symmetry. By exploiting rotational\ninvariance, we show that different classes of scattering geometries exist such\nthat the coincidence detection of the scattered photons shows perfect\nconstructive or destructive (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference, both for symmetric\nand antisymmetric wavepackets. To assess the impact of matter dispersion/losses\non quantum interference effects accompanying photons detection, we analyze the\nscattering of narrow band two-photon wavepackets by high-index dielectric lossy\nspheres. We show that classical Mie resonance peaks, due to their Fano-like\ntraits, yield very strong constructive and destructive interference effects,\noccurring when the wavepacket carrier frequency matches the resonance frequency\nand side Fano dip frequency, respectively. In addition we consider the overall\nscattering probabilities of two, one and zero photons and we prove that, at the\nMie resonance frequencies, they exhibit quantum interference effects which are\nextremely sensitive to the spectral symmetry of the input wavepacket, thus\nsuggesting an efficient spectral technique assisted by matter losses to\nidentify entanglement."}

In\nthe 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the\nsystem in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in\nthe terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The\nphoton-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective\nsuper-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition.\nAs the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident\nsignal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar\nidler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture\nis into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific,\nhighly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane.\nOutside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum\ndevices for further processing. Using a scattering-operator formalism we derive\nresonance and criticality conditions that govern this two-step process and\nobtain analytic transduction efficiencies. For infinite lattices, we predict\ntransduction efficiencies into specific spatial directions of up to 50%, while\nthe overall, undirected transduction efficiency can be higher. An analysis for\nfinite arrays of $N^2$ emitters, shows that the output is collimated into lobes\nthat narrow as $1/\\sqrt{N}$.

In the modern era, light can not only be used in its raw form but can also\nbe used as a versatile tool. Generally, light fields carry energy and momentum\n(both linear and angular). Due to the transfer of linear momentum from light to\nmatter, the radiation pressure is exerted, whereas, the intrinsic spin angular\nmomentum (SAM) is associated with the polarization states of light. Light\nfields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as\noptical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field\nof optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction\nprocess across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by\nthe presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found\na myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation\nto microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among\nothers. Here, we revisit some of the fundamental concepts on optical vortices\nand discuss extensively on how this new dimension of light i.e., the OAM, has\nbeen exploited in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. We discuss the\ndifferent types of vortex beams, the techniques used to generate and detect\ntheir OAM, and their propagation. Particularly, we put a special emphasis on\nthe utilization of vortex beams in nonlinear regimes to explain different\noptical phenomena such as the second harmonic generation, parametric\ndown-conversion, and high-order harmonic generation. The generation of vortex\nbeams in the UV to XUV regimes, encoded with higher OAM values, could\npotentially extend their application range to areas such as high-capacity data\ntransmission, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, phase-contrast imaging,\nand particle trapping in optical tweezers, among others."}
