Abstract: Most use cases of reconfigurable antennas require an accurate forward model mapping configuration to radiated field (and reflections at feeds). Emerging dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) confront the conventional approach of extracting such a model from a numerical simulation with multiple challenges. First, the cost of accurately simulating an intricate and electrically large DMA architecture might be prohibitive. Second, the model-reality mismatch due to fabrication inaccuracies might be substantial, especially at higher frequencies and for DMA architectures leveraging strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) to maximize their tunability. These considerations motivate an experimental parameter estimation for DMA forward models. The main challenge lies in the forward model's non-linearity due to inter-element MC. Multiport network theory (MNT) can accurately capture MC but the MC parameters cannot be measured directly. In this article, we demonstrate the experimental estimation of a high-accuracy proxy MNT model for a 19-GHz DMA with 7 feeds and 96 elements, where all feeds and elements are strongly coupled via a chaotic cavity. For a given DMA configuration and excitation, our proxy MNT model predicts the reflected field at the feeds and the radiated field with accuracies of 40.3 dB and 37.7 dB, respectively. A simpler, MC-unaware benchmark model only achieves 2.6 dB and 3.3 dB, respectively. We systematically examine the influence of the number of feeds and measured DMA configurations on the model accuracy, motivating the inclusion of "auxiliary calibration feeds" to facilitate the parameter estimation when the intended DMA operation is limited to a single feed. Finally, we measure DMA configurations optimized based on our proxy MNT model.

Abstract: This letter presents the design and implementation of a compact high-efficiency octave microwave rectifier. A key highlight is the novel segmented impedance matching method, a unique approach that expands the rectifier bandwidth. The diode reactance is initially regulated by a series short-ended microstrip line. Impedance-compensated structures, characterized by varying admittance properties across an extensive frequency range, partition the operating frequency band into two segments based on the input impedance, thereby minimizing impedance variation. Ultimately, the input impedance is matched by a novel triple-band matching network. An octave rectifier was fabricated and measured. Results demonstrate that the rectifier achieves over 50% efficiency over 1.3-2.55 GHz fractional bandwidth 64.9% at 0-dBm RF input power. Even with a decrease in input power to -10 dBm, the rectifier maintains over 30% efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Local high strain in solid rocket motor grains is a primary cause of structural failure. However, traditional numerical simulations are computationally expensive, and existing surrogate models cannot explicitly establish geometric models and accurately capture high-strain regions. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive graph network, GrainGNet, which employs an adaptive pooling dynamic node selection mechanism to effectively preserve the key mechanical features of structurally critical regions, while concurrently utilising feature fusion to transmit deep features and enhance the model's representational capacity. In the joint prediction task involving four sequential conditions--curing and cooling, storage, overloading, and ignition--GrainGNet reduces the mean squared error by 62.8% compared to the baseline graph U-Net model, with only a 5.2% increase in parameter count and an approximately sevenfold improvement in training efficiency. Furthermore, in the high-strain regions of debonding seams, the prediction error is further reduced by 33% compared to the second-best method, offering a computationally efficient and high-fidelity approach to evaluate motor structural safety.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Classical chaos theory rests on the notion of universality, whereby disparate dynamical systems share identical scaling laws. Existing universality classes, however, implicitly assume Markovian dynamics. Here, a logistic map endowed with power law memory is used to show that Feigenbaum universality breaks down when temporal correlations decay sufficiently slowly. A critical memory exponent is identified that separates perturbative and memory dominated regimes, demonstrating that long range memory acts as a relevant renormalisation operator and generates a new universality class of chaotic dynamics. The onset of chaos is accompanied by fractional scaling of Lyapunov exponents, in quantitative agreement with analytical predictions. These results establish temporal correlations as a previously unexplored axis of universality in chaotic systems, with implications for physical, biological and geophysical settings where memory effects are intrinsic.

TL;DR: 研究了如何优化Ginelli等提出的计算协变李雅普诺夫向量（CLVs）算法的前后暂态阶段终止时间，以提高在保守哈密顿系统中计算其协变李雅普诺夫空间的准确性。提出了一个调整算法的方法，通过避免中心子空间中CLVs的对齐和反对齐，从而在长时期内保持计算的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLVs在多个应用中都很有用，但如何确定计算其最优时间窗仍是一个未解问题。本文旨在通过研究两种方法来确定如何优雅地结束Ginelli等算法中计算CLVs所需的前向和反向暂态阶段，以提高在保守哈密顿系统中计算CLVs的准确性。

Method: 本文研究了两种方法来确定Ginelli等算法中CLVs计算的前后暂态阶段终止时间，并应用于双自由度的Hénon-Heiles系统和三自由度非线性耦合谐振器系统。通过比较两种方法的结果，发现它们的求解结果非常相似，从而推荐了其中一种更高效的方法。

Result: 研究发现，CLVs的二维中心子空间计算的准确性在反向过程长时间内显著降低。通过分析中心子空间的切线动力学，发现CLVs倾向于对齐或反对齐，并据此提出了调整算法的方法，以在长时期内避免这种对齐或反对齐，从而提高了计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个改进算法的方法，以在长期内提高在保守哈密顿系统中使用Ginelli等算法进行CLVs计算的中心子空间的准确性。该方法通过避免CLVs在中心子空间中的对齐或反对齐来实现。

Abstract: Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) are useful in multiple applications, but the optimal time windows needed to accurately compute these vectors are yet unclear. To remedy this, we investigate two methods for determining when to safely terminate the forward and backward transient phases of the CLV computation algorithm by Ginelli et al.~\cite{GinelliEtAl2007} when applied to chaotic orbits of conservative Hamiltonian systems. We perform this investigation for two prototypical Hamiltonian systems, namely the well-known Hénon-Heiles system of two degrees of freedom and a system of three nonlinearly coupled harmonic oscillators having three degrees of freedom, finding very similar results for the two methods and thus recommending the more efficient one. We find that the accuracy of two-dimesnional center subspace computations is significantly reduced when the backward evolution stages of the algorithm are performed over long time intervals. We explain this observation by examining the tangent dynamics of the center subspace wherein CLVs tend to align/anti-align, and we propose an adaptation of the algorithm that improves the accuracy of such computations over long times by preventing this alignment/anti-alignment of CLVs in the center subspace.

### [6] [Analytical prediction of delayed Hopf bifurcations in a simplified stochastic model of reed musical instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23269)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解风琴等乐器的物理动态行为，特别是在随机扰动下的稳定性与分岔，有助于改进乐器设计与演奏方法。

Result: 分岔参数的确定值分为确定性与随机性两种情况，分析结果与数值模拟一致。

Conclusion: 通过随机微分方程模拟，确定了风琴模型的分岔临界值，并验证了结果的可行性和准确性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a simplified single reed instrument model subject to a stochastic forcing of white noise type when one of its bifurcation parameters (the dimensionless blowing pressure) increases linearly over time and crosses the Hopf bifurcation point of its trivial equilibrium position. The stochastic slow dynamics of the model is first obtained by means of the stochastic averaging method. The resulting averaged system reduces to a non-autonomous one-dimensional It{ô} stochastic differential equation governing the time evolution of the mouthpiece pressure amplitude. Under relevant approximations the latter is solved analytically treating separately cases where noise can be ignored and cases where it cannot. From that, two analytical expressions of the bifurcation parameter value for which the mouthpiece pressure amplitude gets its initial value back are deduced. These special values of the bifurcation parameter characterize the effective appearance of sound in the instrument and are called deterministic dynamic bifurcation point if the noise can be neglected and stochastic dynamic bifurcation point otherwise. Finally, for illustration and validation purposes, the analytical results are compared with direct numerical integration of the model in both deterministic and stochastic situations. In each considered case, a good agreement is observed between theoretical results and numerical simulations, which validates the proposed analysis.

Abstract: Twisted multilayer moiré materials are generically quasiperiodic on the moiré scale due to the interference of different misaligned moiré periodicities. Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures.

TL;DR: Domain experts almost always root cause analyze. Do what's required for your customer, but engineers sometimes struggle. Qubits rely on defects, and electrostatic force microscopy can map them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the defects in qubits is key to improving their performance. The presence of defects can significantly impact qubit coherence, making it essential to identify and characterize them. This paper explores the use of electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) to address this challenge, which is particularly important given the complexity of semiconductor-based quantum computing.

Method: The paper employs cryogenic electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) to characterize aluminum oxide defects on bulk silicon surfaces. The technique provides high spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity, enabling the detection of individual defects and their charge states. The authors also use electrostatic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) to map tip-backgate voltages and identify specific types of defects.

Result: The study successfully identifies multiple types of surface defects in aluminum oxide, including aluminum vacancies and carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen impurities. These findings demonstrate that EFM is a powerful tool for characterizing defects at the atomic level, which can aid in improving qubit coherence in quantum dot-based systems.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of electrostatic force microscopy in advancing quantum computing by enabling defect characterization at the atomic level. The methods described provide a pathway for future research in solid-state qubit development, emphasizing the importance of precise and sensitive imaging techniques in mitigating noise sources in quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: The coherence of quantum dot qubits fabricated in semiconductors is often limited by charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics, which are material- and process-dependent. Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits.

Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution < 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.

TL;DR:  paper introduces quantitative analysis of advanced logic transistors based on Hf/Zr gate stacks which achieve better EOT than existing dielectrics and support multi-Vth tuning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging logic scaling and memory devices demand high performance gate dielectrics with sub-nano EOT, low leakage, and tunable Vth. overcoming these challenges enables scalable transistors.

Method:  Analytical modeling, simulations, and experiments using Hf/Zr and Al2O3-HX structures.Annealing and characterization techniques were employed to evaluate EOT, leakage, and Vth.

Result: HZHA achieves 8.4 A EOT with 200 mV flatband shift and 87 mV drift. HA and HZHA exhibit comparable stability under stress. Quantitative metrics surpass existing dielectrics.

Conclusion:  The paper establishes HZHA as RMG-compatible,Vth-tunable dielectric for beyond-1 nm logic scaling. Provides new insights into dipole behavior in Hf/Zr systems and interfacial diffusion.

Abstract: Advanced logic transistors require gate dielectrics that achieve sub-nanometer equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), suppress leakage, and satisfy three key requirements: (i) compatibility with RMG-like high-temperature processing, (ii) sufficient Vth tunability for multi-Vth design, and (iii) high device reliability. However, meeting all of these requirements simultaneously has been difficult with conventional high-k systems. In this work, we demonstrate that Hf/Zr-based gate stacks quantitatively satisfy these conditions. After a 700 C N2 anneal, the HZH superlattice achieves an EOT of 7.3 A, lower than conventional HfO2-only stacks (8.5 A) while maintaining comparable leakage. Embedding a 3 A Al2O3 dipole within an HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2 superlattice (HZHA) breaks the conventional dipole trade-off, achieving an EOT of 8.4 A, lower than the 9.0 A of a standard HfO2/Al2O3 stack, while providing a flatband voltage shift greater than 200 mV, thereby enabling multi-Vth tuning without compromising scaling. Furthermore, under -2 V negative-bias temperature stress at 125 C for 100 s, HZHA and HA exhibit comparable flatband voltage drifts of 87 mV and 97 mV, respectively, confirming that strong Vth tunability and sub-nanometer EOT can be achieved without compromising stability. In addition to these quantitative advances, this study reveals previously unreported physical insights into dipole behavior and interfacial diffusion in ultrathin Hf/Zr multilayers. These results establish HZHA as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier.

Abstract: We study polaritonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) created in GaN waveguides. The existence of symmetry-protected BICs is confirmed by the suppression of light emission and the observation of a polarization vortex in momentum space. Upon increasing the pumping, polariton population accumulates at the BIC and we observe polariton lasing from the blueshifted BIC states. The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions.

Abstract: The optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been customarily calculated ab initio using plane waves and without separating the most important orbitals contributions. In the family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) monolayers lacking inversion symmetry, we take advantage of the mostly d-orbital content of the Bloch bands around the semiconductor gap to reduce the calculation of the linear and quadratic optical susceptibilities to a very minimal model. Such a simple approach reproduces well first principles calculations and could be the starting point for the inclusion of many-body effects and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in TMDCs with only a few energy bands in a numerically inexpensive way.

Abstract: We present a theory of the graphene nanoslide, a fundamental device for graphene straintronics that realizes a single pseudogauge barrier. We solve the scattering problem in closed form and demonstrate that the nanoslide gives rise to a hybrid pseudogauge and electrostatic cavity in the bipolar regime, and hosts one-dimensional transverse channels. The latter can be tuned using a bottom gate between valley chiral or counterpropagating modes, as well as one-dimensional flatbands. Hence, the local density of states near the barrier depends strongly on the gate voltage with a tunable sublattice and electron-hole asymmetry. In the presence of electron-electron interactions, the nanoslide allows for in-situ tuning between a chiral and ordinary Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate quantum dots and spin-orbit coupling for potential spin-based quantum computing.

Method: The authors use the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, supported by variational calculations.

Result: Electron-electron interactions enhance spin transitions and AQ states become susceptible to local magnetic fields, which is crucial for qubit decoherence. Strong interaction U leads to various transitions between ABS, YSR, and Coulomb blockade regions.

Conclusion: The work provides a detailed analysis of the even-parity sector in Andreev pair qubits, highlighting potential applications in spin control and quantum computation.

Abstract: We investigate the superconducting Anderson impurity model for interacting quantum dot Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a term accounting for tunnelling through higher-energy orbitals. These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to model the Andreev spin qubit, where quantum information is encoded in spinful odd-parity subgap states. Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations. Electron-electron interaction admixes single-occupancy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) components into the ABS states, thereby strongly enhancing spin transitions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The ABS states can thus become sensitive to local magnetic field fluctuations, which has implications for decoherence in Andreev pair qubits. For strong interaction $U$, especially in the cross-over region between the ABS and YSR regimes for $U \sim 2Δ$, charge, spin, and inductive transitions can all become strong, offering avenues for spin control and quantum transduction.

Abstract: In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.

Abstract: Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.

Abstract: Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.

Abstract: Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.

TL;DR: The quantum anomalous Hall effect can be realized in metallic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding topological phases and their applications in electronics is a key motivation in condensed matter physics.

Method: Theoretical analysis of metallic systems and their electronic properties was conducted using quantum mechanical models and simulations.

Result: Metallic systems can exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect without a bulk energy gap, characterized by isotropic bulk conduction channels coexisting with chiral edge channels. In a six-terminal setup, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can arise due to dephasing effects despite the Hall resistivity not being quantized. The quantized Hall conductivity is robust against disorder.

Conclusion: The discovery broadens the material platform for realizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect, potentially enabling its study at elevated temperatures, and opens new avenues for both fundamental understanding and practical applications in electronics.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect holds fundamental importance in topological physics and technological promise for electronics. It is generally believed that the QAH effect can only be realized in insulators. In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate that the QAH effect can also be realized in metallic systems, representing a phase distinct from the conventional QAH phase in insulators. This phase is characterized by the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels without a bulk energy gap. Notably, in a six-terminal Hall bar, our calculations show that, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can emerge due to dephasing, despite the Hall resistivity itself never becoming quantized. Furthermore, the quantized Hall conductivity exhibits remarkable robustness against disorder. Our findings not only extend the range of materials capable of hosting the QAH effect from insulators to metals, but also provide insights that may pave the way for the experimental realization of the QAH effect at elevated temperatures.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates robust, non-thermal rotation of the Néel vector in Mn₂Au driven by terahertz current pulses, with ultrafast switching and minimal thermal effects, offering a promising pathway for terahertz spin-orbitronics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to enable ultrafast electric manipulation of magnetic order, which is critical for advancing terahertz data processing technologies. This has applications in high-speed computing and memory devices where magnetic data processing at terahertz frequencies is essential.

Method: The researchers used phase-locked terahertz current pulses to drive the switching of the Néel vector in Mn₂Au. They employed nonlinear optical imaging, transient optical birefringence, and atomistic spin-dynamics simulations to analyze and model the switching behavior.

Result: The results show that the Néel vector rotates by ±90° in response to the terahertz current pulses, with ultrafast switching times (less than 15 picoseconds) and minimal thermal effects. The simulations predict that this switching mechanism can be further optimized for even faster and lower energy processes.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in controlling magnetic order via electric currents opens new avenues for on-chip applications in terahertz spin-orbitronics, particularly in magnetoelectric materials and devices where spin manipulation at high frequencies is crucial for advanced computing and data storage technologies.

Abstract: Ultrafast electric manipulation of magnetic order in solids is critical for the development of future terahertz data processing. A fascinating concept for such high-speed operation is offered in metallic antiferromagnets by Néel spin-orbit torque. It should allow one to coherently rotate the ordered spins by simply applying an electric current of suitable amplitude and polarity. However, such switching has been severely hampered by competing heat-induced effects, and it has not yet been achieved on the intrinsically ultrafast time scales of antiferromagnets. Here, we report robust, direction-controlled and non-thermal rotation of the Néel vector $\mathbf{L}$ by $\pm$90° at room temperature in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au driven by phase-locked terahertz current pulses. All observed features are consistent with ultrafast Néel spin-orbit torque: First, nonlinear optical imaging reveals that the terahertz current direction sets the final orientation of $\mathbf{L}$ in the absence of any bias field for at least two months. Second, transient optical birefringence shows that the switching proceeds ultrafast in less than 15 picoseconds. Finally, atomistic spin-dynamics simulations reproduce the observed dynamics and confirm the minor role of thermal effects. While the switching is already one order of magnitude faster than in ferromagnets at comparable dissipated energy, our simulations predict routes toward switching times and energies which are another order of magnitude lower. Our approach can be transferred to electric-field-driven switching in many more antiferromagnets, including magnetoelectric insulators. The engineering of spin torques, resonance frequencies and read-out mechanisms provides an exciting pathway toward on-chip applications of terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbitronics.

Abstract: Controllable quasiparticle radiation in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for efficient carrier recombination, tunable emission, and modulation of valley polarization which are strongly determined by both the density and nature of underlying excitonic species. Conventional chemical doping techniques, however, often hinder the reversibility and density of excitonic charge states (exciton and trion) due to unfavorable interactions between dopant and 2D materials. In this work, efficient excitonic charge state conversion is achieved by doping monolayer WS$_2$ using water rinsed PVA and the quasiparticle densities are further enhanced by applying high periodic biaxial strain (up to 2.3%) through a 2D silica microsphere array. The method presented here enables nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion without the need of electrostatic gating, while delivering thermally stable trions with a large binding energy of ~56 meV and a high free electron density of ~3$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Strain-induced funneling of the PVA-injected free electrons substantially increases the excitonic quasiparticle densities and boosts the trion emission by 41%. Overall, this approach establishes a versatile platform for excitonic charge state conversion and enhanced quasiparticle density in 2D materials, offering promising opportunities for future optical data storage, quantum-light and display technologies.

Motivation: Germanium hole spin qubits have gained attention due to strong spin-orbit coupling, and this work aims to leverage strain effects for acoustic-based spin control and coupling.

Method: Numerical simulations of coherent control using surface acoustic waves were employed to study the strain modulation of g-tensor matrix and Rabi frequency dependence on strain components.

Result: The study reveals that dynamic periodic strain can modulate the g-tensor matrix, enabling fast spin rotation even at small acoustic amplitudes. Additionally, the Rabi frequency shows strong anisotropy and confinement dependence, which could be crucial for device design.

Conclusion: This work establishes the foundation for using acoustic waves to drive spin control in germanium hole spin qubits, highlighting the potential of strain effects in spin-phonon coupling applications.

Abstract: Germanium hole spin qubits based on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well have attracted much research attention due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits.

Abstract: We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.

Abstract: Two-band Hamiltonians provide a typical description of topological band structures, in which the eigenfunctions can be characterized by a %Bloch vector field whose winding number that defines an integer topological invariant. This winding number is quantized and protected against continuous deformations of the Hamiltonian. Here we show that the Bloch vector and its winding number can be directly related to the gradient of the energy dispersion. Since the energy gradient is proportional to the group velocity, our result establishes an experimentally accessible correspondence between the Bloch vector field and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We discuss a mapping between the gradient of the energy dispersion and the Bloch vector. This implies a direct and measurable relation between two-band Hamiltonians and their underlying topological structures.

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are invariably embedded in matter environments whose gravitational influence can alter key strong-field features of the spacetime. In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations.

Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of spherically symmetric radial domain walls (kinks) in the background of a two-way traversable Simpson-Visser wormhole. By numerically solving the scalar-field equation with a double-well potential, we show that the wormhole throat parameter $a$ has a strong impact on the dynamics of the radial kink: larger $a$ leads to wider throats and allows the domain wall to oscillate across the throat with large amplitude, whereas smaller $a$ confines the motion nearby the throat. In addition, each time the kink crosses the wormhole throat, it emits scalar wave packets, causing its oscillation amplitude to gradually decrease. Our results reveal how the wormhole geometry influences the motion of defects and their energy transfer, providing new insights into the dynamics of topological defects in exotic spacetime.

Abstract: Lunar-based gravitational-wave interferometry is a fascinating endeavor, and was proposed as a promising approach to bridge the observational gap between space-borne and ground-based detectors. In this work, we adopt the Fisher-matrix method to examine the angular-resolution performance of the newly proposed Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (CIGO) on the lunar crater rim near the north pole, together with TianQin and LISA, for monochromatic sources in the 0.1-10 Hz band. We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band.

Abstract: Ghost stars are compact configurations characterized by an arbitrarily small total mass. Such objects require regions of negative energy density -a condition typically regarded as unphysical within the context of conventional stellar models. Nevertheless, negative energy densities arise naturally in traversable wormhole geometries, where the violation of the null energy condition is essential to sustain the flaring-out behavior at the throat. This connection suggests that ghost-like configurations may find a natural realization within wormhole physics. In this work, we investigate the existence of ghost configurations by analyzing their associated Hawking mass. Although in spherical symmetry the Misner and Hawking masses are known to coincide, we show that when the ghost condition is extended beyond spherical symmetry and applied to the Hawking mass, it faces topological obstructions that hinder its straightforward realization. As a concrete example, we demonstrate that a Casimir-like traversable wormhole can be naturally constructed within this framework. Finally, to illustrate the properties of the resulting geometry, we analyze its Penrose-Carter diagram.

Abstract: A detailed canonical analysis for Pontryagin and Euler classes with a Barbero-Immirzi [BI] parameter is developed.

We report the complete canonical structure and the symmetries of the theory; we count the physical degrees of freedom and identify reducibility conditions among the constraints. In addition, in our results, if we consider the $BI$ parameter takes the value of $γ= \pm i $, then the self-dual representation of these invariants is reproduced. Finally, we couple the invariants to the Holst action and explore the canonical analysis.

Abstract: We study a thick brane scenario within the Palatini formulation of gravity, where the metric and affine connection are treated as independent variables. By introducing a non-minimal coupling between a bulk scalar field and the Ricci scalar, we obtain analytic solutions under a flat, four-dimensional Poincaré-invariant metric with a kink-like scalar configuration. The warp factor exhibits a bell-shaped profile, while the scalar potential forms a symmetric volcano-like structure, characteristic of a finite-thickness brane. The corresponding energy density is regular and localized, featuring a central peak with symmetrically placed negative minima. Through the analysis of linear tensor perturbations, we derive a Schrödinger-like equation with supersymmetric factorization, ensuring the absence of tachyonic modes and thus the stability of the background configuration. The effective potential also takes a volcano-like form that supports a localized graviton zero mode, confirming the recovery of four-dimensional gravity on the brane. A numerical study of the massive Kaluza--Klein spectrum reveals the progressive delocalization of massive modes into the bulk.
  Our results demonstrate a stable and physically consistent thick brane configuration within the Palatini gravity framework, offering new insights into gravity localization and braneworld phenomenology.

Abstract: In asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, we consider a real massiver scalar field in the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar (EMS) model and examine both scalar-hairy black hole solutions induced by the nonminimal coupling to the Maxwell field and tachyonic-hairy solutions driven by the scalar potential. When the scalar potential vanishes, scalar-hairy black holes emerge with profiles and properties similar to those observed in flat spacetime. The presence of the scalar potential additionally induces tachyonic-hairy solutions, leading to the coexistence of these two distinct hairy phases in different regions of the parameter space. The phase diagram reveals a first-order phase transition line between the tachyonic-hairy and scalar-hairy phases, originating at a critical point in the extreme temperature and chemical potential regime. Our detailed analysis shows that this phase transition is directly associated with the self-overlap region of the scalar-hairy phase and its start point. Moreover, increasing the coupling strength $λ$ shifts the critical point to higher temperature and chemical potential.

Abstract: We develop a formulation of nonlinear cosmological perturbations on superhorizon scales in multi-fluid systems. It is based on the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism combined with a spatial gradient expansion characterized by a small expansion parameter defined as the ratio of the comoving wavenumber to the Hubble scale. The background spacetime is assumed to be a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. Within this framework, we explicitly construct nonlinear long-wavelength solutions for cosmological perturbations. Since multi-fluid systems are inherently non-adiabatic, these solutions admit both adiabatic and entropy modes already at leading nonlinear order. We define adiabatic and entropy perturbations and discuss the non-uniqueness in defining pure entropy perturbations. Using different choices of pure entropy initial conditions, we analyze the time evolution of physical quantities such as the curvature perturbation and density perturbations in the geodesic slicing for two-fluid systems.

Abstract: In this work, we construct new classes of topological black hole solutions in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime using a novel model of nonlinear electrodynamics called Modification Maxwell (ModMax) and Modification phantom or Modification anti-Maxwell (ModAMax). We then evaluate the thermodynamic quantities and verify the first law of thermodynamics. Our study examines how the parameters of the ModMax and ModAMax fields, as well as the topological constant, affect the black hole solutions, thermodynamic quantities, and local and global thermal stabilities. Furthermore, within the framework of extended phase space thermodynamics, we analyze the Joule-Thomson expansion process and determine the inversion curves. This analysis reveals that the ModMax and ModAMax parameters significantly alter the cooling and heating behavior of these AdS black holes, depending on their topology. Finally, by treating these topological Mod(A)Max AdS black holes as heat engines, we assess their efficiencies, demonstrating that the parameters of nonlinear electrodynamics and horizon topology play crucial roles in enhancing or suppressing the system's thermodynamic performance.

Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the physics of gravitational waves, exploring both the theoretical foundations and the most recent experimental advances. After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide.

Abstract: Woodward proposed that driven mass-energy fluctuations could yield a frequency-dependent "Machian" gravitational response $\propto \partial_t^2 M_{\rm loc}(t)$, amplified by a Sciama-scale cosmic potential $Φ/c^2\sim -1$. We test this claim covariantly in (i) Einstein gravity and (ii) Hoyle-Narlikar (HN) conformal scalar-tensor gravity. In GR, the Landau-Lifshitz relaxed equations in harmonic gauge contain nonlinear terms of the form $H^{αβ}\,\partial_α\partial_βH^{μν}$, including a near-zone piece $H^{00}\,\partial_t^2 H^{μν}$. These terms are not independent matter sources; they arise from expanding the curved wave operator about a flat background. Moving them back to the left-hand side restores the quasilinear principal part, and for laboratory devices their size is suppressed by $\sim (U_N/c^2)(ωL/c)^2\ll 1$, with no enhancement by any cosmological potential. In HN theory, the conformal scalar satisfies $\nabla_a\nabla^a m + (R/6)m=λN$. For a localized device of size $L$ driven at angular frequency $ω$, $|(c^{-2}\partial_t^2 m_s)|/|\nabla^2 m_s|\sim (ωL/c)^2\ll 1$, so the response is effectively instantaneous (Poisson-like), not wave-amplified. Baryon-number conservation fixes the scalar charge, so the rest-mass monopole cannot oscillate; any radiating monopole requires nonconservative internal-energy variations, further suppressed by $E_{\rm int}/(M c^2)$ and by $M_{\rm dev}/M_H$. Thus any Mach-effect thrust is far too small for practical propulsion.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the Einstein constraint equations in vacuum by a new method, which allows us to prescribe four scalar quantities, representing the full dynamical degrees of freedom of the constraint system. We show that once appropriate gauge conditions have been chosen and four scalars freely specified (modulo $\ell\leq 1$ modes), we can rewrite the constraint equations as a well-posed system of coupled transport and elliptic equations on $2$-spheres, which we solve by an iteration procedure. Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu. Though in our main theorem, we only specify conditions consistent with $g-g_{Schw}=O(r^{-1-δ})$, $k=O(r^{-2-δ})$, the method is flexible enough to be applied in many other situations. It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen. In fact, an important motivation for developing our method is to show that the result of Shen is sharp, i.e., construct small, smooth initial data sets which violate Shen's decay conditions, and for which the stability of the Minkowski space result is wrong.

Abstract: We investigate metric perturbations of a spherically symmetric black hole in higher curvature gravity. We show that higher curvature corrections deform the near-horizon region of the effective potential, and that the deviations of the quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies from their general relativity (GR) values become more pronounced for overtone modes. We find that, as the order of the higher curvature term increases, the deformations approach the horizon and the deviations of the overtone QNM frequencies grow progressively larger. We also analyze the ringdown waveforms in the higher curvature gravity model. We consider setups in which the deviations from the vacuum-GR QNMs remain mild for the fundamental mode and the first few overtones, and show that these shifted QNMs can be identified in the ringdown signal through waveform fitting.

Abstract: Dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a parity-violating modification of general relativity, is regarded as a low-energy effective theory arising from string theory. Gravitational waves provide a powerful probe for testing its predictions. However, current gravitational wave observations are unable to place meaningful constraints on this theory through phase measurements, due to limitations from detector noise and the validity requirements of the waveform models. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the prospects for constraining the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity with future gravitational-wave detectors using stellar mass black holes binary. We quantify how the constraining capacities vary across different detectors and source parameters, and identify the regions of parameter space that satisfy the small-coupling condition. Furthermore, by incorporating an astrophysically motivated mass distribution model for stellar mass black hole binaries, we estimate the potential of upcoming observatories.

Abstract: We investigate the polarized images of an equatorial emitting ring around a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole, which introduces an additional deformation parameter. The deformation parameter $η$ allows the spin parameter to extend beyond the bounds imposed by the standard Kerr black hole. The results indicate that the polarized images depend not only on the magnetic field configuration, fluid velocity, and observer inclination angle, but also on the deformation parameter and the spin parameter. As the deformation parameter increases, the polarization intensity decreases monotonically when the magnetic field lies in the equatorial plane, whereas it does not vary monotonically when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the equatorial plane. The variation of the electric vector position angle with the deformation parameter is complex. For a fixed deformation parameter, the polarization intensity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the spin parameter and varies with azimuthal angle. We also investigate the impact of the deformation parameter on the Stokes Q-U loops. The imprint of the deformation parameter in polarized images may serve as a high-precision observational probe for detecting deviations of black hole spacetime from the Kerr geometry and testing general relativity.

Abstract: We investigate the microstructure of Kerr Newman black holes in modified gravity of the f(R) type using a topological complex analytic framework inspired by holography. In this approach, black hole microstates are identified with singularities of an analytically continued partition function, and the entropy is obtained from residues weighted by winding numbers. We show that the microstructure is characterized by a discrete topological index, which encodes both horizon structure and thermodynamic stability. Non extremal Kerr Newman black holes with both inner and outer horizons correspond to a vanishing topological index, while single horizon configurations correspond to a positive unit topological index. An explicit Starobinsky type modified gravity model demonstrates that this classification is robust under changes to the gravitational sector. We further discuss the limitations of the analytic continuation procedure and suggest that this topological classification may indicate a form of phase protection in black hole thermodynamics.

We initially prove an area theorem showing that the minimal throat surface of a traversable wormhole cannot increase using Raychaudhuri's equation together with the null energy condition for the infalling matter. Then, the max-flow in the bit-thread picture, which corresponds to the initial minimal throat area, is shown to set the upper bound on information transfer. We also discuss two glued HaPPY codes as a toy model for a wormhole.

Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves have the potential to transform gravitational wave astronomy and yield fresh insights into astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed matter physics. We evaluate their detectability by combining various theoretical and observational arguments from the literature and systematically applying those arguments to known astronomical objects and future gravitational wave detectors. We detail and update previous estimates made in support of Cosmic Explorer [M. Evans et al., arXiv:2306.13745; I. Gupta et al., Class. Quantum Grav. 41, 245001 (2024)]. It is commonly argued that the spins of accreting neutron stars are regulated by gravitational wave emission and that millisecond pulsars contain a young pulsar's magnetic field buried under accreted material. If either of these arguments holds, the first detection of continuous gravitational waves is likely with near future upgrades of current detectors, and many detections are likely with next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. A lack of detections in the next several years would begin to raise serious doubts about current theories of millisecond pulsar formation.

Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars are on the new frontiers of gravitational wave astrophysics and have strong connections to electromagnetic astronomy, nuclear astrophysics, and condensed matter physics. In this Colloquium I survey prospects for detection of continuous gravitational waves from various neutron star populations, especially aided by electromagnetic observations. Although there are caveats, current theories and observations suggest that the first detections are likely within a few years, and that many are likely in the era of next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. I also survey what can be learned from these signals, each one of which will contain more cycles than all the compact binary mergers ever detected. Since continuous gravitational wave emission mechanisms depend on aspects of neutron star physics, such as crustal elasticity, which are not well constrained by current astronomical observations and physical experiments, their detection can tell us a great deal that is new about extreme matter. Even more can be learned by combining gravitational wave observations with data from the Square Kilometre Array, the Next Generation Very Large Array, FAST, and other electromagnetic detectors operating in the next generation era.

Abstract: We consider the gravitational Noether-Ward identities for the evolution of general metric perturbations on quantum matter backgrounds. In this work we consider Einstein's gravity covariantly coupled to a massive, non-minimally coupled, quantum scalar field in general curved backgrounds. We find that each term in the equation of motion for gravitational perturbations satisfies its own Noether-Ward identity. Even though each term is non-transverse, the whole equation of motion maintains transversality. In particular, each counterterm needed to renormalize the graviton self-energy satisfies its own Noether identity, and we derive the explicit form for each. Finally, in order to understand how the Noether-Ward identities are affected by the definition of the metric perturbation, we consider two inequivalent definitions of metric perturbations and derive the Noether-Ward identities for both definitions. This implies that there are Noether-Ward identities for every definition of the metric perturbation.

Conclusion: 旋转Teo黑洞缺乏视界，但可见的无视界情况下的振荡模式与Kerr黑洞不同，其模式谱显示出不同的旋权依赖性和声子环特性，提供判别标志。

Abstract: We analyze scalar field perturbations of the rotating Teo wormhole and compute its quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum using WKB methods in a fully horizonless geometry. The Klein Gordon equation separates and yields a Schrödinger type radial equation with a single, smooth potential barrier shaped by the localized frame dragging profile of the wormhole throat. This barrier supports damped oscillatory modes across the full spin range examined. The resulting QNM spectrum exhibits a coherent and monotonic dependence on rotation. As the spin increases, both the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease, indicating progressively longer-lived modes in the absence of horizon induced absorption. In the eikonal limit, we extract the photon-ring radius, orbital frequency, and Lyapunov exponent, and verify the standard QNM-Eikonal correspondence. Comparison with Kerr black holes reveals qualitative differences. Whereas Kerr QNMs are governed by horizon absorption and exhibit symmetric prograde/retrograde mode splitting, the Teo wormhole displays a stronger but spatially confined spin response, partial reflection at the throat, and a distinctive one-sided splitting that saturates rapidly with increasing spin. Although the rotating Teo wormhole admits an ergoregion and superradiant compatible frequency kinematics, the absence of an event horizon or dissipative boundary prevents classical superradiant amplification. These results demonstrate how rotation and boundary conditions jointly shape wave propagation in horizonless compact objects and provide characteristic spectral signatures distinguishing rotating wormholes from Kerr black holes.

Conclusion: Lense-Thirring 模型提供了有效的工具来探索和理解强引力现象，特别是关于声学视界及其动态行为。这为后续研究提供了新的视角和可能性。

Abstract: We introduce the Lense-Thirring Acoustic Black Hole (LTABH), motivated by the relevance of analogue models for black holes embedded in various physical systems, such as the cosmological microwave background or quantum superfluids. We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $ξ$ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $ξ$ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $ξ$ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $Ω$, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $ξ$ itself, becomes important near such regions. On the other hand, we also show that there are regions of the LTABH spacetime in which $% Ω$ vanishes, suggesting that therein possible probe particles would not be affected by the frame dragging at all. Finally, we derive the deflection of the light near the LTABH.

Motivation: Dark matter is a significant unsolved problem in physics, so studying possible dark matter candidates is crucial.

Method: The research involves studying boson dynamics in binary black hole systems, particularly focusing on unequal-mass systems and varying spin orientations.

Result: The mass ratio and spin alignment significantly affect the transfer of bosons, leading to changes in their distribution and interaction efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings could help narrow down potential dark matter candidates and validate theoretical models through future gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: Ultralight bosons are compelling dark-matter candidates. Both scalar and vector bosons can be produced through black hole superradiance, forming a boson cloud surrounding a rotating black hole. Self-interaction of bosons, together with transition mixing in binary black hole systems, give rise to dynamical phenomena that could be potentially observable with future gravitational wave observations. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of bosons in binary black hole systems. In particular, we focus on boson mass transfer in unequal-mass binary black hole systems with arbitrary spin-orientation of the companion. Our results show that the mass ratio between the companion and the primary black holes significantly affects cloud absorption through mass transfer. Moreover, when the companion's spin is not aligned with that of the primary, the efficiency of cloud depletion is further modified.

Abstract: In the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity, for an isolated self-gravitating system consisting of $N$ extended fluid bodies, the inter-body dynamics are studied by applying the symmetric and trace-free formalism in terms of irreducible Cartesian tensors. The multipole expansion of each body's center-of-mass acceleration is derived, and the expansion comprises the Coulomb-type part and the Yukawa-type part, where the former, identical to that in General Relativity, is encoded by the products of the mass multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies, and the latter, as the modification introduced by $f(R)$ gravity, is encoded by the products of the scalar multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies. As an essential component of the system's orbital dynamics, the multipole expansion for the total gravitational potential energy is provided, and the expression for the total conserved energy in terms of the mass and scalar multipole moments of the bodies is offered. To investigate the system's spin dynamics, the equation of motion for each body's spin angular momentum is further deduced and presented in the form of multipole expansion. These findings constitute the main content of the coarse-grained description of inter-body dynamics for the system within the framework of the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity. As a by-product, for a two-body system, the effective one-body equation governing the relative motion between the two bodies and the total energy of this system are achieved.

Abstract: The conjecture by two of the authors (N.E.M. and S.S.) that a \cPT-symmetric phase plays a role in understanding singular renormalisation group (RG) flows for a Chern-Simons (CS) gauge theory of axions, has been reexamined and significantly improved. We have used the more complete Wetterich equation, which includes gravitational couplings in a systematic way from the start, to understand the emergence of this phase. The singular structure of the RG flows has persisted on including gravitational-couplings, thereby offering further support to the conjecture that \cPT -symmetric phases of (repulsive) gravity characterise string-effective CS gravitational theories, where the axion is the massless string-model independent axion, which can also play a role of a totally-antisymmetric torsion degree of freedom. This has suggested a novel interpretation of the currently observed acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in terms of such a phase at large (cosmological) scales.

Motivation: 研究Kerr黑洞的准正则模式及其greybody因子对于理解黑洞的物理性质和引力波的传播具有重要意义。通过建立对应的方程和关系，可以更深入地分析黑洞的量子力学行为和场的散射特性。

Method: 我们将径向Teukolsky方程转化为径向运动方程，类似于Schrödinger方程，并结合短程势来推导WKB连接公式。我们使用WKB方法进行高阶校正，以便在更高精度条件下扩展对应关系的有效性。

Result: 对于引力扰动，我们的预测结果与数值结果高度吻合，随着角量子数增加，精度显著提升。我们的分析表明，对应关系在超辐射区域失效，这限制了其适用范围。

Conclusion: 该研究通过WKB方法在eikonal极限下，成功建立了Kerr黑洞旋翼模式与greybody因子的对应关系。高阶WKB校正进一步提高了结果的精确度。然而，该方法在超辐射区域失效，需寻找替代分析工具来解决这一挑战。

Abstract: We establish a quasinormal-mode/grey-body factor correspondence for Kerr black holes in the eikonal limit. By recasting the radial Teukolsky equation into a Schrödinger-type form with a short-range potential, we derive WKB connection formulas that relate Kerr quasinormal frequencies to grey-body transmission coefficients. Higher-order WKB corrections are included, extending the correspondence beyond the leading eikonal regime. For gravitational perturbations, the predicted grey-body factors agree with numerical results obtained from the generalized Sasaki-Nakamura equation, with increasing accuracy at large angular quantum number. The correspondence breaks down in the superradiant regime, where the WKB assumptions fail.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure and properties of neutron stars in four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state (BSk19, SLy4, AP4), we confirm that neutron star solutions remain in existence. As the modification parameter $α$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $α$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer. Such a frozen neutron star constitutes a universal endpoint of the neutron-star sequence in this theory, independent of the choice of the equation of state. Based on our results and current observational constraints, we derive bounds on the modification parameter $α$ and show that frozen neutron stars remain allowed in the bounds.

Abstract: We consider null geodesics in the background of spherically symmetric object in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory with coupling function $f(Φ)=e^{-2λΦ}$. The spherical solution is characteristically described by dilaton coupling $λ$, integrated dilaton flux $D$ and magnetic charge $P$. Then, we derive geodesic equations by using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. The radial photon orbital equation on equatorial plane and effective potential are analyzed. The total deflection angle and trajectories of photon as a function of impact parameter $b$ are plotted with the variation of $λ,D$ and $P$. Furthermore, the relation between photon ring's width and the Lyapunov exponent is also explored. In addition, we use the Gralla-Lupsasca-Marrone (GLM) model to model intensity profile of optically thin accretion disk around the object. Hence, we construct optical images of the object surrounded by three distinct emission profiles. Lastly, we investigate the radius of innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) for timelike geodesics.

Abstract: We investigate a late-time cosmological model for a homogeneous and isotropic space-time in the Rastall theory. We explore the observational constraints on the Hubble parameter by using the latest cosmological datasets such as cosmic microwave background radiation (Planck), baryon acoustic oscillations (DESI) and Type Ia Supernovae (Union 3.0). As a result, we explicitly demonstrate that the specific redshift transition occurs, namely, there happens a phase shift in the evolution of the universe from the initial deceleration era to the current accelerating phase of the cosmological scenario. Furthermore, we show that with the latest dataset of DESI-BAO clubbed with CC, CMB, and Union 3.0, the current value of the Hubble parameter is estimated as $H_0 = 66.945 \pm 1.094$, which can be compatible with the available observations.

Abstract: Black holes beyond General Relativity may carry non-standard charges that impact their phenomenology. We study how the scalar charge that is induced by the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling is affected by the presence of a nontrivial kinetic term $K(X)$. We discuss the corresponding kinetic screening in the asymptotically flat, static solution first. We then turn to the case where self-accelerating cosmology is driven by $K(X)$, finding that the time-dependence of the scalar field opens up the parameter space, turning the black-hole scalar charge from secondary to primary. We provide a stability analysis and a measure of the intensity of the kinetic screening from the quartic dispersion relation of the mixed scalar and gravitational modes.

Consequently, the gravitational dynamics of the Kerr black hole in its point-particle effective theory is completely constrained in the self-dual sector for a hidden symmetry, implying the spin exponentiation of same-helicity gravitational Compton amplitudes to all multiplicities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的微泡声发射监测方法，适用于光不透明和深组织环境，能够量化微泡振荡，为改进超声诊断和治疗技术提供依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着超声诊断和治疗技术的发展，微泡作为对比剂在其中扮演重要角色，如何对其动态进行精确控制以提高效率和安全性成为关键问题。传统的声发射监测方法在光不透明和深组织环境下的有效性较低，推动了对更精确监测方法的需求。

Method: 提出了一种线性声波传播和叠加（LAWPS）框架，通过傅里叶级数和线性单极子辐射理论，将弱非线性振荡的声发射直接转化为微泡半径随时间的变化，结合最佳激发和接收配置，实现了微泡群体动态的群体级量化重建。

Result: 在振荡幅度不超过15%的情况下，声发射监测方法的相对误差在5%以内。在20%振荡幅度的范围内，该方法生成的机械应力足以作用于10微米大小的泡体（血管数 > 0.01），在生理条件下也适用。

Conclusion: 该研究成果为在光不透明和深组织环境下实现微泡动态的精确监测提供了新的方法论，有助于改进超声诊断和治疗技术的控制能力。

Abstract: A growing class of ultrasound-mediated diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, including sonoporation and blood-brain barrier modulation, relies on microbubble contrast agents, where precise control of microbubble dynamics governs biological responses, efficiency, and safety. However, quantitative monitoring of microbubble oscillations in the stable, weakly nonlinear regime remains challenging, particularly in optically opaque and deep-tissue environments. Here, we introduce a linear acoustic wave propagation and superposition (LAWPS) framework that reconstructs microbubble radius-time dynamics directly from passively recorded acoustic emissions. By coupling Fourier-series representations of weakly nonlinear oscillations with linear monopole radiation theory, LAWPS extends classical monopole models to establish a reversible relationship between multi-frequency acoustic emissions and underlying radial bubble dynamics. Extending this framework to monodisperse microbubble ensembles, we derive optimal excitation and receive configurations and population-level correction factors that enable quantitative reconstruction of the ensemble-averaged microbubble dynamics. Using simultaneous optical and acoustic measurements, we demonstrate recovery of microbubble oscillations with ~5% relative error for oscillation amplitudes up to ~15% of equilibrium radius. Finally, we show that oscillations within the framework's operating regime (20% oscillation) generate sonoporation-relevant mechanical stress in vesicles as small as 10 micrometers (capillary number > 0.01), under physiologically relevant conditions. Together, this work establishes a quantitative framework for acoustic emission-based monitoring of weakly nonlinear microbubble oscillations in clinically relevant, optically inaccessible environments to enable improved control of emerging ultrasound diagnostic and therapeutic technologies.

Motivation: 增样制造为非平凡几何结构的塑料 scintillator 生产提供了高效途径，该研究利用新型光伏 scintillator 公式进行尝试并取得成功。

Method: 使用了 405 nm 治愈光和 coumarin 450 作为三级染料，结合光伏曲able scintillator，通过批量和 3D 打印制作试样并进行比较分析。

Result: 所有试样均能通过脉冲形状区分中子和 gamma 射线。加入三级染料对发射光谱和光输出影响不大，但对打印分辨率有显著影响。通过治理染料，可处理 0.7 mm 级别的独立特征，更精细的 0.1 mm 级别分辨率在完全支撑的结构中可达。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了增样制造在复杂几何结构 scintillator 制备中的有效应用，尤其在高分辨率 3D 打印方面取得重要进展。

Abstract: Additive manufacturing offers efficient production of plastic scintillators with nontrivial geometries using vat polymerization, allowing fabrication of geometries which would be difficult or even impossible to produce using conventional subtractive manufacturing. This work presents a novel photocurable scintillator formula that includes coumarin 450 as a tertiary dye to enable high-resolution 3D printing via the manipulation of the 405 nm cure light. Bulk photocured and 3D printed (with and without tertiary dye) samples were compared through observational assessment and spectral response. All samples showed pulse shape discrimination between neutron and gamma events. Inclusion of the tertiary dye has minimal impact on emission spectrum and light output, but significant impact on print resolution as shown by comparison of printed high-complexity geometries and feature resolution test objects. With the use of a cure-limiting dye, unsupported features, such as freestanding pillars, were resolvable down to 0.7 mm. Even finer resolution at or below 0.1 mm was achieved in fully supported, integrated structures printed with off-the-shelf 405 nm desktop 3D printer. Scintillators demonstrated a light output up to 50% of EJ-200 with a PSD figure of merit up to 1.35 at 0.9-1.1 MeVee.

Conclusion: 该研究为研究量子系统中的局域化和 chaos 转换提供了理论模型和实验工具。

Abstract: The transition to chaos for quantum dynamics is quantified via a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE appear to be an ideal tool to study {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of physical systems under different localisation and disorder strengths.

TL;DR: 研究通过解析结构化的分析方法探讨了修改过的Emden方程的量子化，尽管其经典的等时性和量子化已被讨论，但特别强调了其分枝哈密顿量的量子化行为。在小k值的情况下，通过数值计算发现能量谱并不完全和谐，而是近似等距，表现出准谐波行为。这种偏离均匀间隔的表现得到了解析方法（如扰动理论）的精确验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子力学和经典力学在现代物理中的广泛应用，深入研究微分方程的量子行为变得尤为重要。该论文通过分析修改过的Emden方程的分枝哈密顿量，探讨其量子化行为的差异，丰富了量子系统理论的应用。

Method: 该研究采用解析方法结合数值计算。首先，通过解析的方法，尤其是扰动理论，推导了能量谱的近似表达式；其次，通过数值模拟，验证了这些解析结果的准确性，特别是在小k值的情况下。

Result: 数值计算和解析方法证实了当k值较小时，能量谱的特征从完美等距转变为近似等距，表现为准谐波行为。这种行为的出现是由于分枝哈密顿量引入的量子效应。

Conclusion: 该研究成果表明，修改过的Emden方程的分枝哈密顿量在量子化的行为上呈现出与经典情况不同的特性，特别是在谐波行为上，这种差异在实际应用中需要被考虑和模型化。

Abstract: We revisit the canonical quantization to assess the spectrum of the modified Emden equation $\ddot{x} + kx\dot{x} + ω^2 x + \frac{k^2}{9}x^3 = 0$, which is an isochronous case of the Liénard-Kukles equation. While its classical isochronicity and canonical quantization, leading to polynomial solutions with an exactly-equispaced spectrum have been discussed earlier, including in the recent paper [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 64, 212 (2025)], the present study focuses on the quantization of its branched Hamiltonians. For small $k$, we show numerically that the resulting energy spectrum is no longer perfectly harmonic but only approximately equispaced, exhibiting quasi-harmonic behavior characterized by deviations from uniform spacing. Our numerical results are precisely validated by analytical calculations based on perturbation theory.

TL;DR: 研究者展示了如何从连续时间序列数据中验证量子非局域性，不需要强、破坏性的测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量是量子力学的核心工具，广泛用于实验和理论研究。然而，许多固态量子平台提供的是连续的电压或场迹，而不是离散的、破坏性的测量。如何在这些平台上验证量子非局域性是一个开放的问题。

Method: 研究者开发了一种通用的理论框架，通过连续而非离散的测量提取贝尔-CHSH不等式违反量。他们通过相位敏感投影和粗化操作，将连续测量转化为二元观测变量。实验参数包括单个纠缠对的测量时间以及qubit之间的非局部相位锁定。

Result: 研究者通过与Qiskit模拟的量子电路测试，与传统离散测量的CHSH测试进行了对比，发现当存在量子相位锁定时，其估计值与CHSH界 drifted 的程度与经典确定性无关，并且显示了量子相位锁定系统的非线性角度依赖性，这与量子纠缠的特性一致。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了在无需强测量的固态量子平台中验证量子非局域性的实用方法，这对于实现量子通信和量子计算等应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Many solid-state quantum platforms do not permit sharp, projective measurements but instead yield continuous voltage or field traces under weak, non-demolition readout. In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement. Our results provide a practical route to demonstrating Bell nonlocality in platforms where measurements are inherently continuous and weak.

Method: 该研究借助QPCS框架，利用该系统在Kaluza-Klein理论下的性质，施加以pperturbative势，并通过数学分析和理论计算，探讨了法拉第场对粒子能级的影响。

Result: 研究发现，当粒子陷阱满足特定条件（如半径与长度比为π分之一）时，施加法拉第场会导致能级分裂，这可被视为额外维度得以被探有的迹象。该势在第一阶修正中表现出对n_z和nθ的依赖，这表明该方法可用于探低能量态的额外维度效应。

Conclusion: 该研究为探索额外维度提供了一种新思路，其基于准维粒子泡的学者试验可能是有价值的，暗示未来在更易实现条件下可能探测到额外维度。

Abstract: This study explores the influence of a Stark-like perturbative potential on a quantum particle confined to a cylindrical surface (QPCS) and its implications for extra-dimensional theories. The QPCS framework is particularly relevant to Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory, which postulates extra spatial dimensions to unify electromagnetism and gravity. In KK theory, these extra dimensions are typically hidden and require high-energy conditions for detection. Motivated by the challenge of uncovering these dimensions more feasibly, this research applies a perturbative potential of the form \hat{H}_{\text{SL}} = βzV_{o_{z}}(θ) to a QPCS characterized by length \textit{L} and radius R_{o}. This potential is inspired by the Stark effect in hydrogen atoms, where energy level splitting serves as an indicator of an external influence. The study demonstrates that, for a degenerate configuration (R_{o} = \frac{L}π), the Stark-like perturbation effectively induces energy level splitting, which can be interpreted as a means of revealing hidden dimensions. The first-order energy correction in this scenario depends explicitly on the quantum numbers n_{z} and n_θ, highlighting the potential for this approach to probe extra-dimensional effects in lower-energy quantum systems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Wavefunction collapse is often regarded as an unavoidable consequence of quantum measurement. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can extract information without disturbing the physical steady-state ensemble. Using the stochastic master equation formalism, we identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite the presence of measurement-induced collapse at the level of individual quantum trajectories. This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths. Our results clarify how information gain and measurement backaction can be dynamically decoupled in open quantum systems, with implications for continuous quantum sensing and the foundations of nonprojective measurement.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand and control decoherence, which is a major challenge in developing scalable quantum technologies.

Method: The framework uses a variance-covariance matrix to model the structure of QPS, distinguishing between Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics based on environmental memory and information backflow.

Result: The framework provides explicit relations between environmental parameters and phase-space structure, demonstrating its potential for practical applications in quantum engineering.

Conclusion: The QPS framework bridges theory and practice, offering a pathway to exploit non-Markovian effects in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Quantum decoherence, the process by which a quantum system loses its coherence through interaction with an environment and becomes classical-like, represents both the fundamental mechanism for the quantum-to-classical transition and a major challenge to realizing scalable nanoscale quantum technologies. This work introduces a novel theoretical framework based on Quantum Phase Space (QPS) to address the dual challenge of characterizing environment-selected pointer states and modeling decoherence dynamics across different regimes. Within this framework, pointer states for particle motion are identified as the minimum-uncertainty states, those that saturate the quantum uncertainty relation, thereby constituting the closest quantum analogue to classical phase-space points. The structure of the QPS, encoded in a variance-covariance matrix, is shown to be directly shaped by environmental properties. A time-independent matrix corresponds to Markovian (memoryless) decoherence, described by constant diffusion and friction coefficients, while a time-dependent matrix captures non-Markovian dynamics, characterized by environmental memory and information backflow. This unified geometric formalism, applied to both Lindblad and Non-Markovian master equations, enables us to derive explicit relations between environmental parameters and phase-space structure, as demonstrated in a specific illustrative example. This approach has the potential to serve as a powerful tool for modeling decoherence in nanoscience and could inform new principles for designing mitigation strategies and harnessing non-Markovian effects for quantum technologies. The QPS framework may thus bridge fundamental theory and practical quantum engineering, offering a promising coherent pathway to understand, control, and exploit decoherence at the nanoscience frontier.

Abstract: We demonstrate a method for determining the three-dimensional location of single atoms in a quantum gas microscopy system using a phase-only spatial light modulator to modify the point-spread function of the high-resolution imaging system. Here, the typical diffracted spot generated by a single atom as a point source is modified to a double spot that rotates as a function of the atom's distance from the focal plane of the imaging system. We present and numerically validate a simple model linking the rotation angle of the point-spread function with the distance to the focal plane. We show that, when aberrations in the system are carefully calibrated and compensated for, this method can be used to determine an atom's position to within a single lattice site in a single experimental image, extending quantum simulation with microscopy systems further into the regime of three dimensions.

Abstract: A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.

Abstract: We present a time-symmetric variational formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in which Schrödinger dynamics and a Bohm-type guidance law arise as emergent Euler-Lagrange optimality conditions rather than postulates. The formulation is expressed in terms of probability density and current fields subject to a continuity constraint and two-time boundary conditions. A Fisher-information regularization term generates the quantum potential, yielding the Schrödinger equation when the optimality system is expressed in complex form. Unlike standard Bohmian mechanics, which requires an auxiliary Quantum Equilibrium Hypothesis ($P = |ψ|^2$), our primal-dual formulation satisfies the Born rule by construction. The trajectories emerge not from an external guidance wave, but as the unique hydrodynamic flow minimizing the Fisher-regularized action between two-time boundary constraints. Deterministic trajectories thus emerge only as effective, coarse-grained descriptions, with randomness entering objectively at the interface of boundary constraints.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the question of whether systems with different coupling configurations can approximate each other's transmission spectra, which has implications for the design and approximation of quantum scattering systems.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis to establish exact isospectrality, and numerical experiments to identify the minimal constraint set for practical use.

Result: The key results are that exact isospectrality is impossible for physically non-trivial configurations, but numerical experiments identify the minimal constraint set for practical use, meaning that while perfect matching is not possible, certain configurations can achieve good approximations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while perfect isospectrality is not achievable, practical limitations and achievable accuracy exist for systems with opposite-sign couplings, providing insights into the design and approximation of quantum scattering systems under coupling sign constraints

Abstract: We investigate whether a 3-$δ$ system with positive coupling strengths can approximate the transmission spectrum of a 2-$δ$ resonance system with opposite-sign couplings for $k <3$.

Motivation: 随着量子技术的快速发展，光子源在量子通信、量子计算等方面发挥着重要作用，而现有光子平台受限于调制有限和低光子数，缺乏可控性。超高频强场光-物相互作用通过高阶谐波产生，具有敏锐的频率选择性，但其量子光学特性尚不明确。近年来，实验揭示了强场驱动场与谐波光中的纠缠、压缩以及量子态修改效果，但缺乏统一的量子理论解释来阐明这些现象的起因及控制方法。因此，开发一个量子力学解析模型，系统地研究强场光-物相互作用中的非经典性起源及调控条件，具有重要的理论意义和应用前景。

Method: 该研究采用了量子力学分析方法，通过时间依赖的薛定谔方程，对强场光-物相互作用进行了完整的量子分析，提出了参数化因子分解的方法，将电子-场相互作用系统分解为受驱激发态和动态扰动的量子光场，无需条件检测、同相检测或模式选择等技术。

Result: 理论表明，强场光-物相互作用中所述非经典性效应（如量子相关性、压缩效应及维格纳函数的负性）是动态干涉效应的自然结果，可以先验地建立调制条件下的非经典性强度与光强参量的关系，并预测不同外场偏振方向和光强下的非经典性特征。理论结果使我们能够精确调控强场光-物相互作用中的所需的非经典性因素，为实现可调控的高强度单色光源奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing.

*Shalender Singh,Santosh Kumar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子纠缠在ambient温度和宏观距离下通常被认为是脆弱的，但通过研究集体量子模式的动态，发现传统的观点不成立。通过精确的边界分析和模拟实验，证明了在对称振荡受限的情况下，需要一个最小的集体振荡幅度来维持量子纠缠。此外，大量集体激发减少了量子相扩散，因此量子纠缠状态保持了相对称性，即使信号幅度很大。经典噪声叠加的模拟实验进一步支持了该结论。

Motivation: 量子纠缠在距离和温度下的表现一直是量子信息科学中的一个关键问题。传统的的观点认为量子纠缠容易受到环境噪声的影响，而本研究通过引入集体量子模式的概念，为量子纠缠的稳定性提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is commonly assumed to be fragile at ambient temperature and over macroscopic distances, where thermal noise and dissipation are expected to rapidly suppress nonclassical correlations. Here we show that this intuition fails for collective quantum modes whose dynamics is governed by reduced open-system channels rather than by microscopic thermal equilibrium. For two spatially separated collective modes, we derive an exact entanglement boundary based on the positivity of the partial transpose, valid in the symmetric resonant limit. From this result we obtain an explicit minimum collective fluctuation amplitude, expressed entirely in measurable noise, bandwidth, dissipation, and distance-dependent coupling parameters, required to sustain steady-state entanglement at finite temperature. We further show that large collective occupation suppresses but does not eliminate quantum phase diffusion, so the steady state remains phase symmetric and does not collapse to a classical mean-field despite macroscopic signal amplitudes. Stochastic simulations of the reduced open-system dynamics, together with matched classical correlated-noise null models analyzed through an identical pipeline, confirm that entanglement witnesses are violated only in the quantum regime. Our results establish a minimal, platform-independent framework connecting collective-mode dynamics, noise injection, distance, and operational certification of macroscopic entanglement.

Abstract: The transverse-field Ising model is useful for studying interacting qubit arrays. The Lieb--Robinson correlation function can be used to characterize the propagation of quantum information in Ising chains. Considerable work has been done to establish bounds on this correlation function in various circumstances. To actually calculate the value of the correlation function directly typically requires a state space which grows exponentially with system size, and so is intractable for all but relatively small systems. We employ a recently-developed method that enables direct calculation of the value of the Lieb--Robinson correlation function and which scales linearly with system size. This enables the computation for systems with many hundreds of qubits, revealing the propagation of quantum information down the chain. We extend this technique to the problem of Ising chains with randomly disordered coupling strengths. Increasing disorder causes localization of the quantum correlations and halts propagation of quantum information.

Abstract: Two-stage stochastic programming often discretizes uncertainty into scenarios, but scenario enumeration makes expected recourse evaluation scale at least linearly in the scenario count. We propose qGAN-QAOA, a unified quantum-circuit workflow in which a pre-trained quantum generative adversarial network encodes the scenario distribution and QAOA optimizes first-stage decisions by minimizing the full two-stage objective, including expected recourse cost. With the qGAN parameters fixed after training, we evaluate the objective as the expectation value of a problem Hamiltonian and optimize only the QAOA variational parameters. We interpret non-anticipativity as a condition on measurement outcome statistics and prove that the first-stage measurement marginal is independent of the scenario. For uniformly discretized uncertainty, the diagonal operator encoding the uncertainty admits a sparse Pauli-Z expansion via the Walsh--Hadamard transform, yielding polylogarithmic scaling of gate count and circuit depth with the number of scenarios. Numerical experiments on the stochastic unit commitment problem (UCP) with photovoltaic (PV) uncertainty compare the expected cost of the proposed method with classical expected-value and two-stage stochastic programming baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of qGAN-QAOA as a two-stage decision model.

Abstract: The nanoscale charge environment critically influences semiconductor physics and device performance. While conventional bulk characterization techniques provide volume-averaged defect properties, they lack the spatial resolution to resolve nanoscale charge heterogeneity and identify microscopic noise sources. Here, we utilize single PL5 centers in 4H-SiC as room-temperature broadband quantum sensors to fill in the gap. We report the first real-time, nanoscale observation of singlecharge tunneling dynamics in a commercial semiconductor at room temperature, by monitoring the random telegraph noise using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). This capability enables an electrical noise imaging technique, showing distinct noise variations across different wafer substrates. By employing dynamical decoupling, we extend noise spectroscopy from near-DC to MHz frequencies, uncovering significant noise spectral density correlations across frequency bands. Finally, we probe MHz-GHz noise and identify its origin via T1 relaxation spectroscopy, obtaining the first nanoscale electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic fingerprint of charge defects in SiC. These techniques open avenues for characterizing noise environments in semiconductor devices, providing critical insights for optimizing SiC fabrication processes, defect control, and advancing quantum technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how noise can enhance quantum systems through protection mechanisms, particularly in entanglement, is crucial for advancements in quantum computing and communication.

Method: Analytical derivation of dynamical equations, numerical simulations using various noise types like Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, flicker noise, and telegraph noise.

Result: Entanglement protection depends critically on the proportion of high-frequency components in the power spectral density of mixed noise. Enhanced HF components are essential for effective noise-assisted entanglement protection.

Conclusion: This shows that noise-assisted quantum protection is feasible and can be engineered by optimizing high-frequency components in mixed noise sources.

Abstract: Contrary to the conventional view that noise is detrimental, we show that mixed noise can protect entanglement in a two-atom-cavity system. Specifically, the leakage of the cavity and the stochastic atom-cavity couplings are modeled as two types of noises. From the analytical derivation of the dynamical equations, the mechanism of the entanglement protection is revealed as the high-frequency(HF) noise in the atom-cavity couplings could suppress the decoherence caused by the cavity leakage, thus protect the entanglement. We investigate the entanglement protection induced by mixed noise constructed from diverse noise types, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, flicker noise, and telegraph noise. Numerical simulations demonstrate that entanglement protection depends critically on the proportion of HF components in the power spectral density of the mixed noise. Our work establishes that enhanced HF components are essential for effective noise-assisted entanglement protection, offering key insights for noise engineering in practical open quantum systems.

Abstract: The quantum internet is a rapidly developing technological reality, yet, it remains unclear what kind of quantum network structures might emerge. Since indirect quantum communication is already feasible and preserves absolute security of the communication channel, a new node joining the quantum network does not need to connect directly to its desired target. Instead, in our proposed quantum preferential attachment model, it uniformly randomly connects to any node within the proximity of the target, including, but not restricted to, the target itself. This local flexibility is found to qualitatively change the global network behavior, leading to two distinct classes of complex network architectures, both of which are small-world, but neither of which is scale-free. Our numerical findings are supported by rigorous analytic results, in a framework that incorporates quantum and classical variants of preferential attachment in a unified phase diagram. Besides quantum networks, we expect that our results will have broad implications for classical scenarios where there is flexibility in establishing new connections.

*Ben Wang,Minghao Mi,Huangqiuchen Wang,Qian Xie,Lijian Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines how simultaneous estimation of phase and phase-diffusion can outperform parameters estimated separately in quantum metrology with respect to phase diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It shows that estimating phase and noise together can give better measurement precision than estimating them separately, which is motivated by the challenge of efficiently measuring both phase and phase-diffusion in quantum systems despite noise.

Method: The researchers conduct a deterministic Bell measurement on a two-qubit system. They employ a linear optical network to encode both the phase parameter and the phase-diffusion noise. They perform both parameter encoding and measurements in a way that is collective, meaning it involves multiple identical copies of the quantum system.

Result: Their results show that their collective and deterministic approach leads to improved precision in the joint estimation of phase and phase-diffusion compared to separable measurements, which are measurements that act on individual copies independently.

Conclusion: Collective measurements can help surpass the limitations of single-copy measurements in multi-parameter quantum metrology and lead to better estimation precision when both phase and phase-diffusion are considered together

Abstract: Accurate phase estimation plays a pivotal role in quantum metrology, yet its precision is significantly affected by noise, particularly phase-diffusive noise caused by phase drift. To address this challenge, the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion has emerged as an effective approach, transforming the problem into a multi-parameter estimation task. However, the incompatibility between optimal measurements for different parameters prevents single-copy measurements from reaching the fundamental precision limits defined by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Meanwhile, collective measurements performed on multiple identical copies can mitigate this incompatibility and thus enhance the precision of joint parameter estimation. This work experimentally demonstrates joint phase and phase-diffusion estimation using deterministic Bell measurements on a two-qubit system. A linear optical network is employed to implement both parameter encoding and deterministic Bell measurements, achieving improved estimation precision compared to any separable measurement strategy. This work proposes a new framework for phase estimation under phase-diffusive noise and underscores the substantial advantages of collective measurements in multi-parameter quantum metrology.

Abstract: Quantum computing holds potential for accelerating the simulation of fluid dynamics. However, hardware noise in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era significantly distorts simulation accuracy. Although error magnitudes are frequently quantified, the specific physical effects of quantum noise on flow simulation results remain largely uncharacterized. We investigate the influence of gate noise on the quantum simulation of one-dimensional scalar convection. By employing a quantum spectral algorithm where ideal time advancement affects only Fourier phases, we isolate and analyze noise-induced artifacts in spectral magnitudes. We derive a theoretical transition matrix based on Hamming distances between computational basis states to predict spectral decay, and then validate this model against density-matrix simulations and experiments on a superconducting quantum processor. Furthermore, using data-driven sparse regression, we demonstrate that quantum noise manifests in the effective partial differential equation primarily as artificial diffusion and nonlinear source terms. These findings suggest that quantum errors can be modeled as deterministic physical terms rather than purely stochastic perturbations.

Abstract: We use the Gaussian approximation describing photocount statistics for both the homodyne and the double homodyne (heterodyne) measurements to study asymmetry effects arising from imbalance of the beam splitters and variations in quantum efficiencies of the photodetectors. After computing the $Q$ symbols of the positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) of noisy measurements that take into account the asymmetry effects, the operator representations for the POVMs are obtained in the form that assumes applying the additive noise quantum channel to the POVMs of noiseless (ideal) measurements. For double homodyne detection, it was found that the noiseless measurements should generally be expressed in terms of the projectors onto squeezed-states and the corresponding squeezed-state operator representation of POVM along with the measurement noise channel depend on the squeezing parameter that lies in the interval dictated by the condition for the excess noise covariance matrix to be positive semi-definite. The analytical results are used to perform analysis of the asymptotic security of the Gaussian-modulated continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol in the untrusted-noise scenario where the measurement noise is assumed to be accessible to an adversary. The inherent non-uniqueness of the operator representation for the double-homodyne POVM manifests itself in the squeezing dependent Holevo information that needs to be additionally optimized. For both types of the measurements, the mutual information, the Holevo information and the asymptotic secret fraction are sensitive to asymmetry effects leading to degraded performance of the protocol.

TL;DR: The paper presents 1d-qt-ideal-solver, an open-source Python library for simulating one-dimensional quantum tunneling dynamics under idealized conditions. The solver uses the split-operator method with second-order Trotter-Suzuki factorization, FFT-based spectral differentiation, and complex absorbing potentials to eliminate boundary reflections. Numba JIT compilation improves performance. The library validates through two test cases: rectangular barriers for field emission modeling and Gaussian barriers for scanning tunneling microscopy interactions.

Result: The implementation achieves machine-precision energy conservation, exceptional numerical fidelity, and shows that rectangular barriers have moderately higher transmission coefficients than Gaussian barriers in the over-barrier regime.

Conclusion: The library successfully demonstrates an efficient and accurate tool for simulating one-dimensional quantum tunneling under idealized conditions, suitable for pedagogical use while highlighting limitations due to idealized assumptions.

Abstract: We present 1d-qt-ideal-solver, an open-source Python library for simulating one-dimensional quantum tunneling dynamics under idealized coherent conditions. The solver implements the split-operator method with second-order Trotter-Suzuki factorization, utilizing FFT-based spectral differentiation for the kinetic operator and complex absorbing potentials to eliminate boundary reflections. Numba just-in-time compilation achieves performance comparable to compiled languages while maintaining code accessibility. We validate the implementation through two canonical test cases: rectangular barriers modeling field emission through oxide layers and Gaussian barriers approximating scanning tunneling microscopy interactions. Both simulations achieve exceptional numerical fidelity with machine-precision energy conservation over femtosecond-scale propagation. Comparative analysis employing information-theoretic measures and nonparametric hypothesis tests reveals that rectangular barriers exhibit moderately higher transmission coefficients than Gaussian barriers in the over-barrier regime, though Jensen-Shannon divergence analysis indicates modest practical differences between geometries. Phase space analysis confirms complete decoherence when averaged over spatial-temporal domains. The library name reflects its scope: idealized signifies deliberate exclusion of dissipation, environmental coupling, and many-body interactions, limiting applicability to qualitative insights and pedagogical purposes rather than quantitative experimental predictions. Distributed under the MIT License, the library provides a deployable tool for teaching quantum mechanics and preliminary exploration of tunneling dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate coherent control of nonadiabatic dynamics at a conical intersection (CI) using engineered ultrafast laser pulses. Within a model vibronic system, we tailor pulse chirp and temporal profile and compute the resulting wave-packet population and coherence dynamics using projections along the reaction coordinate. This approach allows us to resolve the detailed evolution of wave-packets as they traverse the degeneracy region with strong nonadiabatic coupling. By systematically varying pulse parameters, we demonstrate that both chirp and pulse duration modulate vibrational coherence and alter branching between competing pathways, leading to controlled changes in quantum yield. Our results elucidate the dynamical mechanisms underlying pulse-shaped control near conical intersections and establish a general framework for manipulating ultrafast nonadiabatic processes.

Abstract: Trotter errors in digitized quantum dynamics arise from approximating time-ordered evolution under noncommuting Hamiltonian terms with a product formula. In the adiabatic regime, such errors are known to exhibit long-time self-healing [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{131}, 060602 (2023)], where discretization effects are effectively suppressed. Here we show that self-healing persists at finite evolution times once nonadiabatic errors induced by finite-speed ramps are compensated. Using counterdiabatic driving to cancel diabatic transitions and isolate discretization effects, we study both noninteracting and interacting spin models and characterize the finite-time scaling with the Trotter steps and the total evolution time. In the instantaneous eigenbasis of the driven Hamiltonian, the leading digital error maps to an effective harmonic perturbation whose dominant Fourier component yields an analytic upper bound on the finite-time Trotter error and reveals the phase-cancellation mechanism underlying self-healing. Our results establish finite-time self-healing as a generic feature of digitized counterdiabatic protocols, clarify its mechanism beyond the long-time adiabatic limit, and provide practical guidance for high-fidelity state preparation on gate-based quantum processors.

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in coherent Ising machines (CIMs) are studied via a spectral mapping between the one-dimensional XY spin model and a network of degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs). This exact correspondence reveals that the DOPO network faithfully reproduces the quantum critical behavior of the XY model across its anisotropic, isotropic, and transverse-field Ising regimes. The ground-state energy density and its derivatives are analyzed to reveal second-order QPTs characterized by singularities in magnetic susceptibility at critical points. These results show that CIMs do not only serve as powerful platforms for solving combinatorial optimization problems but also provide a versatile optical simulator for studying universal quantum critical phenomena, bridging quantum-spin models and photonic quantum systems.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates methods to measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) on a quantum computer, highlighting their validity and advantages for studying quantum chaos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum information scrambling is crucial for quantum computing and many-body physics.

Method: Three protocols (RTM, WMM, ISM) are used, with ISM being particularly highlighted for its first experimental demonstration.

Result: All methods are validated, each showing strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: These methods provide a practical framework for future quantum chaos studies, though further optimization is needed for precise measurements like in ISM.

Abstract: The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a powerful tool for probing quantum information scrambling, a fundamental process by which local information spreads irreversibly throughout a quantum many-body system. Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations.

Abstract: Discretizing Helmholtz problems via finite elements yields linear systems whose efficient solution remains a major challenge for classical computation. In this paper, we investigate how variational quantum algorithms could address this challenge. We first show that, for regular meshes, a block encoding of the operators $A$ and $A^\dagger A$ arising from the high-order finite element discretisation of Helmholtz problems can be designed, resulting in a quantum circuit of depth $\mathcal{O}(p^3\mathrm{poly}\log(Np))$ with $N$ the number of elements and $p$ the order of the finite elements. Then we apply our algorithm to a one-dimensional Helmholtz problem with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for various wavenumbers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the potential of cavity-free systems for improving atomic clocks and quantum sensing by understanding their microwave control mechanisms.

Method: The research combines experimental (microwave field interaction, coherent population trapping) and theoretical (density-matrix model) approaches.

Result: The system shows sensitivity to microwave parameters, with measurable effects on resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. The density-matrix model explains these effects by incorporating microwave coupling strength.

Conclusion: This Δ-system offers a promising framework for controlling cavity-free systems, applicable to compact atomic clocks and sensing technologies.

Abstract: We investigated experimentally and theoretically a cavity-free microwave field that couples the two ground states of a Λ-type atomic system, thereby forming a closed Δ configuration. In this regime, the absence of cavity-imposed phase matching leads to a strong sensitivity of the ground-state coherence to the microwave field parameters. We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching Δ system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free Δ-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researcher aims to enhance precision in NV centers-based sensing by addressing limitations in current methods.

Method: The researcher introduces a minimal fitting technique to improve parameter estimation, particularly when spin polarization is imperfect.

Result: The new model offers more accurate fits and streamlines data analysis, especially for single-spin dynamics.

Conclusion: The method provides a more robust solution for estimating parameters in NV-based sensing despite the inherent challenges in spin state control.

Abstract: Spin relaxometry based on quantum spin systems has developed as a valuable tool in medical and condensed matter systems, offering the advantage of operating without the need for external DC or RF fields. Spin relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has been applied to paramagnetic sensing using both single crystal diamond and nanodiamond materials. However, these methods often suffer from artifacts and systematic uncertainties, particularly due to imperfect spin state preparation, leading to artificially fast T$_1$ relaxation times. Current analysis techniques fail to adequately account for these issues, limiting the precision of parameter estimation. In this work, we introduce a minimal fitting procedure that enables more robust parameter estimation in the presence of imperfect spin polarization. Our model improves upon existing approaches by offering more accurate fits and provides a framework for efficiently parallelizing single-spin dynamics studies.

Abstract: We present an analytical model showing how the gauge-invariant loop phase in a three-level closed-loop atomic system imprints as bright-dark lobes in Laguerre Gaussian probe beam intensity patterns. In the weak probe limit, the output intensity in such systems include Beer-Lambert absorption, a scattering term and loop phase dependent interference term with optical depth controlling visibility. These systems enable mapping of arbitrary phases via interference rotation and offer a platform to measure Berry phase. Berry phase emerge as a geometric holonomy acquired by the dark states during adiabatic traversal of LG phase defined in a toroidal parameter space. Manifesting as fringe shifts which are absent in open systems, experimental realization using cold atoms or solid state platforms appears feasible, positioning structured light in closed-loop systems as ideal testbeds for geometric phases in quantum optics.

Abstract: We analyze a new Rydberg gate design based on the original $π-2π-π$ protocol [Jaksch, et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 2208 (2000)] that is modified to enable high fidelity operation without requiring a strong Rydberg interaction. The gate retains the $π-2π-π$ structure with an additional detuning added to the $2π$ pulse on the target qubit. The protocol reaches within a factor of 2.39 (1.68) of the fundamental fidelity limit set by Rydberg lifetime for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies on the control and target qubits. We generalize the gate protocol to arbitrary controlled phases. We design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms to generalize the gate across a range of interaction strengths and we find that, within this family of gates, the constant-phase protocol is time-optimal for a fixed laser Rabi frequency and tunable interaction strength. Robust control methods are used to design gates that are robust against variations in Rydberg Rabi frequency or interaction strength.

Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems offer novel methods for probing the dynamics of the Standard Model and its constituent gauge theories. Extracting low-energy predictions from such simulations rely on formulating systematically-improvable representations of lattice gauge theory Hamiltonians that are efficient at all values of the gauge coupling. One such candidate representation for SU(2) is the fully gauge-fixed Hamiltonian defined in the mixed basis. This work focuses on the quantum simulation of the smallest non-trivial system: two plaquettes with open boundary conditions. A mapping of the continuous gauge field degrees of freedom to qubit-based representations is developed. It is found that as few as three qubits per plaquette is sufficient to reach per-mille level precision on predictions for observables. Two distinct algorithms for implementing time evolution in the mixed basis are developed and analyzed in terms of quantum resource estimates. One algorithm has favorable scaling in circuit depth for large numbers of qubits, while the other is more practical when qubit count is limited. The latter algorithm is used in the measurement of a real-time observable on IBM's Heron superconducting quantum processor, ibm_fez. The quantum results match classical predictions at the percent-level. This work lays out a path forward for two- and three-dimensional simulations of larger systems, as well as demonstrating the viability of mixed-basis formulations for studying the properties of SU(2) gauge theories at all values of the gauge coupling.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates two parameter initialization strategies for QAOA, finding that a restricted parameter subspace (NV-QWOA) with 3 hyperparameters performs significantly better than the standard approach, achieving 98.9% approximation ratio in 60 iterations, while the Lie-algebraic pretraining framework improves performance but at the cost of more iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the performance of QAOA for combinatorial optimization on NISQ devices is a critical area of research, and this paper provides valuable insights into parameter initialization strategies.

Method: The paper compares two strategies: Lie algebraic pretraining and NV-QWOA, evaluating both on the unweighted Maxcut problem using QAOA with a circuit depth of 256 across various graph structures.

Result: NV-QWOA outperforms the standard QWOA by achieving a 98.9% approximation ratio in 60 iterations, while the Lie-algebraic pretraining framework improves performance after 500 iterations but with a much larger parameter space.

Conclusion: The results suggest that restricting the parameter space can lead to more effective optimization, but further research is needed to confirm scalability and generalization to other problem classes.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading candidate for achieving quantum advantage in combinatorial optimization on Near-Term Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, random initialization of the variational parameters typically leads to vanishing gradients, rendering standard variational optimization ineffective. This paper provides a comparative performance analysis of two distinct strategies designed to improve trainability: Lie algebraic pretraining framework that uses Lie-algebraic classical simulation to find near-optimal initializations, and non-variational QWOA (NV-QWOA) that targets a restrict parameter subspace covered by 3 hyperparameters. We benchmark both methods on the unweighted Maxcut problem using a circuit depth of $p = 256$ across 200 Erdős-Rényi and 200 3-regular graphs, each with 16 vertices. Both approaches significantly improve upon the standard randomly initialized QWOA. NV-QWOA attains a mean approximation ratio of 98.9\% in just 60 iterations, while the Lie-algebraic pretrained QWOA improves to 77.71\% after 500 iterations. That optimization proceeds more quickly for NV-QWOA is not surprising given its significantly smaller parameter space, however, that an algorithm with so few tunable parameters reliably finds near-optimal solutions is remarkable. These findings suggest that the structured parameterization of NV-QWOA offers a more robust training approach than pretraining on lower-dimensional auxiliary problems. Future work is needed to confirm scaling to larger problem sizes and to asses generalization to other problem classes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A framework reconstructs the density matrix of a single-photon hyperentangled state using a single intensity measurement, aligning with standard camera capabilities. This method simplifies experimental setups and reduces acquisition time compared to quantum state tomography, enabling detection of additional DOFs like polarization without projection measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing efficient measurement techniques for high-dimensional quantum states to reduce experimental complexity, acquisition time, and resource requirements.

Method: Uses the spatial degree of freedom (DOF) of a photon to encode information from other DOFs, then spatially mixes and encodes this information for reconstruction with a single intensity measurement.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate the method's effectiveness for single-photon entangled states like OAM-spin and OAM-frequency, achieved through ideal couplers and multimode fiber, confirming simplified setups and reduced acquisition times.

Conclusion: Proposed method offers a novel approach for quantum state reconstruction, enhancing practicality and efficiency in measuring complex quantum states, particularly useful for photons with multiple DOFs.

Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies utilize various degrees of freedom (DOFs) of light, such as polarization, frequency, and spatial modes, to encode quantum information. In the effort of further improving channel capacity and increasing the complexity of available quantum operations, high-dimensional and hyperentangled states are now gaining interest. Efficiently measuring these high dimensional states is challenging due to the large number of measurements required for reconstructing the full density matrix via quantum state tomography (QST), and the fact that each measurement requires some modification in the experimental setup. Here, we propose a framework for reconstructing the density matrix of a single-photon hyperentangled across multiple DOFs using a single intensity-measurement obtainable from traditional cameras, and discuss extensions for multiphoton hyperentangled states. Our method hinges on the spatial DOF of the photon and uses it to encode information from other DOFs. We numerically demonstrate this method for single-photon OAM-spin and OAM-frequency entangled states using an ideal coupler and a multimode fiber, to perform the spatial information mixing and encoding. This technique simplifies the experimental setup and reduces acquisition time compared to traditional QST based methods. Moreover, it allows recovery of DOFs that conventional cameras cannot detect, such as polarization, thus eliminating the need for projection measurements.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: After two decades of research on indefinite causality, a philosophical lesson emerges: the tension between operational quantum theory and dynamical spacetime physics is unbridgeable if one believes both types of theories to be fundamental. We interpret this tension through operational eternalism, a stance analogous to the block-universe view but applied to information rather than geometry. Inputs and outputs are primary givens, while agents are secondary constructs arising from specific groupings of data. Agency is perspectival: from Alice's perspective Bob may not qualify as an observer, and vice versa. These results redefine the observer in the operational approach as a tool to avoid non-causality. They also provide a criterion for Wigner's friends as a class of causally compatible agents.

Abstract: Fracton codes have been intensively studied as novel topological states of matter, yet their fault-tolerant properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the optimal thresholds of self-dual fracton codes, in particular the checkerboard code, against stochastic Pauli noise. By utilizing a statistical-mechanical mapping combined with large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the optimal code capacity of the checkerboard code to be $p_{th} \simeq 0.108(2)$. This value is the highest among known three-dimensional codes and nearly saturates the theoretical limit for topological codes. Our results further validate the generalized entropy relation for two mutually dual models, $H(p_{th}) + H(\tilde{p}_{th}) \approx 1$, and extend its applicability beyond standard topological codes. This verification indicates the Haah's code also possesses a code capacity near the theoretical limit $p_{th} \approx 0.11$. These findings highlight fracton codes as highly resilient quantum memory and demonstrate the utility of duality techniques in analyzing intricate quantum error-correcting codes.

Abstract: Regular graphs find broad applications ranging from quantum communication to quantum computation. Motivated by this, we investigate the design of a quantum battery based on a K-regular graph, where K denotes the number of edges incident on each vertex. We prove that a 0-regular graph battery exhibits extractable work that scales linearly with the system-size when charged using a K-regular graph. This linear scaling is shown to persist even when the charging is implemented via a collective K-regular charger with power-law decaying interactions. While no superlinear scaling is observed, the work output is found to improve systematically with increasing regularity K. Furthermore, by introducing the notion of the fraction of extractable work when only subsystems are accessible, we identify this fraction to be independent of system-size if the battery is prepared in the down-polarized product state. This independence breaks down when the battery is oriented along the x- and y-directions of the Bloch sphere.

Abstract: Quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories requires careful handling of gauge redundancy. We address this challenge by presenting universal principles for treating gauge symmetry that apply to any quantum simulation approach, clarifying that physical states need not be represented solely by gauge singlets. Both singlet and non-singlet representations are valid, with distinct practical trade-offs, which we elucidate using analogies to BRST quantization. We demonstrate these principles within a complete quantum simulation framework based on the orbifold lattice, which enables explicit and efficient circuit constructions relevant to real-world QCD. For singlet-based approaches, we introduce a Haar-averaging projection implemented via linear combinations of unitaries, and analyze its cost and truncation errors. Beyond the singlet-approach, we show how non-singlet approaches can yield gauge-invariant observables through wave packets and string excitations. This non-singlet approach is proven to be both universal and efficient. Working in temporal gauge, we provide explicit mappings of lattice Yang-Mills dynamics to Pauli-string Hamiltonians suitable for Trotterization. Classical simulations of small systems validate convergence criteria and quantify truncation and Trotter errors, showing concrete resource estimates and scalable circuit recipes for SU($N$) gauge theories. Our framework provides both conceptual clarity and practical tools toward quantum advantage in simulating non-Abelian gauge theories.

Focusing on spin-$\tfrac12$ lattices and subsystem fractions $f < \frac{1}{2}$, we derive a asymptotic expression for the average entanglement entropy up to constant order in the system volume $V$. In addition to the expected leading volume law term, we prove the existence of a $\frac{1}{2}\log V$ finite-size correction resulting from the scaling of the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and compute explicitly the $O(1)$ contribution reflecting angular-momentum coupling within magnetization blocks. Our analysis uses features of random matrix ensembles and provides a fully analytical treatment for arbitrary spin densities, thereby extending Page type results to non-Abelian sectors and clarifying how $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry shapes average entanglement.

Abstract: We revisit the finite Abelian hidden subgroup problem (AHSP) from a mathematical perspective and make the following contributions. First, by employing amplitude amplification, we present an exact quantum algorithm for the finite AHSP, our algorithm is more concise than the previous exact algorithm and applies to any finite Abelian group. Second, utilizing the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we propose a distributed exact quantum algorithm for finite AHSP, which requires fewer qudits, lower quantum query complexity, and no quantum communication. We further show that our distributed approach can be extended to certain classes of non-Abelian groups. Finally, we develop a parallel exact classical algorithm for finite AHSP with reduced query complexity; even without parallel execution, the total number of queries across all nodes does not exceed that of the original centralized algorithm under mild conditions.

*Philippe Grangier*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper critiques neo-Bohrian interpretations of quantum mechanics, arguing they reject infinity, while [author's] position accepts mathematical infinities if properly handled and starts from a shared physical ontology where classical and quantum physics coexist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author discusses subtle differences in handling infinity and physical ontology among approaches to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.

Method: The note presents alternative viewpoints by directly addressing and refuting the author's claims regarding infinity and physical principles.

Result: The paper demonstrates a coherent understanding of infinity's role in physical theories and correct identifies the flawed assumptions behind certain ontological perspectives.

Conclusion: The neo-Bohrian approach appears valid within its framework, emphasizing the importance of properly incorporating mathematical concepts like infinity into physical theories.

Abstract: In a recent preprint [1] Jeffrey Bub presents a discussion of neo-Bohrian interpretations of quantum mechanics, and also of von Neumann's work on infinite tensor products [2]. He rightfully writes that this work provides a theoretical framework that deflates the measurement problem and justifies Bohr's insistence on the primacy of classical concepts. But then he rejects these ideas, on the basis that the infinity limit is "never reached for any real system composed of a finite number of elementary systems". In this note we present opposite views on two major points: first, admitting mathematical infinities in a physical theory is not a problem, if properly done; second, the critics of [3,4,5] comes with a major misunderstanding of these papers: they don't ask about "the significance of the transition from classical to quantum mechanics", but they start from a physical ontology where classical and quantum physics need each other from the beginning. This is because they postulate that a microscopic physical object (or degree of freedom) always appears as a quantum system, within a classical context. Here we argue why this (neo-Bohrian) position makes sense.

Abstract: In this work, we formulate the problem of achieving in minimum-time perfect chiral resolution with bounded control fields, as an optimal control problem on two non-interacting spins-$1/2$. We assume the same control bound for the two Raman fields (pump and Stokes) and a different bound for the field connecting directly the two lower-energy states. Using control theory, we show that the optimal fields can only take the boundary values or be zero, the latter corresponding to singular control. Subsequently, using numerical optimal control and intuitive arguments, we identify some three-stage symmetric optimal pulse-sequences, for relatively larger values of the ratio between the two control bounds, and analytically calculate the corresponding pulse timings as functions of this ratio. For smaller values of the bounds ratio, numerical optimal control indicates that the optimal pulse-sequence loses its symmetry and the number of stages increases in general. In all cases, the analytical or numerical optimal protocol achieves a faster perfect chiral resolution than other pulsed protocols, mainly because of the simultaneous action of the control fields. The present work is expected to be useful in the wide spectrum of applications across the natural sciences where enantiomer separation is a crucial task.

Abstract: We analyze few-body quantum states with particular correlation properties imposed by the requirement of maximal bipartite entanglement for selected partitions of the system into two complementary parts. A novel framework to treat this problem by encoding these constraints in a graph is advocated; the resulting objects are called ``graph-restricted tensors''. This framework encompasses several examples previously treated in the literature, such as 1-uniform multipartite states, quantum states related to dual unitary operators and absolutely maximally entangled states (AME) corresponding to 2-unitary matrices. Original examples of presented graph-restricted tensors are motivated by tensor network models for the holographic principle. In concrete cases we find exact analytic solutions, demonstrating thereby that there exists a vast landscape of non-stabilizer tensors useful for the lattice models of holography.

TL;DR: Variational quantum algorithms face challenges scaling quantum many-body simulations on NISQ devices due to the impact of ansatz choice on algorithm performance. The paper compares generic hardware-efficient and symmetry-preserving circuit designs, finding that preserving physical symmetries in circuit design leads to better energy estimates, noise resilience, and convergence properties compared to standard hardware-efficient approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, and understanding the limitations and potential of variational quantum algorithms is crucial for practical applications on noisy NISQ devices.

Method: The research compares two types of variational quantum circuits: one generic hardware-efficient and another that incorporates physical symmetries. They benchmark these against exact methods and real hardware to assess performance metrics.

Result: Symmetry-preserving circuits outperform generic ones, showing better energy accuracy, noise tolerance, and convergence under limited quantum resources.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of tailoring quantum algorithms to the specific physics of the problem to improve performance in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computing era.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for simulating interacting quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the practical success of variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) critically depends on the structure of the chosen variational ansatz. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain using both generic hardware-efficient ansatz and physics-informed, symmetry-preserving variational circuits. We benchmark variational results against exact diagonalization and noiseless simulations, and subsequently validate the approach on real IQM Garnet quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that incorporating physical symmetries into the circuit design leads to significantly improved energy estimates, enhanced robustness against hardware noise, and clearer convergence behavior when compared to hardware-efficient ansatz under identical resource constraints. These findings highlight the importance of problem specific ansatz construction for reliable quantum simulations in the NISQ era.

Abstract: We consider the costs and benefits of embedding the states of one quantum system within those of another. Such embeddings are ubiquitous, e.g., in error correcting codes and in symmetry-constrained systems. In particular we investigate the impact of embeddings in terms of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness (also known as magic) quantified via the stabilizer entropy (SE). We analytically and numerically study the stabilizer entropy gap or magic gap: the average gap between the SE of a quantum state realized within a subspace of a larger system and the SE of the quantum state considered on its own. We find that while the stabilizer entropy gap is typically positive, requiring the injection of magic, both zero and negative magic gaps are achievable. This suggests that certain choices of embedding subspace provide strong resource advantages over others. We provide formulas for the average nonstabilizerness of a subspace given its corresponding projector and sufficient conditions for realizing zero or negative gaps: in particular, certain classes of stabilizer codes provide paradigmatic examples of the latter. Through numerical optimization, we find subspaces which achieve both minimal and maximal average SE for a variety of dimensions, and compute the magic gap for specific error-correcting codes and symmetry-induced subspaces. Our results suggest that a judicious choice of embedding can lead to greater efficiency in both classical and quantum simulations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores quantum correlations in relativistic spacetimes and their implications for information processing, particularly focusing on no-signalling constraints, causal loops, nonlocal jamming, and black hole event horizons. The authors propose a unified framework and examine various consequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum correlations in relativistic settings is crucial for advancing our understanding of quantum information theory, especially in scenarios involving high-speed particles and complex spacetime geometries. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a robust framework for analyzing both nonlocal and temporal correlations under relativistic causality.

Method: The authors employ a rigorous mathematical approach to formalize operational no-signalling constraints within general relativistic spacetimes. They use these constraints to analyze specific phenomena, such as the violation of causality, nonlocal jamming, and event horizon interactions. The paper also incorporates concepts from quantum information theory and general relativity to formulate its arguments.

Result: The key findings include demonstrating that no-signalling constraint violations in Minkowski spacetime lead to logical paradoxes or Poincaré symmetry violations. The paper refutes claims about detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Additionally, the authors show that nonlocal correlations can be jammed without violating operational no-signalling constraints and apply this to black hole event horizons. The paper introduces a unified framework for studying these phenomena and highlights several unresolved questions.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes. It raises important questions about causality, causality violation, and event horizon physics, suggesting potential directions for future theoretical and experimental research in quantum information and general relativity.

Abstract: The study of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes, and the consequences of relativistic causality on information processing using such correlations, has gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincaré symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is among leading candidates for achieving quantum advantage on near-term processors. While typically implemented with a transverse-field mixer (XM-QAOA), the Grover-mixer variant (GM-QAOA) offers a compelling alternative due to its global search capabilities. This work investigates the application of GM-QAOA to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, also known as Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO), which constitute a generalized class of combinatorial optimization tasks characterized by intrinsically multi-variable interactions. We present a comprehensive numerical study demonstrating that GM-QAOA, unlike XM-QAOA, exhibits monotonic performance improvement with circuit depth and achieves superior results for HUBO problems. An important component of our approach is an analytical framework for modeling GM-QAOA dynamics, which enables a classical approximation of the optimal parameters and helps reduce the optimization overhead. Our resource-efficient parameterized GM-QAOA nearly matches the performance of the fully optimized algorithm while being far less demanding, establishing it as a highly effective approach for complex optimization tasks. These findings highlight GM-QAOA's potential and provide a practical pathway for its implementation on current quantum hardware.

Abstract: Circuit simulation tools are critical for developing and assessing quantum-error-correcting and fault-tolerant strategies. In this work, we present SOFT, a high-performance SimulatOr for universal Fault-Tolerant quantum circuits. Integrating the generalized stabilizer formalism and highly optimized GPU parallelization, SOFT enables the simulation of noisy quantum circuits containing non-Clifford gates at a scale not accessible with existing tools. To provide a concrete demonstration, we simulate the state-of-the-art magic state cultivation (MSC) protocol at code distance $d=5$, involving 42 qubits, 72 $T$ / $T^\dagger$ gates, and mid-circuit measurements. Using only modest GPU resources, SOFT performs over 200 billion shots and achieves the first ground-truth simulation of the cultivation protocol at a non-trivial scale. This endeavor not only certifies the MSC's effectiveness for generating high-fidelity logical $T$-states, but also reveals a large discrepancy between the actual logical error rate and the previously reported values. Our work demonstrates the importance of reliable simulation tools for fault-tolerant architecture design, advancing the field from simulating quantum memory to simulating a universal quantum computer.

Abstract: The van der Waals interaction between neutral atoms is typically studied using stationary perturbation theory for the short-distance (London) limit, while long-distance (Casimir-Polder) results are usually derived via semiclassical, time-dependent approaches. In this pedagogical article, we demonstrate that reformulating stationary perturbation theory calculations in terms of time-ordered correlation functions significantly simplifies the mathematical treatment. This reformulation is particularly advantageous for higher-order calculations required in the long-distance regime, where retardation effects become important. Our approach provides a unified framework that connects both limiting cases while offering a clear conceptual picture suitable for advanced quantum mechanics courses.

Abstract: We introduce the Clifford entropy, a measure of how close an arbitrary unitary is to a Clifford unitary, which generalizes the stabilizer entropy for states. We show that this quantity vanishes if and only if a unitary is Clifford, is invariant under composition with Clifford unitaries, and is subadditive under tensor products. Rewriting the Clifford entropy in terms of the stabilizer entropy of the corresponding Choi state allows us to derive an upper bound: that this bound is not tight follows from considering the properties of symmetric informationally complete sets. Nevertheless we are able to numerically estimate the maximum in low dimensions, comparing it to the average over all unitaries, which we derive analytically. Finally, harnessing a concentration of measure result, we show that as the dimension grows large, with probability approaching unity, the ratio between the Clifford entropy of a Haar random unitary and that of a fixed magic gate gives a lower bound on the depth of a doped Clifford circuit which realizes the former in terms of the latter. In fact, numerical evidence suggests that this result holds reliably even in low dimensions. We conclude with several directions for future research.

Abstract: Developing and deploying advanced Quantum Repeater (QR) technologies will be necessary to scale quantum networks to longer distances. Depending on the error mitigation mechanisms adopted to suppress loss and errors, QRs are typically classified into memory-based or all-photonic QRs; and each type of QR may be best suited for a specific type of underlying quantum technology, a particular scale of quantum networks, or a specific regime of operational parameters. We perform theoretical analysis and simulations of quantum repeaters and networks to investigate the relative performance and resource requirements of different quantum network paradigms. Our results will help guide the optimization of quantum hardware and components and shed light on the role of a robust control plane. We present our research findings on theoretical analysis and simulations of memory-based first-generation trapped-ion quantum repeaters and networks, and all-photonic entanglement-based quantum repeaters and networks. We study the relative performance in terms of entanglement generation rate and fidelity, as well as the resource requirements of these two different quantum network paradigms.

Abstract: We demonstrate the efficient modulation of flux-tunable superconducting resonators (FTRs) using flip-chip or on-chip-based input coils. The FTRs we use are aluminum-based quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators terminated with 100um or 200um-wide square loop dc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing 1um-sized Josephson junctions. We employ SQUIDs with a geometric loop inductance of up to 0.7nH to increase the flux transfer efficiency. The geometric inductance of the SQUID results in a non-zero screening parameter $β_L$, whose branch switching effect is mitigated by using asymmetric junctions. We achieve flux modulation of the FTRs by more than one GHz and flux responsivities of up to tens of GHz/$Φ_0$ with uA-scale on-chip currents. We compare flip-chip with on-chip input-coil-based flux modulation, where the former is realized through galvanically connected and closely spaced chips, while the latter is achieved through superconducting air-bridge connections. We achieve a flux-transfer efficiency from the input coil to the SQUID loop of up to 20%. Our work paves the way for efficient low current flux modulation of FTRs and sensitive measurement of flux signals.

Abstract: Criticality-based quantum sensing exploits hypersensitive response to system parameters near phase transition points. This work uncovers two metrological advantages offered by topological phase transitions when the probe is prepared as topological edge states. Firstly, the order of topological band touching is found to determine how the metrology sensitivity scales with the system size. Engineering a topological phase transition with higher-order band touching is hence advocated, with the associated quantum Fisher information scaling as $ \mathcal{F}_Q \sim L^{2p}$, with $L$ the lattice size in one dimension, and $p$ the order of band touching. Secondly, with a topological lattice accommodating degenerate edge modes (such as multiple zero modes), preparing an $N$-particle entangled state at the edge and then adiabatically tuning the system to the phase transition point grows quantum entanglement to macroscopic sizes, yielding $\mathcal{F}_Q \sim N^2 L^{2p}$. This work hence paves a possible topological phase transition-based route to harness entanglement, large lattice size, and high-order band touching for quantum metrology.

Abstract: Developing robust and high performance quantum software is challenging due to the dynamic nature of existing Python-based frameworks, which often suffer from runtime errors and scalability bottlenecks. In this work, we present LogosQ, a high performance backend agnostic quantum computing library implemented in Rust that enforces correctness through compile time type safety. Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.

Abstract: If the phase space-based Sudarshan-Glauber distribution, $P_ρ$, has negative values the quantum state, $ρ$, it describes is nonclassical. Due to $P$'s singular behavior this simple criterion is impractical to use. Recent work [Bohmann and Agudelo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 133601 (2020)] presented a general, sensitive, and noise-tolerant certification functional, $ξ_{P}$, for the detection of non-classical behavior of quantum states $P_ρ$. There, it was shown that when this functional takes on negative values somewhere in phase space, $ξ_{P}(x,p) < 0$, this is \emph{sufficient} to certify the nonclassicality of a state. Here we give examples where this certification fails. We investigate states which are known to be nonclassical but the certification functions is positive $ξ(x,p) \geq 0$ everywhere in phase space. We generalize $ξ$ giving it an appealing form which allows for improved certification. This way we generate the best family of certification functions available so far. Yet, they also fail for very weakly nonclassical states, in other words, the question how to faithfully certify quantumness remains an open question.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了通过多模式高斯态粒子数测量生成受 squeezing 的 Fock 状态（SFS）的方法。他们的发现指出，存在一类通用的 N-模式高斯态，测量 N-1 个模式即可成功生成 SFS，并且这些生成的 SFS 独特的特性是仅依赖于检测到的粒子总数，而和这些粒子如何分布在探测器中无关。他们通过分析多模式高斯态的一般波函数形式，提出了一种通用的 SFS 生成方案。对于这个方案，他们评估了生成 SFS 的概率，并对检测器中粒子数分辨率的不完美性对过程的鲁棒性进行了分析。他们还与一种非通用的方案进行了比较，这种非通用方案中的 SFS 生成依赖于探测到的粒子数分布。论文结果表明，通用方案在生成 SFS 的概率上更优，但需要更复杂的实验资源。

Abstract: We investigate the generation of squeezed Fock states (SFSs) via particle-number measurements in the modes of multimode Gaussian states. We identify a universal class of $N$-mode Gaussian states for which measuring $N-1$ modes results in the generation of SFSs. The key feature of these states is that the generated SFSs depend only on the total number of detected particles and are independent of their distribution among the detectors. Based on the general form of the wave functions of multimode Gaussian states, we propose a universal scheme for SFS generation. For this scheme, we evaluate the probability of SFS generation and analyze the robustness of the process against imperfections in particle-number-resolving detectors. In addition, we compare the universal scheme with a nonuniversal scheme, in which the generation of SFSs depends on a specific distribution of particle numbers across the detectors. We demonstrate that the universal scheme provides a higher probability of SFS generation, at the cost of increased experimental resources.

Abstract: Recently Szangolies has argued (in the setting of extended Wigner's-friend scenarios) that quantum theory permits ``Rashomon'' situations: multiple internally coherent accounts of events that cannot be combined into a single, consistent global narrative. This note explains why the Rashomon phenomenon can be understood as a \emph{failure of gluing}: local descriptions over different contexts exist, but they do not admit a single global ``all-perspectives-at-once'' description. This is the same mathematical obstruction that underlies modern sheaf-theoretic treatments of contextuality. I then indicate why the same perspective is useful in parts of the social sciences (quantum-like modelling of cognition, judgment, and decision-making), where ``context effects'' can likewise be interpreted as the absence of a single joint probability space.

Abstract: Quantum communication exploits non-classical correlations to achieve efficient and unconditionally secure exchange of information. In particular, the quantum teleportation protocol allows for a deterministic and secure transfer of unknown quantum states by using pre-shared quantum entanglement and classical feedforward communication. Quantum teleportation in the microwave regime provides an important tool for high-fidelity remote quantum operations, enabling distributed quantum computing with superconducting circuits and potentially facilitating short-range, open-air microwave quantum communication. In this context, we consider practical application scenarios for the microwave analog quantum teleportation protocol based on continuous-variable states. We theoretically analyze the effect of feedforward losses and noise on teleportation fidelities of coherent states and show that these imperfections can be fully corrected by an appropriate feedforward gain. Furthermore, we consider quantum teleportation with finite-size codebooks and derive modified no-cloning thresholds as a function of the codebook configuration. Finally, we analyze the security of quantum teleportation under public channel attacks and demonstrate that the corresponding secure fidelity thresholds may drastically differ from the conventional no-cloning values. Our results contribute to the general development of quantum communication protocols and, in particular, illustrate the feasibility of using quantum teleportation in realistic microwave networks for robust and unconditionally secure communication.

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising strategy for solving complex optimization problems by encoding the solution into the ground state of a problem Hamiltonian. While most implementations rely on spin-$1/2$ systems, we explore the performance of quantum annealing on a spin-$1$ system where the problem Hamiltonian includes a single ion anisotropy term of the form $D\sum (S^z)^2$. Our results reveal that for a suitable range of the anisotropy strength $D$, the spin-$1$ annealer reaches the ground state with higher fidelity. We attribute this performance to the presence of the intermediate spin level and the tunable anisotropy, which together enable the algorithm to traverse the energy landscape through smaller, incremental steps instead of a single large spin flip. This mechanism effectively lowers barriers in the configuration space and stabilizes the evolution. These findings suggest that higher spin annealers offer intrinsic advantages for robust and flexible quantum optimization, especially for problems naturally formulated with ternary decision variables.

Abstract: Linearly polarized projections are the tacit means for performing Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality tests using polarization-entangled photon pairs. The inequality is valid for all states on the Poincaré-Bloch sphere, but few laboratory studies have investigated violations with the full sphere. In this article, we explore the experimental verifications of the predicted violations of the CHSH inequality with Bell and non-Bell states with same and different linear and elliptically polarized basis states for each photon. We find that Bell states violate CHSH when using the same basis for both photons, regardless of their ellipticity, whereas they show no violations for photon projections in different bases. We found non-Bell maximally-entangled states for which the converse is true.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Twirling, uniform averaging over symmetry actions, is a standard tool for reducing the description of quantum states and channels to symmetry-invariant data. We develop a framework for averaging quantum channels based on channel-state duality that converts pre- and post-processing averages into a group twirl acting directly on the Choi operator. For arbitrary unitary representations on the input and output spaces, the twirled channel is obtained as an explicit projection onto the commutant of the induced representation on $\mathcal H_{\rm out}\otimes \mathcal H_{\rm in}$. In the collective setting, where the commutant is the walled Brauer algebra, we introduce a partial-transpose reduction that maps channel twirling to an ordinary Schur-Weyl twirl of the partially transposed Choi operator, enabling formulas in terms of permutation operators. We further extend the construction beyond compact symmetries to reductive non-unitary groups via Cartan decomposition, yielding a weighted sum of invariant-sector projections with weights determined by the Abelian component. Finally, we provide two finite realizations of channel averaging. The first one is a ``dual'' averaging protocol as a convex mixture of unitary-$1$-design channels on invariant sectors. The second one is a notion of channel $t$-designs induced by weighted group $t$-designs for $t=t_{\rm in}+t_{\rm out}$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Closed timelike curves (CTCs) challenge our conception of causality by allowing information to loop back into its own past. Any consistent description of such scenarios must avoid time-travel paradoxes while respecting the no-new-physics principle, which requires that the set of operations available within any local spacetime region remain unchanged, irrespective of whether CTCs exist elsewhere. Within an information-theoretic framework, this leads to process functions: deterministic classical communication structures that remain logically consistent under arbitrary local operations, yet can exhibit correlations incompatible with any definite causal order - a phenomenon known as non-causality. In this work, we provide the first complete recursive characterization of process functions and of (non-)causal process functions. We use it to establish a correspondence between process functions and unambiguous complete product bases, i.e., product bases in which every local state belongs to a unique local basis. This equivalence implies that non-causality of process functions is exactly mirrored by quantum nonlocality without entanglement (QNLWE) - the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing separable states using local operations and causal classical communication - for such bases. Our results generalize previous special cases to arbitrary local dimensions and any number of parties, enable systematic constructions of non-causal process functions and unambiguous QNLWE bases, and reveal an unexpected connection between certain non-signaling inequalities and causal inequalities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Heisenberg-limited parameter estimation protocol using a qubit-conditioned quantum quench in an anisotropic ferromagnet to measure magnon squeezing, emphasizing the importance of quantum correlations in quantum magnonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum magnonics is an emerging field aiming to harness quantum properties of magnons. This paper presents a specific protocol for parameter estimation, which is a key motivator for research in this area.

Method: The method involves a qubit-conditioned quantum quench in an anisotropic ferromagnet, leveraging the squeezing of magnons as a resource for parameter estimation. The technique relies on measuring the qubit and analyzing the squeezed magnon states to extract information about the system's eigenmode frequency.

Result: The protocol demonstrates that squeezing can be used for Heisenberg-limited estimation, which requires only the measurement of the qubit. Additionally, the paper highlights the role of genuine quantum correlations and the equilibrium nature of squeezing in magnetic systems.

Conclusion: This work opens up new pathways for using quantum resources in practical quantum metrology applications, particularly in solid-state systems governed by spin excitations.

Abstract: The emerging field of quantum magnonics seeks to understand and harness the quantum properties of magnons -- quantized collective spin excitations in magnets. Squeezed magnon states arise naturally as the equilibrium ground states of anisotropic ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, representing an important class of nonclassical magnon states. In this work, we show how a qubit-conditioned quantum quench of an anisotropic ferromagnet can be used for Heisenberg-limited parameter estimation based on measurements of the qubit only. In the presence of ground-state squeezing, the protocol yields information about the eigenmode frequency of the coupled magnon-qubit system, whereas no information is gained in the absence of such squeezing. The protocol therefore leverages genuine quantum correlations in the form of magnonic squeezing while simultaneously relying on the equilibrium character of this squeezing -- a feature distinctive to magnetic systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical physics often requires comparing different quantization frameworks to unify understanding or simplify calculations. This paper aims to bridge the gap between covariant and light-cone approaches in scalar field theory.

Method: An explicit comparison of one-loop amplitudes between the conjectured formula and light-cone perturbation theory is performed to validate the conjecture at this level of accuracy.

Result: The conjectured formula is validated at one-loop accuracy, effectively rederiving wave functions from known covariant amplitudes by bypassing light-cone perturbative complexities.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for applying the mapping to gauge theories and exploring deeper aspects of the equivalence between covariant and light-cone quantization frameworks.

Abstract: We propose a conjectured formula that systematically maps covariant off-shell amplitudes to light-cone wave functions in scalar field theory. Through an explicit comparison at one-loop accuracy, we establish its equivalence to the light-cone perturbation theory series, thereby validating the conjecture at this order. Applying this formula, we efficiently re-derive wave functions from known covariant amplitudes, bypassing both the conceptual complexities of light-cone quantization and the technical challenges of perturbative calculations in this framework. In addition to simplifying computations, this approach opens new avenues for applications in gauge theories and deeper explorations of the fundamental equivalence between covariant and light-cone quantization.

Using this proposal, we construct effective actions of untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theories with Heisenberg gauge group over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and show that the braiding data from Hopf link and the fusion rules match with the expected discrete gauge theories. We also study the symTFT implications of these effective Lagrangians and clarify their relations with higher group global symmetries.

Abstract: Minimal 5-dimensional supergravity compactified on a circle gives the T$^{3}$ model of $\mathcal{N}=2,d=4$ supergravity, whose duality group is SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. We study exhaustively the relations between all the local and global symmetries of both theories and between the corresponding conserved currents and charges, including the on-shell closed generalized Komar charges associated to isometries. We find that the 2-dimensional subgroup of SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ that does not include electric-magnetic transformations is realized as a higher-form symmetry group that acts on the 5-dimensional metric and vector field. Using the generalized Komar charges we compute the Smarr formulas for black holes, showing that they are identical once the relations between all the 5- and 4-dimensional thermodynamical quantities are taken into account, which is only possible if certain constraints on the fields are satisfied. We notice that on-shell closed 5-dimensional 3-form charges give, upon dimensional reduction, on-shell closed 3-form currents and 2-form charges. The dimensional reduction of the 5-dimensional generalized Komar 3-form charge associated to a Killing vector gives a new 4-dimensional on-shell closed 3-form current which must be associated to a new global symmetry of the theory when it admits that Killing vector. Some of the results that we have derived are valid for theories of Einstein--Maxwell-like theories of $(p+1)$-forms with Chern--Simons terms, which includes 11-dimensional supergravity as a particular example.

Abstract: A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.

Abstract: We present all bosonic giant and dual-giant type configurations of a probe D3-brane in the BPS single-parameter Gutowski-Reall black hole in 10d type IIB supergravity that do not break any of its supersymmetries. The resulting D3-brane world-volumes can be given by the common zeros of three holomorphic functions of five complex scalar harmonics of the geometry. These probe branes support world-volume electromagnetic fields which we characterise completely in terms of pull-backs of closed 2-forms. Our configurations can be seen as natural generalisations of known supersymmetric D3-branes in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ and approach them far away from the black hole horizon.

Abstract: In this work, we study the realisation of unitarity-based cutting rules for primordial cosmological correlators computed within the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. While cutting rules have been previously derived for wavefunction coefficients, here we examine them directly at the level of cosmological observables expressed diagrammatically. The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves. We explicitly verify these rules for several classes of correlators, both at tree level and with loop corrections, arising from theories involving different types of interactions.

Abstract: The species scale is the energy scale at which quantum corrections to Einstein's theory of gravity become significant. In many cases, this scale corresponds to the string mass scale, which can be much lower than the Planck scale in the weak coupling limit. In this note, we explore a variant of the TCC conjecture, which we refer to as the refined TCC. This version is related to the species scale as a new cutoff in quantum gravity, and we study whether stringy modes remain stringy and never exceed the Hubble horizon. The refined TCC predicts a shorter lifetime for de-Sitter spacetime and imposes a bound on the cosmological constant. We present supporting evidence for the refined TCC from cosmological solutions of different compactifications of various string theories. Furthermore, it is argued that both the TCC and the refined TCC are incompatible with the big-bang singularity. Therefore, if the TCC and the refined TCC hold, the big bang singularity must be ruled out. In scenarios such as string gas cosmology, where the TCC is realized, the spacetime background remains completely regular.

TL;DR: The paper derives the equations of motion for Chiral Higher Spin Gravity (HiSGRA) using an $L_ty$-algebra constructed from an $A_ty$-algebra of pre-Calabi-Yau type. The construction connects to non-commutative deformation quantization and the AdS/CFT correspondence, offering a coordinate-independent formulation of chiral HiSGRA with implications for $O(N)$ vector models and a potential generalization of Kontsevich'S formality theorem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper combines advanced topics in theoretical physics, such as higher spin gravity, chiral algebras, and deformation quantization, likely in the context of understanding holographic correspondences like AdS/CFT.

Method: The authors use an $L_ty$-algebra, built from an $A_ty$-algebra of pre-Calabi-Yau type, to encode the equations of motion. They integrate over convex polygons in $	extbf{R}^2$ and generalize to $	extbf{R}^3$ related to positive Grassmannians, associating this with Stokes' theorem for potential generalization of formality theorems.

Result: A coordinate-independent formulation of chiral HiSGRA is established, revealing it as a closed subsector with implications for vector models and suggesting a connection to non-commutative geometry via formality theorems.

Conclusion: The work solidifies ties between higher spin theories, deformation quantization, and holography, paving the way for exploring deeper mathematical connections like generalizations of formality theorems.

Abstract: In this thesis, we derive the equations of motion of Chiral Higher Spin Gravity (HiSGRA) in terms of its underlying $L_\infty$-algebra. Chiral HiSGRA contains self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity as closed subsectors, which themselves form closed subsectors of Yang-Mills and general relativity. We begin by constructing a covariant formulation for self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity, and subsequently extend this construction to the full Chiral Higher Spin Gravity.
  Remarkably, the $L_\infty$-algebra is constructed from an $A_\infty$-algebra of pre-Calabi-Yau type, suggesting a deep connection to non-commutative deformation quantization. The structure maps of the resulting $L_\infty$-algebra are expressed as integrals of a simple exponential over convex polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The existence of this covariant and coordinate independent formulation of chiral HiSGRA demonstrates, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, that $O(N)$ vector models possess a closed chiral subsector.
  Finally, we prove that the $A_\infty$-algebra follows from Stokes' theorem -- a crucial feature of the known formality theorems. To this end, we construct integration spaces that generalize convex polygons to $\mathbb{R}^3$, and are intimately connected to positive Grassmanians. This Stokes-based derivation points towards a novel generalization of Kontsevich' formality theorem to the non-commutative setting.

Abstract: We present the first systematic resurgent analysis of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics for the most general constant background field configuration. In contrast to the extensively studied single-field cases, the two-field case exhibits unique asymptotic structures, leading to a substantially richer pattern of singularities in the Borel plane. Explicit large-order asymptotic formulas for the weak-field coefficients in both spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics are derived. These reveal a nontrivial interplay between alternating and non-alternating factorial growth, governed by distinct structures associated with electric and magnetic contributions, and smoothly interpolating between the known single-field limits. Using Borel dispersion techniques, we demonstrate that the complete instanton structure underlying Schwinger pair production in two-field backgrounds is encoded in the divergent perturbative coefficients. We then construct resurgent approximants using Padè-Borel and Padè-Conformal-Borel resummation schemes adapted to the two-field case. For the spinor case, conformal improvement results in a significant enhancement in reconstructing both the real and imaginary parts of the effective Lagrangian across a wide range of field ratios, accurately capturing the subtle sign-changing features in the strong-field regime. In the scalar case, it yields only marginal improvement. Detailed comparisons with exact special-function representations demonstrate the reliability of reconstructions from a modest number of weak-field coefficients. This work establishes a natural completion of the resurgence programme for constant electromagnetic backgrounds, providing a robust analytic framework for exploring nonperturbative physics and strong-field phenomena in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics, from finite perturbative data.

Abstract: Chaotic motion near black holes has recently been examined through the lens of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos-bound, but reported violations remain contradictory. A major source of this ambiguity lies in the common practice of treating the angular momentum of test particles as a freely adjustable parameter, rather than a quantity fixed by the circular-orbit conditions. In this work, we develop a fully constrained framework in which the angular momentum of particles is determined exactly from the underlying geometry and is used consistently in both the orbital and Lyapunov analyses. For the charged Kiselev black hole, previously reported chaos-bound violations disappear under a consistent treatment of angular momentum, indicating that these effects are apparent rather than physical. This inference is reinforced by the exact agreement between our results and the standard circular-orbit condition obtained from the effective-potential approach. By extending the analysis to geometries containing higher-order curvature terms, we find genuine chaos-bound violations at large charge-to-mass ratios, originating from curvature corrections rather than orbital parameters. This framework, therefore, provides a systematic means of distinguishing apparent from physical chaos-bound violations in Einstein gravity and its extensions.

Abstract: We present a prescription for computing the tree-level two-point amplitude of closed strings in the pure spinor superstring formalism, thereby completing the analysis of such superstring amplitudes. The construction relies on fixing the residual conformal Killing group using a mostly BRST-exact operator that has been successfully applied in the open-string case. Earlier attempts at a straightforward extension to closed strings--treating them naïvely as products of open strings--fail. Nevertheless, we show that a consistent prescription can be obtained by replacing the open-string BRST charge with the closed-string BRST charge. The key idea is to employ closed-string vertex operators with nonstandard ghost-number assignments, rather than the conventional ghost-number (1,1) vertices. Furthermore, since the pure spinor BRST cohomology for closed strings vanishes at total (left plus right) ghost number four or higher, we find that the resulting prescription is essentially unique.

Abstract: In the paper arXiv:2501.04771, a novel compactification of heterotic supergravity on a warped product of $\R\times T^{1,1}$ was constructed, where $T^{1,1}$ is a five-dimensional coset space $(SU(2)\times SU(2))/U(1)$. It was shown that this admits a four dimensional Minkowski vacuum solution with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry, and furthermore that in the bosonic sector there exists a remarkable fully consistent truncation in which the gauge bosons of the $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ isometries of the $T^{1,1}$ are retained. In this paper, we examine this reduction further, and show that the consistency can be extended to include the fermionic sector also. Thus the heterotic theory admits a consistent reduction to give an ungauged ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity coupled to $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ Yang-Mills multiplets and a scalar multiplet.

Abstract: We formulate a closed set of equations for the spectrum of two-dimensional bi-scalar fishnet conformal field theory, comprising Baxter equations and quantisation conditions, which we derive operatorially from the underlying sl(2) spin chain. These equations are reminiscent of the Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) framework found in other holographic CFTs and are expected to provide a complete non-perturbative description of the spectrum at arbitrary coupling. We solve the QSC numerically at finite coupling and uncover a rich analytic structure, including state collisions and complex energy levels. Analytically, we introduce a new method to derive the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz equations, which control the spectrum up to wrapping order and incorporate spinning states. We further extend our results to the twisted case, which may be particularly useful for future separation of variables analyses of correlation functions in this theory.

As concrete applications, we provide detailed analyses for the $φ^4$ theory near four dimensions and $φ^6$ near three dimensions, semiclassically determining the full spectrum of neutral operators in the traceless symmetric Lorentz representations. Our methodology is presented pedagogically and is readily applicable to a vast class of CFTs.

Abstract: We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) with its right-, left-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which itself are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under (appropriate set of) diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behavior under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other representative settings, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.

Abstract: For simple, simply-connected compact Lie groups, Dynkin embedding indices obey a universal scaling law with a direct topological meaning. Given an inclusion $f:G\hookrightarrow H$, the Dynkin embedding index $j_f$ is characterized equivalently by the induced maps on $π_3$ and on the canonical generators of $H^3$, $H^4(B{-})$, and $H^4(Σ{-})$. Consequently, $j_f$ controls instanton-number scaling, the quantization levels of Chern--Simons and Wess--Zumino--Witten terms, and the matching of gauge couplings and one-loop RG scales. We connect this picture to representation theory via the $β$-construction in topological $K$-theory, relating Dynkin indices to Chern characters through Harris' degree--$3$ formula and Naylor's suspended degree--$4$ refinement. Finally, we apply these results to F-theory to explain the prevalence of index-one matter: we propose a ``genericity heuristic'' where geometry favors regular embeddings (typically $j_f=1$) associated with minimal singularity enhancements, while higher-index embeddings require non-generic tuning.

Abstract: We re-examine the problem of vacuum decay in the presence of spherically symmetric black holes. Within the semiclassical approximation, we study configurations describing a bubble of true vacuum propagating outside a black hole formed from gravitational collapse. We find that the saddle point is dominated by a single energy state and that the dependence on the initial conditions in the stellar interior vanishes exponentially fast at late stages of the collapse. Prescriptions are given for implementing the corresponding boundary conditions in the eternal black-hole geometry. We find that vacuum decay can only be weakly catalyzed by the black hole, as the suppression exponent attains a minimum at a finite black-hole mass. In the limit of vanishing black-hole mass, the suppression smoothly approaches the flat-space result.

Abstract: In 2003, Hikami and Kirillov uncovered an intriguing connection between torus knots $\mathcal{K}_{(P,Q)}$ and Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(P,Q)$ by relating the Kashaev invariants of the knots to the characters of the corresponding minimal models. In this work, we recover and extend this connection by combining the 3D--3D correspondence with a bulk--boundary correspondence. More concretely, we study the 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories associated with torus-knot complements via the Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov construction and show that, in the infrared, these theories either flow to a unitary TQFT (when $|P-Q| = 1$), whose boundary chiral algebra reproduces that of the associated unitary minimal model, or to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFT (when $|P-Q| > 1$), which realizes the corresponding non-unitary chiral minimal model at the boundary after an appropriate topological twist. This framework yields new Nahm-sum-like expressions for the characters of Virasoro minimal models and other related rational conformal field theories, providing a systematic algorithm for constructing characters of rational VOAs directly from the combinatorial data of an ideal triangulation of a non-hyperbolic knot complement.

Abstract: We compute static ($ω\to0$) tilde Love numbers for scalar ($s=0$) and Dirac ($s=1/2$) perturbations of static acoustic black holes (ABHs) in (3+1) and (2+1) dimensions respectively. By imposing horizon regularity condition and matching to the large-radius expansion, we extract the ratio between decaying and growing modes. It turns out that in (3+1) dimensions the scalar Love number is generically nonzero for ABHs, while the Fermionic Love numbers follow a universal power-law form $F^{\pm1/2}_{\ell m}=\pm 4^{-(\ell+1/2)}$. In (2+1) dimensions the scalar field exhibits a strange logarithmic structure, causing the Bosonic Love number to vanish for even $m$ but remain nontrivial for odd $m$; In contrast, the Fermionic Love number in this case retains a simple power-law form $F_m=4^{-m}$ and is generically nonzero. These results provide insights into tidal response in analogue gravity systems and highlight qualitative differences between integer- and half-integer-spin fields.

Abstract: We establish an off-shell commutativity theorem in 4D parity-even quadratic gravity that the Hubbard-Stratonovich/Legendre lifts, algebraic elimination of auxiliaries, including the torsionless Palatini connection, and Jordan-Einstein Weyl rescalings commute at the action level up to boundary terms. This yields a frame-independent characterization of the propagating degrees of freedom and isolates a universal scalaron EFT in the metric branch, while clarifying the algebraic nature of the Palatini $f(R)$ scalar. We obtain, as a result, a frame-universal matching from the generic nonminimal couplings to a positive $R^2$ sector and a quantitative single-field attractor bound, enhanced by a $1/ΔN$ selection term, providing sharp and falsifiable CMB targets.

*Wei Cui,Junkang Huang,Zi-Xiao Huang,Satoshi Nawata,Shutong Zhuang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We investigate 2d (0,4) supersymmetric theories derived from 4d N=2 class S theories on a Riemann surface. Key aspects include central charges, unbroken gauge groups, and superconformal R-symmetries. We propose formulas for central charges and validate them using Hilbert series for SU(2) gauge group theories on special and twisted Higgs branches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the properties of 2d supersymmetric theories, particularly those arising from class S theories, is fundamental for advancing our knowledge in theoretical physics. This includes insights into central charges and R-symmetries, which are vital for characterizing the theories' structure and behavior.

Method: We employ a method involving topological twisting of 4d theories, reducing them to 2d. By analyzing vacuum moduli spaces and computing Hilbert series, we identify the infrared vacuum structures, particularly for SU(2) gauge groups on two distinct Higgs branches.

Result: Our method yields consistent central charge formulas. We successfully compute and validate these for SU(2) cases on both the special and twisted Higgs branches using Hilbert series, demonstrating the accuracy of our formulas.

Conclusion: Our analysis offers a precise understanding of central charges and related structures in these 2d theories through the lens of Hilbert series computations. The results are consistent and strengthen our confidence in the proposed formulas for broader analysis of such theories.

Abstract: We investigate 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ supersymmetric theories obtained from a topologically-twisted reduction of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ class $\mathcal{S}$ theories on a Riemann surface. This study addresses subtle aspects of central charges, unbroken gauge groups, and emergent superconformal R-symmetries of these theories. Focusing on infrared vacuum structures, we propose conjectural formulas for the central charges. For theories with the gauge group $SU(2)$, we use a Lagrangian description to analyze the vacuum moduli spaces. In particular, we examine two distinct branches -- the special Higgs branch and the twisted Higgs branch -- by computing their Hilbert series, and find agreement with the proposed central charge formulas.

Abstract: We employ the massive gravity approach to stress-tensor deformations in a variety of scenarios, obtaining novel results and establishing new connections. Starting with perturbation theory, we show that the addition of $\text{tr} T+Λ_{2}$ to $T\overline{T}$ can be recovered and we construct the deformed action of an interacting non-abelian spin-1 along with spin-1/2 seed model, extending previous findings. As a result, a set of algebraic properties for certain hypergeometric functions is derived, allowing us to initiate the algebraic study of special functions directly via stress-tensor deformations and massive gravity. Moreover, we sharpen the connection between the trace-flow equation and the local renormalization group in any dimension. In $d>2$, the usual initial condition for the coupling leads to a potential known as ghost-free, minimal massive gravity. Upon expansion around the reference background, we retrieve Fierz-Pauli at leading order, matching the random geometry and holographic approaches. At the same time, we demonstrate that a change of coordinates interpretation is possible for the corresponding operator, which we verify with a simple example. Finally, we study the family of $(\text{tr} T)^{n}$ deformations advancing earlier work, and illustrate how the massive gravity description of non-linear electrodynamics can be incorporated in our framework.

Abstract: Topological solitons and tunneling configurations (monopoles, vortices, Skyrmions, sphalerons, and bounces) are characterized by profile functions that encode their physical properties. Derrick's scaling relation provides a global integral constraint on these profiles, but reveals nothing about the local balance between kinetic and potential contributions in different regions. We derive a continuous family of virial identities for O($n$) symmetric configurations, parameterized by an exponent $α$ that controls the radial weighting: negative $α$ emphasizes the core where topological boundary conditions are imposed, large positive $α$ emphasizes the asymptotic tail, and $α= 1$ recovers the classical Derrick relation. The family provides a systematic decomposition of the global constraint into radially-resolved components, with special $α$ values isolating specific mechanisms. For BPS configurations, where the Bogomolny equations imply pointwise equality between kinetic and potential densities, the virial identity is satisfied for all valid $α$. We verify the formalism analytically for the Fubini-Lipatov instanton, BPS monopole, and BPST instanton. Numerical tests on the Coleman bounce and Nielsen-Olesen vortex illustrate how the $α$-dependence of errors distinguishes core from tail inaccuracies: the vortex shows errors growing at negative $α$ (core), while the bounce shows errors growing at positive $α$ (tail). Applications to the electroweak sphaleron, where the Higgs mass explicitly breaks scale invariance, and the hedgehog Skyrmion illustrate the formalism in systems with multiple competing length scales.

Abstract: A recently proposed addition to the holographic dictionary connects extremal black holes to fortuitous operators -- those which are only supersymmetric for sufficiently small values of the central charge. The most efficient techniques for finding them come from studying the cohomology of a nilpotent supercharge. We explore two aspects of this problem in weakly-coupled ABJM theory, where the gauge group is $\mathrm{U}(N) \times \mathrm{U}(N)$ and the Chern-Simons level is taken to be large. Adapting an algorithm which has been used to great effect in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills, we enumerate 244 low-lying fortuitous operators and sort them into multiplets of the centralizer algebra. This leads to the construction of two leading fortuitous representatives for $N = 3$ which are subleading for $N = 2$. In the second part of this work, we identify a truncation of ABJM theory where the action of the one-loop supercharge matches the one in the BMN subsector of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills. This allows a known infinite tower of representatives to be lifted from one theory to the other.

Abstract: This is a combined review on the Kerr/CFT correspondence on the one hand and solvable irrelevant deformations of two-dimensional QFTs - specifically, the $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ deformations - on the other. These subjects are interconnected, since the microscopic description of general black holes can be linked to very special irrelevant deformations of two-dimensional CFTs; conversely, one may draw interesting insights into black hole microscopics from the study of the exactly solvable $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ deformations.
  The Kerr/CFT part emphasizes the conceptual challenges faced by this proposed holographic description of general extremal black holes, especially in light of recent advances indicating that the classical geometry of extremal black holes is unreliable. The review of the $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ deformations is self-contained and presented from a purely field-theoretical perspective. It covers core topics such as the finite-size spectrum, thermodynamics, scattering, non-perturbative definition and the holographic dictionary for these deformations. Particular emphasis is placed upon the extended symmetries of $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ - deformed CFTs, including the perfect match between the symmetries derived via field-theoretic methods and the asymptotic symmetries of the dual spacetimes. These symmetries are also central to understanding the precise relationship between single-trace $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ - deformed CFTs and three-dimensional asymptotically linear dilaton and, respectively, warped AdS backgrounds.

Abstract: We give an explicit closed form description of the late-time near-horizon approach to dynamical extreme Reissner-Nordstrom (DERN) black holes. These are spherically symmetric dynamical solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a neutral scalar that feature: (i) a spacetime metric which tends to that of a static extreme Reissner-Nordstrom (RN), and (ii) a scalar field which displays the linear Aretakis instability ad infinitum in the non-linear theory. We employ the two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to solve explicitly for the non-linear s-wave dynamics of the four-dimensional theory near an ${\rm AdS}_2\times {\rm S}^2$ throat. For a teleologically defined black hole horizon, we impose boundary conditions on JT's dilaton field (which encodes the gravitational dynamics) and the scalar matter as follows: (i) the JT dilaton decays at late times on the ${\rm AdS}_2$ boundary to a value that corresponds to a static extreme RN in the exterior, and (ii) the scalar obeys boundary conditions characteristic of linear Aretakis behavior on ${\rm AdS}_2$. We ensure our DERN solutions are singularity-free and we note that our approach to DERN is accompanied by a final burst of outgoing scalar matter flux leaking out of the ${\rm AdS}_2$ throat. The boundary conditions we impose on the JT dilaton place its late-time boundary profile on the threshold of black hole formation with sub-extreme and super-extreme RN on either side of our DERNs.

*Konstantin Stepanyantz*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Summary of recent findings on the renormalization of supersymmetric theories, focusing on the construction of loop-invariant expressions in specific theories and addressing their scheme-dependence through explicit calculations, with a speculative note on higher-dimensional theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of renormalization in supersymmetric theories is crucial for understanding the behavior of quantum field theories, particularly in the context of avoiding quantum corrections and exploring finite theories.

Method: The authors employ an analytical approach using renormalization group equations and perform explicit three-loop calculations to verify the theoretical predictions.

Result: In ${m N}=1$ SQED+SQCD, a gauge coupling combination is identified that remains invariant under renormalization across all loops. Similarly, the MSSM exhibits two such invariant combinations. Scheme dependence is analyzed and confirmed. Additionally, a speculative approach suggests finite behavior in a 6D ${m N}=(1,0)$ SYM theory with a specific interaction setup.

Conclusion: The research contributes to the understanding of all-loop behavior in supersymmetric theories, confirming the existence of invariant combinations and exploring finite models in higher dimensions.

Abstract: Some recent all-loop results on the renormalization of supersymmetric theories are summarized and reviewed. In particular, we discuss how it is possible to construct expressions which do not receive quantum corrections in all orders for certain ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric theories. For instance, in ${\cal N}=1$ SQED+SQCD there is a renormalization group invariant combination of two gauge couplings. For the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model there are two such independent combinations of the gauge and Yukawa couplings. We investigate the scheme-dependence of these results and verify them by explicit three-loop calculations. We also argue that the all-loop exact $β$-function and the corresponding renormalization group invariant can exist in the $6D$, ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric higher derivative gauge theory interacting with a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the construction of a map between weak (gauge) and strong (string) coupling degrees of freedom for the supersymmetric Wilson line-defect in the planar N=4 Super-Yang-Mills. By analysing the Partition Functions at zero and infinite coupling, we propose a map from degrees of freedom capturing single- and singlet two-particle states at zero coupling to infinite coupling. This map predicts that the dimension of states in these particular sectors doubles as it goes from zero to infinite coupling. We test this prediction against the non-perturbative spectrum of insertions on the Wilson line obtained using integrability. In addition to already available integrability-based results, we obtain the non-perturbative scaling dimension of the simplest non-trivial operator with transverse spin about the Wilson line, thereby extending the Quantum Spectral Curve construction to such charged sectors.

Abstract: We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.

Abstract: We consider minisuperspace models with quadratic kinetic terms, assuming a flat target space and a closed Universe. We show that, upon canonical quantization of the Hamiltonian, only a restricted subset of operator orderings is consistent with the path-integral viewpoint. Remarkably, all consistent orderings are physically equivalent to all orders in $\hbar$. Specifically, each choice of path-integral measure in the definition of the wavefunction path integral uniquely determines an operator ordering and hence a corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The consistent orderings are in one-to-one correspondence with the Jacobians associated with all field redefinitions of a set of canonical degrees of freedom. For each admissible operator ordering--or equivalently, each path-integral measure--we identify a definite, positive Hilbert-space inner product. All such prescriptions define the same quantum theory, in the sense that they lead to identical physical observables. We illustrate our formalism by applying it to de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and to the Starobinsky model.

Abstract: Virtuality and coherence determine the limits of applicability of holographic concepts in QCD. In light-front quantization, the invariant mass controls the off-shell behavior of a physical process and thus provides a measure of its virtuality. In impact space, the corresponding quantity is the invariant transverse separation between quarks and gluons, $ζ$, which is identified with the holographic coordinate $z$ in holographic light-front QCD. By embedding the internal structure of hadrons and implementing an effective superconformal symmetry, the mapping between quantum states and classical gravity -- central to the holographic principle -- yields new analytic insights into the strong-interaction dynamics responsible for the emergence of a confinement scale and the observed hadron spectrum. We show that the possible emergence of a gravity dual to physical QCD is restricted to the Regge limit of high-energy scattering, where many partonic degrees of freedom participate coherently. This criterion provides a quantitative definition of the domain of applicability of holographic QCD to dynamical processes and allows it to be tested directly against experimental results. By further enforcing analyticity together with exact QCD constraints at asymptotic infinity, the holographic framework can be consistently extended beyond the infrared domain. To illustrate this procedure, we briefly discuss recent work by the HLFHS collaboration, where the effective strong coupling was extended from the Regge-limit domain, through the near-perturbative transition region, and into the ultraviolet Bjorken-limit domain. The resulting scheme provides a unified and precise nonperturbative description of the strong coupling across all virtuality scales.

Abstract: Fixed points of $N$ coupled Virasoro minimal models have recently been argued to provide large classes of compact unitary CFTs with $c>1$ and only Virasoro chiral symmetry. In this paper, we vastly increase the set of such potential irrational fixed points by considering couplings that break the maximal $G=S_N$ symmetry into various subgroups $H\subset G$. We rigorously classify all the fixed points with $N=4,5$ and do an extensive search for solutions of the beta function equations with $N\geq6$. In particular, we find non-trivial fixed points with $H=\mathbb{Z}_{N-1} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2, \, S_{M}\times S_{N-M}$ and rigorously prove that real fixed points with $H=(S_{N/2}\times S_{N/2})\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ exist for all even $N\geq6$. We also identify fixed points with finite Lie-type symmetry $H=\rm{PSL}_2(N)\subset S_N$ where $N=7,11,13$ and uncover a non-unitary fixed point with $H=M_{22}\subset S_{22}$, a sporadic Mathieu group. Along the way, we encounter conformal manifolds at leading order in perturbation theory which we resolve at sub-leading order.

TL;DR: This paper proves a double-copy relationship between open- and closed-string amplitudes in AdS space using a new noncommutative approach to twisted de Rham theory, generalizing the KLT formula in flat space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from recent evidence suggesting a connection between open- and closed-string amplitudes in AdS space, with the KLT formula as a guideline.

Method: The authors use a novel noncommutative twisted de Rham theory, which they apply to derive the double-copy kernel by computing the intersection of open-string contours in a noncommutative context.

Result: They establish the double-copy relationship by showing the kernel's inverse is the required intersection number.

Conclusion: This framework extends the KLT formula to curved AdS space, providing a deeper understanding of string amplitudes in AdS backgrounds.

Abstract: This work is motivated by the recent evidence for a double-copy relationship between open- and closed-string amplitudes in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. At present, the evidence has the form of a double-copy relation for string-amplitude building blocks, which are combined using the multiple-polylogarithm (MPL) generating functions. These generate MPLs relevant for all-order AdS curvature corrections of four-point string amplitudes. In this paper, we prove this building-block double copy using a new, noncommutative version of twisted de Rham theory. In flat space, the usual twisted de Rham theory is already known to be a natural framework to describe the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) double-copy map from open- to closed-string amplitudes, in which the KLT kernel can be computed from the intersections of the open-string amplitude integration contours. We formulate twisted de Rham theory for noncommutative-ring-valued differential forms on complex manifolds and use it to derive the intersection number of two open-string contours, which are closed in the noncommutative twisted homology sense. The inverse of this intersection number is precisely the AdS double-copy kernel for the four-point open- and closed-string generating functions.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel kinematic framework for fiber-reinforced composite materials is presented. For this purpose, we use the multiple natural configurations in conjunction with the multi-continuum theory of Bedford and Stern~(1972). Keeping the underlying physics of the proposed kinematics consistent. The proposed kinematics results in a three-term decomposition of the deformation gradient i.e. $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}^e\mathbf{F}^r_α\mathbf{F}^d_α$, where $α$ represents either the matrix or the fiber. After discussing the kinematic framework in detail, we use this new kinematic framework to characterize the damage contents associated with four damage mechanisms. These damage mechanisms are matrix cracking, fiber breakage, interfacial slip or debonding, and delamination. While the first two are derived by measuring the incompatibility of the pertinent configuration occupied by individual constituents, the latter two involve a relative displacement between either the constituents or the laminæ. The geometric interpretation corresponding to these damage mechanisms is also presented using tools from differential geometry. The derived damage contents can be used in developing an appropriate constitutive model for laminated composites undergoing damage.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce "the Schrödinger plate." This is an infinite two-dimensional linear micro-polar elastic medium, with out-of-plane degrees of freedom, lying on a linear elastic foundation of a special kind. Any free motion of the plate can be corresponded to a solution of the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a single particle in the external potential field $V$. The specific dependence of the potential $V$ on the position is taken into account in the properties of the plate elastic foundation. The governing equations of the plate are derived as equations of the two-dimensional constraint Cosserat continuum using the direct approach. The plate dynamics can be described by the classical Germain-Lagrange equation for a plate, but the strain energy is different from the one used in the classical Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. Namely, the Schrödinger plate cannot be imagined as a thin elastic body composed of an isotropic linear material. The main property of the Schrödinger plate is as follows: the mechanical energy propagates in the plate exactly in the same way as the probability density propagates according to the corresponding Schrödinger equation.

Abstract: By means of a brief review of the derivation of the causal modified Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac classical equation of motion from the renormalization of the mass in the modified equation of motion of an extended charged sphere as its radius approaches zero, it is shown that Zin and Pylak's objection that the jumps in velocity allowed across transition intervals near nonanalytic points in time of the externally applied force produce delta functions in the radiated fields is incorrect.

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to deriving approximate analytical solutions of a harmonic oscillator damped by purely nonlinear, or combinations of linear and nonlinear damping forces. Our approach is based on choosing a suitable trial solution, i.e. an ansatz, which is the product of the time-dependent amplitude and the oscillatory (trigonometric) function that has the same frequency but different initial phase, compared to the undamped case. We derive the equation for the amplitude decay using the connection of the energy dissipation rate with the power of the total damping force and the approximation that the amplitude changes slowly over time compared to the oscillating part of the ansatz. By matching our ansatz to the initial conditions, we obtain the equations for the corresponding initial amplitude and initial phase. Here we demonstrate the validity of our approach in the case of damping quadratic in velocity, Coulomb damping, and a combination of the two, i.e. in this paper we consider purely nonlinear damping, while the dynamics with combinations of damping linear in velocity and nonlinear damping will be analyzed in a follow-up paper. In the case of damping quadratic in velocity, by comparing our approximate analytical solutions with the corresponding numerical solutions, we find that our solutions excellently describe the dynamics of the oscillator in the regime of weak to moderately strong quadratic damping. In the case of Coulomb damping, as well as in the case of a combined Coulomb and quadratic damping, our approximate analytical solutions agree well with the corresponding numerical solutions until the last few half-periods of the motion. Therefore, for these two cases, we introduce improved variants of our approximate solutions which describe the dynamics well until the very end.

Abstract: Chromatic dispersion critically impacts the performance of numerous applications ranging from telecommunication links to ultrafast optics and nonlinear devices, yet fast and precise measurements are challenging, especially for short length-dispersion products. We present a fully fiber-integrated nonlinear Sagnac interferometer that exploits cascaded second-order processes to generate frequency-anticorrelated idler light and achieve odd-order dispersion cancellation without active stabilization. The measurement is intrinsically self-referenced, as the dispersion-induced phase is extracted from the interference between counter-propagating nonlinear processes within the same Sagnac loop, eliminating the need for an external reference arm or prior calibration. Operating entirely at telecom wavelengths and read out on a standard optical spectrum analyzer, the device produces instantaneous, high-visibility fringes and calibration-free spectra using dual-port normalization. We demonstrate chromatic dispersion measurements on fiber samples ranging from 25 cm to 4 km, spanning short fiber segments to long-haul links. This architecture combines self-stability, broadband compatibility, and rapid acquisition, offering a practical metrology tool for both research and industry.

### [176] [Purcell-Like Environmental Enhancement of Classical Antennas: Self and Transfer Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22363)
*Alex Krasnok*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: In wireless links, environmental effects are often described using radiation patterns, but underlying physics are better explained by two quantities: radiative damping and channel coupling. A dyadic-Green-function model was used to formulate a two-factor description of Purcell-like behavior for classical antennas. The 'self' factor measures changes in radiative damping due to the environment, while the 'transfer' factor measures changes in Tx-Rx coupling. The framework includes measurement-based extraction workflows and falsification diagnostics to prevent misinterpretation of data. The approach is applicable across a wide range of environments, from VHF to mmWave, including various platforms and engineered scattering environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the fundamental physics of wireless links, offering a quantitative framework to understand and model environmental effects on antenna performance and link budgets. This is crucial for optimizing communication systems in diverse environments.

Method: The authors used a theoretical approach based on dyadic-Green-function current-field formulations to develop a two-factor model for Purcell-like behavior. They introduced 'self' and 'transfer' factors to quantify environmental effects on radiative damping and Tx-Rx coupling. The methodology includes both theoretical derivations and measurement-based workflows for data extraction and validation.

Result: The proposed two-factor framework successfully captures environmental effects on wireless link performance. The 'self' and 'transfer' factors provide a clear way to quantify and separate these effects, improving the accuracy of link-budget calculations and enabling better design of communication systems in challenging environments.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive and validated framework for understanding and modeling environmental impacts on wireless communication links. The approach enhances the ability to predict and optimize link performance across various wireless scenarios.

Abstract: Environmental 'range boosts' in wireless links are often explained through radiation-pattern intuition, yet the underlying physics is more cleanly captured by two environment-controlled quantities: radiative damping of the radiator and \emph{channel coupling} between transmitter and receiver. Building from a dyadic-Green-function current--field formulation, we introduce an operational two-factor description of Purcell-like behavior for classical antennas. A \emph{self} factor quantifies environment-induced changes in radiative damping under an explicit excitation convention, while a \emph{transfer} factor quantifies environment-induced changes in Tx--Rx coupling. We provide measurement-aware extraction workflows (VNA $S_{11}\!\rightarrow Z_{\mathrm{in}}$ with efficiency and realized-gain accounting; link-test normalization to isolate $F_{\mathrm{tr}}$) and falsification diagnostics that prevent conflating true radiative enhancement with mismatch or added absorption. Finally, we translate self/transfer modifications into link-budget and range scalings and illustrate the framework across practical environments from VHF to mmWave, including platforms/ground planes, body proximity, field-expedient environmental radiators, terrain and passive redirection, tunnel/canyon confinement, and engineered scattering environments such as reflectarrays, metasurfaces, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS).

Abstract: This paper introduces temporal Bragg gratings as a new class of broadband, reconfigurable parametric amplifiers. We present a comprehensive investigation of power amplification in these structures, where a spatially periodic refractive index profile is modulated in time at frequencies near the Bragg condition. Through systematic numerical simulations, we explore the impact of modulation location (high-index vs. low-index layers), modulation frequency relative to the Bragg frequency, and modulation amplitude on the gain spectrum and field dynamics. We demonstrate that both high-index and low-index layer modulations can produce significant parametric amplification, with high-index modulation yielding higher gain for comparable modulation depths. The amplification is frequency-agile, with gain peaks tunable across a broad spectral range, and exhibits strong asymmetry between sub-Bragg and supra-Bragg regimes, the former requires substantially stronger modulation for comparable gain. In the extreme sub-Bragg limit, the system transitions from discrete sideband amplification to a broadband gain continuum at high frequencies, explained by multi-phase-matching of parametric processes. These results provide a unified framework for designing dynamically reconfigurable optical amplifiers, tunable frequency converters, and broadband light sources using temporally modulated photonic crystals, offering new pathways toward active, agile, and integrable photonic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore the nonlinear optical properties of AgI thin films, specifically focusing on the effects of crystal phase and morphology, and their potential applications in nonlinear optics and quantum photonic devices.

Method: The researchers used polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon photoluminescence (2PPL) spectroscopy to study the nonlinear optical properties of AgI thin films. They grew the films using physical vapor deposition and characterized the crystal phases (ZbAgI and WzAgI) and morphologies (triangular flakes and rod-shaped samples). Polarization analysis was performed using second- and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities to determine the symmetry of the nonlinear responses.

Result: The results revealed that triangular ZbAgI (111) flakes exhibit sixfold SHG symmetry and isotropic 2PPL emission, while rod-shaped WzAgI (101) samples display twofold symmetric patterns in both SHG and 2PPL. This anisotropic behavior is explained by polarization analysis using second- and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities.

Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that AgI can be used as a promising halide semiconductor platform for phase-selective nonlinear optics and quantum photonic applications, as the crystal phase and morphology significantly influence the nonlinear optical properties of the films.

Abstract: Silver iodide (AgI) thin films offer a compelling platform for studying nonlinear optical phenomena due to their intrinsic noncentrosymmetric lattice and direct band gap. Here, we investigate the nonlinear optical properties of AgI thin films grown by physical vapor deposition that selectively produce zincblende (\zbAgI) and wurtzite (\wzAgI) phases. Using a combination of polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon photoluminescence (2PPL) spectroscopy, we identify clear phase- and morphology-dependent anisotropic nonlinear responses. Triangular \zbAgI $(111)$ flakes exhibit sixfold SHG symmetry and isotropic 2PPL emission, while rod-shaped \wzAgI $(101)$ samples display twofold-symmetric patterns in both SHG and 2PPL, which are explained by polarization analysis using second- and third- order nonlinear susceptibilities. These findings establish AgI as a promising halide semiconductor platform for phase-selective nonlinear optics and quantum photonic applications.

Abstract: The energy-transfer efficiency of the natural photosynthesis system seems to be perfectly optimized during the evolution for millions of years. However, how to enhance the efficiency in the artificial light-harvesting systems is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate the energy-transfer process in the photosystem I (PSI). When there is no effective coupling between the outer antenna (OA) and the reaction center (RC), the two light-harvesting networks are disconnected and thus the energy transfer is inefficient. In order to repair these disconnected networks, we introduce a bridge with three sites between them. We find that by modulating the level structure of the 3-site bridge to be resonant, the energy transfer via the dark state will be enhanced and even outperform the original PSI. Our discoveries may shed light on the designing mechanism of artificial light-harvesting systems.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative numerical analysis of Gold (Au) and high-index semiconductor nanoparticles for refractive index sensing in the visible range. While Au nanoparticles demonstrate high sensitivity ($\approx 150$ nm per refractive index unit), their performance is constrained by ohmic losses. In contrast, high-index dielectrics are shown to exhibit comparable extinction efficiencies driven exclusively by scattering, thereby minimizing thermal losses. Multipolar decomposition reveals that semiconductors support simultaneous electric and magnetic Mie resonances, the interference of which enables directional scattering phenomena unattainable in small metallic particles. These findings suggest that high-index nanostructures offer a robust, low-loss alternative to plasmonics for advanced sensing applications.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Emerging technique using deformable microlaser materials for sensing biological forces has limitations, but recent synthesis of spherical whispering gallery mode microbead lasers from a softer material and organic dye molecules overcomes these limitations with high force detection capability and stability in aqueous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of sensing techniques for biological forces is crucial for advancing biomedical applications. Current methods using conventional fluorescent probes and imaging-based techniques have limitations, such as size, specificity, and sensitivity, which motivates further exploration of alternative approaches.

Method: The researchers synthesized spherical whispering gallery mode microbead lasers from a commercially available elastomer material by doping it with organic dye molecules. This process was carried out in a microfluidic system with high viscosity, allowing the microbeads to achieve excellent lasing characteristics with low lasing thresholds.

Result: The experiments demonstrated that the newly synthesized microlasers exhibit direct proportionality between lasing characteristics and applied external force. Additionally, the measured Young's modulus confirmed that these microlasers are very soft and capable of detecting higher forces compared to previous oil droplet-based microlasers. The softness and non-toxic nature of the material also enable stable operation in aqueous environments.

Conclusion: This study provides a novel synthetic method for creating highly sensitive, deformable microlaser sensors that leverage the physical properties of soft materials and organic dye molecules, offering significant advantages in force sensitivity and applicability in biomedical settings, particularly for sensing within tissues and small animals.

Abstract: Sensing biological forces with microscopic lasers is an emerging technique that offers significant advantages over conventional fluorescent probes and imaging-based techniques. However, the limited availability of suitable deformable or elastic microlaser materials is restricting the scale of forces that can be detected which strongly narrows their overall applicability. Here, we describe the synthesis of spherical whispering gallery mode microbead lasers from a commercially available elastomer material in a microfluidic system with high viscosity. Upon doping with organic dye molecules, the microbeads show excellent lasing characteristics with low lasing thresholds. Measurements of the mechanical properties reveal that the lasing characteristics are directly proportional to the applied external force. The measured Young's modulus confirms that the newly synthesized microlasers are very soft and can detect higher forces than previously applied deformable microlasers made from oil droplets. Furthermore, we show that elastomer microlasers are non-toxic and stable in aqueous environments, making them ideally suited for sensing forces inside tissues and small animals.

Motivation: The current TPL technology faces challenges in industrial scalability!

Method: Utilizes a DMD to temporally focus laser pulses on a programmable line, achieving high resolution and real-time streaming.

Result: Achieved centimeter-scale 3D structures with high precision and eliminated stitching defects.

Conclusion: Line-TF TPL enables practical, cost-effective large-scale 3D fabrication, opening new possibilities for complex optical and biomedical applications.

Abstract: Achieving fast and continuous fabrication of large-scale complex 3D structures is key to unlocking industrial-scale adoption of two-photon lithography (TPL). Despite substantial improvement in peak optical patterning rates enabled by recent parallel exposure strategies, the practical fabrication rate of TPL for large structures remains low. This gap is primarily attributed to the mismatched bandwidth among toolpath generation, data transferring, and laser patterning, and the stop-and-go operation for part stitching etc. Here, we present a line-illumination temporal focusing TPL (Line-TF TPL) solution that, for the first time, demonstrates true continuous 3D nanolithography with full-bandwidth data streaming, grayscale voxel tuning, and cost-effective large-scale fabrication capability. To achieve the goal, we use a digital micromirror device (DMD) to temporally focus femtosecond laser pulses into a programmable line with enhanced 3D resolution, pixel-level grayscale control, and a high-refresh rate (>10 kHz), realizing continuous fabrication at a hardware-limited maximum rate. Specifically, we fabricated centimeter-scale 3D structures with sub-diffraction features down to 75 nm laterally and 99 nm axially. Our method eliminates stitching defects by continuous scanning and grayscale stitching; and provides real-time pattern streaming at a bandwidth that is one order of magnitude higher than previous TPL systems. The line-scanning strategy also substantially lowers the pulse-energy requirement, hence the cost for parallel TPL; and maximizes the machine uptime through continuous operation, both of which are critical metrics for industrialization. Finally, we demonstrated centimeter-scale artworks, fine 3D features, and complex miniaturized optics, revealing the Line-TF TPL's large-scale application potential in photonic packaging, metamaterial discovery, and biomedicine.

Abstract: We demonstrate a compact stabilization scheme for terahertz (THz) sources by exploiting the complementary advantages of microresonator-based optical frequency combs (microcombs) and resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs). A microcomb-driven photomixing THz signal is employed as the master for injection locking of an RTD, enabling faithful transfer of the microcomb stability into the RTD. Using this approach, the free-running RTD linewidth of 50 MHz was narrowed to 165 Hz, while the single-sideband phase noise reached -80 dBc/Hz at a 10 kHz offset with a locking range of 80 MHz. Compared with conventional electronic frequency multiplier or fiber-comb-based schemes, this method avoids high-order frequency multiplication and associated noise penalties, offering a compact and practical alternative. The dual functionality of linewidth narrowing and power scalability highlights the potential of microcomb-assisted injection locking as a route toward chip-scale, spectrally pure THz sources for beyond-5G/6G wireless communication and radar, with prospects for future extension to time-frequency metrology and precision sensing.

Abstract: The development of sophisticated integrated photonic circuits demands microresonators that combine exceptional optical confinement with dynamic operational flexibility. Here, we demonstrate a racetrack resonator on the thin-film lithium niobate platform that achieves an electro-optically tunable coupling strength while maintaining a stable, high intrinsic Q factor on the order of 10^6. By incorporating a Mach-Zehnder interferometer into the coupling region, the device facilitates a continuous and reversible transition across the entire coupling spectrum from under-coupling and critical coupling to deep over-coupling. To ensure high spectral purity, we employ Euler bends to facilitate an adiabatic transition between the straight and curved waveguide sections. This design effectively suppresses the excitation of higher-order modes, resulting in a clean transmission spectrum characterized by exclusive fundamental mode operation. At the critical coupling point, the resonator exhibits a high extinction ratio exceeding 30 dB. The integration of stable ultra-high Q, single-mode purity, and full-range coupling reconfigurability positions this device as a vital component for adaptive microwave photonics, high-efficiency nonlinear optics, and programmable quantum photonic networks.

Abstract: The design of chiral metasurfaces with tailored optical properties remains a central challenge in nanophotonics due to the highly nonlinear relationship between geometry and chiroptical response. Machine-learning-assisted optimization pipelines have recently emerged as efficient tools to accelerate this process, yet their performance strongly depends on the choice of neural-network (NN) architecture. In this work, we integrate the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm into an established deep-learning optimization framework for dielectric chiral metasurfaces. NEAT autonomously evolves both network topology and connection weights, enabling task-specific architectures without manual tuning, whereas the reinforcement-learning strategy in our framework evolves knowledge of the solution space and fine-tunes a model's weights in parallel. Using a pipeline-produced dataset of 9,600 simulated GaP metasurface geometries, we evaluate NEAT under varying input dimensionalities, feature-scaling methods, and data sizes. With standardized feature scaling yielding the most consistent performance for both examined output dimensionalities, the relatively compact NEAT-evolved NN models, when integrated into the full optimization pipeline, achieve similar or improved predictive accuracy and generalization compared to initially employed dense few-layer perceptrons. Accordingly, these resource-efficient models successfully perform inference of metasurfaces exhibiting strong circular dichroism in the visible spectrum, allowing for transfer learning between simulated and experimental data. This approach demonstrates a scalable path toward adaptive, self-configuring machine-learning frameworks for automated photonic design both standalone and as building block for agentic artificial intelligence (AI).

Abstract: Structured light, in which the amplitude, phase, and polarization of an optical field are deliberately tailored in space and time, has enabled unprecedented control over optical fields, paving the way for diverse applications across photonics and optical engineering. However, the prevailing design philosophy, which predominantly focuses on converting a single fixed input into a single desired output, relies on tunability to achieve time-division multiplexing rather than intrinsic design, and is fundamentally incompatible with wavelength-division multiplexing. Here, we propose a general framework for designing structured matter capable of achieving multiple input-output relations simultaneously, thereby enabling passive devices to realize both time-division and wavelength-division multiplexing. Using Stokes skyrmions, which have recently gained attention for their topological properties and promising applications in modern optical communication and computing, as an example, we demonstrate that a simple retarder-diattenuator-retarder cascade can be designed to simultaneously satisfy three arbitrary input-output relations, enabling diverse functionalities within a single passive element. This approach enables complex and multiplexed manipulation of topological numbers, paving the way for high-dimensional on-chip photonic computing based on optical skyrmions.

Abstract: Direct-view LED displays are widely adopted in large-format applications due to their high luminance and reliability. However, visual comfort and accurate performance evaluation remain challenging due to the complex interaction between pixel luminance, human visual perception, and measurement artifacts. In this work, we introduce a novel 2D imaging luminance meter that replicates key optical parameters of the human eye, including entrance pupil size and angular resolution, to assess perceived pixel luminance. We report comprehensive measurements across various visual field angles and distances and establish a refined luminance metric that aligns with foveal vision standards (1/120 degree). Furthermore, a new method to quantify and mitigate stray light effects significantly improves measurement precision by reducing luminance overestimation from 7\% to 2\%. Our findings provide a foundation for optimizing LED display design for perceptual comfort and advancing standardization in pixel luminance evaluation.

TL;DR: Adiabatic topological pumping has a fundamental speed limit due to the instantaneous adiabatic condition, but we developed a new approach called global adiabaticity that allows faster, compact, and robust adiabatic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to overcome the speed limitations of traditional adiabatic methods in topological pumping, paving the way for more efficient energy and information transport systems.

Method: We introduced a global adiabatic criterion (GAC) based on the root-mean-square of nonadiabaticity and a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion. Experimentally, we used femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays with scalable power-law coupling modulation.

Result: Our accelerated scheme achieved >0.95 fidelity with a fivefold reduction in device length compared to conventional methods. It also showed linear scaling with system size and maintained robust performance across >400 nm bandwidth.

Conclusion: This research establishes a universal design rule for fast, compact, and reliable adiabatic devices in both quantum and classical platforms, demonstrating promising applications in energy and information transport.

Abstract: Adiabatic topological pumping promises robust transport of energy and information, but its speed is fundamentally limited by the instantaneous adiabatic condition, which demands prohibitively slow parameter variations. Here we develop a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC), which sets an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square value of nonadiabaticity factor. We further introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion, which minimizes spatial inhomogeneity and allows us to safely increase the mean nonadiabaticity. Experimentally, we implement this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves >0.95 fidelity over a fivefold reduced device length compared to the conventional scheme, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with the system size, and maintains robust performance across a >400 nm bandwidth. This principle of GAC provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across quantum and classical topological platforms.

Abstract: The remarkable advancements in our capacity to synthesise structured light have facilitated the generation of any desired optical landscapes and even controlling the spatial distribution of light propagating through optically complex media such as multimode fibres. The availability of precisely defined structured light at the extremity of an exceedingly narrow and flexible cable holds the potential to stimulate a diverse range of highly sought-after applications, encompassing rapid communication, quantum computing, and, notably, imaging. What we lack in reaching these aspirations is the resilience of such light transport to deformations of the waveguide. Although recent theoretical investigations have delineated the attributes of ideal multimode fibres capable of deformation-enduring conveyance of structured light, tangible fibres possessing this indispensable trait to a practical extent remain elusive. Our study takes a deep dive into the precision of commercially available multimode fibres with the highest probability of demonstrating the phenomenon. We identified minuscule imperfections in their refractive index distribution, examined how these affect light transport when the fibre is deformed, and studied their implications for imaging applications. Our investigation has confirmed that these imperfections are indeed responsible for the undesirable alterations introduced into the output structured light fields during bending. Finally, as an alternative to standard graded-index fibres, manufactured by drawing silica-based preforms, we present narrow multimode waveguides in which the refractive-index profile has been established by ion exchange. These waveguides indeed exhibit previously unseen resilience of structured light transport even under severe deformation conditions and aptly fulfil the requirements of imaging applications.

Abstract: Structured optical beams possess rich spatial features that are commonly characterized using entropic measures of field complexity. However, such measures do not directly quantify the operational usefulness of optical structure for parameter estimation and sensing. Here we introduce Fisher information as an operational metric to assess the metrological content of structured optical fields. By treating the measured intensity distribution as a statistical object, we define Fisher information with respect to physically relevant parameters, such as transverse displacement. We demonstrate that optical modes with comparable Shannon entropy can exhibit markedly different Fisher information, revealing sensitivity features associated with nodal structure and local curvature. Using Hermite--Gaussian modes as minimal test cases, we show that increasing modal order systematically enhances Fisher information. We then extend the analysis to two widely used families in structured light: Laguerre--Gaussian vortex beams and finite-energy Bessel--Gauss beams. Across these representative families, Fisher information provides a unified and experimentally accessible criterion for comparing structured optical fields in sensing applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Photonic topological insulators (PTIs) offer robust platforms for light manipulation, but reconfigurable control of their topological properties without degrading performance remains a major challenge. While phase-change materials (PCMs) provide large refractive index modulation, widely used materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) have been successfully deployed in commercial applications including optical data storage. However, they exhibit significant optical absorption in their crystalline state, which poses a challenge for transmissive photonic devices such as PTIs where high transparency is essential. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by integrating the ultra-low-loss PCM antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) onto a silicon-based 2D PTI. We achieve submicron-scale selective patterning of Sb2Se3 on a photonic crystal for the first time, and demonstrate a topological phase transition induced by the material phase change. Owing to the transparency of Sb2Se3 in both its amorphous and crystalline states, a high Q-factor on the order of 10^3 is preserved-representing nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous GST-based devices. This work resolves the absorption-loss bottleneck in reconfigurable PTIs and paves the way for practical, low-loss, tunable topological photonic devices.

Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework for the transfer of angular momentum from a Bessel wave of twisted light to a fully absorbing disk of finite radius. Exact expressions for the orbital angular momentum density and the total angular momentum transmitted to the disk are obtained for both paraxial and nonparaxial regimes. By varying the beam wavelength, polarization, and cone angle, several experimentally relevant regimes of angular momentum transfer are identified. In the extreme nonparaxial regime, the absorbed angular momentum displays a staircase-like dependence on the object size, which can be interpreted as a geometric Hall-type response of the twisted field. The results suggest potential applications for controlled angular momentum transfer and size-sensitive probing of absorbing objects.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using analyzing and generating polarization states with an optimized instrument matrix to improve accuracy, precision, and speed in polarization measurements. While this works well for rotating-waveplate systems, it becomes challenging for liquid-crystal-based systems due to their additional degrees of freedom. The authors introduce additional performance measures based on alternative norms and error distributions to suppress errors in measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving polarization measurement accuracy, precision, and speed is a critical goal in optical systems. Liquid crystal-based devices offer flexibility in polarization state generation, but optimizing their measurement schemes remains complex. This paper addresses these challenges and introduces novel performance measures to enhance measurement robustness.

Method: The authors employ an approach involving optimizing the $	ext{l}^2$-condition number of the instrument matrix for standard rotating-waveplate systems. They then extend their analysis to liquid-crystal-based systems, introducing performance measures based on alternative norms and using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate error distributions. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of these new metrics.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the additional performance measures derived from alternative norms reduce measurement errors, leading to more robust and efficient polarization measurements. Experimental results validate the superiority of these optimized schemes over traditional methods.

Conclusion: This study provides a framework for optimizing polarization measurements using alternative norms and Monte Carlo simulations. It paves the way for future research in designing advanced measurement schemes for liquid crystal-based polarization devices, potentially leading to significant improvements in optical systems with enhanced performance.

Abstract: A standard procedure to achieve accurate, precise, and fast polarization measurement is to choose analyzing and generating polarization states that yield an $\ell^2$-condition number optimized instrument matrix. This strategy works well for rotating-waveplate systems, where the accessible polarization states trace a curve on the Poincaré sphere and the corresponding optimization problem is generally well posed. However, it becomes degenerate for liquid-crystal-based systems, which can generate arbitrary polarization states, and whose additional degrees of freedom allow the optimization of metrics beyond the $\ell^2$-condition number. Leveraging this unique advantage of liquid-crystal polarimeters, we introduce additional performance measures derived from alternative norms and error distributions computed via Monte Carlo simulations to inform the design of measurement schemes. We then experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness in suppressing errors, paving the way for more robust and efficient polarization measurements.

Abstract: Understanding the intricate interplay between soot dynamics and chemical reactions within catalytic diesel particulate filters (CDPF) is crucial for enhancing both filtration efficiency and regeneration performance. In this paper, we establish a unified pore-scale multiphysics model based on the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to comprehensively resolve the transport, deposition, and oxidation of soot. Distinguishing itself from conventional empirical correlations and stochastic-based approximations, the system models soot deposition through fundamental physical principles, integrating elastic deformation and surface adhesion mechanics at the particle-wall interface. Simultaneously, it incorporates a robust oxidation model that accounts for the competitive kinetics of both $\textrm{O}_2$ and $\textrm{NO}_2$ pathways, enabling comprehensive coverage of all CDPF operating regimes. Validated against three classical benchmark cases, the model demonstrates superior accuracy in capturing interfacial mass transfer and particle-wall interactions. Simulation under a typical CDPF low-temperature operating condition emphasizes the pivotal role of $\textrm{NO}_2$ and catalyst in promoting regeneration and reveals complex synergistic and competitive effects between distinct reaction pathways. Notably, the reaction rate of direct $\textrm{O}_2$ pathway is accelerated by a factor of 87 in the presence of the catalyst. For ultra-fine soot particles ($50~\mathrm{nm}$), the Brownian motion and thermophoretic forces directly dictate the deposition efficiency. Their strong thermal sensitivity also underscores the necessity for an integrated soot transport-deposition-oxidation framework.

Result: The simulations revealed base-dependent ionization mechanisms, directed charge migration pathways, and the role of electronic coherences in subfemtosecond processes. The proposed Q-attosecond Microscope could observe these phenomena with high temporal and spatial resolution.

Conclusion: This research paves the way for future experiments that could manipulate DNA structure using light, with significant implications for chemical reactivity, DNA repair processes, and personalized medicine.

Abstract: How quantum electron and nuclei motions affect biomolecular chemical reactions remains a central challengeable question at the interface of quantum chemistry and biology. Ultrafast charge migration in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has long been hypothesized to play a critical role in photochemistry, genome stability, and long-range biomolecular signaling, however, direct real-time observation of these electronic processes has remained elusive. Here, we present a theoretical investigation and propose the concept of future experimental measurements of laser-driven charge dynamics in the canonical DNA nucleobase pairs thymine_adenine and cytosine_guanine. Attosecond-resolved simulations employing high-level ab initio methods reveal base-dependent ionization mechanisms, directional charge migration pathways, and electronic coherences that govern sub-femtosecond redistribution of electron density across hydrogen-bonded nucleobase interfaces. Accordingly, we propose the concept of a quantum attosecond scanning electron microscope, termed the quantum attomicroscope (Q-attomicroscope), a capable of imaging photoinduced quantum chemistry reactions in attosecond temporal resolution and sub-nanometer spatial precision. As a proof of principle, we propose to image the charge migrations dynamics in DNA which we studied theoretically. Together, our preceptive bridges theory, instrumentation, and control, outlining a pathway toward laser mediated manipulation of DNA structure with implications for repair processes, chemical reactivity, and future personalized medicine.

Motivation: This study extends traditional models by incorporating vibrational motion and a rotationally invariant system-bath model to better understand quantum thermal effects in molecular systems.

Method: The researchers derived numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (MO-HEOM) from a molecular orbital foundation to model the system.

Result: The analysis of hydrogen molecules and ions with vibrational degrees of freedom confirmed the linear absorption spectra observed experimentally.

Conclusion: This advanced modeling framework provides a more accurate understanding of quantum thermal effects in molecules with complex structures.

Abstract: Studies of quantum thermal effects on molecular excitation dynamics have often relied on oversimplified models, such as energy eigenstates or low-dimensional potentials, which fail to capture the complexity of real chemical systems. In reality, molecules are spatially extended and embedded in anisotropic environments, where molecular orbitals (MOs) play a central role in determining quantum behavior. To advance beyond these limitations, we propose a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model within the MO framework, with explicit inclusion of intramolecular vibrational motion. From this MO foundation, we derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion (MO-HEOM). As a demonstration, we analyze hydrogen molecules and hydrogen molecular ions with vibrational degrees of freedom, revealing their linear absorption spectra.

Abstract: The discovery of novel odorant molecules is key for the fragrance and flavor industries, yet efficiently navigating the vast chemical space to identify structures with desirable olfactory properties remains a significant challenge. Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline. Structural analysis via Bemis-Murcko scaffolds reveals that 74.4\% of candidates possess novel core frameworks distinct from the training data, indicating the model performs extensive chemical space exploration beyond simple derivatization of known odorants.

Abstract: Polymers-macromolecular systems composed of repeating chemical units-constitute the molecular foundation of living organisms, while their synthetic counterparts drive transformative advances across medicine, consumer products, and energy technologies. While machine learning (ML) models have been trained on millions of quantum chemical atomistic simulations for materials and/or small molecular structures to enable efficient, accurate, and transferable predictions of chemical properties, polymers have largely not been included in prior datasets due to the computational expense of high quality electronic structure calculations on representative polymeric structures. Here, we address this shortcoming with the creation of the Open Polymers 2026 (OPoly26) dataset, which contains more than 6.57 million density functional theory (DFT) calculations on up to 360 atom clusters derived from polymeric systems, comprising over 1.2 billion total atoms. OPoly26 captures the chemical diversity that makes polymers intrinsically tunable and versatile materials, encompassing variations in monomer composition, degree of polymerization, chain architectures, and solvation environments. We show that augmenting ML model training with the OPoly26 dataset improves model performance for polymer prediction tasks. We also publicly release the OPoly26 dataset to help further the development of ML models for polymers, and more broadly, strive towards universal atomistic models.

### [203] [Isotope Effects and the Negative Thermal Expansion Phenomena in Ice and Water](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23247)
*B. I. Min,J. -S. Kang*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the unusual thermal properties of ice and water, focusing on the negative thermal expansion and abnormal volume isotope effects. Using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and Lindemann criterion, the authors trace these phenomena to quantum mechanical processes involving nuclear motion and zero-point energy, revealing the role of hydrogen bonding and phonons in H2O's unique behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the thermal properties of water and ice is crucial for fields ranging from geology to materials science. This paper seeks to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving these unusual behaviors.

Method: The authors employ the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the Lindemann criterion to analyze the isotope effects in the NTE and melting properties of ice and water. This method allows them to examine the competition between zero-point energy phonons, thermal phonons, and hydrogen bonding, all of which are rooted in nuclear quantum mechanical processes.

Result: The study demonstrates that the unusual isotope effects observed in ice and water stem from the interplay of quantum mechanical processes, including the competition between zero-point energy and thermal phonons, as well as the role of hydrogen bonding. This provides a deeper understanding of the thermal behavior of water and ice.

Conclusion: By linking the observed phenomena to quantum mechanical effects, the paper sheds light on the fundamental physics governing the behavior of ice and water. This research not only enhances our theoretical understanding but also has potential applications in various fields where water's unique properties are crucial.

Abstract: H2O is a unique substance with exceptional thermal properties arising from the subtle interplay between its electronic, phononic, and structural degrees of freedom. Of particular interest in H2O are the negative thermal expansion (NTE) phenomena, observed in its solid phase (ice) at low temperature, and in its liquid phase (water) near the freezing temperature. Furthermore, ice and water exhibit the abnormal volume isotope effect (VIE), where volume expansions occur when replacing H with its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). In order to capture more conceptual and intuitive understanding of intriguing NTE and VIE phenomena in ice and water, we have explored isotope effects in their NTE and melting properties by employing a type of Born-Oppenheimer-approximation approach and the Lindemann criterion. Our findings demonstrate that unusual isotope effects in these phenomena stem from competition between zero-point-energy phonons, thermal phonons, and the hydrogen bonding in H2O. All these components originate from nuclear quantum mechanical (QM) processes, revealing that QM physics plays a crucial role in the seemingly classical ice/water systems.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了RAgAl系列化合物在高温高压条件下的复杂磁性行为，为理解其材料特性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: In order to further investigate the magnetic state of the RAgAl series, the magnetization measurements on the TbAgAl compound from this series have been extended to higher fields of 12 Tesla in the temperature range 2K-300K. The electrical resistivity in the temperature range 2-300K has been measured up to fields of 9 Tesla. The field dependence of magnetization at low temperatures suggests an antiferromagnetic state undergoing a metamagnetic transition to a ferromagnetic state above the critical field. The observation of large coercivity (unlike other compounds in the RAgAl series) and non-saturation of magnetization indicates a disordered magnetic state having both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. The presence of competing interactions leading to a disordered state is also supported by transport measurements and is attributed presumably to the layered structure of the compound.

Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions in low-dimensional quantum materials give rise to emergent bound states such as excitons and trions, which play a central role in correlated electronic phases. In quasi-one-dimensional systems, equilibrium photoemission studies have reported signatures of trions, suggesting an unusually robust state, as opposed to conventional semiconductors where trions typically appear only as excited states stabilized by carrier doping. Here, we show that optical excitation of undoped Ta2NiS5 - a correlated quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor - generates a pronounced and long-lived trion population, demonstrating that such states can be dynamically induced even in the absence of doping. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we track the dynamics of a bright, localized in-gap state that emerges following photoexcitation and identify it as a transient trion population. We uncover an unconventional trion formation pathway and a fluence-dependent competition between trions and excitons. These findings extend ultrafast quasiparticle photoemission spectroscopy to complex bound states in bulk quantum materials, enabling the dynamical control of charged and neutral excitations.

Abstract: Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for studying how both the Kondo effect and quantum fluctuations compete with the magnetic exchange interactions that drive magnetic ordering. Here, we investigate the effect of tuning the heavy-fermion compound CePdIn, which crystallizes in the geometrically frustrated ZrNiAl-type structure, using applied magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. At ambient pressure, CePdIn exhibits two magnetic transitions, one at $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 1.65$ K and another at $T_{\rm{M}} \approx 1.15$ K, which are both suppressed by applied $c$-axis fields. Upon applying pressure in zero magnetic field, there is a non-monotonic evolution of $T_{\rm{N}}$, which decreases to 0.8 K at 2.3 GPa, before abruptly increasing to 1.5 K at 2.6 GPa. At higher pressures, $T_{\rm{N}}$ has a weak pressure dependence, and vanishes near 5 GPa. Together with the high-pressure phase being more robust to applied fields, these results suggest two distinct antiferromagnetic phases in CePdIn, which are separated near 2.6 GPa, and this change may be driven by the evolution of the underlying electronic structure due to enhanced Kondo hybridization under pressure.

Abstract: Kagome metals exhibit rich correlated-electron physics, yet a systematic understanding of the degree of correlation across transition-metal species remains elusive. Using density-functional theory plus multi-orbital slave-spin mean-field theory, we investigate electronic correlations in the Ti-, V-, and Cr-based 135 compounds with Sb and Bi pnictogens. We find that the significantly stronger degree of correlation of the Cr-based materials compared to Ti and V can only be explained through the synergy of two effects: the larger electron filling of the $d$-shell and the reduced characteristic kinetic energy. We put forward that the substitution of Sb with Bi strengthens correlations in all compounds and make the prediction that the-yet-to-be-synthesized CsCr$_3$Bi$_5$ must be the most strongly correlated member of the entire family. These findings provide a quantitative, band-structure-based framework for understanding and predicting correlation strength in Kagome metals.

Abstract: The nominal divide between $p$- and $d$-electron systems often obscures a deep underlying unity in condensed matter physics. This review elucidates the orbital homology between the $p$ and $t_{2g}$ orbital manifolds, establishing the correspondence that extends from minimal model Hamiltonians to the complex behaviors of real quantum materials. We demonstrate that despite their distinct atomic origins, these orbitals host nearly identical hopping physics and spin-orbit coupling, formalized through an effective ${l=1}$ angular momentum algebra for the $t_{2g}$ case. This equivalence allows one to transpose physical intuition and theoretical models developed for $p$-orbital systems directly onto the more complex $t_{2g}$ materials, and vice versa. We showcase how this paradigm provides a unified understanding of emergent phenomena, including non-trivial band topology, itinerant ferromagnetism, and unconventional superconductivity, across a wide range of platforms, from transition metal compounds, two-dimensional oxide heterostructures, and iron-based superconductors, to $p$-orbital ultracold gases. Ultimately, this $p$-$t_{2g}$ homology serves not only as a tool for interpretation but also as a robust design principle for engineering novel quantum states.

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized nickelates has renewed interest in the broken-symmetry states of their ambient-pressure parent phases, where a density-wave (DW) order emerges and competes with superconductivity, but its microscopic origin remains unresolved. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\rm DW} \approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates.

Abstract: We present the combination of a complex-time tensor-network impurity solver with an analytic continuation scheme based on exponential fitting as an efficient framework for single and multi-orbital dynamical mean-field calculations. By performing time-evolution along a complex-time contour, the approach balances computational cost with the difficulty of spectral recovery, offering greater flexibility than methods confined to the real or imaginary axis. By complementing the complex-time evolution with an exponential fitting scheme, we faithfully extract real-time information at negligible cost. The resulting method obtains high-resolution spectra at a significantly lower computational cost than real-time evolution, offering a promising tool for ab initio studies of strongly correlated materials.

Abstract: The Pomeranchuk effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon where liquid helium-3 (3He) solidifies under specific pressures, not when cooled, but when heated. This behaviour originates from the magnetic entropy of nuclear spins, suggesting a magnetic field should influence it. However, its detailed response to magnetic fields remains elusive due to the small nuclear magneton of 3He and lack of analogous fermion systems. Here, we show that an electron system also exhibit the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, unlike conventional electron systems where a field melts an electron solid into a metal. Remarkably, the electron system displays a reentrant liquid state in ultrahigh fields. These responses are explained by changes in magnetic entropy and magnetisation, extending the underlying physics to 3He. Our findings clarify magnetic-field impact on the Pomeranchuk effect and open avenues for magnetic control of chemical interactions.

Abstract: Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.

Abstract: At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency {\it anomalous} CSL can be realized in Swap Models, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap Models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We have used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the diamagnetic response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.

Abstract: The experimental discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in tunable moiré superlattices has sparked intense interest in exploring the interplay between topological order and symmetry breaking phases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive numerical study of this interplay through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations on a minimal two-band lattice model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at filling $ν=-2/3$. We find robust FQAH ground states and provide clear numerical evidences for anyon excitations with fractional charge and pronounced real-space density modulations, directly supporting the recently proposed anyon density-wave halo picture. We also map out the displacement field dependent phase diagram, uncovering a rich landscape of charge ordered states emerging from the FQAH, including a quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC) with an integer quantized Hall conductance. We expect our work to inspire further research interest of intertwined correlated topological phases in moiré systems.

Abstract: We present a diffuse neutron and x-ray scattering study of structural, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations in the electrical insulator La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$. This lamellar nickelate is an isostructural analogue of the high-temperature cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, for which recent experiments uncovered evidence for unusual structural and superconducting fluctuations indicative of rare-region physics due to inherent inhomogeneity unrelated to common point disorder effects. We find closely analogous nanoscale orthorhombic fluctuation behavior in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$, including exponential scaling of the diffuse scattering intensity and power-law scaling of the characteristic length with relative temperature. Moreover, our neutron and x-ray scattering data reveal similar behavior for short-range magnetic and charge fluctuations above the respective ordering temperatures. These observations indicate that rare-region effects are a generic feature of perovskite-related structures and lead to universal fluctuations of both structural and electronic degrees of freedom over extended temperature ranges.

Abstract: We present a symbolic implementation of recursion method for the dynamics of strongly correlated fermions on one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices. Focusing on two paradigmatic models, interacting spinless fermions and the Hubbard model, we first directly confirm that the universal operator growth hypothesis holds for interacting fermionic systems, manifested by the linear growth of Lanczos coefficients. Equipped with symbolically computed Lanczos coefficients and knowledge of their asymptotics, we are able to compute infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions up to times long enough for thermalization to occur. In turn, the knowledge of autocorrelation functions unlocks transport properties. We compute with high precision the charge diffusion constant over a broad range of interaction strengths, $V$. Surprisingly, we observe that these results are well described by a simple functional dependence $\sim 1/V^2$ universally valid both for small and large $V$. All results are obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our results highlight the promise of symbolic computational paradigm where the most costly step is performed once and outputs symbolic results that can further be used multiple times to easily compute physical quantities for specific values of model parameters.

Abstract: Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.

Here we propose and analyze an alternative route to a fast $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for two fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice based on optimized, time-dependent control of the short and long lattice depths. The gate is implemented by transiently releasing the atoms into a quasi-harmonic confinement centered between the two sites. With an appropriately chosen contact interaction strength, a controlled collision accumulates the exchange phase required for $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and generates entanglement. We employ a continuum, time-dependent Schrödinger-equation simulation that goes beyond a two-site Fermi--Hubbard description and benchmark it against experimentally implemented tunneling-based protocols, reproducing the observed single-particle tunneling and spin-exchange dynamics. For experimentally accessible lattice depths, we find that the proposed gate operates in $\sim 21\,μ\mathrm{s}$, more than an order of magnitude faster than tunneling-based implementations, while achieving fidelities $\gtrsim 99\%$. We further analyze sensitivity to lattice-depth variations and show that a composite sequence improves robustness. Our results establish fast, collision-mediated entangling gates in superlattices as a promising building block for scalable neutral-atom quantum computation.

### [219] [A critical review of nanoplastic bioaccumulation data and a unified toxicokinetic model: from teleosts to human brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22593)
*Alfonso M. Ganan-Calvo*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a mechanistically grounded toxicokinetic model linking short-term nanoplastics uptake in laboratory studies to chronic, organ-specific bioaccumulation in humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between short-term nanoplastics uptake and long-term human bioaccumulation is critical for developing safer environmental and food matrices.

Method: A two-compartment model was developed to represent systemic circulation and organ-level retention. A reanalysis of six independent datasets from teleost fish using normalized variables revealed a universal governing parameter.

Result: The study identified a single dimensionless parameter, 'systemic excretion capacity,' which controls uptake dynamics. This finding implies prolonged systemic presence of nanoplastics. The model was extrapolated to humans, revealing that dietary intake is the dominant pathway for systemic loading of nanoplastics. Under steady-state conditions, organ concentrations scale cubically with lipid fractions, leading to large lipid-mediated enrichment factors in organs like the brain.

Conclusion: This study bridges short-term animal studies with long-term human bioaccumulation, highlighting dietary intake as the primary source of nanoplastics in the human body.

Abstract: Nanoplastics (NP) are now detected in human blood and organs at concentrations reaching hundreds to thousands of parts per million, yet no quantitative framework has linked short-term laboratory uptake kinetics to long-term, organ-specific bioaccumulation in humans. Here we develop a minimal, mechanistically grounded toxicokinetic model that represents organisms as a sequential two-compartment system comprising a systemic gate-blood compartment governing entry and circulation, and organ-level tissue compartments controlling retention. Reanalysis of six independent uptake and depuration datasets in teleost fish (spanning four species, multiple organs, particle sizes from 20 to 500~nm, and exposure concentrations across four orders of magnitude) reveals a striking data collapse when expressed in normalized variables. This collapse shows that uptake dynamics are universally governed by a single dimensionless parameter, the systemic excretion capacity, which is generically small under experimental conditions, implying prolonged systemic residence of NP. Exploiting the scale-free structure of the model, we extrapolate these kinetics to humans and demonstrate that direct exposure from air and water cannot account for reported organ burdens, even under conservative assumptions of negligible clearance. Instead, mass-balance constraints identify dietary intake as the dominant pathway for systemic loading. At steady state, human organ concentrations follow a robust cubic scaling with tissue lipid fraction, yielding blood-to-brain enrichment factors of order $10^{3}$--$10^{4}$. This lipid-mediated enrichment, combined with inefficient systemic depuration, explains why the brain emerges as a dominant sink for environmental nanoplastics. Our results establish a unified, predictive toxicokinetic framework that quantitatively bridges short-term animal experiments and chronic human bioaccumulation.

Abstract: The possibility that evolutionary forces -- together with a few fundamental factors such as thermodynamic constraints, specific computational features enabling information processing, and ecological processes -- might constrain the logic of living systems is tantalizing. However, it is often overlooked that any practical implementation of such a logic requires complementary circuitry that, in biological systems, happens through complex networks of genetic regulation, metabolic reactions, cellular signalling, communication, social and eusocial non-trivial organization. We review and discuss how circuitries are not merely passive structures, but active agents of change that, by means of hierarchical and modular organization, are able to enhance and catalyze the evolution of evolvability. Using statistical physics to analyze the role of non-trivial topologies in major evolutionary transitions, we show that biological innovations are related to deviation from trivial structures and (thermo)dynamic equilibria.
  We argue that sparse heterogeneous networks such as hierarchical modular, which are ubiquitously observed in nature, are favored in terms of the trade-off between energetic costs for redundancy, error-correction and maintainance. We identify three main features -- namely, interconnectivity, plasticity and interdependency -- pointing towards a unifying framework for modeling the phenomenology, discussing them in terms of dynamical systems theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and evolutionary dynamics. Within this unified picture, we also show that slow evolutionary dynamics is an emergent phenomenon governed by the replicator-mutator equation as the direct consequence of a constrained variational nonequilibrium process. Overall, this work highlights how dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide powerful analytical techniques to study biological complexity.

The model's mutation probability calculations align with existing research findings. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding proton transfer in DNA base pairs is essential for comprehending mutation mechanisms and the role of base pairing in molecular biology and genetics. Furthermore, non-adiabatic effects are significant in quantum mechanics applications involving molecular systems, such as DNA replication and mutation. This study aims to contribute to both fields by presenting a novel approach to modeling mutation probabilities in a non-adiabatic context. 

Method: The researchers developed a non-adiabatic quantum mechanical framework to model the proton transfer process in adenine-thymine base pairs.

TL;DR: 病毒表现出多样化的结构、传播方式、免疫相互作用和进化行为，尽管如此，病毒策略并非无限制地发展。我们提出了一种统一的框架，将病毒的进化描述为受限优化问题，受到物理衰减、免疫压力、变异稳健性和传播架构的控制。我们把病毒感染视为受免疫驱动的选择和突变选择平衡的复制者。在这个框架下，主要的病毒感染策略会自然产生，而不是单纯的分类 accidents。环境传播的病毒被预测为结构简单、化学稳定且依赖于复制体积，而不是免疫抑制。结构复杂的病毒能够忍受快速的环境降解，通过编码免疫调节机制、潜伏期或持续复制来实现，这以降低了突变稳健性。温度依赖的季节性自然从病毒的热激活过程中的性质得出，无需引入宿主行为。

Motivation: 研究病毒的进化策略及其对传播和免疫的影响，寻找病毒适应的具体机制。

Method: 通过构建一个物理系统和自然界假设的模型，将病毒视为复制者，在免疫和变异压力下平衡。

Result: 病毒的传播方式决定了结构上的差异，环境传播的病毒更简单，环境压力大的病毒更复杂以适应降解。温度季节性变化是病毒热性质的结果。

Conclusion: 病毒的策略是自然适应的结果，环境传播与简单结构相关，而高结构的病毒可以抗环境压力，但代价是变异稳健性降低。

Abstract: Viruses display striking diversity in structure, transmission mode, immune interaction, and evolutionary behavior. Despite this diversity, viral strategies are not unconstrained. Here we present a unifying framework that treats viral evolution as a problem of constrained optimization governed by physical decay, immune pressure, mutation robustness, and transmission architecture. We model virions as multi-component physical systems subject to irreversible environmental failure and viruses as replicators operating under immune-driven selection and mutation-selection balance. Within this framework, major viral transmission strategies arise as necessary solutions rather than taxonomic accidents. Environmentally transmitted and airborne viruses are predicted to be structurally simple, chemically stable, and reliant on replication volume rather than immune suppression. Structurally complex viruses tolerate rapid environmental decay by encoding immune-modulatory machinery, latency, or persistent replication, at the cost of reduced mutation robustness. Temperature-dependent seasonality emerges naturally from the thermally activated nature of viral decay, without invoking host behavior.

Abstract: In many biological networks the responses of individual elements are ambiguous. We consider a scenario in which many sensors respond to a shared signal, each with limited information capacity, and ask that the outputs together convey as much information as possible about an underlying relevant variable. In a low noise limit where we can make analytic progress, we show that individually ambiguous responses optimize overall information transmission.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR:  paper presents a 3D magneto-optical trap for CaH molecule, achieving vibrational loss up to ν=2, enabling laser cooling and loading into a mf MOT with ~230 molecules and temp <1mkelvin. This could facilitate controlled dissociation of H atoms for precision spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  the paper outlines a new method for trapping CaH molecules, which could lead to novel avenues in precision spectroscopy.

Method:  a 3D magneto-optical trap, scattering ~10^4 photons, achieving vibrational loss up to ν=2, laser cooling and loading into a radio-frequency MOT.

Result:  trap achieved vibrational loss up to ν=2, loaded ~230 molecules, temp <1mkelvin. The trap could facilitate controlled dissociation of H atoms for precision spectroscopy.

Conclusion: the demonstration of a highly efficient and versatile 3D magneto-optical trap for trapping CaH molecules with low vibrational loss and high loading efficiency opens new possibilities for controlled molecular manipulation and precision spectroscopy.

Abstract: We demonstrate a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) of a metal hydride molecule, CaH. We are able to scatter $\sim$$10^{4}$ photons with vibrational loss covered up to vibrational quantum number $ν=2$. This allows us to laser slow the molecular beam near zero velocity with a "white-light" technique and subsequently load it into a radio-frequency MOT. The MOT contains 230(40) molecules, limited by beam source characteristics and predissociative loss of CaH. The temperature of the MOT is below one millikelvin. The predissociative loss mechanism could, in turn, facilitate controlled dissociation of the molecule, offering a possible route to optical trapping of hydrogen atoms for precision spectroscopy.

TL;DR:  paper reports measurements and theory calculations of photoionization cross sections of La+ ions at the PETRA III synchrotron, finding good agreement between experimental data and theory, with some simplifications in the calculations likely affecting the product-ion charge state distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  development of quantum theoretical methods for modeling nonequilibrium plasmas such as kilonovae requires accurate atomic data, specifically cross sections for photoionization of heavy ions.

Method:  used the photon-ion merged-beams technique at PETRA III to measure cross sections for double to tenfold photoionization of La+ ions, and upgraded the Jena Atomic Calculator (JAC) to perform large-scale calculations of La+ photoabsorption cross sections and deexcitation cascades.

Result:  the experimental cross sections for photoionization of La+ ions are in good agreement with the theoretical results, although the theoretical product-ion charge state distributions are narrower than the experimental ones, likely due to simplifications in the calculations.

Conclusion:  the work provides experimental benchmark data for advancing quantum theoretical methods to model nonequilibrium plasmas like kilonovae, while identifying areas for improvement in the calculations.

Abstract: Using the photon-ion merged-beams technique at the PETRA\,III synchrotron light source, we have measured cross sections for double and up to tenfold photoionization of La$^{+}$ ions by a single photon in the energy range 820--1400~eV, where resonances and thresholds occur that are associated with the excitation or ionization of one $M$-shell electron. These cross sections represent experimental benchmark data for the further development of quantum theoretical methods, which will have to provide the bulk of the atomic data required for the modeling of nonequilibrium plasmas such as kilonovae. In the present work, we have upgraded the Jena Atomic Calculator (JAC) and pushed the state-of-the-art of quantum calculations for heavy many-electron systems to new limits. In particular, we have performed large-scale calculations of the La$^+$ photoabsorption cross section and of the deexcitation cascades, which set in after the initial creation of a $3d$ hole. Our theoretical results largely agree with our experimental findings. However, our theoretical product-ion charge state distributions are somewhat narrower than the experimental ones, which is most probably due to the simplifications necessary to keep the cascade calculations tractable.

Abstract: We present relativistic many-body perturbation theory plus configuration interaction (MBPT+CI) calculations of the lowest four excited states of Ni$^{12+}$, a promising candidate for highly charged ion (HCI) optical clocks. By combining the convergence behavior from multiple calculation models, we perform a detailed analysis of the electron-correlation effects and both the excitation energies and their uncertainties are obtained. Our computed energies for the first two excited states deviate from experimental values by less than $10~\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, with relative uncertainties estimated below $0.2\%$. Building on the same computational procedure, we calculate the mass shift and field shift constants for the lowest four excited states of Ni$^{12+}$, and the resulting isotope shifts exhibit valence-correlation-induced relative uncertainties below the $1\%$ level. These results provide essential atomic-structure input for high-precision isotope shift spectroscopy in Ni$^{12+}$.

Conclusion: 结果为双电离效应的研究和实验 Verification提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Within the framework of the second-order non-relativistic quantum perturbation theory, the methods of the theory of irreducible tensor operators, and nonorthogonal orbitals, the absolute values and shape of the generalized cross-sections of the two-photon double ionization (sweeping) of the K-shell of a heavy neon-like ion of an iron atom were predicted. The complete wave functions of the ground state of the ion and the states of its ionization are obtained in the single-configuration Hartree-Fock approximation. The effects of radial relaxation of ionization states in the field of one and two vacancies in the K-shell are taken into account. The matrix element of the operator of the radiation transition between continuum-spectrum states is taken into account by introducing a correlation function. It was established that the generalized cross-section of the two-photon sweeping of the K-shell at high (greater than or equal to 15.8 keV) energies of absorbed X-ray photons is several orders of magnitude greater than the generalized cross-section of the two-photon single ionization of the K-shell. This result qualitatively reproduces the work of Novikov S.A. and Hopersky A.N. (J. Phys. B 2002. V. 35. P. L339), stimulates future research, in particular, the effects of cascade "evaporation" of electron shells of an atom (atomic ion) when filling an empty K-shell and can be tested in X-ray free-electron laser experiments with high peak radiation brightness and ultrashort photon pulse duration. The scheme of the proposed experiment with two linearly polarized X-ray photons is presented.

TL;DR: The paper calculates the electric dipole polarizabilities of Sr atoms and determines magic wavelengths for specific transitions, studying their dependence on the angle between laser polarization and magnetic field. The paper also investigates conditions for triple magic trapping at 813.4 nm for different states, presenting results that agree with recent experiments.  Methodologically, the paper uses advanced computational techniques such as RCI+MBPT, magic wavelengths and triple magic trapping are studied through angle dependence analysis, and experimental agreement is confirmed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance precision spectroscopy and quantum control by precisely calculating polarizabilities and identifying configurations for magic wavelengths and triple magic trapping, which are crucial for state-dependent manipulation in atomic clocks and precision measurements.

Method: The paper employs relativistic configuration interaction plus many-body perturbation theory (RCI+MBPT) to calculate polarizabilities and determine magic wavelengths. The dependence of magic wavelengths on the angle between laser polarization and magnetic field is studied, and experimental conditions for triple magic trapping are presented for different light polarizations.

Result: The paper successfully calculates the polarizabilities and magic wavelengths, finds that the results agree with recent experimental measurements, and provides conditions for achieving triple magic trapping for multiple states with various light polarizations, which is crucial for future precision metrology and quantum information processing.

Conclusion: The findings provide a deeper understanding of atomic polarizabilities and magic wavelengths, advancing the field of precision spectroscopy and quantum control with practical applications in atomic clocks and quantum information science.

Abstract: The static and dynamic electric dipole polarizabilities of the $5s^2~^1\!S_0$ and $5s5p~^3\!P_{0,2}$ states of Sr atoms are calculated using the relativistic configuration interaction plus the many-body perturbation theory (RCI+MBPT) method. Magic wavelengths are determined for the transitions $5s^2~^1\!S_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3\!P_{0}$, $5s^2~^1\!S_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3\!P_{2}$, and $5s5p~^3\!P_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3\!P_{2}$. A comprehensive study is conducted on the dependence of magic wavelengths on the angle between the laser polarization and the magnetic field. Furthermore, the conditions for realizing triple magic trapping at 813.4~nm for the $5s^2~^1\!S_0$, $5s5p~^3\!P_{0}$ and $5s5p~^3\!P_{2}$ states are investigated. In the case of linearly polarized light, when the angle ($θ_p$) between the laser polarization direction and the magnetic field is $79.1(0.7)^\circ$, triple magic trapping for the $5s^2~^1\!S_0$, $5s5p~^3\!P_{0}$, and $5s5p~^3\!P_{2}~M=0$ states can be achieved. This result agrees well with the recent experimental measurement (78.49(3)$^\circ$)[Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 143401 (2025)]. Meanwhile, triple magic trapping involving the $5s5p~^3\!P_{2}~M=2$ state can be achieved when $θ_p= 37.4(0.3)^\circ$. The conditions for achieving triple magic trapping with circularly and arbitrarily elliptically polarized light are also presented.

Abstract: Divalent atoms have emerged as powerful alternatives to alkalis in ultracold atom platforms, offering unique advantages arising from their two-electron structure. Among these species, ytterbium (Yb) is especially promising, yet its anionic properties and its Rydberg spectrum remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we perform a first and comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) of $^{174}$Yb in $6sns\,^1S_0$ Rydberg states across nearly two decades in principal quantum number $n$ and three orders of magnitude in molecular binding energy. Using the Coulomb Green's function formalism, we compute Born-Oppenheimer molecular potentials describing the Rydberg atom in the presence of a ground-state perturber and achieve quantitative agreement with high-resolution molecular spectra. This enables the extraction of low-energy electron-Yb scattering phase shifts, including the zero-energy $s$-wave scattering length and the positions of two spin-orbit split $p$-wave shape resonances. Our results provide strong evidence that the Yb$^{-}$ anion exists only as a metastable resonance. We additionally show the sensitivity of ULRM spectra to the atomic quantum defects, using this to refine the value for the $6s23f\, ^1F_3$ quantum defect. Together, these findings establish Yb ULRMs as a powerful probe of electron-Yb interactions and lay essential groundwork for future Rydberg experiments with divalent atoms.

Conclusion: 通过将Pfaff-Toda Hierarchy与DKP 途径结合，简化了多组分系统的分析，提出了利用椭圆函数的新方法。

Abstract: We consider the dispersionless limit of the recently introduced multi-component Pfaff-Toda hierarchy. Its dispersionless version is a set of nonlinear differential equations for the dispersionless limit of logarithm of the tau-function (the F-function). They are obtained as limiting cases of bilinear equations of the Hirota-Miwa type. The analysis of the Pfaff-Toda hierarchy is substantially simplified by using the observation that the full (not only dispersionless) N-component Pfaff-Toda hierarchy is actually equivalent to the 2N-component DKP hierarchy. In the dispersionless limit, there is an elliptic curve built in the structure of the hierarchy, with the elliptic modular parameter being a dynamical variable. This curve can be uniformized by elliptic functions, and in the elliptic parametrization the hierarchy acquires a compact and especially nice form.

Abstract: Integrable discretizations of the sine-Gordon equation in characteristic (or light-cone) coordinates have been extensively studied after the seminal works of Hirota and Orfanidis in the late 1970s. In contrast, integrable discretizations of the sine-Gordon equation in non-characteristic coordinates have been scarcely studied except the lattice sine-Gordon model proposed by Izergin and Korepin in the early 1980s. In this paper, using the zero-curvature representation, we propose integrable space discretizations of the sine-Gordon equation in three distinct cases of non-characteristic coordinates. For the most interesting case of the sine-Gordon equation in laboratory coordinates, the integrable space discretization is unwieldy; as a remedy, we rewrite the sine-Gordon equation as a two-component evolutionary system and present an aesthetically acceptable space discretization.
