Inference at the sensor edge determines experimental data collection efficiency by deciding which information to save for further analysis. Particle tracking detectors at the Large Hadron Collider exemplify this challenge: pixelated silicon sensors generate rich spatiotemporal ionization patterns, yet most of this information is discarded due to data-rate limitations. Concurrently, advancements in co-design tools provide rapid turn-around for incorporating machine learning into application-specific integrated circuits, motivating designs for particle detectors with new integrated technologies. We demonstrate that neural networks embedded in the front-end electronics can infer charged-particle kinematic parameters from a single silicon layer. We regress hit positions and incident angles with calibrated uncertainties, while satisfying stringent constraints on numerical precision, latency, and silicon area. Our results establish a path toward probabilistic inference directly at the edge, opening new opportunities for intelligent sensing in high-rate scientific instruments."}

The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.

Although chemical functionalization can significantly enhance graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance, it often degrades graphene's intrinsic in-plane phonon transport. In this work, we perform a systematic deep neural network molecular dynamics study comparing edge-functionalized graphene nanoribbons with surface-functionalized graphene in aqueous environments. We demonstrate that functionalizing only 10% of the ribbon edges with hydroxyl groups increases the graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance by more than eightfold, primarily due to strengthened interfacial interactions and improved wettability at the edges. In contrast to basal-plane oxidation, edge functionalization largely preserves in-plane thermal conductivity. Importantly, hydroxyl edge groups exert competing effects on phonon transport: they introduce additional boundary scattering that suppresses heat conduction, while simultaneously passivating dangling bonds at bare edges, thereby reducing phonon localization and edge-induced scattering. This competition leads to a non-monotonic dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity on edge functionalization ratio. These results establish edge functionalization as an effective strategy for enhancing graphene-water interfacial thermal transport without sacrificing intrinsic phonon transport properties."}

During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions."}

We show that a minimal extension based on fractional scalar-field cosmology resolves this tension. Introducing a fractional order $α\\neq 1$ generates non-local (memory) corrections in the Friedmann and Klein-Gordon dynamics that suppress $r$ while keeping $n_s$ essentially unchanged. We derive an explicit mapping $α(n,m)$ and recover the standard power-law limit as $α\\to 1$. For observationally favored values $α\\approx 0.8$-$0.9$ in four dimensions we obtain $n_s \\approx 0.965$ and $r \\lesssim 0.04$, bringing power-law inflation into agreement with data. The scalar potential follows self-consistently as an exponential, and a dynamical-systems analysis shows the fractional power-law solutions form stable inflationary attractors over the viable parameter range.

It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface."}

In the present study, exciton transfer under dynamical fluctuation in excitonic coupling was investigated via combined use of non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, exciton density analysis, and a simple two-state model, for inter-ligand exciton transfer in bis(dipyrrinato)Zn(II) as the example case. The reaction coordinate for the exciton transfer was obtained a posteriori via regression analysis where the target and explanatory variables are diabatic energy gaps and atomic displacements, respectively.

Materials that surpass this rule, termed super-Mossian dielectrics, combine large refractive indices with wide optical transparency and are therefore ideal candidates for advanced photonic applications. This Review surveys the expanding landscape of high-index dielectric and semiconductor materials, with a particular focus on those that surpass the Moss rule. We discuss how electronic band structures with a large joint density of states near the band edge give rise to super-Mossian behavior and how first-principles computational screening can accelerate their discovery.

In this work, we revisit curvature-squared string-inspired effective actions, from the point of view of appropriate local field redefinitions, leaving the perturbative string scattering matrices invariant. We require simultaneously unitarity and torsion interpretation of the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor, features characterising the (3+1)-dimensional StRVM Cosmology. Unlike the higher dimensional case, the above feature is possible in the context of (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, obtained after string compactification. We demonstrate that the unitarity and torsion-interpretation requirements lead to a single-type of extra four-derivative terms in the effective gravitational action, not discussed in the previous literature of StRVM, which however is shown to be subleading by many orders of magnitude, compared to the terms of the StRVM framework. Hence, its presence has no practical implications for the relevant inflationary (and, hence, postinflationary) physics of the StRVM. This demonstrates the phenomenological completeness of the StRVM cosmological scenario, which is thus fully embeddable in the UV complete (quantum-gravity compatible) string theory framework."}

Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust.

In the present study it is shown that this is not necessarily the case. Using standard thermodynamics, the general characteristics of phase transitions are investigated, considering an arbitrary number of conserved particle species and coexisting phases, and an arbitrary set of state variables. It is found that there exist two different possible types of realizations of a phase transition. In the first type, one has the immediate replacement of a single phase with another one. As a consequence, some of the global extensive variables indeed behave discontinuously. In the second type, one has instead the gradual (dis-) appearance of a single phase over a range of the state variables. This leads to a continuous behavior of the (global) basic thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, in this case it is not possible to define a latent heat in a trivial manner. It is derived that the latter (former) case happens if the number of extensive state variables used is larger or equal (lower) than the number of coexisting phases. The choice of the state variables thus place a crucial role for the qualitative properties of the phase transition."}

Their performance relies on ultra-stable, narrow-linewidth lasers, frequency stabilized to a compact portable optical cavity. Among various designs, the cubic spacer-based ultra-stable cavity is particularly well-suited for transportable applications due to its low sensitivity to vibrations, owing to its symmetric geometry and robust mounting structure. While longer cavities offer a lower fundamental thermal noise floor, one needs to strike a balance between transportability and size. In this aspect, the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity offers a lower fundamental thermal noise floor in comparison to smaller counterparts, while still retaining a reasonable SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) for terrestrial and aerial PNT applications. Its dual-axis design also enables multi-wavelength laser stabilization, making it a promising candidate for future transportable clock applications. This work presents a detailed study of the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity using FEM (Finite Element Method) to evaluate its mechanical and thermal stability. We analyze the impact of various geometric factors, mounting forces, and machining imperfections, while also modelling thermal effects such as conduction, radiation, and mirror heating within a vacuum chamber and thermally shielded environment.

Their performance relies on ultra-stable, narrow-linewidth lasers, frequency stabilized to a compact portable optical cavity. Among various designs, the cubic spacer-based ultra-stable cavity is particularly well-suited for transportable applications due to its low sensitivity to vibrations, owing to its symmetric geometry and robust mounting structure. While longer cavities offer a lower fundamental thermal noise floor, one needs to strike a balance between transportability and size. In this aspect, the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity offers a lower fundamental thermal noise floor in comparison to smaller counterparts, while still retaining a reasonable SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) for terrestrial and aerial PNT applications. Its dual-axis design also enables multi-wavelength laser stabilization, making it a promising candidate for future transportable clock applications. This work presents a detailed study of the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity using FEM (Finite Element Method) to evaluate its mechanical and thermal stability. We analyze the impact of various geometric factors, mounting forces, and machining imperfections, while also modelling thermal effects such as conduction, radiation, and mirror heating within a vacuum chamber and thermally shielded environment. Our findings provide design insights for developing robust dual-axis optical reference cavities, advancing the deployment of portable atomic clocks for next-generation applications in PNT, geodesy, VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) and deep space missions."}

Nonetheless, fabrication challenges and performance degradation attributable to surface oxidation and lack of uniformity in films thinner than 5 nm remain a significant barrier for achieving high-quality detectors. In this work, we study the influence of a Silicon capping layer on film properties and on the performance of SNSPDs. A Silicon capping layer effectively suppresses oxidation and increases the superconducting transition temperature. This enables superconductivity in films as thin as 3 nm at 3 K, increases critical current in patterned nanowires and significantly extends the saturation plateau from the visible to the near infrared (up to 2050 nm): These detectors maintain sub-50 ps timing jitter, even for nanowires as wide as 250 nm and with detection areas of 20x20μm2. Our results establish that thinner films protected by a capping layer allow for the fabrication of wider wires, decreasing nanofabrication challenges and extending the operating temperature range for efficient single photon detection."}

The $n$-roots of these models are constructed from connecting loop modules of unidirectional couplings whose geometrical arrangements match that of the corresponding parent system. Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an \"exceptional horn\" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta. These exceptional horns reflect the behavior of low-lying excitations that scale with momentum as $E\\sim\\vert \\mathbf{q}\\vert^{\\frac{1}{n}}$, with $n\\geq 3$, as opposed to the linear massless modes that characterize a Dirac cone. Moreover, we derive analytic expressions for the associated Landau levels (LLs), whose energies scale with magnetic flux as $E\\simφ^{\\frac{1}{2n}}$. For the case of the $n$-root Lieb lattice, the zeroth LL is shown to be exceptional. These results are analytically derived for both $n$-root models and numerically demonstrated for certain values of $n$.

In this work, we present a hybrid opto-electric neural network (OENN) wavefront sensor that enables ultra-high-speed operation in a compact, low-cost system. Subwavelength diffractive metasurfaces efficiently encode the incoming wavefront into tailored irradiance patterns, which are then decoded by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). In simulation and experiment, the hybrid approach achieves average Strehl ratio (SR) improvements exceeding 60% and 45%, respectively, for unseen wavefronts compared to purely electronic sensors with few-pixel inputs. Although larger MLPs allow purely electronic sensors to match the hybrid's SR under static conditions, transient atmosphere modeling shows that their added latency leads to rapid SR degradation with increasing Greenwood frequency, while the hybrid system maintains performance. These results highlight the potential of hybrid OENN architectures to unlock scalable, high-bandwidth free-space communication systems and, more broadly, to advance optical technologies where real-time sensing is constrained by electronic latency."}

Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. In scalar-tensor extensions of gravity, black holes may possess primary scalar hair, introducing an additional independent parameter beyond mass and spin. In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion. Modeling M87* within this framework and imposing the EHT bounds on $θ_d$ and $ΔC$, we determine the viable $(a,Q)$ parameter space.

We quantify the robustness of this coefficient under departures from maximal symmetry via the Weyl-to-Kretschmann ratio $ε_C$.

By averaging the Einstein equations to second order in the fluctuation amplitude, we derive a modified Friedmann equation that includes an effective correction term. This correction is shown to be equivalent to the general expression obtained from an arbitrary deformation of the entropy-area relation. By specifying the statistical properties, particularly the variance of the conformal noise, we successfully reproduce the Friedmann equation corrections associated with several well-known generalized entropy frameworks, including Rényi, (dual) Kaniadakis, Barrow, logarithmic, and MOND inspired hypergeometric entropies.

We show that the NP formalism reformulates the horizon condition as the Penrose-Rindler equation. In this context, a Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes is recovered from the Penrose-Rindler equation reinterpreted as a horizon equilibrium of pressures, which includes a pressure associated with the horizon rotation. A complete geometric reformulation of this reinterpretation of the Penrose-Rindler equation evaluated at the horizon is developed within the GHP formalism. The GHP approach further inspires the introduction of the horizon-averaged matter pressure and its conjugate volume, thereby enabling a quasi-local realization of the Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes. This geometric formulation clarifies the connection between horizon dynamics and thermodynamics and offers a unified setting for extending black hole thermodynamics beyond spherical symmetry."}

We require simultaneously unitarity and torsion interpretation of the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor, features characterising the (3+1)-dimensional StRVM Cosmology. Unlike the higher dimensional case, the above feature is possible in the context of (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, obtained after string compactification. We demonstrate that the unitarity and torsion-interpretation requirements lead to a single-type of extra four-derivative terms in the effective gravitational action, not discussed in the previous literature of StRVM, which however is shown to be subleading by many orders of magnitude, compared to the terms of the StRVM framework. Hence, its presence has no practical implications for the relevant inflationary (and, hence, postinflationary) physics of the StRVM.

Most tests of General Relativity (GR) assume that the spacetime around a black hole is circular, meaning the metric possesses a specific symmetry structure common to the Kerr solution. However, deviations from circularity are predicted by various modified gravity theories and non-vacuum General Relativity solutions. In this work, we test a specific non-circular metric constructed based on a locality principle, where the deviation from the Kerr spacetime is driven by the local spacetime curvature. To accurately model the reflection spectrum in this background, we implement a relativistic ray-tracing code in horizon-penetrating (ingoing Kerr) coordinates, which are favored for their ability to avoid introducing curvature singularities at the horizon in non-circular spacetimes. We apply this model to the high-quality \\textit{NuSTAR} spectrum of the Galactic black hole binary EXO 1846--031.

We define this phenomenon for quantum states and classical probability distributions, and explore it in three complementary models, one of which exhibits nontrivial quantum coherence at short times. Our main conclusions are as follows. In one dimension, the strong symmetry is not spontaneously broken at any finite time; however, correlators probing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking develop order on length scales that grow linearly in time, parametrically faster than charge diffusion. We provide numerical evidence for this scaling in multiple distinct probes of SW-SSB, and derive it from a field-theory analysis. Moreover, we relate this scaling to the problem of inferring the charge inside a subregion by measuring its surroundings, and construct explicit decoding protocols that illustrate its origin. In two dimensions, field theory and numerical simulations support a finite-time Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like SW-SSB transition. Within continuum hydrodynamics, by contrast, SW-SSB happens at infinitesimal time in two or more dimensions. The SW-SSB transition time can thus be interpreted as marking the emergence of a continuum hydrodynamic description, or (more precisely) the timescale beyond which non-hydrodynamic information such as discrete particle worldlines can no longer be inferred. We support this picture by analyzing a model in which we exploit SW-SSB to derive a classical stochastic hydrodynamic description from the underlying quantum dynamics."}

Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem.

In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion.

Of particular interest in such systems is to understand the circumstances in which, despite the ability to apply time-dependent controls, they lose information about their initial state exponentially with time i.e., their dynamics are exponentially contractive. While there exists an extensive framework to study contractivity for time-independent Lindbladians, their time-dependent counterparts are far less well understood. In this paper, we study the contractivity of Lindbladians, which have a fixed dissipator (describing the interaction with an environment), but with a time-dependent driving Hamiltonian. We establish exponential contractivity in the limit of sufficiently small or sufficiently slow drives together with explicit examples showing that, even when the fixed dissipator is exponentially contractive by itself, a sufficiently large or a sufficiently fast Hamiltonian can result in non-contractive dynamics. Furthermore, we provide a number of sufficient conditions on the fixed dissipator that imply exponential contractivity independently of the Hamiltonian. These sufficient conditions allow us to completely characterize Hamiltonian-independent contractivity for unital dissipators and for two-level systems."}

By averaging the Einstein equations to second order in the fluctuation amplitude, we derive a modified Friedmann equation that includes an effective correction term.

In this paper, we explore how reinforcement learning can be used to compute a class of Euclidean path integrals that yield the thermal density matrix of a quantum system, thereby enabling the computation of the free energy or other thermal expectation values.

TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make this compilation trainable while respecting the unitary nature of quantum operations, we introduce a unitary-aware constraint that parameterizes TN cores as learnable block unitaries, enabling them to be directly optimized and directly encoded as quantum operators. The proposed TNQE framework enables explicit control over circuit depth and qubit resources, allowing the construction of shallow, resource-efficient circuits.

Such constraints can give rise to striking and counter-intuitive phenomena, including local broadcasting of entangled states and failures of entanglement monogamy. These effects naturally arise in tomographically nonlocal theories (like real quantum theory, twirled worlds, or fermionic quantum theory), where composite systems possess holistic degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to local measurements. In this work, we study entanglement in such theories within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We show that the failure of tomographic locality leads to two qualitatively distinct forms of entanglement, which we term $\\textit{tomographically-local}$ entanglement and $\\textit{tomographically-nonlocal}$ entanglement. We analyze the operational consequences of this distinction, proving that tomographically-nonlocal entanglement is useless for Bell nonlocality, steering, and teleportation, but sufficient for dense coding and perfectly secure data hiding. This framework clarifies the origin of several previously puzzling features of entanglement that arise when tomographic locality fails, as can happen even in quantum theory when one considers fermions or fundamental superselection rules."}

Categorical quantum mechanics (CQM) makes precise why ``copy'' and ``delete'' are not generic quantum operations: they exist only for a realized \\emph{classical data} sector (a preferred basis/observable; a commutative structure). Decoherence explains how a pointer basis can be selected dynamically, but it does not by itself select a unique outcome. This motivates a neutral presentation of the main ontological options (unique-history, decohered multiplicity, agent-relative facticity, and a stochastic foundation with variable diffusion). We also note the relevance of the ``agency constraint'' argued by Adlam-McQueen-Waegell: in a strictly coherent, basis-unselected ``purely quantum'' regime, minimal agency fails due to no-cloning and linearity, which sharpens the role of classical resources for record-based processes. Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios then serve as a stress test, since they treat ``friends'' simultaneously as coherent quantum systems and as agents possessing stable records. Finally, a stochastic-mechanics foundation (with variable diffusion) offers a continuous bridge between quantum and classical regimes, and suggests a principled way to implement measurement update as conditioning plus a time-symmetric minimal-change rule."}

Physically relevant quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise are generically non-Markovian and analytically intractable. Further, their Markovian limits are generically inequivalent when using either the Ito or Stratonovich conventions for the same quantum stochastic processes. We introduce a quantum noise homogenization scheme that temporally coarse-grains non-Markovian, colored-noise driven quantum stochastic processes and connects them to their effective white-noise (Markovian) limits. Our approach uses a novel phase-space augmentation that maps the non-Markovian dynamics into a higher dimensional Markovian system and then applies a controlled perturbative coarse-graining scheme in the characteristic time scales of the noise. This allows an explicit analytical algorithm to derive effective Markovian generators with renormalized coefficients and enables imposing various physical constraints on them. We thus resolve the Ito-Stratonovich ambiguity for multiplicative colored noise driven quantum stochastic processes, wherein we show that their consistent Markovian limit corresponds to the Stratonovich convention with renormalized coefficients as well as Ito correction terms. By assuming their Markovian limit unravels completely positive, trace-preserving maps, we further characterize a physically relevant family of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise."}

This enhancement persists in the sub-shot-noise regime, where the classical signal becomes buried in the spectral background while the two-photon contribution remains resolvable.

For this purpose, the contributions of the electromagnetic waves with the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations to the Casimir force are computed using the Lifshitz theory expressed in terms of the pure imaginary Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions are found using an equivalent formulation of the Lifshitz theory along the real frequency axis. All computations are performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plates using the Drude model and the experimentally consistent plasma model over the separation region from 0.5 to 6~mum, where the total force value is determined by conduction electrons. It is shown that the transverse magnetic contribution to the Casimir force does not depend on the used model of the dielectric permittivity, so that the total difference between the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the measurement data is determined by the transverse electric contribution. In doing so, as opposed to the case of nonmagnetic metals, both fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in this contribution depend on the model of the dielectric permittivity used in computations, whereas the magnetic properties of the plate metal influence the Casimir force solely through the fraction of propagating waves in the transverse electric contribution. The issue of a more adequate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of magnetic metals is discussed."}

It is concluded that the reason for this mystery, and thereby the related mysteries of complementarity, non-commutativity of observables, the uncertainty principle and violation of Bell's equality, is that the axioms of QM depend vitally on the continuum nature of Hilbert Space, deemed unphysical. We develop a theory of quantum physics - Rational Quantum Mechanics (RaQM) - in which Hilbert Space is gravitationally discretised. The key to solving the mysteries of QM in RaQM is a number-theoretic property of the cosine function, concealed in QM when angles range over the continuum. This number-theoretic property describes mathematically the utter indivisibility of the quantum world and implies that the laws of physics are profoundly holistic. We contrast holism with nonlocality. In theories which embrace the continuum, the violation of Bell's inequality requires the laws of physics to be either nonlocal or not realistic; both incomprehensible concepts. By contrast, holism, as embodied in Mach's Principle or in the fractal geometry of a chaotic attractor, is neither incomprehensible nor unphysical. As part of this, we solve the deepest mystery of all; why nature makes use of complex numbers."}

By varying these asymmetry factors, the inverse participation ratio and entanglement entropy of the walker are numerically calculated for different coin and loss parameters, both for symmetric and asymmetric initial states. We then experimentally implement a 16-step asymmetric DTQW using a time-multiplexing fiber loop structure. By choosing an asymmetric initial state, both coin-position entanglement and delocalization are simultaneously enhanced under specific coin parameters. Moreover, we observe that with finite asymmetric polarization-dependent loss, the photon probability on the left side decreases significantly, while that on the right side increases and becomes more localized. Interestingly, under specific coin parameters, the entanglement and delocalization exhibit improved robustness against polarization-dependent loss.

We show that product states always meet this bound, while all pure entangled states and some classically correlated states can exceed it. This demonstrates a nonlocal phenomenon since the predictability of measurement outcomes increases after the measurement. Perfect nonlocal predictability for arbitrary projective measurements occurs only for maximally entangled states among all pure states, underscoring their special role. Comparing pure entangled states with their dephased versions, we find that dephasing on one subsystem can enhance nonlocal predictability for a broad class of states and measurements - a counterintuitive, noise-induced advantage that vanishes for maximally entangled states under any projective measurement."}

Here, we aim to address this gap in current knowledge and consider the quantum optical HHG response from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a finite chain of atoms with both a topologically trivial and nontrivial insulating phase, the latter supporting edge states. We find that HHG from both topological phases is squeezed at the band-gap frequency. Interestingly, while the harmonic spectrum discriminates the two topological phases of the system, the degree of squeezing only discriminates the phases for smaller chain lengths. We attribute this difference to a relative increase in overlap between bulk and edge states in the topological nontrivial phase for smaller systems. Our findings reveal how the strength of dipole couplings governs the nonclassical HHG response and define new research questions on topologically protected generation of quantum light in strong-field physics."}

Specifically, we examine a behavior that can be understood by characterizing the underlying physical processes in terms of a motional-induced effective temperature. This phenomenon shares similarities with the Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect, opening new perspectives for the understanding of nonequilibrium physics at work in the system."}

We focus on a physically motivated model in which each Bell pair constituting the resource interacts with an identical local environment, corresponding to independently distributed entangled links. Two noisy scenarios are analyzed: one with decoherence acting solely on the resource state and ideal measurements, and another with noisy, noise adapted measurements optimised for the given noise model. In the first case, we derive an analytical lower bound and later a closed-form expression for the entanglement fidelity of the teleportation channel and analyze its asymptotic behaviour. In the second, we combine semi analytical and numerical methods. Surprisingly, we find that noise-adapted measurements perform worse than the noiseless ones. To connect the abstract noise description with microscopic physics, we embed the protocol in a spin boson model and investigate the influence of bath memory and temperature on the teleportation fidelity, highlighting qualitative differences between different environments."}

Realizing this opportunity requires demonstrating quantum networking protocols, including quantum teleportation, under real-world conditions on existing telecom infrastructure. In this work, we demonstrate quantum teleportation over Deutsche Telekom's metropolitan fiber testbed in Berlin using commercial components deployed at the telecom datacenter. A local Bell-state measurement between 795 nm photons from a weak coherent source and from a bichromatic warm-atom entangled photon source enables conditional state transfer onto an O-band photon, which is transmitted through a 30-km field-deployed fiber loop under real-world environmental conditions. The teleported state is reconstructed after propagation via state tomography, achieving an average teleportation fidelity of 90\\% on the deployed link. System performance is evaluated in both the absence and the presence of co-propagating C-band classical traffic within the same fiber, demonstrating compatibility with wavelength-division multiplexed telecom infrastructure carrying live data channels."}

Main text: 10 pages", "summary": "Standard Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) struggle to scale to high-dimensional data due to the ``curse of dimensionality,'' which manifests as exponential simulation costs ($\\mathcal{O}(2^d)$) and untrainable Barren Plateaus. Existing solutions often bypass this by relying on classical neural networks for feature compression, obscuring the true quantum capability. In this work, we propose the \\textbf{Multi-Layer Fully-Connected VQC (FC-VQC)}, a modular architecture that performs \\textbf{end-to-end quantum learning} without trainable classical encoders. By restricting local Hilbert space dimensions while enabling global feature interaction via structured block mixing, our framework achieves \\textbf{linear scalability $\\mathcal{O}(d)$}. We empirically validate this approach on standard benchmarks and a high-dimensional industrial task: \\textbf{300-asset Option Portfolio Pricing}. In this regime, the FC-VQC breaks the ``Classical Ceiling,'' outperforming state-of-the-art Gradient Boosting baselines (XGBoost/CatBoost) while exhibiting \\textbf{$\\approx 17\\times$ greater parameter efficiency} than Deep Neural Networks. These results provide concrete evidence that pure, modular quantum architectures can effectively learn industrial-scale feature spaces that are intractable for monolithic ansatzes."}

We show that bosonic interactions described by certain classes of quadratic and quartic Hamiltonians can be enhanced in this way while simultaneously overcoming noise and decoherence. In general, the amplification method enhances both desired and undesired interactions present in the system. Depending on the case, however, detrimental processes can be less amplified than the desired couplings. We leverage this observation to improve the fidelity for preparing Bell-type entangled states between two bosonic modes in the presence of noise and losses. We also investigate noise models for which the protocol either fails or partially achieves a loss-tolerant state preparation speedup. Our work facilitates faster preparation of complex quantum states and implementation of entangling gates in the presence of decoherence mechanisms."}

Although demonstrated over short-range free-space links, long-distance implementations of intermodal quantum key distribution remain challenging, due to turbulence-induced wavefront aberrations which limit efficient single-mode fiber coupling at the optical receiver. Here, we demonstrate a real-time intermodal quantum key distribution field trial over an 18 km free-space link, connecting a remote terminal to an urban optical ground station equipped with a 40 cm-class telescope. An adaptive optics system, implementing direct wavefront sensing and high-order aberration correction, enables efficient single-mode fiber coupling and allows secure key generation of 200 bit/s using a compact state analyzer equipped with room-temperature detectors. We further validate through experimental data a turbulence-based model for predicting fiber coupling efficiency, providing practical design guidelines for future intermodal quantum networks."}

The dynamics is described by the Schrödinger equation on a curved spatial background and, when included, by minimal coupling to a magnetic vector potential incorporating an Aharonov--Bohm flux. After separation of variables, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional radial eigenvalue equation governed by an effective potential that combines torsion-induced Coulomb-like and centrifugal-like structures with magnetic/flux-dependent terms and optional model interactions. Because closed-form analytic solutions are not reliable over the parameter ranges required for systematic scans, we compute spectra and eigenfunctions numerically by formulating the radial equation as a self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville problem and solving it with a finite-difference discretization on a truncated radial domain, with explicit convergence control. We analyze four representative scenarios: (i) no external potential, (ii) Cornell-type confinement, (iii) Kratzer-type interaction, and (iv) the small-oscillation regime around the minimum of a Morse potential. We present systematic trends of the low-lying levels as functions of the torsion parameter, magnetic field, and azimuthal sector, and we show that geometric couplings alone can produce effective confinement even in the absence of an external interaction."}

We show that, at short distance, GCTNS correspond to free Lifshitz vacua, establishing a connection between certain entanglement properties of the two. Two schemes to approximate ground states of (free) bosonic field theories using GCTNS are presented: rational approximants to the exact dispersion relation and Trotterized imaginary-time evolution. We apply them to Klein-Gordon theory and characterize the resulting approximations, identifying the energy scales at which deviations from the target theory appear. These results provide a simple and analytically controlled setting to assess the strengths and limitations of GCTNS as variational ansätze for relativistic quantum fields."}

Using the Rényi-2 genuine multi-entropy $\\mathrm{GM}^{(\\mathtt{q})}_2$ as a diagnostic of genuine $\\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement, we establish this behavior in $(2+1)$-dimensional gapped free-fermion lattices with correlation length $ξ$.

We observe the same pattern for $\\mathtt{q}=3$ (tripartite) and $\\mathtt{q}=4$ (quadripartite) cases, and further corroborate this localization by translating the junction at fixed system size. We also provide a geometric explanation of the junction law in holography.

We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons.
