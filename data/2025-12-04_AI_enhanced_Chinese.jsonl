Building on prior work that used 2D ion crystals to investigate one-dimensional (1D) nanofriction and orientational melting, we leverage this foundation to extend friction studies from linear ion chains and planar rings to 3D shell structures. Using molecular-dynamics simulations, we first map shell formation as a function of ion number $N$ and the trapping aspect ratio, yielding a simple relation that can aid ion-number estimation in experiments. We compute a Peierls--Nabarro-type energy landscape for the rotation of the outer shell against the inner core, showing drastic changes in the effective energy barrier up to a factor of about 60 with only small changes in $N$. Using dynamical simulations, we apply rotational torques to the outer shell of selected systems and show that small changes in $N$ impact the commensurability between shells and can, in some cases, induce a hysteretic response due to torque-induced metastable states. We find that spatially varying coupling to the inner-core corrugation can create coexisting fast and slow moving domains within the rotating outer shell, realizing multidimensional friction where intra-shell shear and inter-shell nanofriction act simultaneously.

Starting from a free-running comb state at low bias (1.3Ith), we identify clear bifurcation routes as the external feedback is increased. In the weak feedback regime (C<1), the frequency comb operation remains stable; as feedback increases to the moderate feedback regime (1<C<2.4), the system transitions through frequency splitting into period-one (P1) oscillations around each comb, followed by higher-order bifurcations (P2, P4, P8). Within the range 2.4<C<13.86, only combs with P1 states are observed, with the split frequency increasing continuously with feedback strength. In the strong feedback regime (C>13.86), complex feedback dynamics re-emerged but with significantly reduced complexity compared with the weak feedback regime. More interestingly, we show that optical feedback can induce chaotic THz emission at higher bias current conditions (>1.6Ith), when the free-running laser output (C=0) is originally a stable frequency comb. The resulting chaotic dynamics, characterized by broadband spectra and large positive Lyapunov exponents, are shown to depend strongly on the linewidth enhancement factor. Although THz QCLs widely considered as ultrastable under external perturbations, this work provides the first detailed report of chaotic dynamics and routes to chaos in THz QCLs under optical feedback. These findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in THz QCLs but also open new possibilities for exploiting applications of chaotic light in THz sensing, imaging and secure communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

They are used in state of the art methods of measuring high-energy particles and radiation sources. Most existing methods use fast single-pixel detectors to detect and time scintillation events. Cameras provide spatial resolution but can only capture an average over many events, making it difficult to image the events associated with an individual particle. Emerging single-photon avalanche diode cameras combine speed and spatial resolution to enable capturing images of individual events. This allows us to use machine vision techniques to analyze events, enabling new types of detectors. The main challenge is the very low brightness of the events. Techniques have to work with a very limited number of photons.\n  We propose a kaleidoscopic scintillator to increase light collection in a single-photon camera while preserving the event's spatial information. The kaleidoscopic geometry creates mirror reflections of the event in known locations for a given event location that are captured by the camera. We introduce theory for imaging an event in a kaleidoscopic scintillator and an algorithm to estimate the event's 3D position. We find that the kaleidoscopic scintillator design provides sufficient light collection to perform high-resolution event measurements for advanced radiation imaging techniques using a commercial CMOS single-photon camera.

Beam tuning in such machines is traditionally performed manually, a process that can be slow, non-optimal, and difficult to execute in the presence of faults or changing conditions. To address this, we developed and deployed a machine learning (ML) based tuning framework on the Injector 2 cyclotron at PSI, chosen as an ideal testbed for high-power operation. The system combined a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm with real-time diagnostics and control, and incorporated accelerator-physics inspired adaptations such as an overshoot strategy that reduced magnetic field settling times by nearly a factor of six. Over an extensive 12-day operational test campaign, relatively long in the context of real-time ML experiments, the ML agent successfully tuned the machine across multiple operating points, achieving convergence within hours and maintaining stable beam extraction with reduced losses.

Thereby, if captured by stars, they could conceivably make their presence known through stellar wobbles picked up by means of Doppler spectroscopy in the radial velocity method, or alternatively through microlensing. In our analysis of such data, we have identified potential PBH contenders by ruling out any exoplanet candidates that have been detected through direct imaging or transit methods, as they would have sizes consistent with planets rather than PBHs.

However, existing control strategies face challenges such as imprecise trajectory tracking, interaction torque oscillations, and limited adaptability to diverse patient conditions. To address these issues, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control algorithm that integrates a human-robot coupling dynamics model, a human torque-momentum observer (HTMO), and an adaptive parameter controller (APC). The algorithm first employs inverse dynamics to compute the joint torques required for the rehabilitation trajectory. The HTMO then estimates the torque exerted by the patient's joints and determines the torque error, which the exoskeleton compensates for via a spring-damper system, ultimately generating the target trajectory. Finally, the APC ensures adaptive assistive control.

We present the design, integration, and validation of a fully automated closed-loop DHM system engineered for high-throughput mechanical characterization of biological cells. The system integrates automated serpentine scanning, real-time YOLO-based object detection, and a high-performance, multi-threaded software architecture using pinned memory and SPSC queues. This design enables the GPU-accelerated reconstruction pipeline to run fully in parallel with the 50 fps data acquisition, adding no sequential overhead. A key contribution is the validation of a robust, multi-stage holographic autofocus strategy; we demonstrate that a selected metric (based on a low-pass filter and standard deviation) provides reliable focusing for noisy holograms where conventional methods (e.g., Tenengrad, Laplacian) fail entirely. Performance analysis of the complete system identifies the 2.23-second autofocus operation-not reconstruction-as the primary throughput bottleneck, resulting in a 9.62-second analysis time per object. This work delivers a complete functional platform for autonomous DHM screening and provides a clear, data-driven path for future optimization, proposing a hybrid brightfield imaging modality to address current bottlenecks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the design of new surfactants using traditional methods is often time-consuming, complex, and largely based on trial and error. Recent studies have incorporated data-driven and computational approaches to generate new surfactants and predict properties of surfactants, but most of these approaches either optimize on a single property or train on a small number of surfactants. In this work, we investigate the generative capabilities of an existing graph diffusion based inverse design model and a transformer based molecule optimization model, for non-ionic surfactants. We train both models to generate non-ionic surfactants based on single- and multi-property values, predict the same properties o using trained property predictor models for generated molecules, and validate a few them using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the inverse design model is better at generating a diverse set of molecules, while the transformer is better at generating molecules which satisfy input property constraints better. We also observe that molecules generated using single property condition, on average, satisfy the input property condition better when compared to molecules generated using multiple property conditions. From molecular dynamics simulations, we observe that the predicted properties of the selected molecules are close to the simulated results concluding that both methods are capable of generating surfactants that actually satisfy input property condtions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u6027\u5242\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u4e2a\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6e05\u6d01\u5242\u548c\u53bb\u6c61\u5242\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u6027\u5242\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e transformer \u7684\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u6027\u5242\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u8f93\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u6027\u5242\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We employ the formulation of field theory in terms of $L_{\\infty}$ algebras together with their homotopy transfer, which here maps the gauge redundant fields of gravity to gauge invariant fields.

These behaviors arise from the intrinsic magnetization dynamics of the MTJ and do not require any additional control circuitry. By interconnecting the NMOS+MTJ neurons, we construct a model of an analog multilayer network that learns through spike-timing-dependent weight updates derived from a gradient-descent rule, with both training and inference modeled in the analog domain.

Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on the recent GWTC-4.0 dataset, we compare these features across all models and assess how well each scenario explains the data. We find that the data strongly favor the presence of a positive correlation between mass and spin magnitude, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the hierarchical scenario provides a better fit to the observations, due to the inclusion of second-generation mergers leading to higher spins at larger masses. The current dataset is not informative enough about spin orientation: the cluster (random orientations) and AGN (aligned orientations) scenarios have comparable Bayesian evidence.

The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.\n  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.\n  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state.

While Shapley value-based methods offer mathematically principled explanations by quantifying each component's contribution to predictions, computing exact values requires evaluating $2^n$ coalitions (or aggregating over $n!$ permutations), which is intractable for real-world graphs. Existing approximation strategies sacrifice either fidelity or efficiency, limiting their practical utility. We introduce QGShap, a quantum computing approach that leverages amplitude amplification to achieve quadratic speedups in coalition evaluation while maintaining exact Shapley computation. Unlike classical sampling or surrogate methods, our approach provides fully faithful explanations without approximation trade-offs for tractable graph sizes. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic graph datasets, demonstrating that QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding the performance of classical methods across all evaluation metrics. These results collectively demonstrate that QGShap not only preserves exact Shapley faithfulness but also delivers interpretable, stable, and structurally consistent explanations that align with the underlying graph reasoning of GNNs.

In concentrated electrolytes, however, electrostatic and steric correlations, together with ion-solvent coupling, give rise to complex behavior, such as underscreening, that remains challenging to explain despite extensive theoretical effort. Using molecular dynamics simulations of primitive electrolytes with and without space-filling solvent particles, we elucidate the structural and dynamical crossovers and their connection that emerge with increasing salt concentration. Explicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition from a charge-dominated dilute regime to a density-dominated concentrated regime, accompanied by dynamical crossovers in ion self-diffusion and ion-pair lifetimes. These dynamical crossovers display a marked discontinuity, unlike the smoother variation of the screening crossover, which originates from short-range ion-counterion structures.

Both structural and dynamical behaviors are found to depend sensitively on ion-solvent coupling: implicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition between two charge-dominated regimes, accompanied by qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior.

Why the universe has such these values is one of the deepest questions in science. Here we propose that these constants arise from quantum mechanics itself. By enlarging the configuration space of quantum cosmology, we treat the constants of nature as part of the wavefunction of the universe. The universal wavefunction contains support for many possible sets of constants, and early-universe processes cause these possibilities to decohere into distinct classical universes. Our universe is one such branch, compatible with complexity and life. We defined the Grand Hilbert Space as the direct sum of U-sectors, each representing a distinct set of physical laws. We derived the Meta-Wheeler--DeWitt equation, which governs the dynamics of the theory parameters. We showed that in the Planck era, the kinetic terms for these parameters are active, creating a state of primordial coherence where the laws of physics effectively fluctuate. This formalism offers a quantitative tool for high-energy physics. We proposed that the total integrated amplitude over theory space serves as a Bayesian evidence metric, allowing for the statistical comparison of rival microscopic theories based on their fertility in generating habitable sectors.

Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed.

While current devices are based on continuous Bi films, integrating ultrathin films around the percolation threshold with a tailored morphology promises to enable more compact devices with a wider tunability range and/or enhanced optical response. In this context, we report the tailoring of the morphology and UV-Vis-NIR effective optical dielectric function ( $\\varepsilon$= $\\varepsilon_1$+i$\\varepsilon_2$) of ultrathin Bi films around the percolation threshold. Just below percolation, the films effective optical permittivity $\\varepsilon_1$ differs markedly from that of a continuous film, as it turns from negative to positive while its effective optical loss $\\varepsilon_2$ is reduced.

Four FRs derived from hydrothermal and ethylene glycol-pretreated corn stover were pyrolyzed at 700\u00b0C. Multi-model kinetic analyses revealed diffusion-controlled mechanisms with activation energies ranging from 157 to 278 kJ/mol, while thermodynamic profiling highlighted the influence of feedstock composition on reaction spontaneity and entropy. Pyrolysis effectively restored porosity compromised during fermentation, yielding biochar with tailored properties: microporous BC3 (185 m2/g) from oxygen-rich precursors and mesoporous BC4 (76.58 m2/g) from graphitized residues. When reintroduced into PFHP, BC3 maximized cumulative hydrogen yield (570 mL) via pH buffering, and BC4 achieved the highest production rate (14.91 mL/h) through electron shuttle mechanisms. The integrated process concurrently generated syngas, bio-oil, and catalytic biochar, enabling waste valorization, renewable energy output, and process enhancement within a circular bioeconomy

We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \\emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state.

Conventional approaches, however, predominantly rely on bulky optical components, leading to considerably high fabrication costs and limited integration density. Here, we introduce a passive photonic integrated circuit capable of precisely determining the polarization state of visible free-space light. An silicon nitride on-chip architecture employing a compact polarization-splitting grating coupler and a set of passive interferometers encodes the polarization information into intensity signals, allowing conventional detectors to accurately reconstruct the polarization state. With increasing compactness of photonic components, however, susceptibility to fabrication tolerances as well as intrinsic design constraints increases, potentially leading to non\\-/ideal behaviour. To address this, we introduce a robust calibration procedure that enables precise measurements even in the presence of imperfections. The chip design, combined with the calibration procedure, offers a robust, small-footprint, and high-speed approach to polarimetry, enabling a wide range of applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "A compact photonic integrated circuit is presented for precision polarization measurement, with a robust calibration procedure to handle manufacturing imperfections.", "motivation": "Polarization is a critical property of light with wide-ranging applications, but direct measurement is challenging.

The drastically different situation appears in the tangential motions of charged test particles due to the magnetic field. The trajectory of a charged test particle in the black hole with the magnetic field of the order of 10 Gauss near the black hole, is confined on a very thin cone as long as the specific angular momentum of the particle is not much larger than the gravitational radius of the black hole times the speed of light. This result leads to a possibility that a plasma lump can hover over the black hole and is very hot, in the monopole magnetic field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u7535\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u62e5\u6709\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e14\u5d4c\u5165\u5355\u6781\u78c1\u573a\u6240\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f84\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0e\u6ca1\u6709\u78c1\u573a\u65f6\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u82e5\u9075\u5b88Maxwell\u901f\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5219\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f1a\u5e26\u4e0a\u7535\u8377\u3002\u78c1\u573a\u4f1a\u5bf9\u6a2a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u9525\u4f53\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u5355\u6781\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5757\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u975e\u5e38\u7d27\u5bc6\u4e14\u9ad8\u6e29\u3002", "motivation": "holes and fields", "method": "the radial motion is treated as the same equation as without the magnetic field, but the magnetic field significantly affects the motion in other directions.", "result": "horizons and fields", "conclusion": "Charged test particles' motions are significantly influenced by magnetic fields, especially in confined and extreme environments like near black holes."}}

Yet key thermal assumptions, chiefly a Gibbs-distributed output ensemble, remain unverified in the large-scale regime. Here, we experimentally and quantitatively assess Gibbs sampling fidelity across system sizes spanning over three orders of magnitude. We explore a wide parameter space of coupling strengths, system sizes, annealing times, and D-wave hardware architectures. We find that the naively assumed scaling law for the effective temperature requires a non-negligible, coupling-independent offset that is robust across machines and parameter regimes, quantifying residual non-thermal effects that still conform to an effective Gibbs description. These non-idealities are further reflected in a systematic discrepancy between the physical temperature inferred from the sampled ensemble and the nominal cryogenic temperature of the device. Our results systematically assess the viability of quantum annealers as experimental platforms for probing classical thermodynamics, correct previous assumptions, and provide a physically grounded thermometry framework to benchmark these machines for future thermodynamic experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For all rational values of the parameter $b^2\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ -- corresponding in 2d CFT to all rational central charge values in the domain $(-\\infty,1]\\cup[25,\\infty)$ -- we establish two main results. First, in the domain $c\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{[25,\\infty)}$ we show that the modular and fusion kernels derived by Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov respectively can be expressed as a linear combination of two functions, which (i) are themselves admissible crossing kernels, (ii) have square-root branch point singularities in the Liouville momenta, (iii) are not reflection-symmetric in the Liouville momenta. These features illustrate that the space of solutions to the basic shift relations determining these kernels is broader than previously assumed. Second, in the domain $c\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{(-\\infty,1]}$ we derive for the first time the physical modular and fusion kernels for generic values of the Liouville momenta. These can again be written as a linear combination of two other admissible kernels but overall, and unlike the Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov solutions for $c\\geq 25$, they possess square-root branch point singularities. As a corollary, we demonstrate that timelike Liouville theory at $c\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{(-\\infty,1]}$ is crossing symmetric and modular covariant. Surprisingly, the crossing kernels at any $b^2\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{\\times}$ behave as if they were semiclassical and one-loop exact, and we discuss the interpretation of this fact in the context of the 2d conformal bootstrap and the 3d TQFT that captures pure 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\uff08CFT\uff09\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u573a\u8bba\uff08TQFT\uff09\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u878d\u5408\u5185\u6838\u7684\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6709\u7406\u6570\u7684\u53c2\u6570b\u00b2\u2208\u211a\u00d7\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5185\u6838\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22CFT\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u6838\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5bf9\u5185\u6838\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u8d28\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5408\u7406\u6570\u53c2\u6570b\u00b2\u2208\u211a\u00d7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u6838\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u6838\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5185\u6838\u7a7a\u95f4\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u5b83\u4eec\u5728Liouville\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0a\u6709\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u5206\u652f\u70b9\u5947\u70b9\u800c\u4e0d\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u5c04\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8de8\u73b0\u8c61\u8868\u660e\u4e86Liouville\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728c\u2208\u211a\u5de6\u534a\u533a\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u53c2\u6570\u57df\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5185\u6838\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e semiclassical \u548c\u4e00\u9636\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5171\u5f62 Bootstrap \u53ca\u4e09\u7ef4 TQFT \u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d1f cosmological \u5e38\u6570\u7684\u7eaf 3d \u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We derive an exact all-order relation between the beta functions of the two couplings, revealing a Renormalization Group invariant, a new dimensionless expansion parameter $\u039b_\u03b5/ \u039b_g$ into the study of YM theory.

As the kinetic coupling is turned on, a mass gap and confinement scale emerge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u6781\u9650\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u5c55\u5f00\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u81ea\u7531\u6027\u8d28\u548c ranormalization \u7fa4\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u771f\u7a7a\u7531\u6709\u9650\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u586b\u5145\uff0c\u4e14\u672c\u5730\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u4ee3\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u578b\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u5927\u5c0f\u7684 $\r^3 \times s^1$ \u4e0a\u7d27\u5316\uff0c\u771f\u7a7a\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6c14\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5f53\u542f\u7528\u52a8\u91cf\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u548c\u675f\u7f1a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u81ea\u7531\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 renormalization \u7fa4\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u771f\u7a7a\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u91cf\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\u540e\uff0c\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u51fa\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u548c\u675f\u7f1a\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u578b\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5728 SDYM \u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u663e\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u7a7a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5355\u6781\u5b50instanton \u6c14\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u81ea\u7531\u548c\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u7167\u70b9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In altermagnets, a recently discovered class of even-parity collinear magnets with $C_n\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, conventional second-order responses are prohibited by an emergent $C_{2z}$ symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field lifts this prohibition, inducing a planar magnetotransport that directly probes the intrinsic quantum geometry and the distinctive $C_n\\mathcal{T}$ nature of altermagnetic orders. We show that the field-dependent quantum geometric susceptibility generates versatile planar magnetotransport, including the planar Hall effects and nonreciprocal responses.

The formation of these vortices induces rotational or turbulent flows, which profoundly alter the fluid properties and revise those dark matter models describing axion condensates, ultralight boson clouds, and other scalar fields in the vicinity of spinning black holes. As macroscopic, quantum, and topological defects, these vortices can stably orbit the black hole over extended periods, establishing their viability as novel probes for investigating black hole physics. For instance, we calculate the angular velocities of orbiting vortices to quantitatively characterize the frame-dragging effect, a classic prediction of general relativity. Additionally, we observe that relatively large vortices are accreted onto the black hole, wrapping around it while undergoing splitting and reconnecting processes. In quantum fluids with high vortex densities, turbulent flows emerge, accompanied by the formation of a vortex boundary layer near the event horizon. Beyond the ergosphere, we find vortex emissions and energetic outbursts, which may provide crucial insights into analogous astrophysical events recently discovered by the XRISM satellite.", "AI":

Realizing accurate analog simulations requires high-fidelity time-dependent pulse control, yet existing calibration schemes are tailored to digital gate characterization and cannot be readily extended to learn continuous pulse trajectories. We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses.

Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases.

Unlike other mechanisms of phase conjugation, the perfect time-domain lens time-reverses both the propagating waves and the evanescent part of the spectrum. Moreover, we find that the time-reversed wave can be slowed down or accelerated, depending on the refractive index ratio. We show that this effect remains strong even when the refractive index varies arbitrarily slow, in sharp contradistinction to time-reflection which necessitates large index changes at sub-cycle rates. This is the first avenue found to yield significant negative-frequency waves using a temporal interface without the need for sub-cycle modulation or impedance matching.

Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model.", "AI": {"tldr": "papers show that counterdiabatic driving, while adiabatic internally, requires energy expenditure in the form of excess work, which can be quantified and used to optimize the driving protocol.", "motivation": "understanding the energy cost of quantum driving protocols is essential for optimizing them and minimizing energy consumption.The counterdiabatic method, which achieves adiabatic dynamics without dissipation, raises questions about its energetics and practicality.", "method": "the paper draws on the mandelstam-tamm bound to relate the adiabaticity of counterdiabatic driving to the spreading of energy between eigenstates during the process.the authors propose a new interpretation of the counterdiabatic hamiltonian parameters to capture the energy cost, which traditional methods miss.", "result": "by introducing this new approach, they successfully quantify the excess work as the driving protocol's energy cost and apply it to the landau-zener model, demonstrating practical application and effectiveness.", "conclusion": "the paper bridges a gap in understanding the energetics of counterdiabatic driving and opens new possibilities for optimizing such protocols by accounting for the energy cost."}}

We first derive the Carrollian version of the scattering equations in Minkowski space and their associated Carrollian amplitude formulae, by direct Fourier transform from momentum space and from ambitwistor strings with a Carrollian basis of vertex operators.

The critical radius is found to change with the spacetime dimensions. Starting from the usual four dimensions it is noted that as the dimension increases the critical radius decreases, attains a minimum at a specific dimension ($D>4$) and thereafter increases again. The mass accretion rate for isotropic fluid is determined using Hamiltonian formalism. The maximum mass accretion rate for RN BH with different equations of state parameters is studied in addition to spacetime dimensions.

Existing RR monitors often suffer from baseline drift over time, breaths can be occluded by limb or body movements, and many systems struggle to resolve shallow or extreme thoracic motion.

The sensor comprises a fiber cavity whose portion is embedded into a flexible chest binder in a sinusoidal-like pattern, which the patient wears. Thoracic expansion and contraction during breathing modulate the cavity, and RR is extracted through CAPS measurements.

In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations -- modeled as damped sinusoids -- directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $\u03b6$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $\u03b6$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $\u03b6$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity.

A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53MnBi2Te4 nanostructure\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u78c1\u573a\uff0855 T\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations\uff08SDHO\uff09\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u632f\u8361\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u78c1\u4e95\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684Hall\u68f1\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u632f\u8361\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50 wrappers\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u9762\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5149\u7535\u79bb\u8c31\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u56e0\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u800c\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f02\u5e38Hall\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u9762\u6001\u662f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u9762\u6001", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728MnBi2Te4 nanostructure\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u78c1\u573a\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe55 T\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Shubnikov-de-Haas\u632f\u8361\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08>40 T\uff09\u4e0b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u632f\u8361\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u632f\u8361\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86MnBi2Te4 nanostructure\u4e2d\u78c1\u6027\u8868\u9762\u6001\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86Shubnikov-de-Haas\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u632f\u8361\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u5305\u88f9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u9762\u6001\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7Landau\u80fd\u7ea7\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u9762\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdfShubnikov-de-Haas\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u5305\u88f9\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5229\u7528Landau\u80fd\u7ea7\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials.

Accepted for publication in the European Physical Journal C", "summary": "Motivated by integrating the dilaton field (as a UV correction) with dRGT-like massive gravity (as an IR correction) into Einstein gravity, we investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of black holes within this gravitational framework. We begin by reviewing the black hole solutions in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity, followed by an analysis of how various parameters influence on the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime and the event horizon of these black holes. In the subsequent section, we examine the conserved and thermodynamic quantities associated with these black holes, paying particular attention to the effects of parameters like $\u03b2$, $\u03b1$, and the massive parameters ($\u03b7_{1}$ and $\u03b7_{2}$) on their local stability by simultaneously evaluating the heat capacity and temperature. We also adopt an alternative method to study phase transitions using geometrothermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore how the parameters of Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity impacts the optical characteristics and radiative behavior of black holes.

To quantify the degree of linearity, we analyze the propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets in these waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such coupled-resonator waveguides can serve as versatile platforms for enabling directional atomic radiation and absorption. Beyond linear dispersion relations, more general forms, including quadratic and cubic relations, can also be achieved through tailored JNN-hoppings.

This reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity model shows a geometrically motivated dark energy component and naturally recovers General Relativity in the appropriate limit. The free parameters of the model are constrained using the latest DESI BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ exhibits excellent consistency with observational data, with high values of $R^2$ and low values of $\u03c7^2_{\\min}$, AIC, and BIC, confirming the model's strong statistical performance relative to $\u039b$CDM. With current $q(0) \\in [-0.40, -0.32]$ and a transition redshift $z_{\\text{tr}} \\sim 0.56$--$0.72$, the dynamical diagnostics show a smooth transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase. While the $Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a negative slope, indicating that the model is not $\u039b$CDM, the effective equation-of-state parameter $\u03c9_{\\text{eff}}(z)$ stays within the quintessence regime ($-1 < \u03c9_{\\text{eff}} < -1/3$). The analysis of classical energy conditions shows that the WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied throughout the cosmic evolution, with a violation of the SEC at lower-redshift, which is consistent with late-time acceleration. Linear homogeneous perturbation analysis further confirms the model's dynamical stability. Conclusively, the FHDE-inspired reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity provides a stable, observationally compatible, and geometrically motivated alternative to $\u039b$CDM, that successfully describes the late-time cosmic acceleration within the symmetric teleparallel framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer.

To help address this, we perform full 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device, building on earlier 2D modelling. We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons. Hence we identify key challenges and find operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Si/SiO2 (SiMOS) systems face challenges in achieving high-fidelity electron shuttling compared to Si/SiGe systems, but simulations reveal possible ways to improve reliability.", "motivation": "Understanding electron shuttling in SiMOS devices is vital due to their potential for advanced electronic applications, especially in semiconductor devices.", "method": "3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device were conducted, building on prior 2D models.", "result": "Simulations show that oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects can collapse electron shuttling to bucket-brigade mode, but increasing confinement restores conveyor-belt operation and improves reliability.", "conclusion": "SiMOS devices can achieve reliable charge transport under specific conditions, though challenges like oxide roughness and defects pose significant hurdles."}}

We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum.

For a real Wigner function the Gibbs--Shannon functional becomes complex; its imaginary part, proportional to the Wigner-negative volume, serves as an entropy-like measure of phase-space nonclassicality. A sign-resolved decomposition separates the total negative weight from its phase-space distribution and defines a negative-channel Fisher information that quantifies how sensitively the negative lobe reshapes as a control parameter is varied.

Each input message is mapped to a weighted graph via a discrete random walk on an n X n toroidal grid, where the walk dynamics determine the edge weights. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is then used to extract the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Unlike standard QPE settings, the phase estimation is performed with respect to a superposition state (a uniform superposition over all node basis states) rather than an eigenvector, ensuring that all eigencomponents contribute to the resulting spectrum. This yields spectral features that distinguish even co-spectral but non-isomorphic message-induced graphs. The final spectral fingerprint is converted into a 256-bit digest, producing a compact representation of the input. As the fingerprint encodes both spectral and dynamical properties of the message-induced graph, the resulting hash exhibits strong sensitivity to input perturbations and provides a structurally rich foundation for post-quantum hashing. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we implement QGH-256 on a 4 X 4 toroidal grid, chosen empirically: smaller grids exhibit collisions, whereas larger grids significantly increase execution time.

In this letter, we establish analytic bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation using non-Gaussian states undergoing dissipative bosonic evolution. By focusing on the short-time regime governed by a time-local master equation, we derive precise scaling laws that elucidate when and how non-Gaussian probes decisively outperform Gaussian states under identical energy constraints. Our analysis uncovers a distinct linear-in-time QFI enhancement unique to Fock states, in contrast to the inherently weaker, quadratic scaling of Gaussian probes. These theoretical insights are substantiated through exact numerical simulations and mapped onto experimentally accessible platforms such as circuit QED. Our results not only clarify the quantum thermometric advantage of non-Gaussianity but also chart a realistic pathway toward harnessing it in noisy quantum technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the metrological limits of temperature sensing in open quantum systems, focusing on non-Gaussian states and their performance compared to Gaussian states under identical energy constraints.

The paper addresses the unresolved metrological limits in open quantum systems, providing insights into the quantum thermodynamic advantage of non-Gaussian states in noisy environments, which is essential for practical quantum technologies. This motivates the exploration of the relationship between resourcefulness (non-Gaussianity) and thermometry, especially in terms of resource efficiency and practical implementation. The significance of this work depends on whether it bridges the gap between theoretical findings and practical applications for quantum sensors in realistic settings.", "method": "The authors use a combination of analytical methods, such as deriving bounds on QFI using non-Gaussian states under a time-local master equation, and numerical simulations. They focus on the short-time regime governed by a time-local master equation, which allows precise scaling analysis without approximating the quantum dynamics. This methodological approach enables them to compare non-Gaussian and Gaussian states and derive exact results applicable to any Gaussian probe state.", "result": "The key results are that non-Gaussian states outperform Gaussian states in temperature estimation, particularly in their linear-in-time QFI enhancement. Specifically, Fock states exhibit a unique linear scaling of QFI with time, which is stronger than the quadratic scaling of Gaussian states. These findings are physically intuitive, as non-Gaussianity increases the sensitivity to environmental interactions, providing a tractable method to enable sensing in realistic scenarios. The results are experimentally verifiable through numerical simulations and practical quantum technology platforms such as circuit QED.", "conclusion": "The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the metrological potential of non-Gaussian states in temperature sensing, revealing the conditions under which they outperform Gaussian states. The clear theoretical framework and the development of analytic bounds and scaling laws offer a foundation for extending this work to more complex quantum systems and real-world applications in quantum sensing and metrology."}}

Quantitatively imaging these fields with full vector information over extended areas remains a major challenge. Existing probes either offer nanoscale resolution at the cost of slow scanning, or widefield imaging with limited vector sensitivity or material constraints. Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to bridge this gap, but a practical camera-based vector magnetometry implementation on relevant microstructures has not been demonstrated. Here we adapt a commercial widefield microscope to implement a camera-compatible pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance protocol to reconstruct stray-field vectors from microscale devices. By resolving the Zeeman shifts of the four NV orientations, we reconstruct the stray-field vector generated by microfabricated permalloy structures that host multiple stable remanent states. Our implementation achieves a spatial resolution of $\\approx 0.52 ~\u03bc\\mathrm{m}$ across an $83~\u03bc\\mathrm{m} \\times 83~\u03bc\\mathrm{m}$ field of view and a peak sensitivity of $ (828 \\pm 142)~\\mathrm{nT\\,Hz^{-1}}$, with acquisition times of only a few minutes.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a cornerstone of classical scientific computing, and there is growing interest in whether quantum computers can accelerate such simulations. To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime. We lower bound the Reynolds number scaling of our quantum algorithm in dimension $D$ at Kolmogorov microscale resolution with $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{4}(1+\\frac{D}{2})} \\times q_M)$, where $q_M$ is a multiplicative overhead for data extraction with $q_M = O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{8}})$ for the drag force. This upper bounds the scaling improvement over classical algorithms by $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3D}{8}})$. However, our numerical investigations suggest a lower speedup, with a scaling estimate of $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{1.936} \\times q_M)$ for $D=2$.

However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural \"parallelization\" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In many examples of interacting quantum systems and random matrix models, this procedure is known to provide a reasonably accurate approximation to the exact numerical density of states. We review some of the examples that are known in the literature where this procedure works very well, and also discuss some of the limitations of this method in situations where the free probability approximation fails to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the exact density of states.

However, in many cases only a few broadband (temporal) modes are relevant before and after the nonlinear interaction. Here we present an efficient framework to calculate the relation between the quantum states at the input and output of a nonlinear element in their respective relevant modes. Since the number of relevant input and output modes may differ, resulting in an open quantum system, we introduce the generalized Bloch-Messiah decomposition (GBMD), reducing the description to an equal number of input and output modes. The GBMD enables us to calculate the multimode Wigner function of the output state by convolving the rescaled Wigner function of the reduced input quantum pulse with a multivariate Gaussian phase-space function. We expand on this result by considering two examples input states: A Fock state in a single broadband mode and a two-mode squeezed vacuum, both in the THz-frequency regime, up-converted to a single output broadband mode of optical frequencies. We investigate the effect, the convolution and thermalization due to entanglement breakage have on the output Wigner function by calculating the von Neumann entropy of the output Wigner function. The methods presented here can be used to optimize the amplification or frequency conversion of broadband quantum states, opening an avenue to the generation and characterization of optical quantum states on ultrafast time scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables.

Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4ee5\u5185\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u662f\u5426\u652f\u6301\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4ee5\u5185\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u516d\u8282\u70b9\u4ee5\u5185\u6240\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}
