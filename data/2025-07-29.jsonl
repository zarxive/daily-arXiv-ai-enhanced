It is shown that helical multifrequency undulators can\nbe employed as a bright and versatile source of photons in the states that are\nsuperpositions of the modes with definite projection of total angular momentum\n(TAM), amplitude, and relative phase. All these parameters of the state are\nreadily controlled by the undulator design. The explicit expression for the\namplitude of radiation of a twisted photon from a charged particle in the\nmultifrequency undulator is derived. The energy spectrum of radiation and the\nselection rules for the TAM projection of radiated photons are described. The\nsymmetry properties of the spectrum with respect to the TAM projection are\nestablished. The interpretation to the energy spectrum and to the selection\nrules is given in terms of virtual photons mediating between the charged\nparticle and the undulator. The results obtained are also applicable to\nradiation of twisted photons produced by ultrarelativistic charged particles\nmoving in plane multifrequency electromagnetic waves."}

Our analysis systematically covers spatial\ndimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the\napproximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction\npotentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell\npotentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering\nproblem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical\nexpressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct\ncomparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction\npotential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision\nmomenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings\nindicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with\nincreasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials.\nRemarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell\napproximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation\noffers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the\npotential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions\nfor quantum field theories."}

In this work, we\npresent the results from a three-dimensional hybrid model capable of operating\nat both high carrier densities and incorporating the effects of energetic\ndisorder. We first generate realistic morphologies using a phase-field approach\nthat accounts for solvent evaporation during film formation. Using these\nexample morphologies, we systematically study the interplay between energetic\ndisorder and configurational disorder at carrier densities representative of\nreal device operation. This enables us to separate and visualize the impact of\nthe nanomorphology and energetic disorder on device performance.

Here we show that partially coherent optical fields help\ncircumvent the worst-case-scenario of rapidly varying, strong optical\nscattering, even when the channel is rendered informationally opaque for\nconventional approaches. Using a channel in which the spatial and polarization\nDoFs are relevant, we encode the logical bits in the unitarily invariant\ncoherence rank (the number of non-zero eigenvalues of the field coherence\nmatrix) and prepare our partially coherent fields with maximal entropies of 0,\n1, 1.585, and 2 bits for rank-1, rank-2, rank-3, and rank-4 coherence matrices,\nrespectively. This scheme demonstrates scattering-immune optical communications\nwith 100 % fidelity. These results unveil an unexpected utility for partially\ncoherent light in optical communications through challenging environments."}

To this end we adopt the scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients\nas a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model\nof the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms,\nand ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue\nproblem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a\ngeometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice, orientation of the\nsurface cut, and the direction of SB wave -- that seeks the complex wavenumber\nnormal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber\nin the direction of the SB wave.

The\nmultilayer architecture, composed of alternating dielectric and metallic films,\nsupports mechanical resonances with quality factors reaching approximately ten\nthousand in the megahertz frequency range. These resonances coherently modulate\nthe optical field through radiation pressure and dynamical backaction. Power\nspectral density measurements reveal distinct mechanical peaks at 0.68, 2.9,\n4.3, 5.5, and 6.8 MHz, with optomechanical coupling strengths exceeding twice\nthe intrinsic baseline, enabling highly efficient signal transduction.\nLorentzian fitting confirms the presence of sharp mechanical linewidths, while\nthe total force noise, including thermal, shot, and technical contributions,\nremains below the threshold required for detecting sub-piconewton forces.\nTime-resolved Raman spectroscopy, which is typically insensitive to chirality,\nhere reveals enantioselective dynamics arising from asymmetric optomechanical\ninteractions, enabling clear spectral distinction between d- and l-enantiomers.\nFinite-element simulations validate the strong spatial overlap between optical\nconfinement and mechanical displacement modes.

Circular polarized SPDC-based sources\nwith efficient chiral response are currently missing, which severely precludes\nthe realization of a wide range of practical applications in quantum computing\nand communications.

The construction is based on an earlier proposal for light-ray anchoring\nto the asymptotic boundary and is uniquely fixed at the semiclassical level by\ndemanding that the notion of time translations for an observer at the\nasymptotic boundary of JT gravity should be extended into the bulk as the flow\nof a conformal isometry. Since conformal isometries are a necessary condition\nfor geometric modular flow, our construction is amenable as a candidate\ngeometric gravitational dressing that may be interpreted via the modular\ncrossed product, potentially connecting our choice of dressing with recent\ndevelopments on the literature on local observables in quantum gravity. Taking\nthis definition beyond the semiclassical regime, we compute quantum\ngravitational wormhole contributions to the black hole thermal atmosphere,\ndirectly producing a finite thermal entropy and leading to a quantum\ndescription of the stretched horizon in this model."}

We demonstrate that, by exploiting the\nstructure of the problem, the cost of the state preparation oracle can also be\nsubstantially reduced. We accomplish so by designing a parametrized family of\nefficient Dicke state preparation routines. We construct explicit block\nencoding circuits for representative spin models such as the Heisenberg and\nspin glass Hamiltonians and provide detailed, non-asymptotic gate counts. Our\nnumerical benchmarks validate the efficiency of the FOQCS-LCU approach,\nillustrating an order-of-magnitude improvement in CNOT count over conventional\nLCU. This framework opens the door to efficient block encodings of a broad\nclass of structured matrices beyond those explored here."}

We find strongly anomalous\nfluctuations, where the variance of the condensate number $\\delta N_{\\rm\nBEC}^2$ scales with the total atom number as $N^{1+\\gamma}$ with an exponent\naround $\\gamma_{\\rm theo}=0.74$ and $\\gamma_{\\rm exp}=0.62$, which we attribute\nto the 2D/3D crossover geometry and the interactions. Our study highlights the\nimportance of the trap geometry on the character of fluctuations and on\nfundamental quantum mechanical properties."}
