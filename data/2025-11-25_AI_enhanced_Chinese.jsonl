While up-conversion and optical Kerr gating (OKG) offer femtosecond resolution, they are generally limited to ensemble measurements, making ultrafast detection in nano-optics challenging. OKG, with its broadband response and high throughput without phase-matching, is especially promising when used at high repetition rates under focused illumination.\n  Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast detection scheme using the third-order nonlinearity of graphene and thin graphite films, operating at 1 GHz with sub-nanojoule pulses and achieving 141 fs temporal resolution. Their exceptionally large nonlinear refractive index, orders of magnitude higher than conventional Kerr media, enhances detection efficiency at smaller thicknesses, enables sub-picosecond response, and supports broadband operation. Their atomic-scale thickness minimizes dispersion and simplifies integration with microscopy platforms, optical fibers, and nanophotonic circuits, making them a compact, practical material platform for nano-optical and on-chip ultrafast Kerr gating.", "AI": {"tldr": "Graphene-based ultrafast Kerr gating achieves sub-nanojoule pulse generation and 141 fs resolution, offering a practical solution for sub-picosecond nano-optics.", "motivation": "The paper addresses the challenge of ultrafast optical detection, which is crucial for quantum science, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast spectroscopy.

In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $\u0394$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $\u0394$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $\u0394$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u0394-ML\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7269\u7247\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u58f0\u79f0\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5408\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5185\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u0394-ML\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u201c\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u201dCCSD(T)/CBS\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7269\u7247\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e0.1 kcal/mol\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u0394-ML\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5206\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u0394-ML\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u0394-ML\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Optical velocimetry and multi-channel pyrometry were used to obtain Hugoniot data, isentropic release paths, and interface temperature histories. The results validate a modified two-phase equation of state (EOS) for copper based on the framework of Greeff et al. The measured Hugoniot shows good agreement with the present model but exhibits significant softening above ~156 GPa relative to the original Greeff EOS, indicating that reduction in lattice specific heat becomes essential when shock temperatures exceed three times the melting point (T > 3Tm). Unloading behavior matches hydrodynamic simulations incorporating the recalibrated EOS, confirming its accuracy for off-Hugoniot states. Theoretical analysis of temperature release profiles suggests that the thermal conductivity of shocked copper powders may be considerably higher than first-principles predictions.

Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe2 and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe2, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components.

Unfortunately, current techniques for the production of these states remain technically challenging. Here we investigate the ability of twisted electron collisions to produce circular Rydberg states. Twisted electrons carry quantized orbital angular momentum that can be transferred to the electronic state of the atom, potentially providing an efficient means to generate circular Rydberg states. Using a fully quantum mechanical framework, we compute total excitation cross sections for circular Rydberg states of hydrogen, rubidium, and cesium targets using Bessel electron beams. Our models account for the full Bessel-beam structure of the incident electron and incorporate macroscopic target effects to model experimentally-relevant conditions. Our results show that twisted electrons with large opening angles produce significant enhancements in the excitation probability relative to plane-wave electrons, particularly for large opening angles and low energies. We trace this enhancement to contributions from projectiles with large values of orbital angular momentum.

The preservation of pairwise rankings across all combinations of functionals and basis sets provides crucial guidance for evolutionary optimization of nonlinear optical materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u57fa\u5e95\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0HF/3-21G\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u4e00\u7ea7\u5e8f\u6781\u5316\u77e9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u503c\u5f97\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548 Yet \u51c6\u786e\u7684 fitness functions\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u5408\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\uff08HF, PBE0, B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, M06-2X\uff09\u548c\u516d\u79cd\u57fa\u5e95\u51fd\u6570\uff083-21G, 6-31G, 6-31+G, 6-31+G**D, 6-31+G**Q, 6-31+G**N\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "HF/3-21G\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a45.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ec4\u5408\u90fd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86HF/3-21G\u4e3a\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u6781\u5316\u77e9\u9884\u6d4b\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the pyrochlore superconductor CsBi2 and spin liquid Pr2Ir2O7 at 0.3 K. For the first time, we obtained atomically resolved images of their (111) surfaces, revealing a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy in CsBi2 reveals a nearly fully opened superconductivity gap. The ratio of 2\u0394/kBTC = 4.7 suggests relatively strong coupling superconductivity, as compared with that in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs). In contrast to the previous study categorizing CsBi2 as a type-I superconductor, the applied magnetic field induces a hexagonal vortex lattice in which each vortex core exhibits an intriguing three-fold symmetry state. In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence. We discuss the relations of these many-body electronic phenomena with the pyrochlore lattice geometry and its charge or spin frustration. Our systematic observations offer atomic-scale insights into the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductors and spin liquids.", "AI": {"tldr":

When incident loads take the form of acoustic or vibrational waves, the ability to mechanically process information eliminates the need for transduction, paving the way for passive computing. Recent studies have proposed systems that learn and execute mechanical logic through buckling, bistability, and origami-inspired lattices. However, owing to the large timescales of shape morphing, such concepts suffer from slow operation or require active stimulation of adaptive materials. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach to mechanical logic, leveraging the rich dynamics of wave propagation in elastic structures. In lieu of traditional forward-design tools, such as band diagrams and transmission spectra, we employ a multi-faceted topology optimization approach, enabling us to identify candidate waveguide configurations within an extremely large design space. By incorporating voids within an otherwise uniform substrate, the optimized waveguides are able to precisely manipulate wave propagation paths, triggering desirable interferences of the scattered wavefield that culminate in energy localization at readouts corresponding to a given logic function. An experimental setup is used to demonstrate the efficacy of such logic gates and their resilience to non-uniform loading. By implementing these building blocks into a mechanical adder, we demonstrate the scalable deployment of more sophisticated mechanical computing circuits, opening up new avenues in mechanical signal processing and physical computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Each strategy is assessed using the Linear Logistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine classifiers. Our results show that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a small subset of frequencies. Particularly, when non-referenced spectra are applied. Furthermore, we show that the SFS-selected features align with the materials' absorption bands, confirming that the discriminative power arises from genuine spectroscopic contrasts.

While the WDW quantization of this model cannot avoid the big bang/big crunch singularity, it is replaced by a big bounce in LQC. We construct the Krylov basis analytically by applying the Lanczos algorithm and evaluate both the Krylov state and operator complexity. In regimes where the wave function of the universe is sharply peaked, our results indicate that the Krylov complexity grows quadratically with the scalar field clock for the state and operator complexities in both the WDW quantum cosmology and LQC. We further show that operator complexity is exactly twice the state complexity in these regimes. We discuss the interpretation of the global behavior of these systems by calculating the Krylov entropy for both quantum cosmological frameworks. We observe that in LQC, the Krylov complexity and entropy remain finite at the bounce, whereas in the WDW quantum cosmology, they diverge at the big bang/crunch singularity.

Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system.

The silicon platform offers several advantages, including significantly lower cost, CMOS compatibility, and mature fabrication processes.

The significance of this search lies in its fast and unmodeled approach, leveraging a cross-correlation technique to identify common signals across the detector network. As a result, this method serves as an excellent alternative to search for unknown or poorly modeled continuous wave sources and narrowband components of the gravitational wave (GW) background. For continuous wave sources whose waveform can be modeled, this method can serve as the first stage of a hierarchical scheme by identifying sub-threshold candidates to be followed up with more optimal but computationally expensive searches. The ASAF search, however, presently suffers from beam smearing, where multiple candidates may arise due to the same noise fluctuations, detector artifact, or a GW source. This can reduce the detection probability in follow-up analyzes, especially with limited computing resources. To mitigate this issue and reduce the number of correlated and unnecessary candidates, we introduce a novel Peak Finder algorithm. This algorithm helps identifying the most representative candidates while preserving detection sensitivity, thereby allowing follow up of a much larger number of independent candidates. The reduction in correlated samples leads to a significant reduction in False Dismissal Rate (FDR) using the Peak Finder method compared to the Full-sky method. For instance, following up 2 Peak Finder candidates at 30 Hz reduces FDR by a factor of 3.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u627e\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728 <!-- tldr \u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7b80\u8981\u603b\u7ed3\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u8d21\u732e\u3002-->\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5bfb\u627e\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790LIGO\u548cVirgo\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5019\u9009\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u5728ASAF\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u540e\u7eed\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9519\u8bef dismissal\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In attosecond science, attosecond pulses have been regarded as classical waves, applied to probe electron dynamics on their natural time scale. Here, we transfer fundamental concepts of quantum optics into attosecond physics, enabling control of both the properties of the XUV attosecond pulses and the quantum fluctuations of matter on attosecond time scales. By combining bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) with a strong laser field to drive high-harmonic generation, we transfer the quantum properties of the BSV onto the resulting XUV attosecond pulses. Applying advanced attosecond interferometry, we reconstruct the quantum state of the XUV high harmonics and their associated attosecond pulses with attosecond precision. Finally, we resolve the squeezing of the electron's wavepacket during one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena - field induced tunneling. The ability to measure and control quantum correlations in both electrons and XUV attosecond pulses establishes a foundation for attosecond quantum electrodynamics, manipulating the quantum state of electrons and photons with sub-cycle precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5165\u5230\u65f6\u77ed\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u5f3a\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6ce2\u5305\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u77ed\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u7535\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u95e8\u5b66\u79d1 previously \u5206\u79bb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5c06 bright squeezed vacuum\uff08\u5f3a\u538b\u7f29\u771f\u7a7a\uff09\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a71\u52a8\u9ad8\u8c03\u8c10\u5149\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u65f6\u77ed\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65f6\u77ed\u5e72\u6d89\u6280\u672f\u6765\u91cd\u6784\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u77ed\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6253\u4e0b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u4e9a\u5206\u6ce2\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5165\u5230\u65f6\u77ed\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To improve computational accuracy, Davidson corrections, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and core-valence electron correlations effects are incorporated into the calculations. The potential energy curves (PECs) of 21 electronic states associated with the two lowest dissociation limits are obtained. The dipole moments (DMs) of the 21 electronic states of ICl+ are systematically studied, and the variations of DMs of the identical symmetry state in the avoided crossing regions are elucidated by analyzing the dominant electronic configuration. With the help of the calculated SOC matrix element, the interaction between crossing states can be elucidated. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements involving the several states are calculated. By analyzing potential energy curves of these states and the nearby electronic states, the possible predissociation channels are provided. Based on the computed PECs, the spectroscopic constants of bound states are determined. The comparison of the spectroscopic constants including and excluding SOC effect indicates that the SOC effect has an obvious correction to the spectroscopic properties of low-lying states. Finally, the transition properties between excited states and the ground state are studied.

This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar.

An efficient variant, TDDFT with resolution of the identity and a minimal auxiliary basis (TDDFT-ris), has been developed to accelerate excitation energy calculations. However, the formulation and implementation of analytical derivatives for this method have not yet been reported. In this work, we present an implementation of analytical excited-state gradients and derivative couplings within the TDDFT-ris framework. Benchmark calculations on medium-sized organic molecules demonstrate a two- to three-fold speedup for both gradients and derivative couplings compared to standard TDDFT. The accuracy of the TDDFT-ris approach is assessed for gradient-dependent applications, including geometry optimizations, emission energy calculations, and the localization of minimum-energy crossing points. Overall, the TDDFT-ris method provides reliable approximations for most cases, with noticeable errors mainly occurring in derivative couplings between nearly degenerate states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this framework, the overlap matrix between two corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is derived from diagonalizing the real-space Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. The pass-ordered product of overlap matrices around the BZ boundary forms a Wilson loop, and defines the Chern number in real space. It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization.

Based on the capacitance operator formulation, which provides a first-order approximation of the spectral properties of dimer-type block resonator systems in the subwavelength regime, we show that a two-fold topological characterization of a block disordered resonator chain is available if it is of dominated type. The topological index used for the characterization is a generalization of the Zak phase associated with one-dimensional chiral-symmetric Hamiltonians. As a manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence principle, we prove that a localized interface mode occurs whenever the system consists of two semi-infinite chains with different topological characters.

From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7Moreau--Yosida\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6cdb\u51fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528Moreau--Yosida\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f7f\u6cdb\u51fd\u8fde\u7eed\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u5bfc\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301 positivity \u548c\u51f8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Kohn--Sham\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6cdb\u51fd\u80fd\u591f\u8fde\u7eed\u5e76\u53ef\u5bfc\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aKohn--Sham\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5927\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The issue of whether $d$-wave superconductivity (SC) occurs in the square-lattice Hubbard model with $U$ of order of the bandwidth has been one of the most debated issues to emerge from the study of high temperature SC. Here, we report variational results on eight-leg cylinders with next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the range $-0.5 t \\leq t'\\leq 0.25 t$ with $U = 8t$ and $12t$ and doped hole concentrations $\u03b4=1/12$ and $1/8$. For $t'\\leq 0$, the ground-state appears to be a charge-density wave (CDW) of one sort or another with SC correlations that are extremely short-ranged. In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit.

Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, \"Phase-Modulated-sideband $\\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing\" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity.

Here, we design a practically realizable tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. This model respects eight-fold rotational and chiral symmetries, resulting in a higher-order topological phase with eight zero-energy corner modes that have no crystalline counterparts. We experimentally explore the topological phase in an acoustic quasicrystal. Surprisingly, we also discover symmetry-protected zero-energy modes near the center of the quasicrystal in a topologically trivial phase, a phenomenon not seen in crystals. We further experimentally observe these modes in a topologically trivial acoustic quasicrystal.

Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models.

The modern numerical derivation of the 27 $B_k^q$ Stevens crystal field parameters (CFPs), which describe the splitting of the energy levels of a central ion, is traditionally achieved through the effective Hamiltonian theory and multiconfiguration wavefunction theory calculations, insofar as the lowest $J$ level fully captures the targeted low-energy physics. In this work, we present a novel theoretical approach for determining the CFPs. The procedure resembles the traditional extraction path but crucially accounts for the full $\\ket{J,M_J}$ space of an ion configuration with $L=3$ and $S=\\nicefrac{1}{2}$. By demonstrating the extraction procedure using the simplest case of a Ce$^\\text{III}$ 4f$^1$ ion with a crystal-field split $J \\in \\{\\nicefrac{5}{2}, \\nicefrac{7}{2}\\}$ manifold, it is shown for the first time that a unique set of CFPs describes the splitting and mixing both the $J$ manifolds. In fact, this $J/J^\\prime$ mixing is analogous to the ``spin mixing'' in binuclear transition metal complexes. At the employed level of calculation, we demonstrate that there is no spin-orbit coupling influence on the CFP values, contrary to previous beliefs. This work represents the first step of a larger effort in reviewing the theory and extraction procedures of CFPs in f-element complexes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u6458\u8981\u7528\u5199\u7684\u6bd4\u8bba\u6587\u672c\u8eab\u8fd8\u957f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7ed3\u6784\u5305\u62ec\u603b\u7ed3\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u8bba\u548c\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3 f-\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u590d\u5408\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u79bb\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u591a\u914d\u7f6e\u6001\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u53d6 f-\u5143\u7d20\u590d\u5408\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u660e\u786e f-\u5143\u7d20\u79bb\u5b50\u5728\u590d\u5408\u573a\u4e2d J/J' \u6df7\u5408\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6b64\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u6ca1\u6709\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u5bf9\u590d\u5408\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a f-\u5143\u7d20\u79bb\u5b50\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We study the solitons and their integral characteristics numerically and demonstrate that they are kinematically stable.

This paper introduces a quantum algorithm designed to estimate vibrational entropy via energy derivatives. Our approach block encodes the exact expression for the second derivative of the energy and uses quantum linear systems algorithms to deal with the reciprocal powers of the gaps that appear in the expression. We further show that if prior knowledge about the values of the second derivative is used then our algorithm can $\u03b5$-approximate the entropy using a number of queries that scales with the condition number $\u03ba$, the temperature $T$, error tolerance $\u03b5$ and an analogue of the partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$, as $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{Z}\u03ba^2 }{\u03b5T}\\right)$. We show that if sufficient prior knowledge is given about the second derivative then the query scales quadratically better than these results. This shows that, under reasonable assumptions of the temperature and a quantum computer can be used to compute the vibrational contributions to the entropy faster than analogous classical algorithms would be capable of.

At the gap, the instrumental resolution skews the signal, producing a high-energy tail that complicates fitting. Our function assumes an instrumental $Q$-resolution with two equal wide and one narrow direction (typical of focused TAS instruments), and a parabolic dispersion at the gap, which is exact for quadratic and accurate for linear dispersions if the resolution is moderate. We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements.

Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets.

In this work, we extend existing theories of cascaded MZI systems to develop a generalized model tailored for wavelength-multiplexed parallel optical computing.

The RMB is part of the new generation of multipurpose reactors, and studying neutron transport is essential for the project to meet its objectives of producing radioisotopes, irradiating materials, and generating neutron beams for scientific investigations. The neutron moderation process in the reflector tank is very well described by Maxwellian distributions, which provide temperatures ranging from T = 331.5 K in the core to T = 266.8 K in the peripheral regions. The relative proportions reveal the predominance (52%) of epithermal neutrons in the reactor core, followed by thermal (29%) and fast (19%) neutrons. The moderation process proves to be effective, considering that 100% of the neutrons fall within the thermal spectrum near the reflector tank wall. The fits using Maxwellian distributions reveal another effect of neutron moderation, a shift in the peak wavelength from 1.07 \u00c5 to 1.19 \u00c5. The same effect is observed along the tube that supplies a neutron beam to the RMB imaging instrument, with $\u03bb_{peak}$ = 1.18 \u00c5 increasing to $\u03bb_{peak}$ = 1.21 \u00c5.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Crucially, we demonstrate that this equivalence transcends the locality constraints that limit traditional topological invariants. While the conventional Resta polarization fails when $\\tilde{H}$ becomes non-local due to the divergence of position variance, we reveal that $\u03c7(\\tilde{H})$ remains robustly quantized, protected by the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators. Our work thus identifies entanglement as the unique real-space diagnostic capable of capturing non-Bloch topology beyond the breakdown of locality, successfully restoring the BBC across diverse non-Hermitian systems such as line-gap, point-gap, and gapless phases, thereby unifying the geometric and entanglement paradigms in non-Hermitian physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u975e-Hermitian\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u71b5\u6781\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u6307\u6807\uff0c Expand concept to identify non-Bloch\u62d3\u6251\u5e76\u8865\u6551\u4f20\u7edf BBC \u7684\u5931\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf bulk-boundary \u5bf9\u5e94\u5728\u975e-Hermitian \u7cfb\u7edf\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6307\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u975e-Bloch \u6781\u5316 P_\u03b2 \u548c\u71b5\u6781\u5316 \u03c7 \u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u62df\u53cd\u5411 Hamiltonian \u4fee\u6b63 NHSE\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u71b5\u6781\u5316 \u03c7(tilde{H}) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8865\u6551\u4f20\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u6307\u6807\u5728\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u975e-Hermitian \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u8865\u6551\u4e86 BBC \u7684\u5931\u6548\u3002"}}

This protocol is efficient for Clifford+T circuits with logarithmically many T-gates, where the limiting factor in the efficiency of the protocol is the difficulty, on input a quantum circuit $C$, of the classical task of producing a description of the unitary obtained by conjugating a Pauli $P$ (corresponding to a Bell-measurement outcome) by $C$, where this description only depends on the input-output functionality of $CPC^{\\dagger}$. The task above, in turn, is at least as hard as the problem of determining whether two $n$-qubit quantum circuits are perfectly equivalent up to global phase. In 2009, Tanaka defined the corresponding decision problem Exact Non-Identity Check (ENIC) and showed that ENIC is NQP-complete in general. Motivated by this, we consider in this work what happens when we pass from low T-count to low T-depth. In particular, we show that, for Clifford+T circuits of T-depth $O(\\log(n))$, deciding ENIC is NP-hard.

Nevertheless, it relies on large, diverse real-world medical data, whose availability is limited by privacy concerns and practical challenges. Although data augmentation has been extensively studied in various other deep learning tasks, it has not been systematically explored for MMF imaging. This work provides the first in-depth experimental and computational study on the efficacy and limitations of augmentation techniques in this field. We demonstrate that standard image transformations and conditional generative adversarial-based synthetic speckle generation fail to improve, or even deteriorate, reconstruction quality, as they neglect the complex modal interference and dispersion that results in speckle formation. To address this, we introduce a physical data augmentation method in which only organ images are digitally transformed, while their corresponding speckles are experimentally acquired via fiber. This approach preserves the physics of light-fiber interaction and enhances the reconstruction structural similarity index measure~(SSIM) by up to 17\\%, forming a viable system for reliable MMF imaging under limited data conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5149\u7ea4\u7ef4\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u53d8\u6362\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u7528\u5149\u7ea4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u83b7\u53d6\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6563\u6591\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5149\u7ea4\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5149\u7ea4\u7ef4\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u4ecd\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6591\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u53d8\u6362\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u83b7\u53d6\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6563\u6591\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6591\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u6076\u5316\u3002\u800c\u7269\u7406\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08SSIM\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5149\u7ea4\u7ef4\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5149\u7ea4\u7ef4\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5149\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5149-\u5149\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5149\u7ea4\u7ef4\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Here we introduce a general and numerically efficient framework to diagnose mixed-state topological phases in strongly interacting systems via the disorder parameter (DP) of the U(1) charge operator. Specifically, from the finite-size scaling of the second derivative of the DP generating function, we introduce the topological scaling indicator, which exhibits a characteristic linear scaling with the system's linear dimension for topological phases, a signature that vanishes upon transition into a topologically trivial phase. Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures.

The results indicate that in all the three cases, the charged black hole spacetime undergoes scalarization at low temperatures. Notably, the spherical topology is unique in that its domain of scalarization theoretically extends to much higher temperatures under low pressure in the extended phase space. Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style.

This distinction originates from the path traced by its rotation matrices within the doubly connected SO(3) group manifold, leading to a nontrivial spinor phase of $e^{i\u03c0}$ upon encircling the texture. Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions. While conventional skyrmions exhibit a dominant $\u03c3_z$ component with weak dipolar $\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y$ contributions, spin-flux skyrmions possess an additional monopolar $\u03c3_x$ component that yields a finite average emergent field for a finite density of skyrmions. This nontrivial component introduces a nontrivial term in the Hall conductivity, enabling a direct explanation of experimental Hall resistivity anomalies that cannot be accounted for by conventional skyrmions alone. Moreover, we show that this additional term couples to the in-plane spin polarization of conduction electrons, providing a further tunable handle to control the transverse Hall response.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using the relative entropy of entanglement, we derive a closed analytical expression for the instantaneous entanglement generation rate for arbitrary pure states and Hamiltonians expressed in the Schmidt basis. We find that constraints based solely on the mean energy of the Hamiltonian are insufficient to bound the entanglement generation rate, whereas imposing a variance constraint ensures a finite and well-defined maximum. We fully characterize the Hamiltonians that achieve this optimal rate, establishing a direct relation between their imaginary components in the Schmidt basis and the structure of the optimal initial states. For systems without ancillas, we obtain a closed-form expression for the maximal rate in terms of the surprisal variance of the Schmidt coefficients and identify the family of optimal states and Hamiltonians. We further extend our analysis to scenarios where Alice and Bob may employ local ancillary systems: using a matrix-analytic framework and a refined description of the Hamiltonians allowed by the physical constraints, we derive an explicit optimization formula and characterize the attainable enhancement in entanglement generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53ea\u6709\u6709\u9650\u7269\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u53d7\u9650\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\u4e0b\u53cc\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4e0b\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u7eaf\u6001\u548c\u4ee5Schmidt\u57fa\u8868\u793a\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u901f\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u754c\u5b9a\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u65bd\u52a0\u65b9\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u5219\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7387\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b83\u4eecSchmidt\u57fa\u4e2d\u865a\u90e8\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eSchmidt\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u71b5\u53d8\u5dee\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e00\u65cf\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6001\u548c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230Alice\u548cBob\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a\u501f\u52a9\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5bf9\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u6709\u9650\u80fd\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff0c\u5728Schmidt\u57fa\u8868\u793a\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u4e0b\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u901f\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5747\u503c\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u5bf9\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u901f\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u9650\u5236\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf\u65e0\u6cd5\u754c\u5b9a\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u65bd\u52a0\u65b9\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u901f\u7387\u3002\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7387\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5176Schmidt\u57fa\u4e2d\u865a\u90e8\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eSchmidt\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u71b5\u53d8\u5dee\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e00\u65cf\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6001\u548c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u9650\u80fd\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A $^{7}$LiYF$_4$:Ho$^{3+}$ crystal is chosen as an example. First, we show that temperatures in the range 10-35 K can be measured using the Boltzmann behavior of the populations of crystal-field levels separated by an energy interval of 23 cm$^{-1}$. Then we select the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ line of the holmium $^5I_5 \\rightarrow ^5I_7$ transition, which has a well-resolved hyperfine structure and falls within the transparency window of optical fibers (telecommunication S band), to demonstrate the possibility of measuring temperatures below 3 K. The temperature $T$ is determined by a least-squares fit to the measured intensities of all eight hyperfine components using the dependence $I(\u03bd) = I_1 \\exp(-b\u03bd)$, where $I_1$ and $b = a\u03bd+ \\frac\u03bd{kT}$ are fitting parameters and a accounts for intensity variations due to mixing of wave functions of different crystal-field levels by the hyperfine interaction. In this method, the absolute and relative thermal sensitivities grow at $T$ approaching zero as $\\frac{1}{T^2}$.and $\\frac{1}{T}$, respectively. We theoretically considered the intensity distributions within hyperfine manifolds and compared the results with experimental data. Application of the method to experimentally measured relative intensities of hyperfine components of the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ PL line yielded $T = 3.7 \\pm 0.2$ K. For a temperature of 1 K, an order of magnitude better accuracy is expected.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, the literature shows that for the spin-Boson model Hamiltonian, FSSH with appropriate corrections usually captures the detailed balance well and obtains rate constants within a factor of 2 compared to numerically exact results. In this study, we show that in the deep inverted Marcus regime, the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH, one version that includes decoherence) yields reasonably accurate rate constants but incorrect thermal populations over a broad range of parameters. We present an analytical derivation to understand the AFSSH behavior, and therefore, show that AFSSH obtains correct rate constants owing to the resonance of the time derivative coupling with the exothermicity, but obtains an incorrect thermal population owing to the self-consistency issue. The presented derivation provides an analytical expression for the quantum correction factor for AFSSH simulations in the Marcus inverted regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here the version the Staruszkiewicz model is presented to describe the relativistic system of two massless charged particles interacting as follows: the retarded field of the first particle acts on the second particle, the advanced field of the second particle acts on the first particle, and a radiation reaction is neglected. The model is formulated within the Hamiltonian formalism with constraints. The system is invariant with respect to 15-parametric conformal group. The corresponding conserved canonical generators and the relativistic Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector provide a superintegrability of the system. The trajectory of the unbounded relative motion is represented by the hyperbolic conic section, similarly to the case of the non-relativistic Kepler problem. Surprisingly, however, the particle world lines appears the isotropic rectilinear rays, i.e., the particles behave as if non-interacting or neutral electrically.

Yet, as we show here, understanding the precise microscopic model for the material dispersion is crucial for predicting experimental outcomes. Here we study the temporal scattering coefficients of four different time-varying Drude-Lorentz models, exploring how an incident continuous wave splits into forward and backward waves due to an abrupt change in plasma frequency. The differences in the predicted scattering are unique to time-varying media, and arise from the exact way in which the time variation appears in the various model parameters. We verify our results using a custom finite difference time domain algorithm, concluding with a discussion of the limitations that arise from using these models with an abrupt change in plasma frequency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These spacetimes violated the Weak Energy Condition (WEC). Lentz proposed a new type of warp drive in 2020. It was claimed that this warp spacetime has non-negative energy density and can therefore be sourced by a classical plasma. We demonstrate that Lentz's claim is incorrect. We begin with a direct calculation of the energy-momentum tensor of Lentz's warp drive in a Eulerian reference frame, and show that there are spacetime regions where the energy density is negative. We then examine the theoretical basis of Lentz's investigation and identify several derivation errors. The derivation errors can be somewhat ameliorated with a modified version of Lentz's geometry, which more closely respects the equalities and inequalities discussed by Lentz. Even so, we show that the modified geometry still violates the WEC even in the Eulerian reference frame.

The secondary compact object, carrying a Proca hair, emits additional dipolar radiation that alters total energy flux relative to general relativity (GR). These modifications induce a secular drift in the orbital evolution of circular geodesic orbits, leading to measurable dephasing in the resulting EMRIs waveforms. By evaluating waveform mismatches between the Einstein-Proca framework and its GR counterpart, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish the signatures of a light Proca field when black hole rotation is included. Furthermore, using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we forecast LISA's capability to place stringent constraints on the Proca mass with EMRIs signal from slowly rotating Kerr black holes. For representative EMRIs configurations, we find that LISA can detect or constrain Proca masses down to $\u03bc_v\\sim 10^{-20}$eV, with typical fractional uncertainties at the level of tens percent, depending on the black-hole spin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u77e2\u91cf\u573a\uff08Proca\u573a\uff09\u5bf9\u6781\u8d28\u6bd4\u5408\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08EMRIs\uff09\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Proca\u573a\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u4f7f\u80fd\u91cf\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5f62\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528LISA\u63a2\u6d4b\u4eea\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86LISA\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cfProca\u7c92\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u8da3\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u77e2\u91cf\u573a\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86Proca\u573a\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LISA\u63a2\u6d4b\u4eea\u7684\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLISA\u63a2\u6d4b\u4eea\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u5230Proca\u7c92\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6ce2\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f53\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65cb\u8f6c\u8f83\u6162\u65f6\uff0cLISA\u63a2\u6d4b\u4eea\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u523010^-20 eV\u7684\u91cf\u7ea7\u6765\u9650\u5236Proca\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f7f\u7528LISA\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u77e2\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684Proca\u7c92\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences.

While extensively studied in single-particle and linear systems, the many-body regime of BICs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that giant atoms, quantum emitters coupled nonlocally to structured waveguides, can host robust doublon BICs, i.e., two-photon bound states stabilized by destructive interference and interactions. We first analyze a driven two-photon emission process and show how doublon BICs arise and mediate decoherence-free interaction between distant atoms. We then demonstrate that these many-body BICs also emerge under natural, undriven dynamics via a virtual two-photon emission process in three-level giant atoms.

These vortical geodesics traverse both horizons and pass through the ring singularity, linking the positive-$r$ exterior to the negative-$r$ asymptotic side. Using impact parameters, we identify a closed subset of parameter space, the inner throat, where the radial potential has no real roots, and photons exhibit no radial turning points. In this region, at most two constant-latitude geodesics exist, one of which is aligned with the principal null direction. We also identify the forbidden polar-angle band that limits the range of geodesics reaching an asymptotic observer. We solve the geodesic equations analytically and numerically in Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates, obtaining mutually consistent results that correct and extend previously available formulae. The resulting trajectories are used to construct simulated views for an observer in the negative-$r$ domain, revealing strong image distortion and inversion, with possible implications for analogous white-hole configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The recently developed time-dependent double coupled-cluster (TD-dCC) ansatz achieves this by combining correlation effects from the N- and (N-1)-electron sectors, but its exact formulation remains computationally demanding. Here we introduce a hierarchy of cost-effective approximate TD-dCC ansatzes derived from truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansions, which preserve a single-similarity-transformation structure while retaining the essential correlation diagrams responsible for satellite formation. We further develop a detailed component analysis that isolates hole-mediated excitation pathways, which are correlated processes arising from the coupling between ground-state and ionized-state amplitudes. We use it to interpret quasiparticle and satellite features across the hierarchy. Applications to the single-impurity Anderson model and molecular systems (H2O and CH4) demonstrate that the approximate TD-dCC methods closely and efficiently reproduce exact many-body spectral features and quasiparticle weights. In parallel, we construct a fault-tolerant quantum signal processing algorithm for the core-hole Green's function, providing a scalable quantum route for simulating correlated core-level dynamics. Together, these developments establish complementary classical and quantum methodologies for quantitative, many-body-accurate core spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The coherent addition of such individually passive processes allows coherence to emerge and increase in phase space without an external drive and with minimal interaction requirements. The coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states emerges because the linear and nonlinear absorption processes are not mutually passive. In the simplest case rotationally symmetric Wigner functions of the oscillator Fock states convert their many negative regions to an extremely complex asymmetric structure in sharp contrast to the rotational symmetry of those obtained by the individual interactions.

This result implies that the parity-violating extension of STEGR is strongly coupled around FLRW and therefore lies beyond the regime of validity of standard linear perturbation theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Newer General Relativity\u7684\u6846\u67b6 Chili, \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5947\u5076\u6027\u4e0d\u5b88\u6052\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f,\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5e73\u5766 FLRW \u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684 Ghost \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u9664\u975e\u6027 Lock Stock and CollisionEquivalent of General Relativity \u52a0\u4e0a\u5947\u5076\u6027\u4e0d\u5b88\u6052\u9879\u3002\u8be5\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u4f20\u64ad\u516b\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u7ebf\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5947\u5076\u6027\u4e0d\u5b88\u6052\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Dirac-Bergmann\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cCartan-Kuranishi\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6b65\u5206\u6790Newer General Relativity\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u5947\u5076\u6027\u4e0d\u5b88\u6052\u9879\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e73\u5766 FLRW \u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9664\u975e\u6027 Lock Stock and CollisionEquivalent of General Relativity \u52a0\u4e0a\u5947\u5076\u6027\u4e0d\u5b88\u6052\u9879\u5916\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728 Ghost \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9664\u975e\u6027 Lock Stock and CollisionEquivalent of General Relativity \u52a0\u4e0a\u5947\u5076\u6027\u4e0d\u5b88\u6052\u9879\u5916, \u65b0\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5e73\u5766 FLRW \u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this paper the ED framework is extended to deal with local gauge symmetries. More specifically, on the basis of maximum entropy methods and information geometry, for an appropriate choice of ontic variables and constraints, we derive the quantum electrodynamics of radiation fields interacting with charged particles.

Here, we propose a qubit reuse method by intermediate-uncomputation that significantly reduces the space complexity of Regev's algorithm, inspired by reversible computing. Our basic strategy lowers the cost from \\( O(n^{3/2}) \\) to \\( O(n^{5/4}) \\), and refined strategies achieve \\( O(n \\log n) \\)which is a space lower bound within this model.

Quantum mutual information (QMI), a fundamental nonlocal measure, plays a key role in quantifying entanglement and has become increasingly important in studying nonequilibrium quantum many-body phenomena, such as many-body localization and thermalization. However, experimental measurement of QMI remains extremely difficult, particularly for nonequilibrium states, which are more complex than ground states. In this Letter, we employ a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to establish a universal mapping between the QMI and local correlations only up to second order for nonequilibrium states generated by quenches in a one-dimensional disordered XXZ model. Our approach provides a practical method for experimentally extracting QMI, readily applicable in platforms such as superconducting qubits.

We show that after eliminating the harmonic part of the Coulomb force by an auxiliary linear force, the remaining reciprocal nonlinear part results in a directly observable non-reciprocal nonlinear effect: increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the coherent displacement of one particle, driven by the position noise, or uncertainty in quantum regime, in another particle.

Next, it explores the QAOA in detail, covering its Hamiltonian formulation, gate decomposition, and example applications, along with their implementation and performance results. This is followed by an analysis of the algorithm's energy landscape, where proofs are provided for its symmetry and periodicity, and where a resulting parameter space reduction is proposed.

The charging process relies on coherent energy exchange, where the atoms couple to the cavity, which in turn, it interacts with the magnon mode via a beam-splitter mechanism. By deriving the system Hamiltonian under the rotating-wave approximation and employing a Lindblad master equation to rigorously model dissipation, we analyze the complete dynamical evolution of the battery. Our study demonstrates that strong, resonant light-matter interactions are crucial for enhancing the key performance metrics: charging efficiency, stored energy, and ergotropy (extractable work). We systematically investigate the deleterious effects of detuning and decoherence, and critically, we uncover a non-trivial interplay between the system's coupling strengths.

Recent investigations have extended non-Hermitian physics into the fully quantum domain. However, existing studies predominantly concentrate on discrete-variable quantum systems, while non-Hermitian quantum effects in continuous-variable encoded systems remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the exceptional structure for a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit, realized with a Kerr nonlinear resonator. We find that the dissipation leads to a bidirectional jump between the two basis states of the cat qubit, which is in distinct contrast with the unidirectional jump associated with normal two-level systems. The competition between this jump and a single-photon drive gives arise to the emergence of third-order Liouvillian exceptional points (LEP3s), each corresponds to a crossing point of two lines of LEP2s. We further show that the LEP3 can exhibit the topological character of the Hamiltonian EP3s, which cannot be realized with a single qubit.

In this article, we extend fractional calculus to explore a particle in a periodic potential, where the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is generalized to its fractional form. This framework allows us to study how the L\u00e9vy index $q$ governs the formation and inversion of energy bands, offering a pathway to engineer new physical behaviors and device functionalities by tuning $q$ in periodic quantum systems. We solve the fractional Schr\u00f6dinger equation for periodic rectangular potentials of varying height $V_0$, barrier thickness $L$, and well width $W$ using an imaginary-time evolution algorithm, and supplement the discrete energy dispersion through Gaussian process regression. Our analysis reveals a qualitative shift in the band structure at $q=2$, separating into regimes for $q>2$ and $q<2$. For $q > 2$, energy bands undergo an inverting transformation as symmetric minima emerge within the first Brillouin zone, shifting from $k=0$ toward $k=\\pm \u03c0/a$ with increasing $q$. These degenerate minima define a Bloch-momentum qubit, suggesting an analog to valley degrees of freedom used in valleytronics. The response of the ground band scales with fractional order as $V_0^{-0.28\\pm0.05}L^{-0.34\\pm0.08}W^{-0.49\\pm0.06}$, indicating tunable sensitivity to geometry. For $q < 2$, the effective mass near $k = 0$ decreases exponentially with $q$, yielding a universal effective mass of $0.15\\pm0.01$ as $q \\to 1$, demonstrating that the L\u00e9vy index serves as a tunable degree of freedom capable of driving band inversion, modulating the band gap, and reshaping carrier dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This demonstrates that in general there is no tension between failures of local tomography and classical explainability (i.e., generalised noncontextuality). In fact, bilocal classical theory is in many ways more simply understood via the underlying ontological model than it is within its original formulation (much as how odd-dimensional stabiliser subtheories can be more simply understood via Spekkens' toy theory). Furthermore, this result naturally leads to the question, does every locally-classical theory admit of an ontological model? By constructing a concrete counterexample, we show that this is not the case. Our findings demonstrate that there is no straightforward relationship between theories being locally-classical, and them being classically-explainable.

We provide a tight lower bound on the minimum efficiency required to observe a desired Bell-CHSH violation using the Navascu\u00e9s-Pironio-Ac\u00edn (NPA) hierarchy, confirming tightness up to four decimal places with numerical optimization over explicit quantum realizations. We then introduce the effect of dark counts and demonstrate how to quantify the minimum required efficiency to observe a desired CHSH violation with an increasing dark count error. Finally, to obtain an analytical closed-form expression of the minimum efficiency, we consider the set of no-signaling behaviors that satisfy the Tsirelson bound, which are easier to characterize than the quantum set. Using such behaviors, we find a simple closed-form expression for a lower bound on the minimum efficiency which is monotonically increasing with the CHSH violation, though the analytically obtained lower bounds are meaningfully below the numerically tight lower bound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5df2\u77e5\u8bbe\u5907\u7684(2,2,2)\u8d1d\u5c14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c detectors\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6697\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u72ec\u7acb\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Navascu\u00e9s-Pironio-Ac\u00edn (NPA) \u673a hesitations hran\u011bk hran\u011bk hran\u011bk hran\u011bk hierarchy \u548c\u6570\u503c\u6700\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u6709\u6697\u8ba1\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u754c\u968f\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fdd\u53cd\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u5907\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u754c\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002"}}
