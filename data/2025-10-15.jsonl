We develop a compact Hilbert space description for one-dimensional\nelastic chains, expressing intra-cell motion as a normalized superposition of\northogonal eigenstates and tracking complex amplitudes as trajectories on a\nBloch sphere. For diatomic lattices, this framework makes inversion symmetry\nprotection explicit: the relative phase between in-phase and out-of-phase modes\nis piecewise locked, and the Zak phase is quantized with band-dependent jumps\nat symmetry points. Extending the analysis to triatomic lattices shows that\nrestoring inversion retains quantization, whereas breaking it dequantizes the\ngeometric phase while leaving the spectral origin invariant. Viewing\nnorm-preserving transformations of the modal coefficient pair as Bloch sphere\nrotations, we demonstrate classical analogues of single-qubit logic gates. A\npi-phase rotation about a transverse axis swaps the modal poles, and a\nlongitudinal-axis phase flip maps balanced superpositions to their conjugates.\nThese gate-like operations are realized by controlled evolution across\nwavenumber space and can be driven or reprogrammed through spatiotemporal\nstiffness modulation. Introducing space-time modulation hybridizes carrier and\nsideband harmonics, producing continuous phase winding and open-path geometric\nphases accumulated along the Floquet trajectory. Across static and modulated\nregimes, the framework unifies algebraic and geometric viewpoints, remains\nrobust to gauge and basis choices, and operates directly on amplitude-phase\ndata. The results clarify how symmetry, modulation, and topology jointly govern\ndispersion, modal mixing, and phase accumulation, providing tools to analyze\nand design vibration and acoustic functionalities in engineered structures."}

They are caused by the\ninteraction between the longitudinal dynamics, governed by the tesseral\nharmonics of the geopotential, and the orbital precession forced by Earth's\noblateness and lunisolar perturbations. The transitions are extremely sensitive\nto small perturbations, making the long-term evolution unpredictable. Recently,\na Monte Carlo analysis of trajectories starting in the immediate vicinity of\nthe 165 degrees E unstable equilibrium point, revealed that the evolution to\nchaos is not gradual. It occurs via sudden episodes of disorder at specific\npoints of the precession cycle, when the orbital inclination is minimal. Due to\nthe high cost of the statistical analysis, the results were limited to a single\ninitial longitude. This paper applies modified versions of the diameter\nLagrangian descriptor to reduce the computational burden. This enables mapping\nthe dynamical behavior over the complete range of longitudes where transitions\nbetween modes of motion are possible, considering both unstable equilibrium\npoints (165 degrees E and 15 degrees W). It is found that the episodes of chaos\nremain linked to the orbital inclination cycle, but their timing depends on the\ninitial spacecraft longitude. As the initial position moves farther away from\nthe unstable point, the transitions take place at higher values of the orbital\ninclination. The longitudes where the transitions occur at maximum inclination\ncorrespond to the boundaries of the chaotic region."}

A hallmark of our construction is that the effective\nradius of an electric point charge can be reduced arbitrarily by tuning a\ncoupling parameter, thereby achieving scales far below the Born--Infeld bound\nand consistent with the experimentally undetected size of the electron. The\nmodels preserve finite self energy for point charges while energetically\nexcluding monopoles and dyons, a robustness that appears intrinsic to this\nclass of nonlinear theories. Two complementary behaviors are uncovered: In the\nnon-polynomial perturbations, the Maxwell limit is not recovered as the\ncoupling vanishes, whereas in polynomial models the self energy diverges\ncorrectly, meaning that the Maxwellian ultraviolet structure is reinstated. A\nfurther subtlety emerges in the distinction between the prescribed source\ncharge, imposed through the displacement field, and the measurable free charge\narising from the induced electric field. In particular, the free charge and the\nself energy contained within any ball around the point charge tend to zero in\nthe strong-nonlinearity or zero effective-radius limit, rendering a pointlike\nstructure locally undetectable, both electrically and energetically.

We develop a\ntheoretical and computational approach to quantify the limits of\nexosome-mediated chemotaxis at the individual cell level. In our model, a\nleader cell secretes exosomes, which diffuse in the extracellular space, and a\nfollower cell guides its migration by integrating discrete exosome detections\nover a finite memory window. We combine analytical calculations and stochastic\nsimulations and show that the chemotactic velocity exhibits a non-monotonic\ndependence on the exosome cargo size. Small exosomes produce frequent but weak\nsignals, whereas large exosomes produce strong but infrequent encounters. In\nthe presence of nonlinear signal transduction, this tradeoff leads to an\noptimal cargo size that maximizes information throughput, as quantified by the\naverage speed of the follower cell.

Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental\ncreep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like\nsprings and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the\npower-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional\ncalculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship;\nhowever, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the\ndeformation rate evolves over time.

As an application we study the non-unitary dynamics of a\nlossy or driven-dissipative BCS superconductors, evolving in presence of\ntwo-body losses and two-body pumps. We show that the non-Hermitian limit acts\nas a singular limit of the hybrid dissipative dynamics, leading to a sharp\nmodification of the universal approach to the driven-dissipative steady-states.\nBy considering the dissipative dynamics with pair losses, we show that, as the\nnon-Hermitian limit is approached, the density dynamics sharply evolves from a\nuniversal power-law to exponential decay that converges towards a quasi-steady\nplateau characterized by the freezing of the particle depletion due to pair\nlosses. The reached quasi-stationary density increases as a function of the\ndissipation rate highlighting the emergence of a non-Hermitian Zeno effect in\nthe lossy dynamics. For the driven-dissipative case, we show that, in the\nnon-Hermitian limit, the system gets trapped into an effective negative\ntemperature state, thus skipping the infinite temperature steady-state reached\nin the presence of finite contribution of the quantum jumps. We rationalize\nthese findings in terms of the conservation of the length of the pseudospins\nwhich, in the non-Hermitian limit, suppresses the effective single-particle\nlosses and pumps acting on the non-condensed particles."}

However, achieving both high transmission modulation and low optical\nloss in the telecom band remains a challenge. This study develops monolithic\nand hybrid metasurfaces based on the phase change material antimony trisulfide\n(Sb$_2$S$_3$) to address this limitation. First, we demonstrate the capability\nof Sb$_2$S$_3$ to offer up to ~91 percent modulation, even with a magnetic\ndipole - a low-Q resonance. It lifts the requirement for complex precisely\nfabricated metasurfaces, a long-standing limitation in the community for all\noptical switching. Furthermore, with the most straightforward hybridisation\napproach, i.e. depositing a thin film of silicon, we improved the simulated\nmodulation depth to 99 percent. Experimentally, over 80 percent modulation was\nachieved for both hybrid and monolithic structures, with nearly 2-fold less\npower required for switching in the hybrid design whilst maintaining high\nmodulation depth.

The prevailing understanding is\nthat the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long\nmean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size,\nthereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat\neffectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann\ntransport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture\nmode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon\npopulations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near\nNHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of\nlong-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons\nheat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient\nnear the NH and thereby enhancing TR.

These\nrates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a\nmultiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its\noperational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the\nathermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of\nathermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity\ndistillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work\nconnects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and\nmaximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing\ncapabilities."}

A key application\nof NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among\nmetals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and\nelectrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies.\nHowever, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their\nquantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered\ndiamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with\ndifferent energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum\nproperties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films. We find a substantial\nreduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and a pronounced decrease of the\nNV$^{-}$ population for NV ensembles located near the platinum layer. As a\nresult, optically detected magnetic resonance experiments could only be\nefficiently performed on diamonds implanted with at least 20 keV, where we\nobserved a strong increase in the T$_{2}$ coherence time beneath the platinum\nthin films.

We address these questions,\nin the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ double-scaled SYK model and its putative bulk dual by:\n(i) formulating a holographic procedure in the language of quantum reference\nframes to gravitationally dress bulk observables to ``clocks'' parametrized by\nboth boundary time and R-charge; and (ii) proposing a \\emph{new measure of\nKrylov complexity} with R-charge in the boundary theory that probes zero-energy\nBPS states. Holographically, this proposal reproduces a relational bulk\nobservable, a BPS wormhole length. We contrast this to the Krylov complexity\nfor Hartle-Hawking states with non-trivial time flow. The latter reproduces the\nsame observable as for the bosonic DSSYK in the semiclassical limit, while its\nquantum fluctuations can capture supersymmetric corrections."}

Electro-optic modulators are essential components in modern photonic\nsystems, enabling high-speed control of light for applications ranging from\ntelecommunications to quantum communication. Conventional inline and\nMach-Zehnder modulators, while widely adopted, are limited by bias drift, high\noperating voltages, and polarization-mode dispersion. Sagnac loop-based\nmodulators have recently emerged as a promising alternative, offering inherent\nstability against environmental fluctuations and eliminating the need for\nactive bias control. In this work, we present a comprehensive model of the\nSagnac modulator that captures both intensity and polarization modulation. We\nanalyze the role of asymmetry in the loop, highlighting its impact on the\nachievable repetition rate, and propose modulation strategies to overcome these\nconstraints. Finally, we investigate the symmetric Sagnac configuration and\ndemonstrate practical techniques for achieving robust modulation while\nmitigating experimental challenges.
