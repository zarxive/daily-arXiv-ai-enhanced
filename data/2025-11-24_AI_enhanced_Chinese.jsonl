In this paper, we determine spatially-bounded rogue waves in the Davey-Stewartson I equation. We show that these rogue waves can be obtained when a single or multiple internal parameters in the higher-order rational solution of the Davey-Stewartson I equation are real and large, and the order-index vector of this higher-order rational solution has even length and comprises pairs of the form (2n, 2n+1), where n is a positive integer. Under these conditions and another nondegeneracy condition on the root curve of a certain double-real-variable polynomial, the higher-order rational solution will exhibit spatially-bounded rogue waves that arise from a uniform background with some time-varying lumps on it, reach high amplitude in limited space, and then disappear into the same background again. The crests of these rogue waves form a single or multiple closed curves that are generically disconnected from each other on the spatial plane, and are analytically predicted by the root curve mentioned above. We also derive uniformly-valid asymptotic approximations for these spatially-bounded rogue waves in the large-parameter regime. Near the crests of these rogue waves, these asymptotic approximations reduce to simple expressions. Our asymptotic approximations of these rogue waves are compared to true solutions and good agreement is demonstrated.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of \u03bb~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns.

It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points.

We propose an axiomatic reformulation in which a chemical system is modelled as a ternary Gamma semiring (TGS), where chemical states form an additive semigroup, mediators encode catalytic or environmental context, and mediated transformations are represented by a ternary operation. We show that the TGS axioms admit direct physical interpretations: distributivity corresponds to ideal, non-interfering parallel reactions, while associativity characterizes thermodynamic path-independence. Classical systems including Michaelis-Menten kinetics, global equilibrium, and allosteric regulation are recovered as different algebraic regimes, and we develop operational tests that quantify departures from the axioms through experimentally measurable indices.

This analysis is based on numerical simulations of the channeling process, which were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. Ionising collisions are considered random, fast and local events, and are incorporated into the classical relativistic molecular dynamics framework according to the previously described algorithm. The case studies presented refer to 10 GeV electrons and positrons incident on single crystals of diamond and silicon, oriented along the (110) and (111) planes, with thicknesses of up to 1 mm for electrons and 6 mm for positrons. To elucidate the role of ionising collisions, simulations were performed with and without accounting for them. It is shown that, for electrons, both approaches lead to similar results with regard to both the channelling efficiency and the radiation intensity. In practical terms, this means that numerical simulations can be carried out without accounting for ionising collisions, which are much faster yet produce similar results. For positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, their impact on the radiation intensity strongly depends on the opening angle of the cone within which the radiation emission is collected. A quantitative analysis of this feature is presented in the paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Leveraging translational invariance and other symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we reconstruct the momentum-resolved quasiparticle excitation spectrum through targeted simulation of low-lying excited states using VQE. We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz. Finally, we highlight extensions of our proposed VQE implementation to simulate quasiparticles in other interacting quantum many-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using a reinforcement learning agent formulated as a Markov decision process, we identify quantum circuits that optimally navigate the entropy vector space to generate violations of Ingleton's inequality. We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare.

These layered devices show a key feature, flat bands. Flat bands localize electrons, which in turn leads to the expression of correlated states such as Mott insulators, superconductivity, and more. A key property of these devices is that their 2D nature allows us to tune them in situ, effectively allowing us to change the device's electronic properties. This powerful ability greatly reduces the time and money required to study superconductivity.

Our approach is based on encoding two Hatano-Nelson (HN) chains, which is equivalent to the bosonic Kitaev model, within the resonant modes of an electro-optics frequency comb. Non-reciprocal light propagation in the frequency domain is realized through simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation of the circulating field inside the optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate the sensing of a small modulating tone coupling the two HN chains with a SNR that scales exponentially with the lattice size, formed from up to 70 frequency modes per chain.

To establish fundamental principles of dynamic photon-modulated catalysis, the photocatalytic conversion of a generic surface reaction was simulated to understand the kinetic implications of an independent stream of photons promoting surface product desorption. Simulations were conducted via the microkinetic model and kinetic Monte Carlo methods for the scenarios of a Poisson distribution, constant spacing between photons, and coordinated on/off pulsing of photon sources. The time-averaged photocatalytic rate at differential conditions for varying photon flux and temperatures indicated three kinetic regimes described by product thermal desorption control, surface reaction control, and an intermediate kinetic regime with a zero slope Arrhenius plot, consistent with a degree of rate control dominated by the photon arrival frequency (i.e., per-site photon flux).

Conventional dielectrics, including liquid crystals (LCs), offer limited improvement for triboelectrification, whereas the breakthrough ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF-LCs), with giant spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant, act as highly effective charge boosters. Here, we introduce NF-LC (DIO) as a functional filler in a PVDF-based TENG.

In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index.

These findings demonstrate the critical role of multifold band crossings and disorder-induced broadening of energy levels in determining the transport properties, offering theoretical insight into the unconventional conductivity behavior observed in topological semimetals hosting spin-1 chiral fermions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u5355\u5c3e\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6d3d\u5e7f\u4e49\u9006\u6ce2\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u9699\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u62d0\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u7531Dirac\u5e26\u548c\u5e73\u51e1\u5e26\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u4ea4\u53c9\u80fd\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u62d0\u70b9\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u7684\u6570\u503c\u660e\u663e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6742\u8d28\u6563\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u51e1\u5e26\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\u591a\u5c42\u4ea4\u53c9\u80fd\u9699\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6c34\u5e73 broaden \u5728\u8fd0\u8f93\u6027\u8d28\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e00\u7c7b\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u9699\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u9699\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u5c3e\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u81ea\u6d3d\u5e7f\u4e49\u9006\u6ce2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u5355\u5c3e\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7531Dirac\u5e26\u548c\u5e73\u51e1\u5e26\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u80fd\u9699\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u80fd\u9699\u62d0\u70b9\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5176\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u7684\u6570\u503c\u968f\u6742\u8d28\u6563\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u51e1\u5e26\u66f2\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u62d0\u70b9\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u7684\u6570\u503c\u663e\u8457\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6742\u8d28\u6563\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u51e1\u5e26\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u591a\u5c42\u80fd\u9699\u4ea4\u70b9\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6c34\u5e73 broaden \u5bf9\u8fd0\u8f93\u884c\u4e3a\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u9699\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u5c42\u80fd\u9699\u4ea4\u53c9\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e2d\u5355\u5c3e\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7535\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\u03c6^4$ theory in $d=4-\\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest.

Brute-force simulations, though popular, are limited to conditions of high metastability, where the critical cluster and the nucleation barrier are small. The seeding method has recently emerged as a powerful alternative for exploring lower supersaturation regimes by initiating simulations with a pre-formed nucleus. In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Molecular dynamics simulations of nucleation in first-order phase transitions using the seeded method shows that classical nucleation theory predictions align well with simulations, with the accuracy improving with better equations of state.", "motivation": "The limitation of traditional nucleation theory in predicting stabilty of clusters in low supersaturation conditions drives the exploration of alternative methods like the seeded molecular dynamics simulations to assess stability of clusters more accurately in confined systems.", "method": "N VT ensembles, molecular dynamics simulations, seeded simulations, Lennard-Jones systems, and comparisons with CNT predictions.", "result": "Seeded simulations confirm CNT predictions, especially when using accurate equations of state.

Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range.

This result fundamentally breaks the established universal behavior observed in local topological quantum fluids and demonstrates a novel mechanism for the breakdown of adiabaticity in fermionic systems with strong long-range interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6162\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u7edd\u4f26\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u76f8\u53d8\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6fc0\u6ce2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u6b65\u957f\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff1b\u82e5\u9a71\u52a8\u6b62\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u76f8\u8fb9\u6cbf\uff0c\u5219\u6fc0\u6ce2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u7edd\u4f26\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u7edd\u4f26\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u7531\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9636\u8dc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63a5\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6fc0\u6ce2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u88ab\u5916\u90e8\u7f13\u6162\u9a71\u52a8\u8de8\u8d8a\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\uff0c\u6fc0\u6ce2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u6b65\u957f\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff1b\u82e5\u9a71\u52a8\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u76f8\u8fb9\u6cbf\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u5219\u6fc0\u6ce2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u7edd\u4f26\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5176\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7edd\u4f26\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise.

We apply the theory to an exact continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ab initio accuracy.

Through explicit application of the optical metric formulation of TO, we demonstrate that any smooth, passive, impedance-matched transformation performs as a canonical (symplectic) mapping on optical phase space. In combination with Hamiltonian ray dynamics, this indicates that Liouville theorem is as well applicable to TO media: the phase-space volume element is preserved, radiance remains constant along rays, and etendue won't decrease under any passive TO mapping. Based on this novel notion, which has never been mentioned in TO literature before, we develop a radiance-invariant phase-space measure specific to TO media. We then utilize it to find severe analytical limitations on field enhancement. We demonstrate that the maximum attainable average intensity in any passive TO concentrator is exclusively constrained by the area-compression ratio of the coordinate mapping, irrespective of material implementation. Using the same paradigm on zero-index media, optical-null media, and illusion devices reveals the same rules. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that transformation optics (TO) can redistribute intensity but cannot increase radiance, and they give a Liouville-type theorem within this field. This provides a consistent, metric-based elucidation for the intrinsic limitations of concentration in passive metamaterials and extreme-index platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence. Here, we revisit this problem from a more analytical perspective. Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered. When the temperature is sufficiently low that neither of these occur, then ARA succeeds. Remarkably, there are even situations in which the environment benefits ARA: we find parameter values for which no transition-avoiding paths exist at zero temperature but such paths appear at non-zero temperature.", "AI": {"tldr": "A study comparing conventional quantum annealing (QA) and adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) in the presence of decoherence.

Quantum and neuromorphic computing rely on unconventional materials and device functionalities, yet achieving resilience to imperfections and reliable operation remains a major challenge. This has motivated growing interest in topological materials that provide robust and low-power operation while preserving coherence. However, integrating coherent topological transport with non-volatile memory functionality in a single reconfigurable device has remained challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a topological field-effect memristor based on inverted InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum wells operating in the quantum spin Hall regime. The intrinsic floating-gate behavior allows one to reconfigure the transistor functionality into memristive functionality with broad electric-field tunability. Unlike other memristor implementations, one resistance state is governed entirely by dissipationless, coherent transport through helical edge channels, while the other arises from incoherent bulk conduction. By combining electrically tunable coherent and incoherent transport with memory functionality, our device realizes a prototypical topological electronic element that integrates coherent transport and adaptive memristive behavior, paving the way for hybrid quantum-neuromorphic architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6e6e\u6ca1\u6001\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u53ef\u9760\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u529f\u8017\u6548\u7387\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50-\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u51af\u00b7\u8bfa\u4f9d\u66fc\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u663e\u73b0\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u5f0f\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u9760\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u529f\u8017\u6548\u7387\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u5012\u7f6e\u578bInAs/GaInSb/InAs\u4e09\u5c42\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u9876\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u6709\u6f02\u79fb\u95e8\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b memristive\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7535\u573a\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u53cc\u7535\u5bfc\u4f53\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5916\u90e8\u7535\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5e72\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u65e0\u8017\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u6742\u6563 bulk\u4f20\u5bfc\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5 memristor \u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5de5\u4f5c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a_dtype\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We derived equations connecting the parameters of the circular orbits centered on the beams axis to the optical force and torque. The equations show that, besides orbital rotation, the spheroidal particle simultaneously rotates around its equatorial axis. We found that two distinct dynamic regimes are possible. The orbital motion can be accompanied by a rapid proper rotation with angular velocity an order of magnitude larger than the angular velocity of the orbital rotation. Alternatively, the orbital and proper rotations can be synchronized. The direction of orbital rotation can either coincide with or be opposite to the direction of rotation of the electric vector. The findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations. The results can be of use in development of nano-scale gyroscopes as well in shape-selective sorting of submicron particles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u53cd\u5411\u5706\u504f\u632f\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\u573a\u4e2d\u4e9a\u5fae\u7c73\u7403\u72b6\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5149\u529b\u548c\u8f6c\u77e9\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5f0f\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7c92\u5b50\u9664\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u65cb\u8f6c\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u540c\u65f6\u7ed5\u81ea\u8eab\u8d64\u9053\u8f74\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\uff1a\u8f68\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f34\u968f\u5267\u70c8\u81ea\u8f6c\uff0c\u81ea\u8f6c\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u662f\u8f68\u9053\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u7ea7\u5927\u3002\u6216\u8005\u8f68\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u81ea\u8f6c\u540c\u6b65\u3002\u8f68\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u7535\u77e2\u91cf\u65cb\u8f6c\u65b9\u5411\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u76f8\u53cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u548c\u4e9a\u5fae\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5206\u9009\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u7c92\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u548c\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e9a\u5fae\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u65cb\u8f6c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u548c\u4e9a\u5fae\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5206\u9009\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6839\u636e Maxwell \u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u7535\u573a\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5149\u529b\u548c\u8f6c\u77e9\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd0\u7528\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u3001\u7403\u72b6\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f68\u9053\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e9a\u5fae\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u8f68\u9053\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u81ea\u8f6c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u4e92\u540c\u6b65\u6216\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5fae\u7c92\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u5fae\u7c92\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u5fae\u7eb3\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u88c5\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u53cd\u5411\u5706\u504f\u632f\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\u573a\u4e2d\u4e9a\u5fae\u7c73\u7403\u72b6\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u65cb\u8f6c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5149\u529b\u548c\u8f6c\u77e9\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u5f0f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5fae\u7c92\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f68\u9053\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u8f6c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65cb\u8f6c\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u540c\u6b65\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u5fae\u7eb3\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u548c\u4e9a\u5fae\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5206\u9009\u7b49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Working within the tetrad formalism, we solve the Dirac equation for several configurations of the angular momentum density $J_t$ and the torsion parameter $J_z$ that are relevant from a physical perspective. These configurations include balanced torsion ($J_t = J_z$), pure spinning strings ($J_z = 0$), pure screw dislocations ($J_t = 0$) and the general case. In all cases, the geometry modifies an effective azimuthal quantum number, and for strong rotation it introduces a geometric radial cutoff $\u03c1_c$ that acts as a hard wall. These factors lead to closed-form expressions for the radial wave functions, phase shifts and differential cross sections, which are expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric and Bessel functions. We demonstrate that conical curvature, rotation and torsion generate Aharonov-Bohm-like contributions, as well as energy- and momentum-dependent asymmetries in Dirac-Coulomb scattering. This results in topology-renormalised Mott/Rutherford patterns.

The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\\% credibility and in agreement with previous results.

Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum.

We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains. We also discuss how the correlated phase of the isolated chain is characterized by boundary zeros in its single-particle Green's function, and briefly comment on their localization properties in relation to the boundary spins.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By implementing a double Wick rotation, we obtain the exact modular Hamiltonian for a suitable hyperbolic subsystem and use it to formulate the timelike entanglement first law precisely. Our central result is a detailed proof that, in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime, this timelike entanglement first law is equivalent to linearized Einstein's equations in the bulk: the first law follows from the linearized equations and, conversely, implies them. Our result further reveal the dynamical connections between entanglement and gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5230\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u9075\u5b88\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u70ed\u6e29\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u533a\u95f4\u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd Wick \u65cb\u8f6c\u83b7\u5f97\u5408\u9002\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u6a21\u5316\u751f\u6210\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1 Anti-de Sitter \u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea0\u7f20\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5f15\u529b\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc Wick \u65cb\u8f6c\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u6a21\u5316\u751f\u6210\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65f6\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea0\u7f20\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1 Anti-de Sitter \u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": ",Thermodynamic-like entropy evolution\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f14\u5316\u6709\u5173\u3002Equivalence between entanglement first law and linearized Einstein equations\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u7ea0\u7f20\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Motivated by these experiments, we perform molecular dynamics simulations using a multicoverage potential energy surface that was previously constructed with the embedded atom neural network method. The process is modeled by combining the two-temperature model (2TM)--to describe the laser-excited electrons and phonons--and Langevin dynamics with electronic time-dependent temperature $T_\\textrm{e}$--to model the coupling of the nuclei degrees of freedom with the laser-excited electrons. We show that improving the energy balance description in 2TM--by including \\textit{ab-initio} $T_\\textrm{e}$-dependent electronic heat capacity and electron-phonon coupling constant--is key to reproduce the asymmetry of the photodesorption probability $P_{\\rm des}$ between positive and negative time delays. Furthermore, we also explore possible reasons for the usual underestimation of $P_{\\rm des}$ at zero delay given by state-of-the-art calculations. In particular, we improve the description of the energy exchange between CO and the metal surface at high $T_\\textrm{e}$ by including in the simulations a $T_\\textrm{e}$-dependent friction coefficient. The prediction for $P_{\\rm des}$ at zero delay in this case, increases by an order of magnitude, reducing its discrepancy with the experimental value. Altogether, our results hint to the importance of accounting for the temperature dependence of the electronic structure and properties in describing the extreme conditions generated in 2PC experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8109\u51b2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Pd(111)\u8868\u9762\u7684CO\u8131\u51fa\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u6216\u5f31\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u5230\u8fbe\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5148\u540e\u987a\u5e8f\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4eCO\u8986\u76d6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u5c24\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06CO\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u8868\u9762\u7684\u70ed\u4ea4\u6362\u4e0e\u5149\u6fc0\u7535\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7535\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u6bd4\u70ed\u5bb9\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e0e\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8868\u9762\u7684\u70ed\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6e29\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62dfCO\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u8868\u9762\u7684\u70ed\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u53cc\u8109\u51b2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6e29\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": " paper\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u8109\u51b2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53cc\u6e29\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86CO\u5728\u4e0d\u540cCO\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e0ePd(111)\u8868\u9762\u7684\u8131\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7535\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u6bd4\u70ed\u5bb9\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u53cc\u6e29\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c paper\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u5f3a\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u5148\u5230\u8fbe\u8868\u9762\u65f6\uff0cCO\u7684\u8131\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5f31\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u5148\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u5c24\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c paper\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7535\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u6bd4\u70ed\u5bb9\u540e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u7684\u96f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8131\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u503c\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": " paper\u7814\u7a76\u7684CO\u5728Pd(111)\u8868\u9762\u7684\u8131\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53cc\u6e29\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Kaganovich"], "title": "The Two-Measure Theory and an Overview of Some of its Manifestations", "comment": "38 pages, 7 figures, published in Universe (MDPI)", "summary": "The Two-Measure theory (TMT) has been developing since 1998 and has yielded a number of highly interesting results, including those not realized in traditional field theory models. The most important advantage of TMT as an alternative theory is that, under the conditions under which all classical tests of general relativity are performed, TMT models are able to accurately reproduce Einstein's general relativity. Despite this, TMT is still often perceived as something too exotic to be relevant to reality. In fact, the fundamental idea underlying TMT seems undeniable: if we truly believe in the effectiveness of mathematics in studying nature, we must agree that there must be a correspondence between the fundamental laws of nature and the structure of the mathematical apparatus necessary to adequately describe them.

Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies the Mpemba effect in quantum many-body systems and finds that the effect occurs primarily when the Hamiltonian commutes with other conserved quantities, which significantly impacts the system's ability to relax into a steady state.", "motivation": "Understanding the Mpemba effect in quantum systems is important for unraveling non-equilibrium dynamics and has implications for quantum thermodynamics and quantum simulation.", "method": "The authors employ a combination of analytical techniques, including Lieb-Robinson bounds and generalized hydrodynamics, supplemented by numerical tensor network and free-fermion techniques to analyze large-scale quantum systems.", "result": "The research conclusively shows that the presence of additional conserved quantities significantly influences the occurrence of the Mpemba effect, with systems exhibiting the effect only under specific conditions related to commuting Hamiltonians and conserved operators.", "conclusion": "The findings shed light on the conditions required for observing the Mpemba effect in quantum systems and offer insights into controlling non-equilibrium behavior in large quantum systems, aiding in the design of quantum technologies and simulators."}}

Of particular interest is the regime where the interacting electrons exhibit both spin and valley degeneracy, resulting in SU(4) Kondo physics. However, this regime is challenging to realize in typical mesoscopic systems because it requires a strong interaction between electrons, resulting in a Kondo temperature ($T_\\mathrm{K}$) significantly larger than the spin and valley splittings. Here, we present conductance measurements of a quantum point contact (QPC) in bilayer graphene (BLG). Beyond the expected quantized conductance plateaus, which reflect spin and valley degeneracy, we observe an additional subband, known as `0.7 anomaly' exhibiting signatures of Kondo physics and a $T_\\mathrm{K}$ ranging from approximately 0.5 up to 2.4 K at zero magnetic field, corresponding to Kondo energies between 40 and 200 $\u03bc$eV. Given that the spin-orbit splitting in BLG is between 40 and 80 $\u03bc$eV, we argue that these results are consistent with a transition between four-fold degenerate SU(4) and two-fold degenerate spin-valley locked SU(2) Kondo effects. Furthermore, we break the valley degeneracy of the lowest subband by an out-of-plane magnetic field and show that Kondo signatures remain present, indicating a transition from SU(4) to a valley-polarized SU(2) Kondo effect, and showing the versatility of BLG QPCs for exploring many-body effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The resulting frequencies show excellent agreement with those computed using the WKB and continued fraction methods, with typical deviations below $10^{-3}$.

The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This formalism has led to striking developments in the context of perturbative scattering, which corresponds to large impact parameter scattering. As a result, in its current form, the KMOC formulae can not be directly applied to processes for generic values of the impact parameter. However, there is a domain where the relationship between classical radiation and on-shell amplitudes can be stretched beyond large impact parameter scattering. This regime is defined by the soft expansion of outgoing radiation. It is thus natural to ask if such soft radiative fields can be computed using the basic paradigm set by the KMOC formalism. In this short note, we show that this is indeed the case for electromagnetic memory. That is, we compute an inclusive observable associated with soft flux at ${\\cal I}^{+}$ and show that, irrespective of the details of the hard scattering, this observable defines a non-perturbative formula for electromagnetic memory in the classical limit.

The electromagnetic sector is governed by a Generalized Nonlinear Electrodynamics (GNED) Lagrangian obtained from a root-$T\\bar T$ deformation constructed via the Courant--Hilbert approach, ensuring both duality invariance and causal propagation. This theory contains ModMax, Generalized Born-Infeld (GBI), and self-dual logarithmic electrodynamics as continuous limits. Within this framework we obtain exact charged AdS black hole solutions and perform a detailed study of their thermodynamic properties, including mass, temperature, entropy, and free energy. The resulting phase structure exhibits van der~Waals-type transitions between small and large black holes and features a characteristic swallowtail in the free energy at the critical point.\n  We further investigate the internal geometry and show that the nature of the central singularity is determined by the matter fields sourcing the spacetime. Analysis of the Kretschmann scalar demonstrates how gravity and electromagnetism jointly control curvature blow-up in charged and ModMax black holes, with gravity providing the leading divergence. In contrast, (GBI) and logarithmic (NED) models imprint distinct singularity profiles governed by the specific functional form of their Lagrangians. Examining the near-origin behavior of the metric allows us to identify the parameter ranges that support an event horizon and to determine when the solution instead becomes a naked singularity.

We analyze the evolution of surface Fermi-arc states across these regimes, highlighting their distinct behaviors during the gap-opening transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5916\u78c1\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5947\u70b9_decoupling\u548c\u80fd\u9699\u5f00\u5f20\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5916\u78c1\u573a\u5bf9\u5947\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u80fd\u9699\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u5f00\u5f20\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u5947\u70b9\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5947\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8bf1\u5bfc\u80fd\u9699\u5f00\u5f20\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u80fd\u9699\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5947\u70b9\u5728\u6676\u683c\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u6253\u4e0b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Distinct quark masses are realized by separating the flavor branes, producing holographic flavor hierarchies. We refine the calculation made in previous works: we impose Hermiticity on the induced metric and fix the expansion of the determinant for matrix valued fields. Implementing these improvements yields modified fluctuation equations and quantitatively different meson spectra: the scalar modes become heavier while the vector modes become lighter, removing the degeneracy reported in the literature. At finite 't Hooft coupling, we also observe a qualitatively different dependence of the vector modes on the quark masses.

Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion. Our work provides fundamental mechanistic understanding of chemical dynamics that can be used for designing new types of nanophotonics experiments that probe single-molecule chemistry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted.

A central challenge in many-body physics is that the identity of quantum phases, especially those with topological order, are often inaccessible through local observables or simple symmetry-breaking diagnostics. Here, we apply QDL techniques to the 2+1-dimensional toric-code loop-gas model in a magnetic field. Ground states are generated across multiple lattice sizes using a parametrized loop-gas circuit (PLGC) with a variational quantum-eigensolver (VQE) approach. We then train a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) across the full field-parameter range to perform phase classification and capture the overall phase structure. We also employ a physics-aware training protocol that excludes the near-critical region (0.2 <= x <= 0.4)) around (x_c = 0.25), the phase-transition point estimated by quantum Monte Carlo, reserving this window for testing to evaluate the ability of the model to learn the phase transition. In parallel, we implement an unsupervised quantum k-means method based on state overlaps, which partitions the dataset into two phases without prior labeling. Our supervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and accurately locates the phase transition, in close agreement with previously reported values; the unsupervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and locates the phase transition with a small offset as expected in finite volumes; both QDL methods outperform classical alternatives. These findings establish QDL as an effective framework for characterizing topological quantum matter, studying finite volume effects, and probing phase diagrams of higher-dimensional systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff08QDL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u660e\u786e\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u5229\u7528QDL\u65b9\u6cd5\u57282+1\u7ef4\u6258\u91cc\u4e9a\u4ee3\u7801\u73af\u8def\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u73af\u8def\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u7535\u8def\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u672c\u5f81\u89e3\u6cd5\uff08VQE\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5730\u6001\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5b50\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08QCNN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6355\u83b7\u6574\u4f53\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u9664\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u91cf\u5b50k-\u5747\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6001\u91cd\u53e0\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5212\u5206\u3002\u76d1\u7763QDL\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u523b\u753b\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6216\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u73af\u8def\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u7535\u8def\u4e0e\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u672c\u5f81\u89e3\u6cd5(VQE)\u751f\u6210\u5730\u6001\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(QCNN)\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u91cf\u5b50k-\u5747\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6001\u91cd\u53e0\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5212\u5206\u3002\u76d1\u7763QDL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u6392\u9664\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763QDL\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763QDL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8f7b\u5fae\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u4e24\u79cdQDL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86QDL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u523b\u753b\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff08QDL\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cQDL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u8f6c\u53d8\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The detector features three junctions connected to a superconducting island, which together carry out photoelectric conversion and charge readout. The enhanced light-matter coupling, crucial to photon to quasiparticle conversion, is provided by a granular aluminum-based high-impedance microwave resonator.

LEGEND operates High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors bare in liquid argon. $^{42}$K is attracted by the HPGe detectors' electric fields, and drifts toward the germanium surface, where it undergoes beta decay. LEGEND-1000 will mitigate $^{42}$K-induced background by using underground-sourced argon, depleted in cosmogenic isotopes. If underground argon is not available, mitigation techniques must be employed.

In particular, heat removal is directly linked to a fundamental requirement of quantum computation: the ability to reset a system to a pure state before computation. Efficient cooling is therefore crucial both for advancing our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and for enabling the development of modern quantum technologies. In this work, we devise a cooling task that exploits steerability, a fundamental form of quantum correlations, to demonstrate a provable quantum advantage over classically correlated scenarios in which steerability is absent. We quantify this advantage by the ratio between the heat removed using steerable quantum correlations and the heat removed using unsteerable classical correlations. Specifically, we show that steerable quantum correlations always provide a thermodynamic advantage in the cooling task. Remarkably, we further establish that the maximum achievable advantage is directly related to a geometric measure of steerability known as steerability robustness. Our results suggest that this thermodynamic advantage can serve as a witness of steerability. Finally, we present examples showing that the advantage can increase with the dimension of the underlying system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51b7\u5374\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u70ed\u91cf\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u8a00\uff0c Quantum\u91cd\u836f\u5e97\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edfreset\u56de\u7eaf\u6001\u4ee5\u4fbf\u7ee7\u7eed\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528steerable\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b7\u5374\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86steerable\u548c\u975esteerable\u7ecf\u5178\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u51b7\u5374\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u79f0\u4e3asteerability robustness\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0csteerable\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u51b7\u5374\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u603b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u7ea0\u7f20\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\u4e0esteerability robustness\u6709\u5173\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u80fd\u8d8a\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51b7\u5374\u70ed\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3asteerability\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u89c1\u8bc1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

The integrating hyperentanglement (combining polarization, OAM, and path degrees of freedom (DOFs)) raises the theoretical success probability to 100%, achieving deterministic BSA.

In this system, the magnon mode in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is coupled to only one of two rotating microwave modes in the torus-shaped microwave cavity. When two-photon drives are applied to both ports of the waveguide, the chiral cavity-magnon coupling leads to an unconventional photon blockade in one propagation direction, resulting in directional single-photon emission. The emission direction of the single-photon source can be controlled by reversing the biased magnetic field. Furthermore, we further examine the effects of imperfect chiral cavity-magnon coupling and the coupling between the two cavity modes on the photon blockade behavior. The results show that the system retains robustness in the presence of these nonideal factors, and the unidirectional photon blockade effect remains clearly preserved.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent experiments with subwavelength arrays of quantum dots have observed superradiance at room temperature, revealing a delicate competition between collective enhancement of coherent emission and pure dephasing $\u03b3^*$, which destroys it.

In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains.

Spectroscopic measurements serve as an effective means of elucidating detailed information about the system, such as the energy-level structure and the transition matrix elements of the KPO. Conventional spectroscopy requires the drive frequency to match an energy spacing with a nonzero transition matrix element. In recent years, a phenomenon called photonic resonance (PR) has been theoretically predicted in KPO spectroscopy. Specifically, resonance occurs under the condition that the detuning is set to $n/2$ times the Kerr nonlinearity, where $n$ is a natural number. However, under this condition the transition matrix element vanishes, and thus the mechanism by which photonic resonance (PR) arises has remained unclear. In this work, we aim to elucidate the physical origin of PR observed in KPO spectroscopy. We first performed theoretical calculations and experiments of spectroscopic measurements, confirming that PR can indeed be observed and that the theoretical and experimental results are in qualitative agreement. We then carried out an analytical study under the assumption of an ideal noiseless environment. Our analysis revealed that, although the transition matrix element of the external field expressed in the system's energy eigenbasis is zero, higher-order perturbative effects induce Rabi oscillations between the ground and excited states. Furthermore, numerical simulations in a time domain including the effect of decoherence demonstrated that coherent oscillations decay, leading to the appearance of PR.", "AI": {"tldr": "Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) spectroscopy exhibits photonic resonance (PR) under specific detuning conditions, despite the transition matrix element vanishing, due to higher-order effects and decoherence.", "motivation": "Understanding the physical mechanisms behind photonic resonance in KPO spectroscopy is important for quantum information processing applications.", "method": "Theoretical calculations, spectroscopic measurements, and numerical simulations under an ideal noiseless environment were performed.", "result": "PR can be observed in KPO spectroscopy, and the theoretical and experimental results are in qualitative agreement.", "conclusion": "The mechanism of PR in KPO spectroscopy involves Rabi oscillations induced by higher-order perturbative effects and decoherence."}}

Large numbers of entangled subsystems also require experimentally accessible and practically feasible methods of verifying the genuine, i.e., simultaneous, entanglement of all subsystems. We have derived a class of entanglement witnesses suitable for $W$-states, which are states where a single excitation is coherently distributed across subsystems initially in their ground state or a state with low thermal occupation, e.g., via detection of a Raman-scattered photon. The entanglement is witnessed through violation of an inequality involving number statistics, which can be measured via detection of subsequent Raman-scattered photons. Unlike conventional, partially tomographic, witnesses, our method is experimentally accessible for both multipartite and continuous variable systems. The thermal robustness of the method is quantified by the initial thermal occupations for which violation occurs. As an alternative approach, we have derived an inequality which tests the nonlocal, or quantum coherent, nature of the photon measurement backaction which produces the $W$-state.

There were numerous problems this experiment and how it was interpreted. First, the experiment is not observing stationary states as claimed, but rather the time-averaged density of wave pulses which reflect off the potential step. Second, the proposed method for measuring a propagation speed is shown to be invalid for true stationary states. Third, the invalid method was misapplied to the time-averaged density, and this is shown to have created the false impression that it yields correct speed values for stationary states. These issues notwithstanding, for a wavefunction $\u03c8= Re^{iS/\\hbar}$, the velocity of interest, $\\vec{v}_s = -\\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\frac{\\vec{\\nabla}R}{R}$, is different than the Bohm velocity $\\vec{v}_B=\\frac{1}{m}\\vec{\\nabla}S$, and may be nonzero for stationary states.

We also note that, because the original 3-element contexts are no longer maximal in $\\mathbb{R}^6$, the embedded configuration admits two-valued states even though its realisation with maximal contexts in $\\mathbb{C}^3$ is Kochen-Specker uncolourable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u7ec4\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u5176\u5b9e\u6570\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5173\u7cfb\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5c04\u7ebf\u6b63\u4ea4\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c04\u7ebf\u8d4b\u4e88\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u518d\u5e94\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5c04\u7ebf\u5728\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684165\u4e2a\u5c04\u7ebf\u5728\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6620\u5c04\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u5141\u8bb8\u4e24\u4e2a\u503c\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u539f\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u662f\u65e0\u8272\u4e0d\u53ef\u7740\u8272\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u76f8\u4f4d\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, standard deep learning suffers from a fundamental issue: loss of plasticity, in which networks gradually lose their ability to learn from new data. Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold.

Focusing on permutation constrained objectives, we show that the standard generic QAOA ansatz, with a transverse field mixer and diagonal r local cost, faces an intrinsic feasibility bottleneck: even after angle optimization, circuits whose depth grows at most linearly with n cannot raise the total probability mass on the feasible manifold much above the uniform baseline suppressed by the size of the full Hilber space. Against this envelope we introduce a minimal constraint enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) that operates directly inside a product one hot subspace and mixes with a block local XY Hamiltonian. For permutation constrained problems, we prove an angle robust, depth matched exponential enhancement where the ratio between the feasible mass from CE QAOA and generic QAOA grows exponentially in $n^2$ for all depths up to a linear fraction of n, under a mild polynomial growth condition on the interaction hypergraph.

The vector beam consists of vortex pulse pairs with right- and left-circular polarizations, corresponding to opposite spin angular momentum (SAM), and carrying opposite orbital angular momentum (OAM) charges $\\pm l$. We show that during the propagation of the vortex pairs, analytically obtained in the linear regime, the medium inherits the topology of the vortex pair, mapping the OAM onto a spatially structured atomic coherence. This mapping produces $2|l|-$fold azimuthal transparency structures that reshape the beam intensity from a ring into a petal-like pattern. The OAM-structured atomic coherence induces a corresponding optical anisotropy within the medium, which feeds back into the propagating vector beam, resulting in optical spin-orbit coupling manifested as SAM exchange, rotation, and evolution of polarization textures. Depending on the initial ground-state population of the phaseonium, the polarization state evolves between left-circular, linear, and right-circular polarizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Adapted from double-drive reset of population (DDROP), the protocol utilizes simultaneous drives on the transmon and its readout resonator, leveraging the dispersive shift to create a directional process that returns the transmon to the computational subspace.

The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728Hamiltonian\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94Hamiltonian\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6784\u5efa\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u57fa\u6001\u7684\u5355\u5143aries\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8eHamiltonian\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9aHamiltonian\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673aHamiltonians\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u591a\u516d\u7ef4\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ecTransverse-field Ising\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u914d\u5bf9Hamiltonian\u3002\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u9650\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u81f3\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc6\u522b\u91cf\u5b50\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u65f6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c Possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached."}}
