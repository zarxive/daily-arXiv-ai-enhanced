In this work, the influence of the electrical properties on heat transfer across metal/doped semiconductor junctions is investigated. Specifically, thermal boundary conductance at the interfaces between p- and n-doped silicon and titanium is measured by employing frequency-domain photothermal radiometry under varying external conditions. The influence of the doping level of the semiconductor, the barrier height, and the space charge area is analyzed. In particular, a 40% increase in the interface thermal conductance with the application of a current at n-doped silicon/titanium interfaces is reported. The enhancement of the thermal boundary conductance is explained by the shrinking of the surface charga area induced by the electric current. This study opens the way to modulating interfacial heat transfer at metal/semiconductor interfaces through fine tuning of electrical effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments.

Field-cooling from above the N\u00e9el temperature is a reliable yet slow re-pinning method in exchange-biased systems. For on-demand reprogrammable devices, localized and rapid exchange bias repinning methods are essential. Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature.

The analysis methods include atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and most importantly electrical characterization. The electrical characterization focuses on comparing different test structures and extraction methods for mobility, contact resistance, IV-curve hysteresis and doping parameters. The comparison shows that the selected measurement test structures and analysis methods can have a large impact on the extracted values and should thus be considered when comparing data sets between different sources.

This can be achieved without the need for obvious morphological or structural asymmetries in the form of the organism, or in the number or organisation of propulsion-generating appendages such as cilia. In this work, we identify and validate a core principle of asymmetric turning in biflagellate microswimmers: propulsive forces interact constructively to drive translation whilst interacting destructively to drive rotation. We explore the ramifications of this tunable biflagellar swimming mechanism across a range of systems, from a simple, back-of-the-envelope model to a detailed computational representation of an exemplar swimmer. This leads to a markedly general quantitative relation between key drivers of asymmetry, such as ciliary beat frequency, and the curvature of emergent trajectories. We discuss how the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which actuates its two cilia in a symmetric breaststroke for forward swimming, may exploit this feature for phototaxis.

Submitted to Acta Astronautica", "summary": "Dynamical structures in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are fundamental for designing low-energy transfers, as they aid in analyzing phase space transport and designing desirable trajectories. This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8elobes\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u7403-\u6708\u7403\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6269\u5927\u592a\u7a7a\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8egraph\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u91cd\u53d1\u5c04\u70b9\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5730\u7403-\u6708\u7403\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8elobes\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

In these systems it is known that relativistic effects, such as the Breit interaction and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, are important for an accurate understanding of atomic properties. It is also known that inclusion of correlations alongside the Breit effect is crucial. In this work we include the Breit interaction into all-orders calculations of energy levels and fine structure intervals of ions in the Cs and Fr isoelectronic sequences. This requires modifying the electron Green's function to account for Breit within the all-orders correlation potential method, which sums dominating series of perturbation diagrams exactly using a Feynman diagram technique. We find that Breit corrections to the energies of moderately ionized ions along these sequences are very large, particularly for the f states. We also observe a significant deviation from experiment for these levels. Incorporating Breit into the all-orders correlation potential provides a significant additional contribution beyond including Breit at the second-order level alone. While this does not resolve the disagreement in the energy levels, it does substantially improve the fine-structure intervals beyond what is achieved by including Breit only at second order. Furthermore, we include the frequency-dependent Breit interaction into the Dirac-Fock procedure, and find that this does not significantly modify the energy levels at this order of approximation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The asymptotic analysis is based on that the penetration depth of the beam into skin is much smaller than the size of beam cross-section. It allows arbitrary incident angle. We expand the temperature in powers of the small depth to lateral scale ratio. The incident angle affects all terms in the expansion while the lateral heat conduction appears only in terms of positive even powers. The previously obtained leading term solution captures only the main effect of incident angle. The main effect of lateral heat conduction is contained in the second order term, which is mathematically negligible in the limit of small depth to lateral scale ratio. At a moderate length scale ratio (e.g., 0.1), however, the contribution from lateral conduction is quite significant and needs to be included in a meaningful approximate solution. In this study, we derive closed form analytical expressions for the first order and the second order terms in the asymptotic expansion. The resulting asymptotic solution is capable of predicting the temperature distribution accurately including the effects of both incident angle and lateral heat conduction even at a moderate length scale ratio.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u89e3\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u659c\u7167\u89d2\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6bd4\u503c\u4e0b\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u76ae\u80a4\u52a0\u70ed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u7167\u5c04\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e42\u5c55\u5f00\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u5b54\u9699\u6bd4\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u659c\u7167\u89d2\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6e10\u8fd1\u89e3\u5728\u5c0f\u6bd4\u503c\u4e0b\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u7b2c\u4e00\u9879\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9879\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u6bd4\u503c\u4e0b\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5c0f\u6bd4\u503c\u4e0b\u5ffd\u7565\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9879\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9879\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We introduce the Dunkl creation and annihilation operators and show that their quadratic combinations generate an $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra.

The exact energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of the Dunkl number coherent states. Furthermore, we compute the Mandel $Q$ parameter and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ to analyze the statistical properties of the Dunkl squeezed states. We show that, for the squeezed vacuum, the Mandel parameter remains independent of the Dunkl deformation, whereas the correlation function exhibits an explicit dependence on the Dunkl parameter $\u03bc$, which modifies the photon bunching effects.

In momentum space where the three-point correlation is determined by two wavevectors $\\mathbf{q}_1$ and $\\mathbf{q}_2$, the singularity takes the form $|\\mathbf{q}_1\\times\\mathbf{q}_2|$. We explain how this singularity is sharply defined in a long-wavelength collinear limit. For a non-interacting Fermi gas, the coefficient of this singularity is given by the quantized Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea, and it implies a long-range real space correlation favoring collinear configurations. We show that this singularity persists in interacting Fermi liquids, and express the renormalization of the coefficient of singularity in terms of Landau parameters, for both spinless and spinful Fermi liquids.

To reduce the computational overhead associated with training, particularly when Hessian information is included, we implement graphics processing unit accelerated black box matrix matrix multiplication, achieving an order of magnitude speedups relative to standard implementations. For rate calculations, we introduce a selective Hessian training strategy that distinguishes flexible modes strongly coupled to the transferring proton from more rigid modes weakly coupled to the reaction coordinate. This enables the construction of accurate surrogate potential energy surfaces with substantially fewer Hessian evaluations. Applications to malonaldehyde and Z-3-aminopropenal demonstrate that tunneling rates can be predicted within 20% of exact values while reducing force and Hessian evaluations.

In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center.

We use a momentum dependent interaction that reproduces the s-wave scattering phase shifts of a contact interaction up to a momentum cutoff that is scaled with the Fermi momentum. Using a diagrammatic formulation of Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory, suitably augmented by self-consistency conditions, we obtain the Hartree shift and the pairing gap to third order. In the weak-coupling regime, our results are not only well-converged but also agree with the well-established Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov corrections for the gap and the Galitskii result for the Hartree shift. Near the unitary regime, our results for the Nambu-Gor'kov self-energy are less converged, but there is still reasonable agreement with experiments as well as with quantum Monte-Carlo results.

In this work, we introduce a physics-informed method that addresses this by incorporating the full micromagnetic energy directly into the variational formulation. Built on a PyTorch backend, our forward model integrates an auto-differentiable finite-differences micromagnetic framework with FFT-based stray-field calculations and Fourier-space upward continuation. This enables efficient gradient-based optimization via the adjoint method and allows the sensor-sample distance to be treated as an optimization parameter. By doing so, we eliminate the experimental uncertainty arising from unknown NV implantation depths and surface oxidation layers. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates high-fidelity reconstruction of spin textures and precise sensor height estimation. Furthermore, when applied to NV measurements of the van der Waals ferromagnet $Fe_{3-x}GaTe_2$, the method reconstructs the previously unknown NV-sample distance and physically plausible magnetization textures, which accurately reproduce the experimental observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4eceNV\u81ea\u65cb\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u4f59\u5f26\u573a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u78c1\u5316\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u672a\u77e5NV implantation\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6c27\u5316\u5c42\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u78c1\u5316\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9ad8\u5ea6\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u4e2d\uff0cNV\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u5173\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9NV\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u77e5\u9053NV implantation\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u9762\u6c27\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u78c1\u5316\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9ad8\u5ea6\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5fae\u78c1\u80fd\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528PyTorch\u540e\u7aef\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u5fae\u78c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eFFT\u7684 stray-field\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u5ef6\u7eed\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u901a\u8fc7\u4f34\u968f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u6837\u54c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u672a\u77e5NV implantation\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6c27\u5316\u5c42\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u78c1\u5316\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u5728Fe3-xGaTe2\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7NV\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cd\u6784NV\u548c\u6837\u54c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u78c1\u5316\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u518d\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4eceNV\u81ea\u65cb\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u4f59\u5f26\u573a\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u78c1\u5316\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u65cb\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002"}}

When rhythms arise from limit cycles, phase reduction theory shows that their dynamics are universally modeled as coupled phase oscillators under weak coupling. This simple representation enables direct inference of inter-rhythm coupling functions from measured time-series data. However, strongly rhythmic chaos can masquerade as noisy limit cycles. In such cases, standard estimators still return plausible coupling functions even though a phase-oscillator model lacks a priori justification. We therefore extend the phase description to the chaotic oscillators. Specifically, we derive a closed equation for the phase difference by defining the phase on a Poincar\u00e9 section and averaging the phase dynamics over invariant measures of the induced return maps. Numerically, the derived theoretical functions are in close agreement with those inferred from time-series data.

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems.

For that purpose, we analyze the Raman force on the shear phonons of a frustrated magnetoelectric bilayer spin system. The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated.

For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape.

Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems.

Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Dissipative forces can be utilized as a resource in quantum systems to induce various dynamical behaviors like synchronized oscillations, transient chaos, and steady-state chaos by tuning interaction parameters.

Compared to ultrafast spectroscopies, these techniques have very high structural-information content and competitive time-resolution, but sensitivity to relative changes in electron scattering intensity is orders of magnitude lower. Hybrid pixel counting detectors (HPCDs) are a promising technology for improved sensitivity and signal-to-noise in UED(S) experiments, as they offer near-zero readout noise and dark counts with the possibility of new acquisition modalities (e.g. shot-to-shot normalization) due to their high frame rates. However, it is well known that HPCDs suffer from count losses at high electron fluxes even in CW beam applications. How this translates to ultrashort electron pulse exposures has yet to be determined and is critical to understanding the application of this technology to ultrafast electron scattering experiments. Here we show that count losses are exacerbated significantly in ultrafast (pulsed) experiments and that HPCDs require count rates to be kept below $\\approx 2$ electrons per pixel per pulse. This count-rate limitation presents a severe constraint on electron bunch charge when interrogating single crystal samples. A model for the electron counting uncertainties in HPCDs across the entire relevant range of average count rates is proposed, from which we derive experimental strategies to optimize data quality in UEDS using direct electron detectors. Finally, we suggest ways HPCDs could be better adapted to ultrashort pulsed beam experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u81f4\u7535\u5b50\u884d\u5c04\u548c\u6d88\u58f0\u6563\u5c04\u5b9e\u9a8c(UED(S))\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u6750\u6599\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86HPCD\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u7535\u8377\u6d41\u5931\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u7535\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316UEDS\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdbHPCD\u9002\u914d\u8d85\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u5149\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u5149\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dHPCD\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86HPCD\u7684\u7535\u8377\u6d41\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0HPCD\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u7535\u8377\u6d41\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7535\u5b50 bunch \u7684\u7535\u8377\u91cf\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316UEDS \u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb HPCD \u6280\u672f\u5728\u8d85\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u5149\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "HPCD \u6280\u672f\u5728UED(S)\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u8377\u6d41\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8d85\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u5149\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002"}}

The treatment combines (i) multichannel quantum-defect theory and long-range polarization models to determine the field-free energies of $n\\ell$ Rydberg states of the molecules ($\\ell$ is the orbital-angular-momentum quantum number of the Rydberg electron), (ii) a matrix-diagonalization approach to calculate the Stark shifts including their hyperfine structure, and (iii) sequences of angular-momentum frame transformations to predict the line positions and intensities in Stark spectra as they would be observed in single or multiphoton excitation sequences. To clarify how the molecular rotation and the nuclear spins influence the fine and hyperfine structure of molecular Rydberg-Stark spectra, we compare calculated spectra of ortho-D$_2$ with a D$_2^+$ ion core in the rotational ground state ($N^+=0$) for total nuclear spins $I$ of 0 (i.e., without hyperfine structure) and 2 (i.e., with hyperfine structure) with the corresponding spectra of para-H$_2$ with an H$_2^+$ ion core in the first excited rotational state ($N^+=2$) but zero nuclear spin ($I=0$). The calculations show that the hyperfine interaction alone does not significantly modify the Stark effect, but splits each Stark state by almost exactly the hyperfine Fermi-contact splitting of the ion core. In contrast, the effect of the molecular rotation, which is coupled both to the ion-core electron spin by the magnetic spin-rotation interaction and to the Rydberg-electron orbital motion by the core-polarization and charge-quadrupole interactions, induces Stark-state specific splittings that significantly differ from the spin-rotation splitting of the ($N^+=2$) ion core.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5b50\u9ad8\u4e3b\u91cf\u5b50\u6570Rydberg\u6001\u7684\u6781\u5fae\u548c\u8d85\u6781\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u9759\u6b62\u5300\u5f3a\u7535\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u9759\u6b62\u7535\u573a\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u9ad8\u80fd\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6781\u5fae\u548c\u8d85\u6781\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u6e20\u9053\u91cf\u5b50\u7f3a\u9677\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6781\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53d7\u7535\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5206\u5b50Rydberg\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u573a\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6781\u5fae\u548c\u8d85\u6781\u5fae\u4f4d\u79fb\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u53d8\u6362\u9884\u6d4b\u7535\u573a\u4e2dRydberg\u5206\u5b50\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5b50\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u5bf9Rydberg- Stark\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6781\u5fae\u548c\u8d85\u6781\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u8d85\u6781\u5fae\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u6539\u53d8 Stark \u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u5206\u88c2\u6bcf\u4e2a Stark \u6001\uff1b\u5206\u5b50\u65cb\u8f6c\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u6027\u81ea\u65cb-\u65cb\u8f6c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e\u79bb\u5b50\u6838\u5fc3\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u5fc3\u6781\u5316\u548c\u6838\u7535\u8377\u5076\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e Rydberg \u7535\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4 Stark \u6001\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u88c2\u4e0e (N\u207a=2) \u79bb\u5b50\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-\u65cb\u8f6c\u5206\u88c2\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u5b50Rydberg- Stark\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6781\u5fae\u548c\u8d85\u6781\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \\approx 125$--$130$~K and the N\u00e9el temperature $T_N \\approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system. These findings highlight the central role of magnetoelastic coupling in iron-based superconductors beyond the itinerant regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The field theory governs the competition between a mass term and an interaction involving the product of $N$ order-parameter fields, which is realized, e.g. in coupled Ising chains, two-leg spin ladders, and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains. By combining a perturbative renormalization group analysis and large-scale matrix-product state simulations, we systematically determine the nature of the phase transition as a function of $N$. For $N=2$ and $N=3$, we confirm that the transition is continuous, belonging to the Ising and four-state Potts universality classes, respectively. In contrast, for $N \\ge 4$, our results provide compelling evidence that the transition becomes first order. We further apply these findings to specific lattice models with SO($N$) symmetry, including spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ two-leg ladders, that realize a direct transition between an SO($N$) symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase.

At its heart lies the exchange-correlation functional, a quantity which exactly encapsulates the many-body effects stemming from the quantum mechanical interactions between the electrons. Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency.\n  This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems.\n  This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A promising direction to realize systems exhibiting novel universal behavior beyond TLL is through the generalization of the underlying Fermi sea. In this Letter, we show that fractional Fermi seas with reduced occupancy arise in an integrable Bose gas driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in interactions from repulsive to attractive.

This coupling acts as a gravitational $\u03b8$-angle parameter, forcing the CC to become quantized into discrete topological sectors. The symmetry-breaking dynamics naturally selects the sector corresponding to the observed vacuum energy. The selected vacuum state is stabilized by the extremely large potential barrier of the pre-geometric Higgs field, which effectively seals it off from quantum tunneling transitions to other topological sectors.

From the exact scattering data, we evaluate transport coefficients by solving the Boltzmann equation with energy-resolved phase shifts. We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail.

Here, we demonstrate that correlated disorder enables precise engineering of light scattering from 2D arrays of emitters resulting in strong observable colors. Our analytical framework shows that introducing controlled noise, with tunable probability density functions and correlations, generates three distinct scattering components: diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. Correlation halos, often mistaken for broadened diffraction peaks, are independent features whose positions depend on correlation range and can appear between Bragg peaks.

The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity).

This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties.

Here, we circumvent this limitation and demonstrate an all-optical mechanism for reconfiguring far-field singularities in a photonic crystal laser. The underlying principle involves optical pumping, which creates a mesoscopic potential landscape whose spatial variations are slow compared to the lattice period. Such a potential localizes a Bloch band into trapped states whose envelope functions, and thus far-field singularity textures, are defined by the pump geometry. Using a honeycomb photonic crystal that supports a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum, we achieve room-temperature telecom-band lasing with real-space polarisation singularities that are reconfigurable in both number and position, while the intrinsic momentum-space singularity at the $\u0393$-point is preserved.

While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u5e38\u6570\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e-inspired\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\u6355\u83b7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "motivation": "\u6355\u83b7\u5468\u671f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5982LISA\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Schwarzschild-de Sitter\uff08SdS\uff09\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u5e38\u6570\u5bf9\u675f\u7f1a\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u5b87\u5b99\u5e38\u6570\u52a0\u901f\u4e8c\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u8f6f\u5316\uff0c\u7f29\u77ed plunge\u65f6\u95f4", "conclusion": "\u5b87\u5b99\u5e38\u6570\u5bf9\u6355\u83b7\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76"}}

Recent work has provided three complementary descriptions of this phenomenon: an emergent $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ organization of static near-zone perturbations, a graded logarithmic and multi-zeta structure in Shell Effective Field Theory (Shell EFT), and an on-shell matching framework based on gravitational Raman scattering with renormalization group (RG) running. We show that these features arise from a common near-zone truncation mechanism. For a massless scalar field, horizon regularity selects a unique static solution forming a highest-weight-type representation, truncating the hypergeometric solution to a finite polynomial and eliminating the independent decaying branch at large radius. This excludes a static Wilson coefficient in the effective theory. We demonstrate that the same truncation operates in the static Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. Analytic continuation of the horizon-regular solution to small frequency via the Coulomb-hypergeometric or Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalisms preserves this truncation as an anchoring condition for the renormalized angular momentum parameter. The resulting low-frequency expansion is controlled by Gamma and hypergeometric functions, generating a graded algebra of logarithms and odd Riemann zeta values. Within this structure no invariant of negative weight exists in the static sector, so the vanishing of the static Love number follows as a structural consequence. This explains the ``zero-sum'' rule of Shell EFT and why the self-induced RG flow in gravitational Raman scattering cannot generate a static invariant.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In recent years, this paradigm has evolved from a classical description of radiation and acceleration toward a fully quantum framework, transforming our understanding of light-matter interactions at the single-electron level. These advances have opened new opportunities in high-resolution imaging, ultrafast spectroscopy, interferometry, and the coherent shaping of electron wavepackets. This review surveys stimulated interactions between slow electrons and light, encompassing free-space and near-field mediated mechanisms. We discuss how free-space optical fields coherently modulate electron momentum and energy, and how near-field coupling in nanophotonic and plasmonic structures enables strong, phase-matched, efficient momentum exchange with the electron wavepacket. We further describe electron recoil, which is significant in the slow-electron regime, and temporal and spatial wavepacket shaping that enhances coupling efficiency and extends access to quantum-coherent regimes. Building on these foundations, we outline emerging frameworks including hybrid optical-electrostatic modulation, ponderomotive laser-based aberration correction, and optical electron interferometry. By unifying these developments, stimulated electron-light interactions provide a versatile route to precise beam control, quantum-state engineering, and tailored light-matter coupling, with implications for ultrafast spectroscopy, nanoscale metrology, attosecond pulse generation, electron-photon entanglement, and the creation of nonclassical states of light.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6162\u7535\u5b50\u4e0e\u5149\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u523a\u6fc0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fd1\u573a\u8bf1\u53d1\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5149\u81f4\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u8fd1\u573a\u8026\u5408\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u6ce2\u5305\u5f62\u5851\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7535\u5b50\u56de\u5c04\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u573a\u7684\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149-\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8c03\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u5feb\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7eb3\u7c73\u6d4b\u8ddd\u3001\u65f6\u949f\u8109\u51b2\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5149-\u7535\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5149\u573a\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5149-\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u8d85\u5feb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u7740\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u56de\u987e\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u6162\u7535\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0b\u7684\u5149-\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u7406\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u6162\u7535\u5b50\u4e0e\u5149\u7684\u523a\u6fc0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fd1\u573a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5149\u81f4\u52a8\u91cf\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u6ce2\u5305\u5f62\u5851\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u7535\u5b50\u56de\u5c04\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5f3a\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8c03\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5149-\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u6162\u7535\u5b50 regime \u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u8c03\u63a7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5149\u81f4\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u8fd1\u573a\u8026\u5408\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u6ce2\u5305\u5f62\u5851\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u56de\u5c04\u548c\u5149\u573a\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u8c03\u63a7\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8d85\u5feb\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7eb3\u7c73\u6d4b\u8ddd\u3001\u65f6\u949f\u8109\u51b2\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5149-\u7535\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5149\u573a\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u6162\u7535\u5b50\u4e0e\u5149\u7684\u523a\u6fc0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5176\u5728\u8d85\u5feb\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7eb3\u7c73\u6d4b\u8ddd\u3001\u65f6\u949f\u8109\u51b2\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5149-\u7535\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5149\u573a\u5236\u9020\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Our results show that the transient superradiant burst exhibits the expected peak intensity scaling $I_{\\max}\\!\\sim\\! N^2$, with a universal finite-size correction $|\u03be(N)-2|\\!\\sim\\! 1/\\ln N$ that governs the apparent scaling exponent in realistic ensembles. In the stationary regime, collective broadening modifies the EIT response: although it typically enhances absorption, it counterintuitively increases the group velocity, leading to a relative scaling $v_g\\!\\propto\\! N^2$, even while $v_g\\!\\ll\\! c$. This effect suggests that cooperative interactions fundamentally limit the achievable slow-light delay in dense media. To achieve these results, we derive a representative-atom master equation that quantitatively reproduces both the superradiant and EIT regimes, in excellent agreement with the exact symmetric-subspace dynamics and correctly incorporating collective feedback and $N$-dependent broadening. This unified framework bridges transient superradiant emission and steady-state quantum interference, with direct implications for slow light, quantum memories, and precision metrology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u80fd\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728Dicke\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u5c04\u4e0e\u7535Magnetically\u8bf1\u5bfc\u900f\u660e\u5ea6(EIT)\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6682\u6001\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5448$I_{max} \tilsim N^2$\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6709\u9650\u4fee\u6b63\u9879$|\tau(N)-2| \tilsim 1/\text{ln} N$\u3002\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u96c6\u4f53\u8272\u6563\u6539\u53d8\u4e86EIT\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff1a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u901a\u5e38\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5438\u6536\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u53cd\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7fa4\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728$v_g \tilsim N^2$\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301$v_g \textbackslashll c$\u3002\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u9650\u5236\u6162\u5149\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5b9a\u91cf\u8fd8\u539f\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u548cEIT\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u539f\u5b50\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b8c\u7f8e\u543b\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u96c6\u4f53\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eN\u7684\u5c55\u5bbd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6682\u6001\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u5c04\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5bf9\u6162\u5149\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u6d4b\u5b9a\u7b49\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4ea4\u53c9\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e09\u80fd\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u548cEIT\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u5cf0\u503c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff1b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6001\u4e0b\u96c6\u4f53\u8272\u6563\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86EIT\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7fa4\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e14\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5149\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6 explains the connection between super-radiance and EIT, \u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e cooperation induced limits on slow light delays in dense media.

Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \\emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e8c\u5143\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u8f6c\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u8fdb\u52a8\u53ca\u5176\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9_remnant\u9ed1\u6d1e\u56de\u63a8\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u8fdb\u52a8\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u548c_remnant\u9ed1\u6d1e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u672a\u6765\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5982NGO\u548cLISA\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "subdominant\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9\u56de\u63a8\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5ffd\u7565\u5b83\u4eec\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u901f\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u9ad8\u8fbe210 km/s\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u8bef masses\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "subdominant\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5e94\u7eb3\u5165\u672a\u6765\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6b21\u8981\u591a\u6781\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u63a8\u65ad\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53c2\u6570\u4ea7\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

Here, we report the observation of a coherent mesoscopic spin state in a disordered ensemble of substitutional nitrogen (P1) centers in diamond. An iterative Hartmann-Hahn protocol transfers polarization from dense nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to a P1 ensemble, yielding a 740-fold enhancement over room-temperature thermal equilibrium as revealed by differential readout. The resulting mesoscopic P1 spin ensemble exhibits collective Rabi oscillations and long-lived spin-lock and Hahn-echo coherences. We identify a crossover in the saturation polarization arising from the competition between coherent driving and local disorder, providing a quantitative measure of the system's intrinsic disorder.

Our method is a direct, explicit one, in the sense that we identify the appropriate Feynman graphs, we compute their amplitudes which then allows us to obtain the $\u03b2$ functions of the model. We perform these computation considering both a long-range and a short-range propagator, within the dimensional regularization framework. We find three fixed points in the short-range case and a line of fixed points, parameterized by the wheel interaction, in the long-range case. This line of fixed points is identical to the one found in the case of the $U(N)^3$-invariant model.

Proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop transformer framework for phase-only far-field holography", "summary": "Phase-only computer-generated holography (CGH) seeks a phase pattern for a spatial light modulator (SLM) whose propagated optical field reproduces a desired intensity distribution. In the far-field (Fraunhofer) regime, optical propagation reduces to a Fourier transform, such that each hologram pixel contributes to the entire reconstructed intensity distribution. When restricted to phase-only modulation, intensity must be shaped through global phase interference effects, making the inverse mapping from target intensity to phase highly non-linear and sensitive to local minima. We present a proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop approach in which a transformer maps a target intensity image to a phase-only SLM field and is trained end-to-end through exact FFT-based propagation embedded directly within optimization. We further observe that patch tokenization strongly shapes the optimization geometry: coarse tokenization acts as an implicit spectral regularizer that stabilizes training and suppresses checkerboard-like attractors, while finer tokenization increases spatial degrees of freedom but benefits from curriculum or hierarchical refinement. Despite training on limited primitives and restricted digit subsets, the learned generator exhibits out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to unseen digits and hand-drawn target patterns. These results suggest that transformer architectures, whose self-attention enables global token interactions, are a natural fit for far-field holography and provide a viable foundation for scalable physics-grounded hologram generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e transformers \u7684\u76f8\u4f4donly \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5171\u805a\u7126\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528_exact FFT-based \u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5212\u5206token\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u5212\u9700\u501f\u52a9\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7cbe\u70bc\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5149\u6805\u663e\u793a\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u7136\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c_perms \u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5171\u805a\u7126\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5149\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u3001\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u5c06\u76f8\u4f4donly \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5171\u805a\u7126\u6210\u50cf\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 transformer \u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165_exact FFT-based \u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5149\u6805\u663e\u793a\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 finetuned \u7684Transformers \u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u6784\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4e3a\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u76f8\u4f4donly \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5171\u805a\u7126\u6210\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u548c token \u533a\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing and no more.

The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimisation, including brute force computer search, to optimise quantum computations.

Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate the inflationary predictions of the $\u03b2$-exponential potential, $V(\u03c6)=V_0\\left(1-\u03bb\u03b2\u03c6/M_p\\right)^{1/\u03b2}$ considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled realizations. This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios. We derive analytical expressions for the slow-roll parameters and inflationary observables using a perturbative expansion in the non-minimal coupling $\u03be$, and validate these results through numerical calculations. In the minimally coupled case, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq 0.976$ and $r \\simeq 0.035$ for $N=50$ and moderate values of \u03b2, remaining compatible with ACT+DESI constraints at the 1\u03c3level while yielding a spectral tilt larger than the universal attractor prediction. Introducing a small non-minimal coupling significantly improves agreement with observations by suppressing the tensor-to-scalar ratio while preserving the enhanced scalar tilt. For $N=60, \u03bb\\sim 0.3-0.5$, and $\u03b2\\sim O(1-5)$, the non-minimally coupled model yields $n_s \\simeq 0.974-0.976$ and $r \\lesssim 0.03$, comfortably consistent with ACT, DESI, and BICEP/Keck bounds. Our results show that the $\u03b2$-exponential potential, especially when implemented with a non-minimal coupling, exhibits good agreement with the latest CMB observations.

Strain engineering of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) enables the tuning of light-matter interactions and associated optoelectronic properties, and generates new functionalities, including the formation of quantum dots (QDs). Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($\u03bc$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device. Compared with delocalized excitons, QDs in both materials exhibit enhanced strain sensitivities of their emission energies $-$ approximately fourfold in WS$_2$ and twofold in WSe$_2$ $-$ leading to pronounced broadening of the ensemble emission linewidth. Temperature-dependent $\u03bc$-PL spectroscopy combined with dynamic strain tuning experiments further reveal that the enhanced strain sensitivity of individual QDs originates from strengthened interactions with low-energy phonons induced by quantum confinement. Our results demonstrate a versatile strain-engineering approach with potential for spectral matching across solid-state, atomic, and hybrid quantum photonic networks, and provide new insights into phonon-QD interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this model, the cosmological constant arises from the ensemble average of time-reparametrization modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5e0c\u6c0f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5176\u7efc\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u6765\u6e90\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u4e4b\u8c1c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5176\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u5bf9\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5e0c\u6c0f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5176\u7efc\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u5bf9\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u4e0e\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Current QEC controllers execute all scheduled syndrome (parity-bit) measurement rounds before decoding, even when early syndrome data indicates that the run will result in an error. The resulting excess measurements increase the decoder's workload and system latency. To address this, we introduce an adaptive abort module that simultaneously reduces decoder overhead and suppresses logical error rates in surface codes and color codes under an existing QEC controller. The key idea is that initial syndrome information allows the controller to terminate risky shots early before additional resources are spent. An effective scheme balances the cost of further measurement against the restart cost and thus increases decoder efficiency.\n  Adaptive abort schemes dynamically adjust the number of syndrome measurement rounds per shot using real-time syndrome information. We consider three schemes: fixed-depth (FD) decoding (the standard non-adaptive approach used in current state-of-the-art QEC controllers), and two adaptive schemes, AdAbort and One-Step Lookahead (OSLA) decoding. For surface and color codes under a realistic circuit-level depolarizing noise model, AdAbort substantially outperforms both OSLA and FD, yielding higher decoder efficiency across a broad range of code distances. Numerically, as the code distance increases from 5 to 15, AdAbort yields an improvement that increases from 5% to 35% for surface codes and from 7% to 60% for color codes.\n  To our knowledge, these are the first adaptive abort schemes considered for QEC. Our results highlight the potential importance of abort rules for increasing efficiency as we scale to large, resource-intensive quantum architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (\u03c1_c > 10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield \u0393> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs.

This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86Bell\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u8a00\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u786e\u7406\u89e3Bell\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5047\u8bf4\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c", "method": "\u4eceReichenbach\u7684\u5171\u56e0\u539f\u5219\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdBell\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "Bell\u7684\u4e0d\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5f02\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30Bell\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I.

The game structures corresponding to generic experiments such as fixed-causal-order process matrices or causal contextuality scenarios, together with a deterministic non-Nashian resolution algorithm that abandons unilateral deviation assumptions (free choice) and assumes Perfect Prediction instead, were described in previous work.\n  In this new research, we learn the reward functions of the game, which contain a hidden variable, using neural networks. The cost function is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the frequency histograms obtained through many deterministic runs of the game and the predictions of the extended Born rule.\n  Using our framework on the specific case of the EPR 2-2-2 experiment acts as a proof-of-concept and a toy local-realist hidden-variable model that non-Nashian quantum theory is a promising avenue towards a local hidden-variable theory.

These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system.

However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems.

In this work, we address the practical applicability of the KST, unveiling that the Krylov bounds of low orders already enable efficient and accurate estimation of the QFI. We show that the Krylov bounds converge to the QFI exponentially fast with increasing order and can surpass the state-of-the-art polynomial lower bounds known to date. Moreover, we show that certain low-order Krylov bound can already match the QFI exactly for low-rank states prevalent in practical settings. Such exact match is beyond the reach of polynomial lower bounds proposed previously.

In our experiment, the prepared quantum states are high-dimensional orbital angular momentum states of single photons, and both the preparation fidelity and the measurement fidelity are about 99.0$\\%$ for the six-dimensional quantum states.

In the asymptotic i.i.d. setting of standard information decoupling via partial trace, we show that this bound is ensemble-tight in quantum relative entropy distance and thereby yields a characterization of the associated decoupling error exponent in the low-cost-rate regime.\n  Leveraging this framework, we derive several operational applications formulated in terms of purified distance: (i) a single-letter expression for the exact error exponent of quantum state merging in terms of Petz-R\u00e9nyi conditional entropies, and (ii) regularized expressions for the achievable error exponent of entanglement distillation and quantum channel coding in terms of Petz-R\u00e9nyi coherent informations.

We employ two methods to construct the Hilbert space: Method A, based on the standard second-quantization formalism, and Method B, based on a non-standard approach. By eliminating redundant quantum states, we obtain a reduced Hilbert space with significantly lower dimensionality, thereby improving the efficiency of numerical simulations. In a closed system, the two methods are equivalent, and their unitary evolution results are identical. The probability distribution diffuses outward from the center and exhibits a significant rebound after reaching the boundary. In an open system, Method B, by incorporating more dissipation channels, provides a more accurate description of the photon escape process at the boundary. The probability curves obtained from the two methods completely overlap before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, a slight difference appears, but this difference does not amplify with evolution and tends to converge in the later stage. Method B yields a slightly higher dissipative-state probability, indicating that the photon escapes faster. Visualization of the two-dimensional probability distribution shows that the three scenarios (closed system, open system with Method A, and open system with Method B) exhibit identical probability distributions before reaching the boundary.

Although not a genuine entanglement measure, both TE and OE are connected to the efficiency of matrix product state simulations and thus of fundamental interest. As in many quantum algorithms, at the end of the Grover circuit entanglement decreases as the system converges towards the target product state.

We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector. This thus not quite so simple harmonic oscillator provides an explicit realization of our general contention that antilinearity is more basic to quantum theory than Hermiticity.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the properties of a harmonic oscillator and its exceptional points when the Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian.

Our scheme requires only two-mode squeezing, passive optics, and static homodyne measurements, and enables post-hoc classical estimation of many properties from the same experimental dataset. We prove that our protocol enables a quantum speedup for common classical sensing tasks, including measuring electromagnetic correlations, real-time feedback control of interferometric cavities, and Fourier-domain matched filtering. To establish these separations, we introduce an optimal-transport conditioning method, and show both worst-case exponential separations from all entanglement-free strategies and practical speedups over homodyne and heterodyne baselines.

We introduce the Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver (SEGQE) as a greedy, shadow-assisted framework for measurement-efficient ground-state preparation. SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates.

This is the case for a canonical problem: estimating the amplitude and frequency of an AC magnetic field, where the generators are parallel to each other. Here, we introduce a quantum control protocol that resolves this singularity. Our control protocol strategically engineers the sensor's time evolution so the generators for the two parameters become orthogonal.
