We provide a complete derivation of the most general inertial frame transformation, which is indeed nonlinear; along the way, we shall find that the conditions of preserving the Law of Inertia take the form of Schwarzian differential equations, providing perhaps the simplest possible physics setting in which the Schwarzian derivative appears. We then demonstrate that the most general such inertial transformation which further preserves the speed of light in all directions is, however, still affine linear. Physically, this paper may be viewed as a reduction of the number of postulates needed to uniquely specify special relativity by one, as well as a proof that inertial transformations automatically imbue spacetime with a vector space structure, albeit in one higher dimension than might be expected. Mathematically, this paper may be viewed as a derivation of the higher-dimensional analog of the Schwarzian differential equation and its most general solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u60ef\u6027\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u5149\u901f\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u4eff\u5c04\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u90a3\u4e2a\u9644\u52a0\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5149\u901f\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e0b\u81ea\u52a8\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u5e76\u6c42\u89e3\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u4e00\u822c\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u4fdd\u6301\u5149\u901f\u4e0d\u53d8\u65f6\uff0c\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u6362\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4eff\u5c04\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u591a\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u60ef\u6027\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u5149\u901f\u4e0d\u53d8\u8db3\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5b83\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08\u5982\u60ef\u6027\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u5149\u901f\u4e0d\u53d8\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6216\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u3002"}}

We leverage the computational efficiency of periodic DLPNO-MP2 to perform simulations beyond a single unit cell.

In the dilute regime, we show that adsorption energies obtained from periodic DLPNO-MP2 agree with existing benchmarks. We then obtain adsorption energies at increasing densities approaching full monolayer coverage.

Although analogous YSR bound states were predicted within quantum condensates of excitons several decades ago, their existence has been elusive. Here, we directly visualize in-gap electronic states bound to impurities inside an exciton condensate phase of a van der Waals crystal Ta2Pd3Te5, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find that the energies of in-gap states are strongly correlated with the excitonic band gap, which is systematically tuned by local strain and carrier injection. Our theoretical analyses reveal that these in-gap states are induced by charge dipoles associated with Ta vacancies through a charge-exciton version of the YSR mechanism. Our findings establish both the YSR physics in exciton condensates and a novel microscopic tool to probe and control quantum properties in exciton condensates persisting up to room temperature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5728van der Waals\u6676\u4f53Ta2Pd3Te5\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u51ddensate\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u96a7\u9053\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u5185\u95f4\u9699\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u4e0e\u6742\u8d28\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3aYSR\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u5927\u5c0f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u95f4\u9699\u5927\u5c0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5e94\u53d8\u548c\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6001\u662f\u7531\u6676\u683c\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u5982\u949b\u7a7a\u4f4d\uff09\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8377-\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7248\u672c\u7684YSR\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u51ddensate\u4e2d\u7684YSR\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684 microscopic\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u51ddensate\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u662f\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684YSR\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c5e\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb8\u591abody\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u3001\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u7814\u7a76YSR\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u96a7\u9053\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u5728van der Waals\u6676\u4f53Ta2Pd3Te5\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u51ddensate\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u95f4\u9699\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u4e0e\u6742\u8d28\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6001\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f83\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5185\u95f4\u9699\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0e\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5e94\u53d8\u548c\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5730\u8c03\u63a7\u4e86\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u5185\u95f4\u9699\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f62\u53d8\u8c03\u63a7\u6750\u6599\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u4e2d\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u548c\u5185\u95f4\u9699\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728van der Waals\u6676\u4f53Ta2Pd3Te5\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u51ddensate\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728YSR\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5f62\u53d8\u548c\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u8c03\u63a7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5fae\u6270\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7269\u8d28\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u65e0\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u6b64\u524d\u4ece\u672a\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6b21\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While the study addresses interesting phenomenological questions, we identify several inconsistencies that compromise the validity of the reported results. Specifically, we note mutually contradictory values for the extremal charge separating the black hole and horizonless regimes, an inaccurate characterization of the Schwarzschild limit as an extremal configuration, a vacuum weak-deflection expansion that fails to recover the standard second-order Schwarzschild coefficient, and a sign error in the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected tunneling probability. We also highlight terminology regarding the nature of the horizonless solution and the physical interpretation of plasma parameters that requires correction.

Talman"], "title": "The sun as colliding beam, betatron cosmic ray factory", "comment": null, "summary": "A theory of cosmic ray production within the solar system (not extra-galactic) is presented. The sun's time variable magnetic flux linkage makes the sun (as well, perhaps, as Jupiter) a natural, all-purpose, betatron storage ring, with semi-infinite acceptance aperture, capable of storing and accelerating counter-circulating, opposite-sign, colliding beams.\n  The puzzle of how positrons and anti-protons can be well represented at all energies, is explained, initially, by the low energy capture of particles of either sign by the sun's magnetic dipole field. Later, as the magnetic field bending has become negligible compared to the gravitational bending, both positive and negative beams will have survived the gradual transition from predominantly magnetic to predominantly gravitational bending. Later, anti-particles produced in QED beam-beam collisions of sufficiently high energy, are also accelerated.\n  The high quality of cosmic ray data collected over recent decades, at steadily increasing energies, especially by the International Space Station (ISS), make the study of cosmic ray production mechanisms both timely and essential.\n  The paper describes how longitudinal electric fields, explained by the Parker solar wind theory can enable the sun to serve as a ``booster'' accelerator of cosmic rays, increasing the maximum cosmic ray energies enough to produce the observed 13 orders of magnitude maximum particle energy and the energy flux needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray atmosphere equilibrium within the solar system.\n  A steady state mechanism is described, based on semi-quantitative discussion of a relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, according to which the highest energy cosmic rays observed can have been produced by the Parker longitudinal electric field component, during fractionally brief, but periodic, circular or semi-circular turns centered on the sun.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u5728\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5185\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u592a\u9633\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u592a\u9633\u7b49\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u4e86 Parker \u5f15\u529b\u98ce\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f-\u96c5\u5404\u6bd4\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fd\u9645\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u901a\u8fc7 Parker \u957f\u5ea6\u7535\u573a\uff0c\u592a\u9633\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901f\u8c03\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u592a\u9633\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6728\u661f\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u56de\u65cb\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u53cd\u7c92\u5b50\u50a8\u5b58\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a \"Geometric $k$-Comb.\" We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($\u03bc$) and Tjurina ($\u03c4$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Interaction Metrology provides a topological standard for measuring coupling strengths, leveraging quantum singularities to achieve robust, deterministic quantization for force sensing and quantum logic gates.", "motivation": "Precision metrology seeks fundamental standards, moving beyond timekeeping to generalize across physical quantities.

Experimentally, an isotope effect on $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is observed: the melting temperature of H$_2$O is approximately 4~K lower than that of D$_2$O. This difference can only be explained by nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), which can be accurately captured using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). Here we run PIMD simulations driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) based on SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0, and revPBE-D3 and a DP model trained on the MB-pol potential. We calculate the \\tm of ice, the density discontinuity at melting, and the temperature of density maximum ($T_{\\mathrm{dm}}$) of the liquid. We find that the model based on MB-pol agrees well with experiment. The models based on DFT incorrectly predict that NQEs lower $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$. For the density discontinuity, SCAN and SCAN0 predict values close to the experimental result, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 significantly underestimate it. Additionally, the models based on SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the $T_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ is higher than $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, while those based on revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite.

Oscillatons share several properties with boson stars, including comparable compactness and mass ranges. However, their time-dependent nature can lead to potentially discriminating observable signatures. In this work, we explore the observational properties of oscillatons. We find that stable oscillatory circular orbits exist, extending down to the center of the configuration, supporting the possibility of accretion disk structures within the star. We compute the deflection of light rays and verify that it is largely insensitive to the time dependence of the metric. Despite this, the oscillatory behavior of the redshift factor has a strong effect on the observed intensity profiles from accretion disks, producing a breathing-like image whose frequency depends on the mass of the scalar field. In fact, their oscillation period may lie within the observational windows of the Event Horizon Telescope for Sgr A$^{*}$ and M87$^{*}$, suggesting the possibility that this ``twinkling\" behavior could be tested via near-horizon imaging of these objects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior.

We find that for small angular deviation of the polarization direction, actuated for instance by modifying an external magnetic field, the superfluid state undergoes an undamped scissors mode oscillation, a characteristic signature of superfluidity. In contrast, both the droplet and supersolid states exhibit a scissors-mode oscillation, which is effectively damped due to multiple closely spaced frequency components. Notably, we find that this damping rate provides a direct quantitative measure for the rigidity of different phases of a dipolar BEC. Furthermore, there exists a maximum angular deviation of the polarization direction, beyond which the droplet and the supersolid states undergo a permanent deformation i.e., we find an analog of the usual elastic to plastic phase transition of solids. We characterize this transition numerically using the fidelity of the condensate wavefunction with the ground state as well as the droplet width and periodicity of the supersolid density of the condensate which are experimentally accessible.

However, existing THz system suffers from bulkiness, narrow spectral response and limited flexibility constrained by their dependence on external antennas, complex coupling architectures and rigid components. Here, we present a 2D THz smart wristband based on a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) array, which integrates sensing and communication within a monolithic microdetector. Operating without any external antenna, the compact and flexible device enables self-powered, polarization-sensitive and frequency-selective THz detection across a broad response spectrum from 0.25 to 4.24 THz, with a responsivity of 6 V/W, a response time of 62 ms, and mechanical robustness maintained over 2000 bending cycles. Notably, we further exploit its multi-parameter THz responses for dual-purpose ISAC functionality.

In such molecules, each CH_2 group must have a distinct chemical shift and be magnetically inequivalent via out-of-pair couplings. Under these conditions, singlet state populations of geminal protons propagate along (CH_2)_n segments forming magnetically silent spin waves.

While most plants rely on external vectors, some have evolved mechanisms that employ the buildup of liquid pressure in a closed compartment and its explosive release to disperse their seeds. This form of energy storage, reinvented by humans for engineering applications, is termed a hydraulic accumulator. Here we investigated the fluid mechanics involved in dispersal in the squirting cucumber, Ecballium elaterium integrating high-speed videography (up to 10 000 fps), microtomography, and internal pressure sensors. We recorded long-term pressure time series showing that E. elaterium exhibits circadian (24 hour) and ultradian (short-period) rhythms. Remarkably, the measurements revealed a lack of correlation between fruit and stem turgor; while the stem showed strong circadian cycles, the fruit often did not, suggesting isolated physiological processes in different tissues. The fruit's spongy wall tissue stores elastic potential energy as turgor pressure builds to nearly one atmosphere (92-99 kPa). Upon detachment, this energy is rapidly released to expel a turbulent, particle-laden liquid jet. Microtomography revealed that the seeds are packed around a central funiculus, a configuration that optimizes their exit through the basal orifice at velocities of up to 30 m/s. Seeds eventually move faster than the liquid droplets during the later stages of ejection as they shed their liquid coating. This sophisticated mechanism ensures a broad dispersal cone, effectively spreading offspring across space and environmental conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the dispersal mechanism of squirting cucumbers and highlights the hydraulic accumulator mechanism used in seed ejection.", "motivation": "The paper's motivation lies in understanding the dispersal strategies of plants to facilitate seed distribution in new environments.", "method": "The study employed high-speed videography, microtomography, and internal pressure sensors to investigate the fluid mechanics of seed dispersal in Ecballium elaterium.", "result": "The findings revealed that squirting cucumbers store elastic potential energy in their spongy tissue, which is released as a powerful liquid jet, and the seeds are ejected at velocities up to 30 m/s, optimizing their dispersal across various habitats.", "conclusion": "This hydraulic accumulator system effectively allows squirting cucumber seeds to travel long distances and colonize diverse environments."}}

We further propose a practical scheme to realize these phases in multilayer structures of 2-dimensional Rashba metal with engineered $d$-wave altermagnetic order. Our results deepen the theoretical understanding of mass terms in Dirac systems and provide concrete guidelines for the experimental detection and realization of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, in this study, it is shown that observable correlations are governed by the intrinsic spatiotemporal covariance of a global spin-fluctuation field, such that spatial separation specifies only overlapping statistical projections rather than independent physical components. A unified field-theoretic description is established in which sub-ensembles are defined as measurement-induced statistical projections of a single stochastic field. Within this formulation, sub-ensemble correlations are determined by the covariance operator, inducing a natural geometry in which statistical independence corresponds to orthogonality of the measurement functionals. For collective spin fluctuations described by a diffusion-relaxation Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic field, the covariance spectrum admits only a finite set of fluctuation modes in a bounded domain, imposing an intrinsic, field-level limit on the number of statistically distinguishable sub-ensembles. The loss of sub-ensemble independence is formalized through the notion of spatial sampling overlap, which quantifies the unavoidable statistical coupling arising from shared access to common low-order fluctuation modes. While multi-channel atomic magnetometry provides a concrete physical setting in which these constraints become explicit, the framework applies generically to diffusion-coupled stochastic fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206resolved\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5c40\u90e8\u54cd\u5e94\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7531\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u65cb\u6da8\u843d\u573a\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u4ec5\u51b3\u5b9a\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u800c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u7269\u7406\u6210\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206resolved\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e9a\u7fa4\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u5e26\u6765\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5bfc\u51fa\u81ea\u7136\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u5bf9\u5e94\u6d4b\u91cf\u6cdb\u51fd\u6b63\u4ea4\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7531\u6269\u6563\u653e\u677eOrnstein-Uhlenbeck\u573a\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u81ea\u65cb\u6da8\u843d\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u754c\u57df\u5185\u53ea\u6709\u6709\u9650\u7684\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u53e0\u52a0\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5c40\u90e8\u54cd\u5e94\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7531\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u65cb\u6da8\u843d\u573a\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u53d8\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u53e0\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\u3002"}}

Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities.

More specifically, we take generalized free fields in five dimensions, where the extra dimension is compactified to a circle. Due to the usual Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the resulting excitations carry properties of both particles and unparticles, so we dub this scenario ``gapped unparticles\". We derive a two-point function of the gapped unparticles by performing dimensional reduction. We then compute, in the collapsed limit, the four-point correlation function of conformally coupled scalars exchanging a gapped unparticle, which are used as seed functions to obtain the correlation function of primordial density perturbations. The phenomenology of the resulting correlators presents some novel features, such as oscillations with an envelope controlled by the anomalous dimension, rather than the usual value of 3/2. Depending on the value of the five-dimensional scaling dimension and effective mass of the gapped unparticles, we find a clear strategy to distinguish gapped unparticles from heavy massive scalars. If we assume the interactions are localized on a brane, gapped unparticles with different effective masses will share a universal coupling, and their exchanges produce an interesting interference pattern.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u5149\u6807\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728\u81a8\u80c0\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u516d\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u573a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e86 Kaluza-Klein \u7ea7\u6570\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u201c\u6709\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u5149\u6807\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u201d\u7684\u4e24\u70b9\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6536\u7f29\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u56db\u70b9\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u539f\u59cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u5149\u6807\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5149\u6807\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86 Kaluza-Klein \u7ea7\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u56db\u70b9\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u539f\u59cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5149\u6807\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7684\u56db\u70b9\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u503c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u632f\u8361\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5305\u7edc\u7ebf\u7531\u5f02\u5e38\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u95f4\u9694\u5149\u6807\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7b56\u7565\u4e5f\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u6e05\u695a\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5bf9\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

The nanoscale photocarrier transport, trapping, and recombination mechanisms are usually inferred from ensemble-averaged measurements and remain elusive. Because an individual high-performing nanoparticle photocatalyst may outperform the ensemble average, design rules that would otherwise enhance catalytic efficiency remain unclear. Here, we introduce photomodulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an optically coupled scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map photocarrier localization. Using rhodium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Rh) solar water-splitting nanoparticles, we directly image the carrier densities concentrated at oxygen-vacancy surface trap states. This is achieved by separating photothermal heating from photocarrier populations through experimental and computational analyses of low-loss spectra. Photomodulated STEM-EELS enables angstrom-scale imaging of defect-induced photocarrier traps and their impact on photocatalytic efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The altermagnetic order opens a gap at the topological edge states and drives a topological phase transition from a first-order to a second-order topological phase. When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order. Consequently, both edge and corner modes become directionally controllable. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for realizing and tuning skin-topological phenomena in non-Hermitian higher-order topological systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u8fd1\u90bb\u78c1\u5316\u4f53\u8fd1\u90bb\u4e8e\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4ee5\u5de5\u7a0b\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u90bb\u8fd1\u4ea4\u8054\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f15\u8d77\u62d3\u6251\u6001\u76f8\u4f4d\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4e92\u60e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ae\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u89d2\u4f4d\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4fa7\u9762\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u8fd1\u90bb\u78c1\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u76ae\u80a4\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u5173\u6ce8\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u89d2\u4f4d\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u90bb\u78c1\u6027\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u8fb9\u6001\u548c\u89d2\u4f4d\u79fb\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u90bb\u8fd1\u4ea4\u8054\u548c\u975e\u4e92\u60e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u89d2\u4f4d\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4f4d\u8f6c\u53d8\u6765\u8c03\u63a7 skin\u548c\u89d2\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u90bb\u8fd1\u78c1\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u548c\u76ae\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u89d2\u4f4d\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u90bb\u78c1\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u8f6c\u53d8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fb9\u548c\u89d2\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u975e\u90bb\u8fd1\u78c1\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u548c\u76ae\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Our results successfully reproduce the prominent localized 5f peak observed in ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy around -2.8 eV below the Fermi level in the Am-I phase. While 5f electrons in Am-I and Am-II remain strongly localized, those in Am-III and Am-IV manifest discernible signatures of increased hybridization: a noticeable shift of spectral weight toward the Fermi level, enhanced hybridization strength, and the emergence of distinct multi-peak structures. These changes indicate that 5f electrons begin to participate in bonding and undergo partial delocalization under pressure. Nevertheless, the spectral weight of 5f electrons near the Fermi level in Am-IV remains relatively low, indicating that, compared to U and Pu, Am retains stronger localized 5f electrons even under high pressure. Analysis of the electronic configurations reveals pressure-enhanced valence state fluctuation, characterized by the mixing of 5f5, 5f6, and 5f7 electronic configurations. The X-ray absorption branching ratio further shows that the angular-momentum coupling scheme approaches the jj limit. Additionally, we demonstrate that the stability of the low-symmetry high-pressure phases (Am-III and Am-IV) is governed by a Peierls-like distortion mechanism, which reduces the total energy through symmetry-lowering lattice distortions accompanied by electronic reconstruction.

A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU.

Unlike shear deformations applied at the macro-tissue scale or the micro-cell scale, the effects of such perturbations at the meso-scale remain largely unexplored. To address this, we developed a mesoscopic probe that adheres to the apical surface of an epithelial monolayer and applies magnetically derived local shear. We find that localized shear propagated way beyond immediate neighbors and suppressed cellular migratory dynamics in stiffer layers, yet dissipated locally and left dynamics unchanged in softer layers. This mechano-transductive view is reinforced by the observation that stiffening of a soft layer promotes responsiveness to shear. Interpreted within the epithelial jamming framework, shear-induced migratory suppression in stiff layers was accompanied by reduced MSD scaling exponents and changes in cell shape. These changes suggested a localized shift of the tissue toward a lower-energetic state.

Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes.

Ultimately, the molecular design of panchromatic photovoltaic materials should move beyond molecular-level optimization toward synergistic tuning among molecules, semiconductors, and electrolytes or active-layer materials, thereby providing concrete conceptual guidance for achieving efficiency optimization rather than simple spectral maximization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5143\u8272\u6750\u6599\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u4ee5 broaden absorption \u63d0\u9ad8\u5149\u4f0f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u91cf\u5176\u4ed6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u7ae0\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5143\u8272\u6750\u6599\u5728\u5149\u4f0f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u5b50\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5668\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7535\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5143\u8272\u6750\u6599\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5206\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u5e94\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6210\u5206\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u7efc\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u5206\u5b50-\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53-\u7535\u89e3\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In contrast, topological superconductors with their inherent particle-hole symmetry can host a thermal metallic phase, which is non-universal and depends on the nature of microscopic disorder. In this work, we demonstrate that in the presence of geometric disorders, such as random bond dilution, a robust metal can emerge in a Chern insulator with particle-hole symmetry. The metallic phase is realized when the broken links are weakly stitched via concomitant insertion of $\u03c0$ fluxes in the plaquettes. These nucleate low-energy manifolds, which can provide percolating conduction pathways for fermions to elude localization. This diffusive metal, unlike those in superconductors, can carry charge current and even anomalous Hall current. We investigate the transport properties and show that while the topological insulator to Anderson insulator transition exhibits the expected Dirac universality, the metal insulator transition displays a different critical exponent $\u03bd\\approx 2$ compared to a disordered topological superconductor, where $\u03bd\\approx 1.4$.

Building on this idea, we develop a theoretical framework describing a non-inertial observer equipped with a detector undergoing non-uniform, time-dependent acceleration.

We review the three qubit GHZ Mermin device, make its generalization to four qubits, and then construct analogous Mermin devices for the generalized Dicke states of three and four qubits. As a result of studying if their operations can be fully explained by Mermin's instructional sets, we show that the GHZ and Dicke states of three qubits and the GHZ state of four qubits do not allow such a description.

You move by making a step of a certain length per time interval in a chosen direction. Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u968f\u52a8\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u7269\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5230\u968f\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u5e7f\u76f8\u5173\u968f\u673a\u884c\u8d70\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u679c\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06ornstein-uhlenbeck\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ece\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u8f6c\u6362\u5230\u968f\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

These correlations might explain the observation of an anomalous Stark effect (Pockels effect) reported a few years ago in Langmuir, vol. 37, 5193-5201, (2021), and provides useful insight for the multitude of electro-chemical applications that involve electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86[bmim][NTf2] \u65e0\u6781\u6eb6\u80f6\u5939\u5c42\u7535\u5bb9\u5668\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u7535\u6781\u95f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u5bb9\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u548c\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u53d6\u5411\u3001\u7535\u52bf\u53cc\u5c42\u3001\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u5782\u76f4\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u4e8e\u77f3\u58a8\u677f\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\uff0c\u968f\u7535\u5bb9\u5668\u9759\u7535\u7535\u8377\u3001\u6c34\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u538b\u529b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u6709\u65e0\u6781\u6027\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u4e0e\u5176\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u65af\u5854\u514b\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u6cca\u514b\u5c14\u65af\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u76f8\u543b\u5408\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6781/\u65e0\u6781\u6eb6\u80f6\u754c\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86[bmim][NTf2]\u65e0\u6781\u6eb6\u80f6\u5939\u5c42\u7535\u5bb9\u5668\u5728\u7535\u6781/\u6eb6\u80f6\u754c\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u548c\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u548c\u7535\u52bf\u53cc\u5c42\u7b49\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u4e0e\u5176\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u65af\u5854\u514b\u6548\u5e94\u76f8\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65e0\u6781\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528all-atom\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6781\u5316\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u573a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76[bmim][NTf2]\u65e0\u6781\u6eb6\u80f6\u5939\u5c42\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u7535\u6781\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9759\u7535\u7535\u8377\u3001\u6c34\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u548c\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u53d6\u5411\u3001\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u7535\u52bf\u53cc\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(\u2170) \u9633\u79bb\u5b50\u548c\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u53d6\u5411\u968f\u9759\u7535\u7535\u8377\u3001\u6c34\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u538b\u529b\u53d8\u5316\uff1b(\u2171) \u7535\u52bf\u53cc\u5c42\u968f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff1b(\u2172) \u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u4e0e\u6709\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u65af\u5854\u514b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86[bmim][NTf2]\u65e0\u6781\u6eb6\u80f6\u5939\u5c42\u7535\u5bb9\u5668\u5728\u7535\u6781/\u6eb6\u80f6\u754c\u9762\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9759\u7535\u7535\u8377\u3001\u6c34\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u4e0e\u5176\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u65af\u5854\u514b\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In contrast, for spatially separated dual spin currents, the time-reversal-invariant vector chirality emerges as a critical factor governing magnetization dynamics. Here, we investigate field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in an altermagnet RuO2/ferromagnet/heavy metal Pt trilayer, driven by chiral dual spin currents (CDSC). We demonstrate that the chirality of these dual spin currents acts as the deterministic role in breaking out-of-plane symmetry. Leveraging the intrinsic spin-splitting effect of the d-wave altermagnet to generate an x-polarized spin component, the interplay of non-collinear spin currents from two adjacent layers induces a helical magnetic texture within the intermediate layer. The resulting intralayer exchange coupling manifests as an effective in-plane magnetic field, facilitating deterministic switching. This distinct physical picture, validated by switching measurements and micromagnetic simulations, reveals that the switching polarity is dictated by chirality rather than charge current polarity. Characterized by the novel symmetry and low power consumption, CDSC offers a promising paradigm for next-generation high-performance spintronic architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u4f53RuO2/\u94c1/\u91cd\u91d1\u5c5ePt\u4e09\u5143\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7834\u574f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5782\u76f4\u78c1\u5316\u5207\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u78c1\u5316\u8c03\u63a7\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5730\u4f4d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u53cc\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e micromagnetic \u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u88c2\u6548\u5e94\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u90bb\u4e24\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u5171\u7ebf\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u73af\u6d41\u78c1\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u53cc\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u73af\u6d41\u78c1\u6027\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u78c1\u5316\u5207\u6362\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u5c55\u73b0\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u73af\u6d41\u5206\u7acb\u6027\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a next-gen \u8f6c\u6362\u6562\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

Yet, conventional treatments based on asymptotic expansions suffer from divergences and become unreliable near the optical axis. In this work, we present a rigorous calculation of GW scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within the BH perturbation theory. By placing the observer at a finite distance and abandoning the asymptotic expansion of radial wave functions, we obtain a well-convergent partial-wave description without invoking any regularization scheme, thereby naturally resolving the divergences of the partial-wave series and the Poisson spot. We numerically computed the scattered GW waveforms by reconstructing the physical $+$ and $\\times$ polarizations from the master variables, revealing the formation of the Poisson spot and pronounced wavefront distortions. A systematic comparison with conventional asymptotic approaches shows that they reproduce only qualitative features at large scattering angles and fail in the forward-scattering region. We further compare the frequency-domain transmission factors derived from the scattering formalism with those obtained from the Kirchhoff diffraction integral, finding significant discrepancies at high frequencies due to the latter's neglect of long-range gravitational effects and polarization evolution. Our results establish a stable and physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong-field regimes and provide a solid foundation for accurate modeling of GW lensing beyond standard approximations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gravitational-wave (GW) scattering near a black hole is difficult due to strong gravity effects causing divergences in conventional treatments.

However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute.\n  We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold.

By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material.

The second R\u00e9nyi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. However, Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and second R\u00e9nyi entropies varies from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the R\u00e9nyi index. By constructing a number-conserving many-body state with only two local degrees of freedom, we obtain a R\u00e9nyi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling: the second R\u00e9nyi entropy remains logarithmic while the von Neumann entropy is parametrically larger. We then introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved second R\u00e9nyi entropies and the subsystem charge distribution.

Using a waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer internally loaded with two sets of non-concentric dual ring resonators, we demonstrate the generation of unclonable keys for one-time pad encryption which can be reconfigured on the fly by applying small voltages to on-chip thermo-optic elements. With this method, we access a keyspace larger than 12 Tb for a single device with simple, single-mode waveguide input and output coupling. Using two devices at either end of a communication channel, we show that an eavesdropper tapping the channel fibre link would be unable to recover the same spectrum measured at either end of the link, providing physical encryption for key distribution. Furthermore, being purely classical, this form of secure communications does not require quantum photonic sources or detectors, and can therefore be easily integrated into pre-existing telecommunication architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u5757\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u8c31\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u727a\u7272\u4f20\u64ad\u635f\u8017\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6ce2\u5bfc\u578b\u9a6c\u8d6b-\u6cfd\u5fb7\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5185\u90e8\u52a0\u8f7d\u4e24\u4e2a\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u73af\u5f62\u8c10\u632f\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5bc6\u7801\u52a0\u5bc6\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e00\u7aef\u53e3\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7535\u5149\u5143\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u94a5\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d85\u8fc712 terabits\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u901a\u9053\u4e24\u7aef\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u4ece\u5149\u7ea4\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u7aef\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u901a\u8baf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u6e90\u6216\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u4fe1\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8bbe\u5907\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u65e0\u5e8f\u589e\u5f3a\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u6743\u8861\u4f20\u64ad\u635f\u8017\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6ce2\u5bfc\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u73af\u5f62\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5149\u8c31\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u8baf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce2\u5bfc\u578b\u7684\u9a6c\u8d6b-\u6cfd\u5fb7\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5185\u90e8\u52a0\u8f7d\u4e24\u4e2a\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u73af\u5f62\u8c10\u632f\u5668\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u591a\u6a21\u6ce2\u5bfc\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u78c1\u7535\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u4e24\u7aef\u5404\u5e03\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u94a5\u5728\u4e24\u7aef\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u83b7\u53d6\u76f8\u540c\u5bc6\u94a5\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u8baf\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": ".\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bc6\u94a5\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d85\u8fc712 terabits\u7684\u5355\u8bbe\u5907\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u53e3\u7684\u5165\u5c04\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e24\u7aef\u5e03\u8bbe\u4e24\u53f0\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u540c\u8c31\u7a83\u53d6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u7ecf\u5178\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7279\u5b9a\u8c31\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u6e90\u6216\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u52a0\u5bc6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4fdd\u62a4\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone.

Broken symmetries in such a system can lead to inequivalent lattice sites, and magnetic impurities may interact selectively with particular orbitals or sublattices.

Here, we explore the behavior of individual Fe adatoms on a cluster-Mott charge-density-wave (CDW) system of 1T-TaS2 utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states. DFT calculations identify three distinct types of interactions; hybridization with localized correlated electrons, distorting the CDW cluster, and charge transfer. In particular, the hybridization of Fe 3d and half-filled Ta 5dz2 orbitals suppresses the Mott insulating state for an adatom at the center of a CDW cluster.

The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability.

Here we demonstrate device-relevant ultrabroadband near-infrared (NIR) photonics by integrating element-specific roles within an entropy-stabilized lattice. We establish high-entropy rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb,Re)Cl6 (Re3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), where near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase cubic solid solution (S_config about 1.6R) with homogeneous multication incorporation. Sb3+ acts as a broadband sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide emitters, transforming single-mode emission into wide-coverage NIR output (850-1600 nm) with three fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced signature enables redundancy-based ratiometric readout with reduced sensitivity to intensity drift, supporting reliable solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing. Beyond functional expansion, accelerated aging tests show markedly improved tolerance to humidity and oxygen versus single-component analogues. The robustness is experimentally attributed to octahedral contraction-strengthened metal-halide bonding that increases the kinetic barrier for moisture-triggered bond cleavage, together with entropy-induced lattice distortion that impedes long-range halide migration and suppresses defect/impurity-phase formation. Finally, a UV-pumped phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, wide-coverage NIR illumination, highlighting configurational-entropy engineering as a practical strategy to couple ultrabroadband photonic function with environmental stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The well-known PXP model, a U$(1)$ LGT with a two-level electric field in one spatial dimension, has become a paradigm of exotic physics in and out of equilibrium. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian version in which the spin-flip rate differs between the two spin directions. While the naive expectation is that non-Hermiticity might suppress coherent phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, we find that when the facilitating direction of the spin is disfavored, the oscillations are instead \\emph{enhanced}, decaying much slower than in the PXP limit. We demonstrate that this can be understood through a similarity transformation that maps our model to the standard PXP model, revealing that the oscillations are enhanced versions of the PXP scars.

In this work, we show that a finite rectangular altermagnetic sample can acquire a net spin polarization purely due to its geometry. This effect arises from the interplay between the anisotropic, spin-resolved Fermi contours of an altermagnet and the discrete sampling of momentum space imposed by unequal sample dimensions. By explicitly counting occupied states, we demonstrate that rectangular samples with $L_x \\neq L_y$ host a finite spin polarization, which vanishes in the symmetric limit $L_x=L_y$ and in the thermodynamic limit. We further show that this geometry-induced spin polarization can be directly probed in transport measurements. In the tunneling regime, the ratio of spin to charge conductance exhibits characteristic square-like patterns as a function of sample dimensions, faithfully reflecting the underlying spin polarization. In addition, transport across ferromagnet--altermagnet--ferromagnet junctions reveals an asymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to reversal of the Zeeman field, providing an independent transport signature of the finite spin polarization.

The classical phase space M = T*Q is taken as the base of a trivial Hilbert bundle E ~ M x H, and the familiar position and momentum representations are realised as different global trivialisations of this bundle. The Fourier transform appears as a fibrewise unitary transition function, so that the standard position-momentum duality is made precise as a change of coordinates on a single geometric object. For the circle, we also discuss twisted boundary conditions and show how a twist parameter can be incorporated either as a fixed boundary condition or as a base coordinate, in which case it gives rise to a flat U(H)-connection with nontrivial holonomy.

However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\u03c0$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we present experimental evidence for a predicted, unique spin valley locked electronic state generated by Bi zigzag chains in the layered compound BaMnBi2. We observe remarkable quantum transport properties in this material, including a stacked quantum Hall effect (QHE) and a nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). From the analysis of the QHE, we identify a spin valley degeneracy of four, while the NLHE provides supporting evidence for the anticipated valley contrasted Berry curvature, a typical signature of a spin valley locked state. This spin valley locked state contrasts with that observed in the sister compound BaMnSb2, where the degeneracy is two.

Here, we investigate the magnetic ground state and quasiparticle excitations of the fascinating double perovskite system, Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$, through Time of flight (TOF) neutron diffraction (TOF), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and theoretical modelling. The compound Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$ is reported to exhibit a single magnetic transition, in sharp contrast to most of the other rare-earth (R) members in this family, A$_2$RRuO$_6$ (A = Ca/Sr/Ba), which typically show magnetic ordering of the Ru ions, followed by R-ion ordering. Our neutron diffraction results confirm that long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx 47$~K, primarily driven by 4d--4f Ru$^{5+}$--Dy$^{3+}$ exchange interactions, where both Dy and Ru moments start to order simultaneously. The ordered ground state is a collinear antiferromagnet with Ising character, carrying ordered moments of $\u03bc_{\\mathrm{Ru}} = 1.6(1)~\u03bc_\\mathrm{B}$ and $\u03bc_{\\mathrm{Dy}} = 5.1(1)~\u03bc_\\mathrm{B}$ at 1.5~K. Low-temperature INS reveals well-defined magnon excitations below 10~meV. SpinW modelling of the INS spectra evidences complex exchange interactions and the presence of magnetic anisotropy, which governs the Ising ground state and accounts for the observed magnon spectrum. Combined INS and Raman spectroscopy reveal crystal-electric-field (CEF) excitations of Dy$^{3+}$ at 46.5 and 71.8~meV in the paramagnetic region.

Tailored molecules on a Si(100) surface image the probe apex, and the usual challenge of understanding the probe structure is effectively solved. The molecules can also react with the probe, with the two sides of the tunnel junction acting as reagents positioned with sub-angstrom precision. This allows abstraction or donation of atoms from or to the probe apex. We demonstrate this by using a novel alkynyl-terminated molecule to reproducibly abstract hydrogen atoms from the probe.

We show that a minimal GUP deformation of the Fierz-Pauli (FP) action induces a higher-derivative kinetic operator equivalent, at quadratic order, to the spin-2 sector of Stelle's curvature-squared gravity. Via an auxiliary-field formulation, the GUP-generated higher derivative can be recast as a Lee-Wick (LW) partner of the spin-2.

The guided wave resembles the edge states in electronic systems: it is induced by the topological Hall effect, and the wave propagates along the interface but not in the bulk media. Starting from a symmetric honeycomb photonic crystal that attains Dirac points at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, $K$ and $K'$, we introduce two classes of perturbations for the periodic medium. The perturbations lift the Dirac degeneracy, forming a spectral band valley at the points $K$ and $K'$ with well-defined topological phase that depends on the sign of the perturbation parameters. By employing the layer potential techniques and spectral analysis, we investigate the existence of guided wave along an interface when two honeycomb photonic crystals are glued together.

Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.\n  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $\u03bb$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance.

Molecular dynamics (MD) naturally captures ballistic transport and phonon nonequilibrium, but has not been applied to hot-spot problems due to computational cost. Here, we perform the first MD simulations of hot-spot heat transfer across ballistic-diffusive regimes and benchmark them against FEM. We find that FEM using bulk thermal conductivity $\u03ba_0$ significantly underestimates hot-spot temperature, even when the channel thickness is ~10 times the phonon mean free path, indicating persistent non-Fourier effects. We introduce a size-dependent \"best\" conductivity, $\u03ba_{\\mathrm{best}}$, using which FEM can reproduce MD hot-spot temperatures with high fidelity. We further decompose the MD-extracted thermal resistance into: (i) diffusive spreading, (ii) cross-plane ballistic, (iii) heat-carrier selective heating, and (iv) residual 3D ballistic-spreading resistances, and quantify each contribution. The resulting framework offers a practical route to embed non-Fourier physics into FEM for hot-spot prediction, reliability assessment, and thermally aware design of next-generation transistors.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses efficient heat transfer analysis challenges in modern semiconductor devices, revealing that traditional finite-element methods underestimate temperature spikes in hotspots due to non-Fourier heat transfer effects, which can be accurately modeled using molecular dynamics simulations.", "motivation": "Understanding heat transfer in advanced semiconductor devices is crucial for optimizing their thermal management, especially when dealing with high electron densities and shrinking geometries.", "method": "The authors employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model heat transfer in hotspots of FinFET and HEMT devices, then compare the results with finite-element method (FEM) predictions using bulk thermal conductivity.", "result": "MD simulations show that FEM using bulk thermal conductivity underestimates hotspot temperatures.

Through analytic treatment and numerical verification, we demonstrate that these images encode not only phase transition information but also ensemble information, including additional temperature information in the isothermal ensemble. Phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which we prove occurs in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information originates from a fundamental difference between isobaric and isothermal evolution: image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius along isobars, whereas it exhibits nonmonotonic behavior along isotherms. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish isobaric from isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, the nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius whose relative ordering with the small- and large-black hole radii at the phase transition admits three logical possibilities. Our analysis reveals that only two of these possibilities are physically realized, separated by a critical reduced temperature. Furthermore, image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitatively differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information. These results not only enrich the set of observational avenues for probing black hole thermodynamic properties, but also introduce a new paradigm. This paradigm studies phase transitions in conjunction with nonmonotonic evolution, providing a useful framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ed1\u6d1e\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7efc\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u51ef\u52d2-\u8bfa\u65af\u7279\u6717\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u76f8\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd8\u7f16\u7801\u7cfb\u7efc\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b49\u6e29\u7cfb\u7efc\u4e2d\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6e29\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u76f8\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5927\u5c0f\u7a81\u7136\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u7b49\u538b\u548c\u7b49\u6e29\u7cfb\u7efc\u4e2d\u90fd\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u7cfb\u7efc\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u4e8e\u7b49\u538b\u548c\u7b49\u6e29\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u5927\u5c0f\u6cbf\u7b49\u538b\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u6cbf\u7b49\u6e29\u53d8\u5316\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u7b49\u538b\u548c\u7b49\u6e29\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5728\u7b49\u6e29\u7cfb\u7efc\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5165\u6781\u503c\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u8be5\u534a\u5f84\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76f8\u53d8\u5c0f\u3001\u5927\u9ed1\u4f53\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5217\u63a5\u53d7\u4e09\u79cd\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u9694\u70b9\u7531\u4e34\u754c\u964d\u6eab\u5ea6\u5206\u9694\u3002\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6eab\u5ea6\u533a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ed1\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u786e\u5b9e\u7f16\u7801\u6eab\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u9ed1\u4f53\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4ed6\u9ed1\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5370\u8bb0\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4ed6\u9ed1\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m-AdS\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9ed1\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u76f8\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u7cfb\u7efc\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6eab\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u56fe\u50cf\u5927\u5c0f\u6cbf\u7b49\u538b\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6cbf\u7b49\u6e29\u53d8\u5316\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u3002\u76f8\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u589e\u52a0\u53ef distinguishes \u7b49\u538b\u548c\u7b49\u6e29\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5728\u7b49\u6e29\u7cfb\u7efc\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5165\u6781\u503c\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5176\u6392\u5217\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u6eab\u5ea6\u533a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6f14\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ed1\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e86 valuable thermodynamic information\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4ed6\u9ed1\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level.

Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\\;M_\\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints.\n  To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\\mathcal{C}_{\\max}\\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $\u03bb_{\\rm BL}\\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism.

These geometric properties influence electronic transport and result in the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects, and are typically controlled using static electric fields or strain. However, the possibility of modulating quantum geometric quantities in real-time remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic modulation of Berry curvature and its moments, as well as the generation of a pseudo-electric field using time-dependent strain. By placing heterostructures on a membrane, we introduce oscillatory strain together with an in-plane AC electric field and measure Hall signals that are modulated at linear combinations of the frequencies of strain and electric field. Our measurements reveal modulation of Berry curvature and its first moment. Notably, we provide direct experimental evidence of pseudo-electric field that results in an unusual dynamic strain-induced Hall response.

We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, \u03bd_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\\times_{\u03c9_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, \u03bd_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation.

This approach yields transmittance oscillations with a period of ~20 fs, which corresponds to three optical cycles of the probe beam. To achieve a similar oscillatory modulation in the refractive index, we incorporate a TCO electron-acceptor layer on top of the inverse-designed cavity, enabling thermionic carrier injection at the TCO heterojunction. The resulting acceptor layer achieves a striking \u0394n response time as short as 9 fs, approaching a single optical cycle, and is further tunable to sub-cycle timescales. The findings not only clarify the elusive transient physics in TCOs but also demonstrate, for the first time, the critical role of electron temperatures in driving oscillatory dynamic responses.

In this work, we investigate how these features are modified by a TsT deformation of the background, which renders the Kalb Ramond field physical and radially dependent, thereby obscuring its interpretation as a constant magnetic field.\n  We show that chiral symmetry breaking persists in the deformed model. The meson spectrum, however, depends on the fluctuation sector. Fluctuations perpendicular to the magnetic field are sensitive to the deformation and, for generic values of the TsT parameter $\\mathrm{k}$, do not admit a consistent spectrum due to divergent behavior near the horizon, whereas fluctuations parallel to the magnetic field remain unaffected.\n  Remarkably, the combined effect of the magnetic field and the TsT deformation singles out the special value $\\mathrm{k} = -\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{H}}$. At this point, the perpendicular modes are restored. Moreover, the Kalb Ramond field becomes constant again, recovering its interpretation as a magnetic field. The resulting effects on the spectrum appear only at order $O(H^2)$, and therefore the Zeeman splitting, if present at all, is shifted to this higher order.\n  Furthermore, the resulting background with $\\mathrm{k} = - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{H}}$ is interesting in its own right, even without embedding any brane. The spacetime admits an interpretation in terms of D1 branes and exhibits a degenerate boundary geometry, asymptotically $\\mathrm{AdS}_3 \\times S^5$, with a degenerate horizon.

The device is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, whose complex eigenvalues encode the energy (real part) and the broadening (imaginary part) of the Andreev quasi-bound states. When extending the Andreev current formula to the non-Hermitian case, a novel contribution arises that is proportional to the phase derivative of the levels broadening. This term becomes particularly relevant in the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectrum, but its experimental detection is not straightforward. We identify optimal Andreev spectrum configurations where this novel current contribution can be clearly highlighted, and we outline an experimental protocol for its detection.

They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $\u03b1$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $\u03b1$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u03b1-Bi4I4 discovered 3D QSHI with topological edge states, robust against defects and stacking.", "motivation": "Exploring topological states in materials for quantum applications, especially 3D QSHI.", "method": "Density functional theory calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.", "result": "Observation of helical edge states in monolayer and bilayer \u03b1-Bi4I4 confirmed by STM.", "conclusion": "Deepest topological state, supports applications in spin Hall effect and quantum devices."}}

Working in the coincident gauge, we perform the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and classify QSN models into distinct cases according to the numbers of their primary constraints. For cases that are physically viable in the sense that both a consistent cosmological background and tensor gravitational waves exist, we count the number of degrees of freedom based on two approaches. First we investigate the linear cosmological perturbations around an FLRW background. Then we perform a Dirac-Bergmann Hamiltonian constraint analysis to count the number of DOFs at the nonperturbative level. We focus on three representative cases. In case II, both the perturbative and nonperturbative approaches yield the same result, which indicates that the theory propagates 10 degrees of freedom. In contrast, in cases V and VI, the Hamiltonian analysis yields 8 degrees of freedom, while only 6 and 5 modes are visible at linear order in perturbations, respectively.

Chaotic emissions from semiconductor lasers are attractive in this context because of their fast dynamics and nonrepetitive behavior. Their spectral bandwidth, however, is typically limited to several tens of gigahertz, which constrains the achievable entropy rate and makes ultrafast random bit generation difficult without substantial post-processing. Here, we demonstrate a chaos-based entropy source that employs optical heterodyning between the chaotic emission from a semiconductor laser and an optical frequency comb, yielding a bandwidth exceeding 100 GHz and an experimentally verified single-channel entropy rate of 1.86 Tb/s. By directly extracting multiple bits from the digitized output of the entropy source, we achieve a single-channel random bit generation rate of 1.536 Tb/s, while four-channel parallelization reaches 6.144 Tb/s with no observable interchannel correlation.

A holomorphic conformal field theory with a Kac-Moody subalgebra implies a topological interface between Chern-Simons gauge theories. Upon condensing a suitable set of anyons, such an interface yields a duality between topological field theories. We illustrate this idea using the $c=24$ holomorphic theories classified by Schellekens, which leads to a list of novel sporadic dualities. Some of these dualities necessarily involve condensation of anyons with non-abelian statistics, i.e. gauging non-invertible one-form global symmetries. Several of the examples we discover generalize from $c=24$ to an infinite series. This includes the fact that Spin$(n^{2})_{2}$ is dual to a twisted dihedral group gauge theory.

Extended data figures and Supplementary notes are available from the corresponding author upon request. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u6781\u6027\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u663e\u5fae\u955c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5c42\u72b6$d$-\u6ce2\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f53$KV_2Se_2O$\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u81ea\u65cb\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u53d1\u5c552D\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u6781\u6027\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "1.\u5c42\u72b6$d$-\u6ce2\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f53$KV_2Se_2O$\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u81ea\u65cb\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u96f6\u78c1\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u94c1\u78c1\u548c\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u30022.\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u8be5\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u65cb\u7279\u5f81\u30023.\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u683c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u914d\u5bf9\u7684X\u548cY\u8c37\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u5411\u7684\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u5e26Split\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c42\u72b6$d$-\u6ce2\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce an optical spiking neural network that uses optical rogue-wave statistics as a programmable firing mechanism. By establishing a homomorphism between free-space diffraction and neuronal integration, we demonstrate that phase-engineered caustics enable robust, passive thresholding: sparse spatial spikes emerge when the local intensity exceeds a significant-intensity rogue-wave criterion. Using a physics-informed digital twin, we optimize granular phase masks to deterministically concentrate energy into targeted detector regions, enabling end-to-end co-design of the optical transformation and a lightweight electronic readout. We experimentally validate the approach on BreastMNIST and Olivetti Faces, achieving accuracies of 82.45\\% and 95.00\\%, respectively, competitive with standard digital baselines.

As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$\u03bc$\\si{\\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \\pm 38)$~\\si{\\nano\\meter} in the device.

This approach has been more recently extended and combined with digital phase-shifting holography and off-axis holography to extract both the amplitude and phase information of a sample relying on single-photon interference. Despite these advantages, implementing the technique in real-world scenarios where the observed system is subject to environmental noise and dynamic variations remains challenging.

The near-horizon geometry contains an AdS2 throat with a constant electric field, which lowers the effective mass of the scalar and can trigger a violation of the AdS2 Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. We show that this instability is resolved by the formation of a static scalar cloud supported by Schwinger pair production. The condensate backreacts on the gauge field and partially screens the electric flux, leading to a self-consistent stationary configuration. The scalar profile is obtained analytically from the near-horizon equations and exhibits the characteristic behavior of a BF-violating mode in AdS2.

Azopolymers provide an alternative route by converting structured optical fields into surface reliefs via light-induced mass migration, but existing approaches have been limited to smooth, shallow, and engraving-like topographies produced from a flat film. Here we introduce an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform that exploits engineered darkness within computer-generated holograms to spatially localize inward mass transport and directly produce positive, protruding microreliefs. We show that isolated and array of micro-bumps can be generated from pristine flat azopolymer films in a single writing step, and we introduce spatiotemporal control through sequential tailored illumination to reshape microrelief profiles, enabling flattened-top micropillars, programmable array shapes and arrangements, and free-form continuous microrelief designs. Hierarchical microarchitectures are also demonstrated by extending the concept of multi-step illumination sequences. As functional demonstrations, we realize multi-focus microlenses and quasi-square diffraction gratings with enhanced 1st-order efficiencies. Finally, we leverage azopolymer reconfigurability to implement write-erase-rewrite cycles that reset and repurpose the same surface region for distinct micropatterns, enabling rewritable surfaces and reprogrammable master templates for replication.

For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \\equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics.

A worldline action is an effective theory, and as such the tree-level matching needs to be corrected by loop effects, including UV counter terms, renormalization, and higher-order matching to general relativity. However, we anticipate that many features of the Wilson coefficients of the proposed tree-level action will remain unchanged even after a loop-level matching. While the worldline action is given in closed form, it contains an infinite number of quadratic-in-Riemann operators $R^2$, even for the same-helicity sector. We argue that in the same-helicity sector the $R^2$ operators have no intrinsic meaning, as they merely remove unwanted terms produced by the linear-in-Riemann operators, which are well-established in the literature. The opposite-helicity sector is somewhat more complicated, it contains both $R^2$ operators that removes unwanted terms, and $R^2$ operators that add new needed terms to the Compton amplitude. We discuss and classify all independent $R^2$ operators that can feature in the worldline action.", "AI": {"tldr": " Devise \u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u6b21 Riemann \u884c\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u81ea\u8f6c\u7684 Kerr \u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0a\u5c06\u6811\u7ea7\u522b Kerr Compton \u632f\u5e45\u5339\u914d\u5230\u6765\u81ea\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u8003\u8651\u7684\u63d0\u8bae\u6811\u7ea7\u522b Kerr Compton \u5e45\u5ea6\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u884c\u52a8\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u6548\u5e94\u3001UV \u5bf9\u6570\u9879\u3001\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u548c\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9884\u671f\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u73af\u7ea7\u522b\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u8bae\u6811\u7ea7\u522b\u884c\u52a8\u7684Wilson\u7cfb\u6570\u8bb8\u591a\u7279\u6027\u5c06\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u884c\u52a8\u6709\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u65e0\u9650\u4e2a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26R\u00b2\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5bf9\u540c\u6781\u6027\u7684 \u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002\u6211\u4eec \u8bba\u8ff0\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u6781\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e2d\uff0cR\u00b2 \u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u6ca1\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u53ea\u662f\u79fb\u9664\u7531\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u9879\uff0c\u800c\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5df2\u5728\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u786e\u8ba4\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6781\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5305\u542b\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u9879\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u6240\u9700\u9879\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6781\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u7c7b\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u884c\u52a8\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684R\u00b2\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf \u884c\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u81ea\u8f6c\u7684 Kerr \u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d\u6811\u7ea7\u522b Kerr Compton \u632f\u5e45\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5339\u914d\u6811\u7ea7\u522b Kerr Compton \u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97 \u8ba1\u7b97Wilson\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u5339\u914d\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u6d89\u53ca\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684R\u00b2\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26 \u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u884c\u52a8\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u4e2a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u7684 \u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26 R\u00b2\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5bf9\u540c\u6781\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002\u5728\u540c\u6781\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e2d\uff0cR\u00b2 \u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u6ca1\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u53ea\u662f\u79fb\u9664\u7531\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u9879\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e2d\uff0cR\u00b2\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u65e2\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u9879\uff0c\u53c8\u589e\u52a0\u65b0\u7684\u6240\u9700\u9879\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u6781\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4f53\u73b0\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7684\u72ec\u7acbR\u00b2\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u90fd\u88ab\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168 \u5339\u914d\u4e86\u6811\u7ea7\u522b Kerr Compton \u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u5e76\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684R\u00b2\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

These frozen stars develop a critical horizon at a finite radius $r_c$, where $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ approach zero.

The three-qubit W-state is one such example where every state is robust to single-qubit loss. However, this state is not suitable for deterministic distribution, and deterministic communication protocols. Here, we focus on the distribution of a non-symmetric version of such states, namely $W_{\\mathrm{mod}}$ states. These states belong to the W-class, and have one ebit of entanglement across a specific bipartition, enabling deterministic teleportation and superdense coding. In particular, we describe a few protocols through which these multipartite entangled states can be distributed {\\it deterministically} in a quantum network by first preparing them locally in a central node and then transmitting individual qubits to the end nodes. We analyse the performance of these protocols based on the fidelity of the final distributed state, considering all types of noises that can act during the distribution. Finally, we compare the performance of the protocols to the case where the distribution is performed without any central node.", "AI": {"tldr": "In this paper, multipartite entangled states, particularly non-symmetric W-state variants, are optimized for deterministic distribution in quantum networks.

It is known that the continuum partition function can be represented by a Hermitian two-matrix model, and we propose a string field theory whose Dyson-Schwinger equation coincides with the loop equation of this continuum matrix model. By setting the matrix size to one, we analyze a convergent non-perturbative partition function expressed as a two-dimensional integral, and show that it satisfies a third-order linear differential equation.

The nonlinear response arises from the coupling of the mechanical mode to an ensemble of microscopic two-level system defects driven out of equilibrium by a microwave drive. In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence. Within this framework, we delineate the conditions under which similar systems will realize this nonlinearity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We verify the universal relations obtained from conventional neutron stars in the case of quark stars and explore the cases with different values of parameters of the quark star equation of state. Since quark stars have significantly smaller radii compared to neutron stars in the low mass range, the relation between the tidal defomability and $f$-mode frequency times radius is different for neutron stars and quark stars. This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase.

For pure single-qubit inputs, a particular choice of the single-qubit unitary yields globally chaotic, strongly mixing dynamics that explores the entire Bloch sphere, providing a physical realization of ergodic behavior in a complex map. We extend the analysis to realistic, noisy preparation by considering mixed initial states and the induced nonlinear evolution inside the Bloch sphere. Numerical results show that the maximally mixed state is an attractor for mixed inputs, although many trajectories exhibit transient increases in purity before ultimately converging. To quantify robustness against noise, we introduce a practical notion of quasi-ergodicity: ensembles prepared in a small angular patch at fixed purity rapidly spread to cover all directions, while the purity gradually decreases toward its minimal value. By varying the final single-qubit gate, we identify a broad family of protocols that remain ergodic-like for pure states, supported by consistent diagnostics including the absence of attracting cycles, agreement of time and ensemble statistics, rapid spreading from localized regions, and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. Away from the special globally mixing case, the mixed-state dynamics can change qualitatively: for most ergodic-like parameters, a finite subset of noisy inputs is driven toward purification rather than complete mixing, demonstrating the coexistence of statistical mixing and purification within a single iterated protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Motivated by these features, we explore time-dependent SU(2) Yang-Mills condensates as non-linear classical background fields to model QGP. We first study quarks in gluon backgrounds and show that quark back-reaction can break the isotropy of the condensate for certain initial conditions. We then compute the one-loop finite-temperature effective action using the background-field method and heat-kernel expansion. The resulting thermodynamic pressure increases with temperature but exhibits an approximately logarithmic dependence. This is expected, as this is the de-confined phase of QGP; it is not exactly an ideal gas due to self-interaction.

Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study suggests no significant postmerger echoes from black hole mergers and sets upper limits on their detectability.", "motivation": "Understanding black hole physics through gravitational wave echoes helps explore spacetime near horizons and quantum effects.", "method": "A model-independent approach using a likelihood framework to detect long-lived quasinormal modes, de-noising data via notching, and Bayesian parameter refinement.", "result": " No statistical evidence found for echoes; sets upper limits on their SNR and average amplitude.", "conclusion": " supports the no-echo hypothesis and provides new constraints for future studies"}}

We analyze the single-photon band structure and associated atomic decay rates, revealing a fundamental dependence on dimensionality. One- and two-dimensional arrays are shown to be inherently radiative, exhibiting band gaps and decay rates that oscillate between superradiant and subradiant regimes, as a function of lattice spacing. In contrast, three-dimensional lattices are found to be fundamentally non-radiative due to the inhibition of spontaneous emission, with decay only at discrete Bragg resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this structural difference dictates the system dynamics, which crosses over from dissipative decay in lower dimensions to coherent transport in three dimensions.

The position of the event horizon $r_h$ and the critical impact parameter $b_m$ are then probed to gauge the extent of influence magnetic charge $g$ and halo parameters $\u03b1$, $\u03b2$ have on them. A recurring outcome of our analysis with respect to different BH observables is the nullification of competing effects of charge and halo parameters, leading to observables obtaining values equal to those for a Schwarzschild BH. This is also observed for $r_h$ and $b_m$. We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring. Interestingly, we find combinations of charge and halo parameters that leave the deflection angle unchanged from the Schwarzschild case, thereby leading to a situation where an MHDM BH and a Schwarzschild BH become indistinguishable. Similar results are also observed for lensing observables. Finally, utilizing observations related to the angular diameter of super-massive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ and employing the $\u03c7^2$ test, we extract bounds on $g$, $\u03b1$, and $\u03b2$ signifying the viability of our BH model as an SMBH.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To address this challenge, we report an experimentally accessible protocol for directly measuring the mixed-state topological invariant. By engineering controlled nonunitary dynamics in a photonic quantum walk, we prepare topologically nontrivial mixed states from a trivial initial state. Furthermore, by machine-learning the full density matrix in momentum space, we directly extract the quantized geometric phase of the nontrivial mixed states. These results highlight a geometric phase framework that naturally extends to open quantum systems both in and out of thermal equilibrium.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5355\u4f4dary\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5e73\u51e1\u6001\u5230\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u7684\u6001\u7684\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u6062\u590d\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f97\u5230\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u7eaf\u6001\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u4e0b\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u672a\u89e3\u4e4b\u8c1c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5e0c\u671b\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u975e\u5355\u4f4dary\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5e73\u51e1\u6001\u5230\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u7684\u6001\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u6062\u590d\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6210\u529f\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f4d\u5177\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f4d\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u975e\u5355\u4f4dary\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5236\u5907\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations.

The expectation has been extensively verified in the maximally broken phase $G\\to U(1)^r$. Here we address the non-Abelian regime in which $H$ contains a semisimple factor $H^{s}$.

While one basis yields a zero current, another produces the standard nonzero value. We then consider a potential that is rapidly switched on, recovering the standard current in the asymptotic future. This result is generalized to potentials that interpolate between different constant values at spatial infinity.

In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\\,M_\\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints.

We establish that the large central charge of the boundary conformal field theory corresponds to classical gravity, while a small central charge corresponds to quantum gravity described by Loop Quantum Gravity. In addition, we study the thermodynamic behavior of AdS-Schwarzschild black holes for both large and small central charges. For large central charge, the classical AdS-Schwarzschild black holes have two phases: unstable small black holes and stable large black holes. Conversely, for small central charge, black holes are stable, and their entropy is smaller than that of classical black holes. To explore the influence of the boundary central charge on the information loss paradox, we use the island formula to recover the Page curve. We find that before the Page time, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation increases with time, and its slope is determined by the central charge of the boundary theory. After the Page time, the island inside black holes emerges, and the unitarity of black hole evaporation is restored, yielding a constant entropy consistent with the Page curve. This entanglement entropy, i.e. after the Page time, depends on the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and includes a logarithmic correction related to the central charge.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By imposing horizon regularity condition and matching to the large-radius expansion, we extract the ratio between decaying and growing modes. It turns out that in (3+1) dimensions the scalar Love number is generically nonzero for ABHs, while the Fermionic Love numbers follow a universal power-law form $F^{\\pm1/2}_{\\ell m}=\\pm 4^{-(\\ell+1/2)}$. In (2+1) dimensions the scalar field exhibits a strange logarithmic structure, causing the Bosonic Love number to vanish for even $m$ but remain nontrivial for odd $m$; In contrast, the Fermionic Love number in this case retains a simple power-law form $F_m=4^{-m}$ and is generically nonzero. These results provide insights into tidal response in analogue gravity systems and highlight qualitative differences between integer- and half-integer-spin fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u9759\u6001\uff08\u03c9\u21920\uff09\u6ce2\u957f\u6570\u5ea6\uff08\u4e5f\u79f0\u4e3a\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u6807\u91cf\uff08s=0\uff09\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\uff08s=1/2\uff09\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9759\u6001\u58f0\u5b66\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08ABHs\uff09\u5728\uff083+1\uff09\u548c\uff082+1\uff09\u7ef4\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u7684\u9759\u6001\u503c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u5730\u5e73\u9762\u6b63\u5219\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u5339\u914d\u5230\u5927\u534a\u5f84\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u8870\u51cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u3002\u5728\uff083+1\uff09\u7ef4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u91cf\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u975e\u96f6\uff0c\u800c\u8d39\u7c73\u79bb\u5b50\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u9075\u5faa\u901a\u7528\u5e42\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f F^{\ndonplus1/2}_{\textit{l}\textit{m}} = \textpm 4^{-(\textit{l}+1/2)}\u3002\u5728\uff082+1\uff09\u7ef4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5947\u602a\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u91cf\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5728\u5076\u6570 m \u65f6\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5947\u6570 m \u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u96f6\uff1b\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u8d39\u7c73\u79bb\u5b50\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f F_m = 4^{-m}\uff0c\u4e14\u666e\u904d\u975e\u96f6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u91cd\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7b54\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6574\u6570\u548c\u534a\u6574\u6570\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u58f0\u5b66\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\uff08Love numbers\uff09\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u7c7b\u91cd\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e94\u7b54\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u9886\u57df\u3002\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u5e94\u7b54\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u65cb\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u573a\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u03a8\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5728\uff083+1\uff09\u7ef4\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u7269\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u5730\u5e73\u9762\u6b63\u5219\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u5339\u914d\u5230\u5927\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u5c55\u5f00\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u5728\uff082+1\uff09\u7ef4\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u91cf\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\u5728\uff083+1\uff09\u7ef4\u975e\u96f6\uff0c\u800c\u8d39\u7c73\u79bb\u5b50\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\u5448\u73b0\u5e42\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u5728\uff082+1\uff09\u7ef4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5947\u6570 m \u7684\u6807\u91cf\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\u975e\u96f6\uff0c\u4f46\u5076\u6570 m \u65f6\u4e3a\u96f6\uff1b\u8d39\u7c73\u79bb\u5b50\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u5ea6\u5219\u5728\u4efb\u4f55 m \u503c\u65f6\u90fd\u6709\u975e\u96f6\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u9075\u5faa\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u91cd\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7b54\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u6574\u6570\u4e0e\u534a\u6574\u6570\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u5728\u9759\u6001\u58f0\u5b66\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u5f15\u529b\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7b54\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The simplest example of these eigenfunctions is provided by non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, while generally they are constructed basing on the ground state eigenfunction coinciding with the twisted Baker-Akhiezer function being a peculiar (symmetric) eigenfunction of the DIM Hamiltonians. Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials.

The Lie-algebraic criteria of controllability imply that such an array is not completely controllable, but satisfies the conditions for subspace controllability on any subspace with a fixed number of excitations. Therefore, a qubit array described by the model under consideration is state-to-state controllable for an arbitrary choice of initial and final states that have the same Hamming weight. This limited controllability is exploited here for the time-optimal dynamical generation of an $a$-excitation Dicke state $|D^{N}_{a}\\rangle$ ($a=1,2,\\ldots, N-1$) in a linear array with $N$ qubits starting from a generic Hamming-weight-$a$ product state. To dynamically generate the desired Dicke states -- including $W$ states $|W_{N}\\rangle$ as their special ($a=1$) case -- in the shortest possible time with a single local $Z$ control, we employ an optimal-control scheme based on the dressed Chopped RAndom Basis (dCRAB) algorithm. We optimize the target-state fidelity over the expansion coefficients of smoothly-varying control fields in a truncated random Fourier basis; this is done by combining Nelder-Mead-type local optimizations with the multistart-based clustering algorithm that facilitates searches for global extrema. In this manner, we obtain the optimal control fields for Dicke-state preparation in arrays with up to $N=9$ qubits. Based on our numerical results, we find that the shortest possible state-preparation times scale quadratically with $N$. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our control scheme against small control-field deviations from the optimal values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u573a\u6001\u5728\u5e26\u6709\u7b49\u8f74Heisenberg\u8026\u5408\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u603b\u6fc0\u53d1\u6570\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\uff0c\u4e14\u4efb\u610f\u521d\u59cb\u548c\u7ec8\u6001\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u603b\u6fc0\u53d1\u6570\u4e0b\u53ef\u63a7\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u53cc\u573a\u6001\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53cc\u573a\u6001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eLie\u4ee3\u6570\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91c7\u7528dCRAB\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u573a\u6001\u5728\u7b49\u8f74Heisenberg\u8026\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7ec4\u4e2d\u53ef\u63a7\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

By constructing appropriate metrics in each dynamical regime, namely the unbroken-symmetry phase, the broken-symmetry phase, and at exceptional points, we provide a consistent definition of expectation values, variances, and time evolution within a Krein-space framework. Within this approach, we derive a generalized Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty inequality which is valid across all spectral regimes. As an application, we analyze a two level model with parity-time reversal symmetry and show that, while the uncertainty measure exhibits oscillatory behavior in the unbroken phase, it evolves toward a minimum-uncertainty steady state in the broken symmetry phase and at exceptional points.

Accurate modeling of these devices is essential for predicting performance, improving design, and optimizing control. Many modeling approaches currently rely on lumped circuit approximations or other simplified treatments that can be limited in resolving the interplay between the qubit dynamics and the electromagnetic circuitry, leading to significant experimental deviations from numerical predictions at times. To address many of these limitations, methods that self-consistently solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for qubit dynamics with the classical Maxwell's equations have been developed and shown to accurately predict a wide range of effects related to superconducting qubit control and readout. Despite these successes, these methods have not been able to consider multi-qubit effects that give rise to qubit-qubit entanglement. Here, we address this by rigorously deriving how multi-qubit coupling effects between transmon qubits can be embedded into Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger methods. To support this, we build on earlier first-principles derivations of Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger methods for the specific case of two transmon qubits coupled together through a common electromagnetic system in the dispersive regime. To aid in validating aspects of the Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger framework, we also provide a new interpretation of Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger methods as an efficient simulation strategy to capture the class of non-Markovian open quantum system dynamics. Our results demonstrate that these effects can give rise to strong classical crosstalk that can significantly alter multi-qubit dynamics, which we demonstrate for the cross-resonance gate. These classical crosstalk effects have been noted in cross-resonance experiments, but previous quantum theory and device analysis could not explain their origin.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quantum computing's superconducting qubits require accurate modeling due to the complex interplay between qubit dynamics and electromagnetic circuitry.

We analyze the effect of the Coulomb coupling on three distinct synchronization regimes, i.e., complete quantum synchronization, $\u03c6$-synchronization, and quantum phase synchronization. Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $\u03c6$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u6a21\u5149\u5b66\u673a\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e93\u4ed1\u4f5c\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u7531\u5149\u9a71\u4f7f\u51b3\u5b9a\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u9891\u7387\u9501\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e93\u4ed1\u8026\u5408\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u8154\u632f\u8361\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u4f20\u611f\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u6a21\u5149\u5b66\u673a\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4eba\u4eec\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u540c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Coulomb\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u8154\u7684\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4f4d\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u5728\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u9891\u7387\u9501\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\u3002 comparer \u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u91c7\u7eb3\u7684\u673a\u7406\u3002 conna\u00eet", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e93\u4ed1\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7387\u9501\u5b9a\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u8154\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u4f20\u611f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5e93\u4ed1\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u56db\u6a21\u5149\u5b66\u673a\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u9891\u7387\u9501\u5b9a\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f4d\u91c7\u7eb3\u7684\u673a\u7406\u3002\u5e93\u4ed1\u4f5c\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u9891\u7387\u9501\u5b9a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u8154\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This paper develops this perspective for circuit QED dispersive readout through a first-principles derivation starting from the circuit Lagrangian. The transmon qubit terminating a transmission line resonator provides a frequency-dependent boundary condition whose pole structure encodes the qubit's transition frequencies; different qubit states yield different resonator frequencies. Two approximations, linear response and a pole-dominated expansion valid near resonance, reduce the boundary function to a rational form in the Sturm-Liouville eigenparameter. The extended Hilbert space of the Fulton-Walter spectral theory then provides a framework for the dressed-mode eigenvalue problem conditional on the qubit state. The dispersive shift and vacuum Rabi splitting emerge from the transcendental eigenvalue equation, with the residues determined by matching to the splitting: $\u03b4_{ge} = 2Lg^2\u03c9_q^2/v^4$, where $g$ is the vacuum Rabi coupling. A level repulsion theorem guarantees that no dressed mode frequency coincides with a transmon transition. For two qubits with matched dispersive shifts, odd-parity states become frequency-degenerate; true parity-only measurement requires engineered suppression of linear dispersive terms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u7535\u8defQED\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u6563\u8bfb\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u798f\u7279-\u6c83\u5c14\u7279\u8c31\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u6d88\u5149\u62c9\u6bd4\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u9891\u79fb\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5076\u6570\u548c\u5947\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u67d0\u79cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u9891\u7387\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u7a0b\u624b\u6bb5\u6d88\u9664\u7ebf\u6027\u79bb\u6563\u9879\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u5916\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u6001\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7535\u8defQED\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u798f\u7279-\u6c83\u5c14\u7279\u8c31\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6c42\u89e3\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u6d88\u5149\u62c9\u6bd4\u5206\u88c2\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u9891\u79fb\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u5076\u5947\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u7a0b\u624b\u6bb5\u6d88\u9664\u7ebf\u6027\u79bb\u6563\u9879\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Based on the principles of generalized unitarity, they are given by products of elementary three-point amplitudes where the kinematics of internal on-shell legs are determined by cut conditions. In the ${\\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, the dual formulation for on-shell diagrams produces the same quantities as canonical forms on the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$. Most of the work in this direction has been devoted to the planar diagrams, which dominate in the large $N$ limit of gauge theories. On the mathematical side, planar on-shell diagrams correspond to cells of the positive Grassmannian $G_+(k,n)$ which have been very extensively studied in the literature in the past 20 years. In this paper, we focus on the non-planar on-shell diagrams which are relevant at finite $N$. In particular, we use the triplet formulation of Maximal-Helicity-Violating (MHV) on-shell diagrams to obtain certain regions in the Grassmannian $G(2,n)$. These regions are unions of positive Grassmannians with different orderings (referred to as oriented regions).

Extending the one-axis and two-axis twisting paradigms of Kitagawa and Ueda, we introduce a general class of three-axis spin squeezed states within the anisotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. The model features direction-dependent quadratic couplings that interpolate between uniaxial and biaxial regimes and can be interpreted as an asymmetric quantum rotor. Using semiclassical dynamics, Majorana representations, and Husimi-Q distributions, we analyze the structure and metrological properties of the resulting states. The three-axis framework reproduces the known N^(-2/3) scaling of one-axis twisting and the Heisenberg-limited N^(-1) scaling of two-axis twisting, while allowing additional tunability and enhanced entanglement generation in low-spin systems. We further show that tuning the anisotropy parameters induces ground-state and excited-state quantum phase transitions, including a second-order transition associated with level clustering and critical dynamics. These results unify spin squeezing, quantum criticality, and rotor analogies, and suggest implementations in Rydberg arrays and cavity-QED platforms for precision sensing and quantum simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u65cb\u8f6c squeezing \u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u91cf\u5b50\u9650\u5236\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a metrology \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c setup \u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50 metrology \u5728\u5404\u79cd\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u65cb\u8f6c squeezing \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584 metrology \u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6781\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u573a\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86 Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u65cb\u8f6c coupling \u548c semiclassical \u52a8\u6001 \u5206\u6790\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 Majorana \u8868\u793a\u548c Husimi-Q \u5206\u5e03\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u8f74\u548c\u53cc\u8f74\u65cb\u8f6c coupling \u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 N^(-2/3) \u548c N^(-1) \u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4f4e\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5141\u8bb8\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574 anisotropy \u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0e\u80fd\u7ea7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u4e34\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u548c rotor \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u51b7\u70ed Rydberg \u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8154\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\\times_{\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}}\\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\\rm F}$ or Spin$\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \\to K \\to G_{\\rm Tot} \\to G \\to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $\u03bd_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\\bf B \\pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms.

To do this, we employ the complex scaling method, where resonance poles of the S-matrix are realized as discrete eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian dilated Hamiltonian, to construct situations in which resonant and scattering states coalesce into an EP in the complex energy plane, that is, the resonance pole is embedded into the continuum spectrum. We analyze the self-orthogonality in the vicinity of an EP and the Berry phase. Our results provide a bridge between non-Hermitian spectral theory and the traditional theory of quantum resonances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u590d\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8f85\u52a9\u6027\u548c\u5171\u632f\u6001\u5728Hermitian Hamiltonians\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u53cc\u66f2\u578b\u5947\u70b9\uff08\u53cc\u66f2\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f62\u6210\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u6216Moller-Plesset\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373Hermitian Hamiltonians\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u53cc\u66f2\u70b9\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b58\u5728", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u6027\uff08\u65afchr??dinger\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684Marchenko\u7c7b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff09\u7684\u590d\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u4f7f\u5f97\u9000\u5316\u7684\u5171\u632f\u6001\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u6001\u6210\u4e3aHermitian\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u865a\u62df\u79bb\u6563\u6001\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u88ab\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fdb\u5165\u5177\u6709\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u9020\u63a5\u8fd1\u53cc\u66f2\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5171\u632f\u6001\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u6001\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Berry\u76f8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684HermitianHamiltonian\u53cc\u66f2\u70b9\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u679c\u8868\u660e\u53cc\u66f2\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f85\u52a9\u6027\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

As a minimal and exactly solvable example, we analyze the $U_q(\\mathfrak{su}(2))$ quantum group and a two-qubit realization obtained from the coproduct of a $q$-deformed single-spin Hamiltonian. Although the deformation is invisible on a single qubit, it resurfaces in the two-qubit sector through the non-cocommutative coproduct, yielding a family of intrinsically nonlocal unitaries. We compute their operator entanglement in closed form and show that, for Haar-uniform product inputs, their entangling power is fully determined by the latter. This provides a concrete mechanism by which non-commutative symmetries enforce a baseline of entanglement at the algebraic level, with implications for information dynamics in quantum-spacetime settings and quantum information processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c Hopf-\u4ee3\u6570\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u643a\u5e26\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u8fd9\u7531\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u590d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5143\u7684\u4f59\u79ef\u6240\u5f3a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528U_q(su(2))\u91cf\u5b50\u7fa4\u548c\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u901a\u8fc7q-\u53d8\u5f62\u5355\u81ea\u65cb\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7684\u4f59\u79ef\u83b7\u5f97\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5f62\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u6bb5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4f59\u79ef\u7684\u975e\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u975e\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u4f59\u79ef\u800c\u91cd\u73b0\u5728\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u5355\u5143\u5185\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4e00\u65cf\u5185\u8574\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u5728Haar-\u5747\u5300\u4e58\u79ef\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u529b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u5b8c\u5168\u7531\u540e\u8005\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4ee3\u6570\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u7a7a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u6765\u8bf4\u660e\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u7a7a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Hopf\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fU_q(su(2))\u91cf\u5b50\u7fa4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u79ef\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u590d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5143\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u4f59\u79ef\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u64cd\u4f5cents\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5f62\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u4e24\u5149\u5b50\u81ea\u7531\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4f59\u79ef\u7684\u975e\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff0c\u53d8\u5f62\u662f\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u7a7a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers.

An exponentially scaling DLA dimension is associated with the presence of so-called barren plateaus (BP) in the optimization landscape, which renders training intractable. In this work, we investigate the DLA of QAOA applied to the canonical MaxCut, for both weighted and unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, we show that when the weights are drawn from a continuous distribution, the DLA dimension grows as $\u0398(4^n)$ almost surely for all connected graphs except paths and cycles. In the more common unweighted setting, we show that asymptotically all but an exponentially vanishing fraction of graphs have $\u0398(4^n)$ large DLA dimension. The entire simple Lie algebra decomposition of the corresponding DLAs is also identified, from which we prove that the variance of the loss function is $O(1/2^n)$, implying that QAOA on these weighted and unweighted graphs all suffers from BP. Moreover, we give explicit constructions for families of graphs whose DLAs have exponential dimension, including cases whose MaxCut is in $\\mathsf P$. Our proof of the unweighted case is based on a number of splitting lemmas and DLA-freeness conditions that allow one to convert prohibitively complicated Lie algebraic problems into amenable graph theoretic problems. These form the basis for a new algorithm that computes such DLAs orders of magnitude faster than previous methods, reducing runtimes from days to seconds on standard hardware. We apply this algorithm to MQLib, a classical MaxCut benchmark suite covering over 3,500 instances with up to 53,130 vertices, and find that, ignoring edge weights, at least 75% of the instances possess a DLA of dimension at least $2^{128}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance.

By extension, letting the intracavity light act back on the atoms enables coherent photon-mediated interactions. I start by discussing collective spin models, emphasizing applications in entanglement-enhanced metrology, before proceeding to richer many-body physics enabled by incorporating spatiotemporal control or employing multiple cavity modes. I will highlight opportunities for leveraging these tools for quantum simulations inspired by problems in condensed matter and quantum gravity.

Developing expandable and efficient CVQKD networks will promote the deployment of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future. This paper proposes a CVQKD network based on the entangled states of an optical frequency comb. This scheme generates Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states with a frequency comb structure through the process of a type-II optical parametric oscillator. By combining with the scheme of entanglement in the middle, a fully connected CVQKD network capable of distributing secret keys simultaneously can be formed. We analyze the security of the system in the asymptotic case. Simulation results show that under commendable controlling of system loss and noise, the proposed scheme is feasible for deploying a short-distance fully connected CVQKD network. Loss will be the main factor limiting the system's performance. The proposed scheme provides new ideas for a multi-user fully connected CVQKD network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5149\u9891\u7387\u590d\u5236\u5b9a\u6001\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u9891\u7387\u590d\u5236\u5b9a\u6001\u7684\u5168\u5149\u53c2\u6570\u632f\u8361\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6ce2\u591a\u5229\u53f6-\u7f57\u68ee\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u95f4\u6001\u7ea0\u7f20\u65b9\u6848\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u5168\u8fde\u63a5CVQKD\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u635f\u5931\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5168\u8fde\u63a5CVQKD\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u635f\u5931\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Accurate benchmarking of quantum gates is crucial for understanding and enhancing the performance of quantum hardware. A standard method for this is interleaved benchmarking, a technique which estimates the error on an interleaved target gate by comparing cumulative error rates of randomized sequences implemented with the interleaved gate and without it. In this work, we show both numerically and experimentally that the standard approach of interleaved randomized benchmarking (IRB), which uses the multi-qubit Clifford group for randomization, can produce highly inaccurate and even physically impossible estimates for the error on the interleaved gate in the presence of coherent errors. Fortunately we also show that interleaved benchmarking performed with cycle benchmarking, which randomizes with single qubit Pauli gates, provides dramatically reduced systematic uncertainty relative to standard IRB, and further provides as host of additional benefits including data reusability. We support our conclusions with a theoretical framework for bounding systematic errors, extensive numerical results comparing a range of interleaved protocols under fixed resource costs, and experimental demonstrations on three quantum computing platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4ea4\u9519\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5e72\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u6539\u7528\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u6ce1\u5229\u95e8\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u4ea4\u9519\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u5982\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u9650\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u9519\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6570\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u5957\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u5e72\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4ea4\u9519\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cd5\u548c\u4f8b\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u6ce1\u5229\u95e8\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cd5\uff08IRB\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u7528\u4f8b\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cd5\uff08EBM\uff09\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This allows flexible control over the number of binary variables and adapts well to hardware constraints. We prove convergence properties, introduce a step size adaptation scheme, and validate the method on linear regression.

To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3). These results provide clear, high-level evidence that adaptive resource orchestration in the ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation on near-term hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "ModEn-Hub architecture enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation via orchestration of entanglement hubs and resources.", "motivation": "The increasing need for scalable quantum computing beyond single-device systems motivates the development of a networked architecture that capitalizes on quantum networking.", "method": "A photonic interconnect with a quantum network orchestrator is proposed, along with a Monte Carlo study comparing orchestration effectiveness to a baseline.", "result": "ModEn-Hub achieves ~90% teleportation success across 1-128 QPUs, contrasting with a ~30% baseline when quantum interference is minimized.", "conclusion": "Orchestration of entanglement hubs significantly enhances quantum computing scalability and efficiency on near-term hardware."}}

The concept of a PT transition has been extended to Markovian open quantum systems, which are described by the GKSL equation. Interestingly, the PT transition in many-body Markovian open quantum systems, the so-called \\textit{Lindbladian PT (L-PT) phase transition}, is closely related to two classes of exotic nonequilibrium many-body phenomena: \\textit{continuous-time crystals} and \\textit{non-reciprocal phase transitions}. In this review, we describe the recent advances in the study of L-PT phase transitions. First, we define PT symmetry in three distinct contexts: non-Hermitian systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, and Markovian open quantum systems, highlighting the interconnections between these frameworks. Second, we develop mean-field theories of L-PT phase transitions for collective-spin systems and for bipartite bosonic systems with particle-number conservation. Within these classes of models, we show that L-PT symmetry can induce a breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry down to a discrete one, leading to persistent periodic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the L-PT phase transition point is typically \\textit{a critical exceptional point}, where multiple collective excitation modes with zero excitation spectrum coalesce. These findings establish an explicit connection to continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions. Third, going beyond the mean-field theory, we analyze statistical and quantum properties, such as purity and quantum entanglement indicators of time-independent steady states for several specific models with the L-PT symmetry.
