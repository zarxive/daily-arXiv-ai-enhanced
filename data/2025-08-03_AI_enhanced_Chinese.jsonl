These\ncorrespond to the different ways in which a many-body exciton state, at fixed\ntotal momentum, can be decomposed into free electron and hole Bloch states that\nare entangled by an exciton envelope wave function. Inspired by the modern\ntheory of polarization, we define an exciton projected position operator whose\neigenvalues single out two unique choices of exciton Berry phase and associated\nBerry connection - one for electrons, and one for holes. We clarify the\nphysical meaning of these exciton Berry phases and provide a discrete Wilson\nloop formulation that allows for their numerical calculation without a smooth\ngauge. As a corollary, we obtain a gauge-invariant expression for the exciton\npolarisation at a given total momentum, i.e. the mean separation of the\nelectron and hole within the exciton wave function. In the presence of\ncrystalline inversion symmetry, the electron and hole exciton Berry phases are\nquantized to the same value and we derive how this value can be expressed in\nterms of inversion eigenvalues of the many-body exciton state. We then consider\ncrystalline $C_2 \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, for which no symmetry eigenvalues are\navailable as it is anti-unitary, and confirm that the exciton Berry phase\nremains quantized and still diagnoses topologically distinct exciton bands.

However, in the\ncontext of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$\ndiscrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is\ncurrently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter\n$N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example,\nwe investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field\ntheory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the\nFD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different\n$N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\\textit{field digitization\nscaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond\ndimension $\\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover\naround a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating\nthat FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\\chi$ and $N$. Finally,\nwe analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the\nground state of a (2+1)D $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a\nFD of compact quantum electrodynamics.

The mechanism of formation of this phase mainly consists of\nthe merging of smaller nuclei. Even though increasing temperature and the\nreactants concentration lead to a similar nucleation speedup, there are\ndifferences in ring populations and lifetimes within the highly-connected\namorphous intermediate phases that are formed in each case.

In this work, we\ninvestigate single titanium (Ti) atoms adsorbed on MgO/Ag(100) surfaces using a\ncombined scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. Our\nmeasurements reveal two distinct spin states, $S = 1/2$ and $S = 1$, depending\non the local adsorption site and the thickness of the MgO film. Density\nfunctional theory calculations suggest a Ti$^+$ configuration for the Ti\nadsorbates with approximately 3 electrons in the 4$s$ and 3$d$ valence shells.\nUsing a multi-orbital atomic multiplet calculations the site dependence of the\nspin can be rationalized as a charge redistribution between spin-polarizing and\ndepolarizing orbitals.

With help of the first principles\ncalculations, we conclude that the Xh peak is associated with the transition\nbetween the top valence band and the second lowest conduction band, which is\nforbidden by the inversion symmetry in 1L CrSBr. Furthermore, the position and\nintensity of the Xh peak are strongly dependent on the interlayer magnetic\norder of the CrSBr samples, which provides an efficient way to probe their spin\nconfigurations.

However, their inherently small\noptical interaction volume poses fundamental challenges for efficient\nintegration into quantum and nanophotonic devices. Addressing this limitation\nrequires the development of photonic platforms that can effectively enhance\natomic-scale optical coupling. To this end, air suspended nanomembranes with\nextreme thinness and minimal radiative loss offer an ideal framework for\nintegrating atomic layer materials into photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate\nan ultrathin freestanding photonic nanomembrane with a thickness down to 29 nm\ncomparable to that of atomic layer materials enabling atomic scale control of\nlight coupling. This architecture supports strong field confinement at the\nsurface and significantly enhances light matter interaction. Through the\nintegration of atomic layer material, we achieve angstrom level thickness\nmodulation, where a single atomic-layer-deposition cycle corresponding to a\nthickness increment of 0.65 angstrom results in a 0.09 nm shift in the high Q\nresonance. High-resolution spatial mapping further confirms uniform and\ndeterministic resonance tuning across the nanomembrane surface.

A phenomenological model capable of\ndescribing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity,\nby which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However,\nbeing a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility\nrelations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we\ndevelop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic\ncompatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase\nspace of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and\nthus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped.

In\nideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible\nnematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of\ncrystalline anisotropy.

Recent theoretical advances have reignited interest in its\nnonlinear counterpart, the nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which spin\nmagnetization is induced by a second-order electric field. However, the\nintrinsic contribution to both effects is generally forbidden in systems\npreserving time-reversal symmetry ($\\mathcal{T}$) or composite symmetries such\nas $\\mathcal{T}\\tau_{1/2}$, where $\\tau_{1/2}$ denotes a half-lattice\ntranslation. In such systems, spin magnetization typically emerges either from\nextrinsic mechanisms but limited to metals due to their Fermi-surface property,\nor from dynamical electric fields with a terahertz driving frequency. Here, we\npropose a new mechanism for spin magnetization, arising from the interplay of\nmagnetic and electric fields, termed the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein\neffect. Remarkably, its intrinsic component, determined purely by the\nmaterial's band structure, can appear even in $\\mathcal{T}$-invariant\nmaterials, but lacking inversion symmetry ($\\mathcal{P}$), including\ninsulators. On the other hand, we illustrate that its extrinsic component can\nserve as a sensitive indicator of the N\\'eel vector reversal in\n$\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials, offering a\nnovel route for antiferromagnetic order detection. To validate our theory, we\nperform explicit calculations using a two-band Dirac model and a tight-binding\nmodel on a honeycomb lattice, finding that both effects yield sizable spin\nmagnetization.

Here, we propose a device that achieves selective SAW\nattenuation by instead programming its internal magnetic state. To this end, we\nperform micromagnetic simulations for the magnetoelastic interaction of the\nRayleigh SAW mode with spin waves (SWs) in exchange-decoupled Co/Ni islets on a\npiezoelectric LiTaO$_3$ substrate.

The\nphysical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological\ninvariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored\nfor static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven\nscenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet\nnon-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological\nproperties of time-periodic NH systems.

Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust\n(despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving\nparameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to\nemergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame\napproach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when\nappropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture.

These devices utilize\nelectrochemical ion intercalation to modulate the ion concentration in the\nchannel material. The electrical conductance, which is concentration dependent,\ncan be read separately and mapped to a non-volatile memory state. To compete\nwith other random access memory technologies, linear and symmetric conductance\nmodulation is often sought after, properties typically thought to be limited by\nthe slow ion diffusion timescale. A recent study by Onen et al.[1] examining\nprotonic EIoS with a tungsten oxide (WO3) channel revealed that this limiting\ntimescale seemed irrelevant, and linear conductance modulation was achieved\nover nanosecond timescales, much faster than the bulk ion diffusion. This\ncontrasts with previous studies that have shown similar conductance modulation\nwith pulse timescales of milliseconds to seconds. Understanding the phenomena\nbehind these conductance modulation properties in EIoS systems remains a\ncrucial question gating technological improvements to these devices. Here, we\nprovide a theoretical explanation that demonstrates how linearity and symmetry\narise from consistent control over the electrolyte-WO3 interface.

When the particle momentum satisfies a\ncertain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a\nnormal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result\nsuggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely\nalong the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted\nas a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse\ndeflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke\nEhrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized\nangular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle\nis an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like\nvoltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall\neffect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved\nsurface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a\nbinormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron\ntransport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC\nvoltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices.\nQuantum transport on a helical nanoribbon can be controlled by tuning the bends\nand twists of its surface, suggesting diverse applications in biopolymers and\nnanotechnology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9525\u5f62\u7eb3\u7c73\u5e26\u72b6\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u7f51\u5e26\u4e2d\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u805a\u5408\u7269\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u751f\u7269\u805a\u5408\u7269\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u80fd\u52bf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u66f2\u7ebf\u8868\u9762\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u57c3\u4f26\u8d39\u65af\u7279\u5b9a\u7406\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u91cf\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u9525\u5f62 NANORibbon \u4e2d\u88ab\u675f\u7f1a\u5728\u5185\u8fb9\u6cbf\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u87ba\u65cb\u7ebf\u4e0a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7403\u9762\u65cb\u8f6c\u7cfb\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u6548\u5e94\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u7eb3\u7c73\u5e26\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u65f6\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u6548\u5e94\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u9525\u5f62 NANORibbon \u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5236\u9020\u751f\u7269\u805a\u5408\u7269\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u5bb9\u53d8\u5668\u3002"}}

In Japan, several domestic superconducting quantum computing\nsystems, including our own, began operation in 2023. However, the design of\nquantum computing systems, especially in the most critical areas near quantum\ncomputers, remains largely undisclosed, creating a significant barrier to entry\ninto the quantum computing field. If this situation continues, progress toward\nstandardization, which is essential for guiding quantum computer development,\nwill stall, and it will be difficult to develop a practical quantum computing\nsystem that can perform calculations on a supercomputer scale. To address this\nissue, we propose Open Quantum Toolchain for OPerators and USers (OQTOPUS), a\nfull-stack quantum computing system developed from research with real quantum\ncomputers. OQTOPUS is one of the world's largest open-source software projects,\ncovering operational software from cloud-based execution environment\nconstruction to system operation. Furthermore, to perform quantum computing\neffectively and efficiently, it implements key features, such as transpilers,\nmultiprogramming, and error mitigation, in an area as close as possible to a\nquantum computer, an area that system vendors rarely disclose. Finally, this\nstudy presents experimental results of applying OQTOPUS to a real quantum\ncomputer.

For deterministically coupled single PL6 defects, we observe\na threefold increase in the saturated photon count rate, confirm single-photon\nemission, and demonstrate coherent control of the spin state through optically\ndetected magnetic resonance (ODMR), resonant excitation, and Rabi oscillations.\nThese advancements establish a viable pathway for developing scalable,\nhigh-performance SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6982\u8ff0\uff1a\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u57284H-SiCOI\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6807\u5ea6\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7f3a\u9677\uff08PL4\u548cPL6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u7ea4\u653e\u5927\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8 performance\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPL4\u7f3a\u9677\u5bfc\u81f4\u96f6\u632f\u52a8\u5149\u8c31\u5f3a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a040\u500d\uff0cPurcell\u56e0\u5b50\u7ea65.0\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u4e2aPL6\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e09\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6001\u7684\u5149\u81f4\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e3aScemic\u6750\u6599\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u7535\u8def\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u2261\u81ea\u65cb\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u57284H-SiCOI\u5e73\u53f0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u2261\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5728SiC-on-insulator\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u8154\u4f53\u8c10\u632f\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u81ea\u65cb\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7f3a\u9677\uff08PL4\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u96f6\u632f\u52a8\u5149\u8c31\u5f3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u5b50\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230P\u503c\u7ea65.0\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u7f3a\u9677\uff08PL6\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u7387\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u65cb\u6001\u7684\u5149\u81f4\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u2261\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7fa4\u4f53PL4\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u96f6\u632f\u52a8\u5149\u8c31\u5f3a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a040\u500d\uff0cP\u503c\u7ea6\u4e3a5.0\uff0c\u5355\u4e2aPL6\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e09\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6001\u7684\u5149\u81f4\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u3001\u8c10\u632f\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u62c9\u6bd4\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u2261\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4e3a4H-SiCOI\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7f3a\u9677\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdSiC\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8fd9\u4e5f\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86SiC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5149\u5b50\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u5730\u5740able\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002"}}

BQT is a crucial component of distributed quantum networks,\nallowing for the bilateral transfer of quantum information between two nodes.\nWhile perfect teleportation necessitates maximally entangled states, these are\nvulnerable to degradation due to inherent decoherence. We propose a BQT scheme\nthat enables the bilateral transfer of arbitrary qubits between nodes via\namplitude damping channels (ADC), aiming to optimize fidelity using weak\nmeasurements in the final step of the process. Environment-assisted\nmeasurements (EAM) are used to establish a four-qubit channel composed of two\nBell states. We explore two situations: (I) where only the recovery qubits pass\nthrough amplitude damping channels and (II) where the entire four-qubit channel\nis subjected to ADC. Our findings demonstrate a balance between average\nfidelity and success probability when the weak measurement strength ($q_w$) is\nconstrained by the decay rate ($p$), specifically $q_w \\in {[0,p]}$. Perfect\nBQT is achieved when $q_w = p$, indicating complete suppression of ADC effects.\nOn the other hand, a decline in both average fidelity and success probability\nis noted when the weak measurement strength surpasses the ADC strength, marking\nthe prohibited domain as $q_w \\in {(p,1]}$.

Experts\ngenerally believe that quantum computing relies on matrix operations, which are\ndeterministic in nature without randomness. This inherent determinism makes it\nparticularly challenging to design quantum circuits that require random number\ninjection.

These components are compatible\nwith a scalable framework that leverages large scale parallelism and Quantum\nAmplitude Estimation (QAE) to achieve quadratic speedup. The circuit was\nimplemented on IBM Qiskit and evaluated using 8 parallel threads and 1600\nmeasurement shots.

Zero-Noise\nExtrapolation (ZNE), which we mainly consider in this work, is one of prominent\nquantum error mitigation methods. For algorithms with deep circuits - such as\niterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's\neffectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise. Extrapolation based\non such low-fidelity data often yields inaccurate estimates and requires\nsubstantial overhead. In this study, we propose a lightweight,\nextrapolation-based error mitigation framework tailored for structured quantum\nalgorithms composed of repeating operational blocks. The proposed method\ncharacterizes the error of the repeated core operational block, rather than the\nfull algorithm, using shallow circuits. Extrapolation is used to estimate the\nblock fidelity, followed by a reconstruction of the mitigated success\nprobability. We validate our method via simulations of the 6-qubit Grover's\nalgorithm on IBM's Aer simulator, then further evaluating it on the real\n127-qubit IBM Quantum system based on Eagle r3 under a physical noise\nenvironment. Our results, particularly those from Aer simulator, demonstrate\nthat the core block's error follows a highly consistent exponential decay. This\nallows our technique to achieve robust error mitigation, overcoming the\nlimitations of conventional ZNE which is often compromised by statistically\nunreliable data from near-random behavior under heavy noise. In low-noise\nconditions, our method approaches theoretical success probability, outperforms\nZNE. In high-noise conditions, ZNE fails to mitigate errors due to overfitting\nof its extrapolation data, whereas our method achieves over a 20% higher\nsuccess probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u672c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5757\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8ZNE\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1 noise quantum\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u8fd0\u7b97\u5757\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u6574\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u671f\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfZNE\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The Hadamard test is hard to implement\nbecause it requires controlled applications of $U^{k}$. Recently, a Sequential\nHadamard test (SHT) was proposed (arXiv:2506.18765) which requires controlled\napplication of $U$ only but its total run time $T_{\\rm tot}$ scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(k^{3}/\\epsilon^{2}r_{\\rm min}^{2})$ where $r_{\\rm min}$ is the\nminimum value of $|\\langle \\psi|U^{k'}|\\psi\\rangle|$ among all integers $k'\n\\leq k$. Typically $r_{\\rm min}$ is exponentially low and SHT becomes too slow.\nWe present a new algorithm, the SANDWICH test to address this bottleneck.
