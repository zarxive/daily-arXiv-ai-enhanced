TL;DR: The STAR experiment successfully implemented an eTOF subsystem for fixed-target experiments at different energies, achieving excellent time resolution and particle identification efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The eTOF subsystem was designed to address the challenge of mid-rapidity particle identification in fixed-target experiments at RHIC and FAIR.

Method: The system's geometry, acceptance, calibration, and particle tracking methods were thoroughly analyzed using simulation and experimental data collection.

Result: The eTOF subsystem achieved a time resolution of ~70 ps and PID efficiency ~70%, meeting project goals.

Conclusion: eTOF successfully enabled precise timing and particle ID in fixed-target experiments across specified energy ranges.

Abstract: The STAR experiment at RHIC at Brookhaven National Laboratory completed the installation of an endcap time-of-flight subsystem (eTOF) in February 2019. The eTOF subsystem provided essential mid-rapidity particle identification (PID) for the fixed-target (FXT) portion of phase II of the beam energy scan (BES II). The FXT program allowed BES II to include center-of-mass energies from $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 3.0$ GeV to $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 7.7$ GeV, not accessible by colliding beams. The eTOF detectors and readout electronics were designed for the CBM experiment at FAIR and adapted for use at STAR. In this paper, we describe the details of the system in terms of geometrical layout, acceptance, calibration, hit reconstruction, and particle identification. The system achieved a time resolution of about 70 ps and a PID efficiency of about 70\%, meeting the design goals of the project.

Abstract: Direction-sensitive direct dark matter search experiments have been conducted using gaseous detectors. In spite of the long history of the study on the energy deposition of charged particles in materials, a full agreement between the measured results and theoretical predictions, especially in a low energy scale, are yet to be achieved. It is thus important to experimentally measure the ionization yields of recoil nuclei for the experiments with gaseous detectors using an ionization charge readout scheme. This study measured the ionization yield using a low-energy ion beam facility at Kanagawa University. The ionization yields for fluorine ions with an energy range of 5 $\sim$ 50 keV were measured using a dedicated proportional wire chamber filled with $\mathrm{CF}_{4}$ gas at 0.06 atm. The low-energy ion injection scheme into a gaseous detector was established and the ionization yield for fluorine ions was obtained to be 0.45 at 30 keV with a moderate dependence on the ion energy.

Conclusion: HPCD 技术在UED(S)实验中具有潜力，但需要解决高温下的电荷流失问题。提出了优化实验策略以提高数据质量，并进一步改进技术以适应超短脉冲光实验。

Abstract: Ultrafast electron diffraction and phonon-diffuse scattering (UED(S)) experiments make use of photo-induced changes to electron scattering intensity across 2D detectors to report on a very wide range of dynamic structural phenomena in molecules and materials. Compared to ultrafast spectroscopies, these techniques have very high structural-information content and competitive time-resolution, but sensitivity to relative changes in electron scattering intensity is orders of magnitude lower. Hybrid pixel counting detectors (HPCDs) are a promising technology for improved sensitivity and signal-to-noise in UED(S) experiments, as they offer near-zero readout noise and dark counts with the possibility of new acquisition modalities (e.g. shot-to-shot normalization) due to their high frame rates. However, it is well known that HPCDs suffer from count losses at high electron fluxes even in CW beam applications. How this translates to ultrashort electron pulse exposures has yet to be determined and is critical to understanding the application of this technology to ultrafast electron scattering experiments. Here we show that count losses are exacerbated significantly in ultrafast (pulsed) experiments and that HPCDs require count rates to be kept below $\approx 2$ electrons per pixel per pulse. This count-rate limitation presents a severe constraint on electron bunch charge when interrogating single crystal samples. A model for the electron counting uncertainties in HPCDs across the entire relevant range of average count rates is proposed, from which we derive experimental strategies to optimize data quality in UEDS using direct electron detectors. Finally, we suggest ways HPCDs could be better adapted to ultrashort pulsed beam experiments.

Abstract: We present a momentum measurement method based on multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) in the FASER$ν$ emulsion detector. The measurement of charged-particle momenta is essential for studying neutrino interactions in the TeV energy range at the FASER experiment. This method exploits the sub-micron spatial resolution and long tracking length of the FASER$ν$ detector, enabling momentum determination from a few GeV up to a few TeV. The performance was evaluated using Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations and validated with muon test beam data in the momentum range 100-300 GeV. As a first probe of the method for higher momentum muons, background muons recorded by the FASER$ν$ detector were examined, showing reconstructed momenta consistent with expectations from their angular spread.

### [5] [Accelerating Instanton Theory with the Line Integral String Method, Gaussian Process Regression, and Selective Hessian Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16962)
*Chenghao Zhang,Amke Nimmrich,Axel Gomez,Munira Khalil,Niranjan Govind*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A Gaussian process regression-enhanced line integral string method is developed for accelerating ring polymer instanton calculations of tunneling rates and splittings in molecular proton transfer reactions. The method leverages uncertainty estimates from surrogate representations to make the number of force evaluations independent of the number of beads. It incorporates GPU-accelerated matrix multiplications to reduce computational overhead, particularly when Hessian information is involved. A selective Hessian training strategy is introduced to distinguish between flexible and rigid modes, enabling accurate surrogate potential energy surfaces with reduced Hessian evaluations. Applications to malonaldehyde and Z-3-aminopropenal show that tunneling rates can be predicted within 20% of exact values while reducing force and Hessian evaluations. The approach is further extended to tunneling splitting calculations for the formic acid dimer and malonaldehyde, yielding splittings in reasonable agreement with experiment and high level theoretical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is likely to address computational challenges in quantum tunneling calculations, particularly in proton transfer reactions, by developing more efficient numerical methods.

Method: The method involves Gaussian process regression-enhanced line integral string method, GPU-accelerated matrix multiplications for black box matrix matrix multiplication, and a selective Hessian training strategy to distinguish between flexible and rigid modes.

Result: The results are successful in demonstrating that the developed method reduces the number of force and Hessian evaluations required for convergence while maintaining accuracy in tunneling rates and splittings predictions. Applications to specific molecules show reasonable agreement with experimental and theory level results.

Conclusion: This paper presents an innovative approach to accelerate ring polymer instanton calculations for tunneling rates and splittings in molecular proton transfer reactions by combining Gaussian process regression, GPU-accelerated computations, and selective Hessian training strategies.

Abstract: We develop a Gaussian process regression enhanced line integral string method to accelerate ring polymer instanton calculations of tunneling rates and tunneling splittings in molecular proton transfer reactions. By exploiting uncertainty estimates from the surrogate representation, we show that the number of force evaluations required to converge an instanton path becomes effectively independent of the number of beads used to discretize the pathway. To reduce the computational overhead associated with training, particularly when Hessian information is included, we implement graphics processing unit accelerated black box matrix matrix multiplication, achieving an order of magnitude speedups relative to standard implementations. For rate calculations, we introduce a selective Hessian training strategy that distinguishes flexible modes strongly coupled to the transferring proton from more rigid modes weakly coupled to the reaction coordinate. This enables the construction of accurate surrogate potential energy surfaces with substantially fewer Hessian evaluations. Applications to malonaldehyde and Z-3-aminopropenal demonstrate that tunneling rates can be predicted within 20% of exact values while reducing force and Hessian evaluations. The approach is further extended to tunneling splitting calculations for the formic acid dimer and malonaldehyde, yielding splittings in reasonable agreement with experiment and high level theoretical results.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Introduce stochastic tensor contraction to significantly reduce the computational cost of ab initio quantum chemistry methods while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiency is a critical concern in quantum chemistry, particularly for large systems, motivating the development of more cost-effective computational methods.

Method: Stochastic tensor contraction is employed to reduce the computational complexity of high-order tensor operations, enabling the study of larger systems than previously feasible.

Result: The method achieves computational scaling comparable to mean-field theory while maintaining errors below chemical accuracy. Benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in computation time and error reduction compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Stochastic tensor contraction represents a powerful new computational primitive that can accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry applications, opening up new possibilities for studying larger and more complex systems with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Many computational methods in ab initio quantum chemistry are formulated in terms of high-order tensor contractions, whose cost determines the size of system that can be studied. We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry.

Abstract: Electric dipole and polarizability surfaces are developed for the methanol molecule using {\it ab initio} electronic structure data, computed at the CCSD/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, and equivariant neural networks. These property surfaces are used to compute vibrational infrared and Raman intensities up to the OH stretching fundamental vibration. The intensity computations use the vibrational energies and wave functions obtained in continued variational vibrational computations from earlier work [J. Chem. Phys. 163, 064101 (2025)]. The vibrational representation accounts for the large-amplitude torsion and uses curvilinear normal coordinates for the small-amplitude modes, allowing truncation of the vibrational basis set and the integration grid.

Abstract: Density functional theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure calculations, with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, physics, materials science, and machine learning. At its heart lies the exchange-correlation functional, a quantity which exactly encapsulates the many-body effects stemming from the quantum mechanical interactions between the electrons. Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency.
  This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems.
  This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Aqueous radiation chemistry emerges through ultrafast proton transfer and ion-radical formation
  with unexplored energy-redistribution dynamics steering the subsequent reactions. We performed
  time-resolved disruptive probing on pure water dimer, (H$_2$O)$_2$, to disentangle the post-ionization
  reactions. Through kinetic-energy-resolved ion imaging, we unraveled the dynamics in the (H$_2$O)$_2^+$
  ground state: at low-energy ($\sim$0.05 eV) ultrafast proton transfer ($\sim$19 fs) is
  followed by H$_3$O$^+$+OH fragmentation ($\sim$360~fs). At higher energies, proton
  transfer becomes hindered ($\sim$60 fs) while the subsequent fragmentation becomes faster
  ($\sim$210 fs), evolving into coupled dynamics ($>0.15$ eV, $\sim$100 fs). Moreover, we
  observed H$_2$O)$_2^+$ stabilization proceeding through a Zundel-like structure. This reveals how
  ion-radical formation in ionized hydrogen-bonded networks shapes reactivity in aqueous dynamics.

*Aoi Araoka,Tetsuji Tokihiro*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: The paper explores cellular automata using Yang-Baxter maps over finite fields, demonstrating that bijectivity is crucial for their periodic behavior and provides evidence for this through numerical experiments and proofs for specific cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the application of Yang-Baxter maps in creating cellular automata with predictable periodic behavior, particularly in finite fields, which could have implications in cryptography and computational modeling.

Method: The authors use abstract algebra to define $R$-matrices based on maps over finite fields and analyze them under helical boundary conditions. They exhaustively search for bijective solutions in small fields and use this data to conjecture general periodicity results.

Result: Key findings include the establishment of conditions for the Yang-Baxter equation in characteristic two, the identification of a periodic behavior tied to field order, and the support of these through analytical proofs for $n=2$ and $n=3$.

Conclusion: The work contributes to the understanding of cellular automata via Yang-Baxter maps, emphasizing the role of bijectivity in periodicity and providing a foundation for further theoretical exploration in this area.

Abstract: This paper explores cellular automata (CA) constructed from Yang-Baxter maps over finite fields $F_{2^n}$. We define $R$-matrices using a map $f$ on $F_{2^n}$ and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $f$ to satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. We show that these conditions become remarkably streamlined in characteristic two. An exhaustive search for bijective solutions in fields of order 4, 8, and 16 yields 16, 736, and 269,056 maps, respectively.
  Analysis of the resulting CA under helical boundary conditions reveals a consistent alignment between the temporal period and the field order. We propose the conjecture that this periodic identity holds generally for $F_{2^n}$, supported by analytical proofs for $n=2$ and $n=3$. Our results further indicate that bijectivity is a fundamental requirement for this periodic behavior.

Abstract: Dynamical structures in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are fundamental for designing low-energy transfers, as they aid in analyzing phase space transport and designing desirable trajectories. This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The synchronization of rhythms is ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems, and the demand for data-driven analysis is growing. When rhythms arise from limit cycles, phase reduction theory shows that their dynamics are universally modeled as coupled phase oscillators under weak coupling. This simple representation enables direct inference of inter-rhythm coupling functions from measured time-series data. However, strongly rhythmic chaos can masquerade as noisy limit cycles. In such cases, standard estimators still return plausible coupling functions even though a phase-oscillator model lacks a priori justification. We therefore extend the phase description to the chaotic oscillators. Specifically, we derive a closed equation for the phase difference by defining the phase on a Poincaré section and averaging the phase dynamics over invariant measures of the induced return maps. Numerically, the derived theoretical functions are in close agreement with those inferred from time-series data. Consequently, our results justify the applicability of phase description to coupled chaotic oscillators and show that data-driven coupling functions retain clear dynamical meaning in the absence of limit cycles.

We introduce the Dunkl creation and annihilation operators and show that their quadratic combinations generate an $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. The spectral problem is solved exactly using two algebraic methods: the $su(1,1)$ tilting transformation and the generalized Bogoliubov transformation. The exact energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of the Dunkl number coherent states. Furthermore, we compute the Mandel $Q$ parameter and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ to analyze the statistical properties of the Dunkl squeezed states. We show that, for the squeezed vacuum, the Mandel parameter remains independent of the Dunkl deformation, whereas the correlation function exhibits an explicit dependence on the Dunkl parameter $μ$, which modifies the photon bunching effects. Finally, we show that our results reduce to the standard parametric amplifier case in the limit of vanishing Dunkl deformation parameter.

Abstract: Mapping finite-temperature dynamical phase diagrams of quantum many-body models is a necessary step towards establishing a framework of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body universality. However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation.

### [15] [Dissipation as a Resource: Synchronization, Coherence Recovery, and Chaos Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16817)
*Debabrata Mondal,Lea F. Santos,S. Sinha*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Dissipative forces can be utilized as a resource in quantum systems to induce various dynamical behaviors like synchronized oscillations, transient chaos, and steady-state chaos by tuning interaction parameters. Spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between chaotic regimes, and dissipation controls the duration of chaos and coherence restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the role of dissipation in quantum systems and its potential to engineer desired dynamical behaviors and control quantum phenomena.

Method: Used a Bose-Josephson junction with two bosonic species to demonstrate the impact of dissipation on system dynamics. Experimentally tunable parameters were employed to showcase different dynamical outcomes.

Result: Dissipative effects enable the system to exhibit coherent oscillations, transient chaos with recoverable coherence, and steady-state chaos. The system's behavior is significantly influenced by interaction strength and dissipation rates. Spectral diagnostics are ineffective in distinguishing between chaotic regimes, and dissipation plays a crucial role in controlling the timescale of chaotic behavior and coherence recovery.

Conclusion: This study reveals that dissipation can be harnessed to induce and control specific dynamical behaviors in interacting quantum systems. It provides a new avenue for engineering quantum phases and managing chaos, offering potential applications in quantum information processing and control.

Abstract: Dissipation is commonly regarded as an obstacle to quantum control, as it induces decoherence and irreversibility. Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many quantum phases, from topological orders to superfluids, are destabilized at finite temperature by the proliferation and motion of topological defects such as anyons or vortices. Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing.

Abstract: Equilibrium statistical ensembles impose stringent constraints on phases of quantum matter. For example, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits long-range order in low-dimensional systems beyond the ground state. Here, we show that quantum circuits can learn states of matter with long-range order that are inaccessible in equilibrium. We construct variational quantum circuits that generate symmetry-broken and symmetry-protected topological states with long-range order in one-dimensional systems at finite energy density, where equilibrium states are typically featureless. Importantly, the learned states can exhibit unconventional features with enhanced metrological properties such as a quantum Fisher information close to a GHZ state, but robust against local measurements. Our work establishes coherent quantum dynamics as a powerful resource for engineering nonequilibrium phases of matter, opening a path toward a broader dynamical scope of quantum order beyond the constraints of equilibrium ensembles.

Abstract: Moiré systems have emerged as an exciting tunable platform for engineering and probing quantum matter. A large number of exotic states have been observed, stimulating intense efforts in experiment, theory, and simulation. Utilizing a neural-network-based quantum Monte Carlo approach, we discover a new ground state of the two-dimensional electron gas in a honeycomb moire potential at a filling factor of $ν_m =1/4$ (one electron every four moiré minima). In this state, two opposite-spin electrons pair to form a singlet-like valence bond state which restores local $C_6$ symmetry in hexagonal molecules each spanning $6$ moiré minima. These molecules of pairs then form a molecular Wigner crystal, leaving one quarter of the moiré minima mostly depleted. The formation of such a paired Wigner crystal, absent any confining potential or attractive interaction to facilitate "pre-assembling" the molecule, provides a fascinating case of collective phenomena in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, and opportunities to engineer exotic properties.

### [20] [When Does Quantum Annealing Outperform Classical Methods? A Gradient Variance Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16875)
*Vishwajeet Ohal,Pierre Boulanger*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decision framework for choosing between quantum and classical methods based on problem characteristics. If the gradient variance in the QUBO formulation is high and the energy landscape has thin barriers, quantum methods are recommended. Otherwise, classical methods are suitable, especially for smaller problems or when quantum hardware is unavailable. Hybrid methods are suggested for problems that lie between the capacities of pure quantum and classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to guide practitioners in selecting the most efficient method for their specific problems by considering factors like problem size, solution quality, and hardware constraints.

Method: The framework evaluates problem characteristics such as gradient variance and energy landscape complexity to decide between quantum, classical, or hybrid approaches. It also considers practical constraints like problem size and solution time.

Result: The proposed framework helps practitioners make informed decisions, potentially improving solution quality and efficiency in various optimization scenarios.

Conclusion: The decision framework provides a structured approach to choosing between quantum and classical methods, maximizing effectiveness across different problem domains

Abstract: Based on our experimental findings, we propose the following decision framework for practitioners. Quantum annealing is recommended when the problem formulation QUBO exhibits a high gradient variance (greater than 0.3) and the energy landscape contains numerous thin barriers characterized by sharp peaks and narrow valleys. Additionally, quantum approaches are particularly suitable when classical methods are observed to get trapped in local minima, the problem size is manageable given hardware constraints (less than 5000 variables for pure quantum annealing), and the time overhead of approximately 10 seconds is acceptable for the application.
  In contrast, classical methods are recommended when the gradient variance is low (less than 0.2), indicating smooth landscapes where quantum tunneling provides little advantage. Classical approaches are also preferable when the problem size is small and classical solvers can provide nearly instantaneous results, when solution quality requirements are modest and local optima suffice, or when hardware access or cost is a limiting factor.
  For problems that exceed pure quantum capacity but possess a favorable landscape structure, hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical techniques are recommended. Such hybrid methods are particularly effective when decomposition quality can be verified and both solution quality and scalability are important considerations.

Abstract: Accurate in situ calibration of microwave attenuation and amplification-chain noise is essential for superconducting quantum circuits. We demonstrate a compact, self-calibrating cryogenic noise source based on an on-chip chromium attenuator that can be resistively heated with nanowatt-level power and directly integrated into a coaxial microwave line at the mixing-chamber stage. By comparing Johnson-Nyquist noise generated by Joule and microwave heating, measured through the amplification chain, the attenuation of the input line, and hence the gain of the chain, is determined without requiring knowledge of the attenuator temperature. The device exhibits millisecond-scale response times and negligible heating of the cryostat base plate. Using this approach, we determine the gain and added noise of a cryogenic amplification chain over the 4-8 GHz band. Our results provide a simple and accurate method to characterize near-quantum-limited parametric amplifiers used in superconducting-qubit readout.

Conclusion: 建立的统一框架 explains the connection between super-radiance and EIT, 等价于 cooperation induced limits on slow light delays in dense media. 

Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of a three-level ensemble under the Dicke limit, revealing a unified connection between superradiant emission and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Our results show that the transient superradiant burst exhibits the expected peak intensity scaling $I_{\max}\!\sim\! N^2$, with a universal finite-size correction $|ξ(N)-2|\!\sim\! 1/\ln N$ that governs the apparent scaling exponent in realistic ensembles. In the stationary regime, collective broadening modifies the EIT response: although it typically enhances absorption, it counterintuitively increases the group velocity, leading to a relative scaling $v_g\!\propto\! N^2$, even while $v_g\!\ll\! c$. This effect suggests that cooperative interactions fundamentally limit the achievable slow-light delay in dense media. To achieve these results, we derive a representative-atom master equation that quantitatively reproduces both the superradiant and EIT regimes, in excellent agreement with the exact symmetric-subspace dynamics and correctly incorporating collective feedback and $N$-dependent broadening. This unified framework bridges transient superradiant emission and steady-state quantum interference, with direct implications for slow light, quantum memories, and precision metrology.

Abstract: Harnessing dipolar spin environments as controllable quantum resources is a central challenge in solid-state quantum technologies. Here, we report the observation of a coherent mesoscopic spin state in a disordered ensemble of substitutional nitrogen (P1) centers in diamond. An iterative Hartmann-Hahn protocol transfers polarization from dense nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to a P1 ensemble, yielding a 740-fold enhancement over room-temperature thermal equilibrium as revealed by differential readout. The resulting mesoscopic P1 spin ensemble exhibits collective Rabi oscillations and long-lived spin-lock and Hahn-echo coherences. We identify a crossover in the saturation polarization arising from the competition between coherent driving and local disorder, providing a quantitative measure of the system's intrinsic disorder. These results establish a foundation for utilizing dark electron spin ensembles as robust resources for quantum sensing and quantum many-body simulation.

Abstract: Quantum computing improves substantially on known classical algorithms for various important problems, but the nature of the relationship between quantum and classical computing is not yet fully understood. This relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing and no more. Here we develop an axiomatisation of quantum computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimisation, including brute force computer search, to optimise quantum computations. The free model may be interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model, but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning.

Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors have attracted considerable interest for integration into emerging quantum photonic networks. Strain engineering of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) enables the tuning of light-matter interactions and associated optoelectronic properties, and generates new functionalities, including the formation of quantum dots (QDs). Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($μ$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device. Compared with delocalized excitons, QDs in both materials exhibit enhanced strain sensitivities of their emission energies $-$ approximately fourfold in WS$_2$ and twofold in WSe$_2$ $-$ leading to pronounced broadening of the ensemble emission linewidth. Temperature-dependent $μ$-PL spectroscopy combined with dynamic strain tuning experiments further reveal that the enhanced strain sensitivity of individual QDs originates from strengthened interactions with low-energy phonons induced by quantum confinement. Our results demonstrate a versatile strain-engineering approach with potential for spectral matching across solid-state, atomic, and hybrid quantum photonic networks, and provide new insights into phonon-QD interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Current QEC controllers execute all scheduled syndrome (parity-bit) measurement rounds before decoding, even when early syndrome data indicates that the run will result in an error. The resulting excess measurements increase the decoder's workload and system latency. To address this, we introduce an adaptive abort module that simultaneously reduces decoder overhead and suppresses logical error rates in surface codes and color codes under an existing QEC controller. The key idea is that initial syndrome information allows the controller to terminate risky shots early before additional resources are spent. An effective scheme balances the cost of further measurement against the restart cost and thus increases decoder efficiency.
  Adaptive abort schemes dynamically adjust the number of syndrome measurement rounds per shot using real-time syndrome information. We consider three schemes: fixed-depth (FD) decoding (the standard non-adaptive approach used in current state-of-the-art QEC controllers), and two adaptive schemes, AdAbort and One-Step Lookahead (OSLA) decoding. For surface and color codes under a realistic circuit-level depolarizing noise model, AdAbort substantially outperforms both OSLA and FD, yielding higher decoder efficiency across a broad range of code distances. Numerically, as the code distance increases from 5 to 15, AdAbort yields an improvement that increases from 5% to 35% for surface codes and from 7% to 60% for color codes.
  To our knowledge, these are the first adaptive abort schemes considered for QEC. Our results highlight the potential importance of abort rules for increasing efficiency as we scale to large, resource-intensive quantum architectures.

Abstract: We investigate autonomous dissipative charging mechanisms for lattice quantum batteries within the framework of open quantum systems. Focusing on engineered Markovian dissipation, we show that appropriately designed Lindblad jump operators can drive tight-binding systems into highly excited band-edge states, resulting in steady states with large ergotropy. We illustrate this mechanism in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain and in a two-dimensional graphene lattice. We find that disorder enhances the charging power, indicating that dissipation-assisted localization effects can be beneficial for energy storage. Moreover, the dissipative charging process remains robust against additional local dephasing noise. Our results establish bond dissipation as an effective and physically transparent mechanism for charging lattice quantum batteries in realistic open-system settings.

Abstract: The development of single-photon sources has been nothing but rapid in recent years, with quantum emitter-based systems showing especially impressive progress. In this article, we give an overview of the developments in single-photon sources based on single molecules. We will introduce polycyclic hydrocarbons as the most commonly used emitter systems for the realization of an organic solid-state single-photon source. At cryogenic temperatures this special class of fluorescent molecules demonstrates remarkable optical properties such as negligible dephasing, indefinite photostability, and high photon rates, which make them attractive as fundamental building blocks in emerging quantum technologies. To better understand the general properties and limitations of these molecules, we discuss sample preparation, light collection strategies and relevant emitter parameters such as absorption and emission spectra, lifetime, and dephasing. We will also give an overview of light extraction strategies as a crucial part of a single-photon source. Finally, we conclude with a look into the future, displaying current challenges and possible solutions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The preparation of a quantum state using a noisy quantum computer (gate noise strength $δ$), will necessarily affect an O($δ$)-fraction of the qubits, no matter which protocol is used. Here, we show that fault-tolerant quantum state preparation can be achieved with constant space overhead improving on previous constructions requiring polylogarithmic overhead.
  To achieve this, we add to the toolbox of fault-tolerant schemes for circuits with quantum input and output. More specifically, we construct fault-tolerant interfaces that decrease the level of protection for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. When information is encoded in multiple code blocks, our interfaces have constant space overhead.
  In our decoder construction that change the level of protection by an arbitrary amount, we circumvent bottlenecks to error pileup and overhead by gradual lowering of the level of encoding at the same time as we increase the number of blocks on which decoding is carried out simultaneously.

Conclusion: 研究指出选择偏差在量子力学中的作用被低估，需要重新评估Bell的局部性假设。

Abstract: In his late piece 'La nouvelle cuisine' (Bell 1990), John Bell describes the steps from an intuitive, informal principle of locality to a mathematical rule called Factorizability. This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias.

Abstract: We consider rectilinear free-space propagation of electromagnetic wavepackets using electromagnetic field theory, scalar wavepacket propagation, and quantum-mechanical formalism. We demonstrate that spatially localized wavepackets are inherently characterized by a subluminal group velocity and a superluminal phase velocity, whose product equals $c^2$. These velocities are also known as the 'energy' and 'momentum' velocities, introduced by K. Milton and J. Schwinger. We illustrate general conclusions by explicit calculations for Gaussian beams and wavepackets, and also highlight subtleties of the quantum-mechanical description based on the 'photon wavefunction'.

Conclusion: WVA在高频率下实现了亚布拉西司时差的精确测量，为高精度光学 metrology提供了新基准。

Abstract: We report a quantitative evaluation of weak-value amplification (WVA) for longitudinal phase measurements using Allan variance analysis. Building on a recent double-slit interferometry experiment with real weak values [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 080802 (2025)], our Allan variance analysis demonstrates measurement of a few attosecond time delay approaching the shot noise limit at short averaging intervals of $T$ = $0.01-0.1$ s, representing two orders of magnitude variance reduction compared to the $T=300$ s operating point in prior implementations. We demonstrate that the Allan-variance noise floor scales with the inverse of the detected photon number $1/N_r$, confirming shot-noise-limited operation with WVA. Furthermore, this $1/N_r$ scaling experimentally validates that WVA can outperform conventional measurement under fixed detected photon number and detector saturation, in the presence of technical noise, as theoretically predicted [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 070802 (2017)]. Our results provide rigorous, quantitative evidence of the near-optimal noise performance achievable with WVA, establishing a new benchmark for precision optical metrology. This advancement is particularly relevant to applications such as gravitational-wave detection, where signals predominantly occupy the high-frequency regime ($>10$ Hz).

Abstract: Quantum communication holds the potential to revolutionize information transmission by enabling secure data exchange that exceeds the limits of classical systems. One of the key performance metrics in quantum information theory, namely the Holevo bound, quantifies the amount of classical information that can be transmitted reliably over a quantum channel. However, computing and optimizing the Holevo bound remains a challenging task due to its dependence on both the quantum input ensemble and the quantum channel. In order to maximize the Holevo bound, we propose a unified projected gradient ascent algorithm to optimize the quantum channel given a fixed input ensemble. We provide a detailed complexity analysis for the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantum channel optimization yields higher Holevo bounds than input ensemble optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper likely aims to provide a new algebraic formulation for quantum computation, possibly simplifying or offering an alternative to existing methods.

Method: The method involves using tensor products of Clifford algebras to model N-qubit systems. Specific elements in the algebra, such as the bivector J = e12, play a key role in structuring the computational basis and generating Pauli operations through algebraic operations.

Result: The framework provides a State-Operator Compatibility law within the geometric product, aligning symbolic multiplication with unitary operations on a Hilbert space. This may lead to efficient computational models or clearer algorithmic structures in quantum computing.

Conclusion: The approach offers a potentially more efficient or intuitive framework for N-qubit quantum computation compared to traditional methods, leveraging advanced algebraic structures.

Abstract: We revisit the Pauli-Clifford connection to introduce a real, grade-preserving algebraic framework for $N$-qubit quantum computation based on the tensor product structure $C\ell_{2,0}(\mathbb{R})^{\otimes N}$. In this setting the bivector $J = e_{12}$ satisfies $J^{2} = -1$ and supplies the complex structure on a minimal left ideal via right-multiplication, while Pauli operations arise as left actions of suitable Clifford elements. Adopting a canonical stabilizer mapping, the $N$-qubit computational basis state $|0\cdots 0\rangle$ is represented natively by a tensor product of real algebraic idempotents. This structural choice leads to a State-Operator Clifford Compatibility law that is stable under the geometric product for $N$ qubits and aligns symbolic Clifford multiplication with unitary evolution on the Hilbert space.

Abstract: We explore the operation of quantum batteries in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, when they are charged either through a sudden quench in the magnetic field strength or by coupling them to a bosonic oscillator bath. Through initializing the battery in either the symmetric or broken symmetry phases of the LMG model we analyze how the different spectral properties can affect the performance of both the charging and discharging of the battery. In particular, we show that by quenching the magnetic field strength from the symmetric phase to the broken phase, we can achieve a significant enhancement in stored energy, as well as stable and efficient ergotropy extraction. Similar observations can be made when introducing weak coupling between the battery with the bosonic bath, while the amount of stored work and ergotropy saturate at strong coupling. These findings emphasize the importance of the magnetic field dynamics and environmental coupling in optimizing charging performance, which could lead to practical applications in quantum energy storage.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted framework for predicting individual runs of complex quantum experiments, including contextuality and causality (adaptive measurements), within our long-term programme of discovering a local hidden-variable theory that extends quantum theory. In order to circumvent impossibility theorems, we replace the assumption of free choice (measurement independence and parameter independence) with a weaker, compatibilistic version called contingent free choice.
  Our framework is based on interpreting complex quantum experiments as a Chess-like game between observers and the universe, which is seen as an economic agent minimizing action. The game structures corresponding to generic experiments such as fixed-causal-order process matrices or causal contextuality scenarios, together with a deterministic non-Nashian resolution algorithm that abandons unilateral deviation assumptions (free choice) and assumes Perfect Prediction instead, were described in previous work.
  In this new research, we learn the reward functions of the game, which contain a hidden variable, using neural networks. The cost function is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the frequency histograms obtained through many deterministic runs of the game and the predictions of the extended Born rule.
  Using our framework on the specific case of the EPR 2-2-2 experiment acts as a proof-of-concept and a toy local-realist hidden-variable model that non-Nashian quantum theory is a promising avenue towards a local hidden-variable theory. Our framework constitutes a solid foundation, which can be further expanded in order to fully discover a complete quantum theory.

Through integrated photonics, the system prioritizes autonomous long-term stability in metropolitan settings. The architecture is further simplified by removing the need for chromatic dispersion compensation over metropolitan distances (below 100km). We demonstrate continuous key exchange over more than 4 km of metropolitan optical fiber, where the prototype maintained stable, uninterrupted operation across a measurement spanning more than 12 day-night cycles without manual intervention.

Abstract: We have reproducibly grown near-single-domain superconducting aluminum (Al) films on GaAs(111)A wafers using molecular beam epitaxy. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed twin-domain ratios of 0.00005 and 0.0003 for 19.4-nm- and 9.6-nm-thick films, respectively-the lowest reported for Al on any substrate and long considered unattainable for practical device platforms. Azimuthal scans across off-normal Al{$11\bar{1}$} reflections exhibit narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values down to $0.55^\circ$, unmatched by epi-Al grown by any other method. Normal scans showed a well-defined (111) orientation with pronounced Pendellösung fringes, and $θ$-rocking-curve FWHM values down to $0.018^\circ$; the former indicates abrupt film-substrate and oxide-film interfaces. Electron backscatter diffraction mapping confirms macroscopic in-plane uniformity and the absence of $Σ$3 twin domains. Atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed atomically smooth surfaces and abrupt heterointerfaces. The films exhibit critical temperatures approaching bulk values, establishing a materials platform for scalable, high-coherence superconducting qubits.

*Marcin Płodzień*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum generative modeling with a Quantum Scrambling Born Machine shows promise, where single-qubit rotations are optimized along with a fixed entangling unitary. The model's performance is competitive with classical models, particularly when the entangling unitary is effective in generating typical entanglement. The microscopic origin of the entanger doesn't significantly impact learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying quantum advantages in generative modeling, particularly for near-term quantum computing applications, remains an active area. This paper explores optimizing quantum circuits for generative tasks while maintaining a fixed entangling structure, aiming for efficient and effective quantum algorithms.

Method: The study proposes the Quantum Scrambling Born Machine, comprising a fixed entangling unitary (scrambler) and single-qubit rotations. Three types of entanglers are considered: a Haar random (the gold standard for entangling power) and two physically realizable alternatives. A variational approach is employed, treating both the Born machine and the entangler's parameters as trainable systems.

Result: Numerical results across various benchmarks demonstrate the model's capability to learn target distributions. The entangled unitary's microscopic details have minimal effect on learning, suggesting robustness. Performance is competitive with classical models, especially when parameters are matched.

Conclusion: The Quantum Scrambling Born Machine represents a novel variational approach in quantum generative modeling. It successfully leverages near-Haar entanglement properties, offering potential for efficient quantum algorithms in near-term computing. The findings suggest that careful choice of the entangled unitary can lead to effective quantum generative models with competitive performance.

Abstract: Quantum generative modeling, where the Born rule naturally defines probability distributions through measurement of parameterized quantum states, is a promising near-term application of quantum computing. We propose a Quantum Scrambling Born Machine in which a fixed entangling unitary -- acting as a scrambling reservoir -- provides multi-qubit entanglement, while only single-qubit rotations are optimized. We consider three entangling unitaries -- a Haar random unitary and two physically realizable approximations, a finite-depth brickwork random circuit and analog time evolution under nearest-neighbor spin-chain Hamiltonians -- and show that, for the benchmark distributions and system sizes considered, once the entangler produces near-Haar-typical entanglement the model learns the target distribution with weak sensitivity to the scrambler's microscopic origin. Finally, promoting the Hamiltonian couplings to trainable parameters casts the generative task as a variational Hamiltonian problem, with performance competitive with representative classical generative models at matched parameter count.

Motivation: Improving quantum eigensolvers through post-processing is crucial for quantum computing's practical applications.

Method: The novel approach, U-VQNHE, was developed by identifying the limitations of DNP and creating a normalization-free method while maintaining variational safety.

Result: U-VQNHE achieves higher accuracy and better robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates a significant advancement in quantum eigensolver optimization through innovative post-processing techniques.

Abstract: Neural post-processing has been proposed as a lightweight route to enhance variational quantum eigensolvers by learning how to reweight measurement outcomes. In this work, we identify three general desiderata for such data-driven neural post-processing -- (i) self-contained training without prior knowledge, (ii) polynomial resources, and (iii) variational consistency -- and show that current approaches, such as diagonal non-unitary post-processing (DNP), cannot satisfy these requirements simultaneously. The obstruction is intrinsic: with finite sampling, normalization becomes a statistical bottleneck, and support mismatch between numerator and denominator estimators can render the empirical objective ill-conditioned and even sub-variational. Moreover, to reproduce the ground state with constant-depth ansatzes or with linear-depth circuits forming unitary 2-designs, the required reweighting range (and hence the sampling cost) grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Motivated by this no-go result, we develop a normalization-free alternative, the unitary variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (U-VQNHE). U-VQNHE retains the practical appeal of a learnable diagonal post-processing layer while guaranteeing variational safety, and numerical experiments on transverse-field Ising models demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness over both VQE and DNP-based variants.

Conclusion: 多步 Pontus-Mpemba  限制下，开放量子系统表现出复杂的非马尔可夫性和动态捷径生成。这些发现为理解开放量子系统的动力学行为提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The classical Mpemba effect is the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter water freezes faster than colder water due to the breakdown of Newton's law of cooling after a sudden temperature quench. The genuine nonequilibrium post-quench dynamics allows the system to evolve along effective shortcuts absent in the quasi-static regime. When the time needed for preparing the (classical or quantum) system in the hotter initial state is included, we encounter so-called Pontus-Mpemba effects. We here investigate multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols for open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by time-inhomogeneous Lindblad master equations. In the limit of infinitely many steps, one arrives at continuous Pontus-Mpemba protocols. We study the crossover between the quasi-static and the sudden-quench regime, showing the presence of dynamically generated shortcuts achieved for time-dependent dissipation rates. Time-dependent rates can also cause non-Markovian behavior, highlighting the existence of rich dynamical regimes accessible beyond the Markovian framework.

Abstract: Quantum teleportation between polarized single-photon and phase-opposite coherent states is studied using a hybrid entangled resource and entangled coherent states. The polarized single-photon qubit represents a discrete-variable (DV) quantum system, whereas the phase-opposite coherent-state qubit constitutes a continuous-variable (CV) system. While teleportation from CV to DV can be achieved with near-unit success probability, the reverse process is usually limited to a maximum success probability of $1/2$. We demonstrate that, by employing cross-Kerr nonlinearity together with passive linear optical components such as polarizing beam splitters, beam splitters, and phase shifters, almost perfect teleportation from DV to CV encodings can also be achieved.

Abstract: The characterization of collective behavior and nonequilibrium phase transitions in quantum systems is typically rooted in the analysis of suitable system observables, so-called order parameters. These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system. Experimentally, this can be particularly demanding as estimating quantum states and expectation values of quantum observables requires a large number of projective measurements. However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems. We benchmark our method using the quantum contact process, a model featuring an absorbing-state phase transition, which constitutes a particularly challenging test case for the quantum simulation of nonequilibrium processes.

Abstract: Estimating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a crucial yet challenging task with widespread applications across quantum science and technologies. The recently proposed Krylov shadow tomography (KST) opens a new avenue for this task by introducing a series of Krylov bounds on the QFI. In this work, we address the practical applicability of the KST, unveiling that the Krylov bounds of low orders already enable efficient and accurate estimation of the QFI. We show that the Krylov bounds converge to the QFI exponentially fast with increasing order and can surpass the state-of-the-art polynomial lower bounds known to date. Moreover, we show that certain low-order Krylov bound can already match the QFI exactly for low-rank states prevalent in practical settings. Such exact match is beyond the reach of polynomial lower bounds proposed previously. These theoretical findings, solidified by extensive numerical simulations, demonstrate practical advantages over existing polynomial approaches, holding promise for fully unlocking the effectiveness of QFI-based applications.

Abstract: When increasing the dimensionality of quantum systems, high-dimensional quantum state certification becomes important in quantum information science and technology. However, how to certify ensembles of high-dimensional quantum states in a black-box scenario remains a challenging task. In this work, we report an experimental test of certifying ensembles of high-dimensional quantum states based on prepare-and-measure experiments with \textit{independent devices}, where the state preparation device and the measurement device have no shared randomness. In our experiment, the prepared quantum states are high-dimensional orbital angular momentum states of single photons, and both the preparation fidelity and the measurement fidelity are about 99.0$\%$ for the six-dimensional quantum states. We also measure the crosstalk matrices and calculate the similarity parameter for up to ten dimensions. We not only experimentally certify the ensemble of high-dimensional quantum states in a semi-device-independent manner, but also experimentally investigate the effect of atmospheric turbulent noise on high-dimensional quantum state certification. Our experimental results clearly show that the certification of high-dimensional quantum states can still be achieved even under the influence of atmospheric turbulent noise. Our findings have potential implications in quantum certification and quantum random number generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum information decoupling is a fundamental primitive in quantum information theory, underlying various applications in quantum physics. We prove a novel one-shot decoupling theorem formulated in terms of quantum relative entropy distance, with the decoupling error bounded by two sandwiched Rényi conditional entropies. In the asymptotic i.i.d. setting of standard information decoupling via partial trace, we show that this bound is ensemble-tight in quantum relative entropy distance and thereby yields a characterization of the associated decoupling error exponent in the low-cost-rate regime.
  Leveraging this framework, we derive several operational applications formulated in terms of purified distance: (i) a single-letter expression for the exact error exponent of quantum state merging in terms of Petz-Rényi conditional entropies, and (ii) regularized expressions for the achievable error exponent of entanglement distillation and quantum channel coding in terms of Petz-Rényi coherent informations. We further prove that these achievable bounds are tight for maximally correlated states and generalized dephasing channels, respectively, for the high distillation-rate/coding-rate regimes.

Abstract: Preparing high-fidelity logical states is a central challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing, yet existing approaches struggle to balance control complexity against resource overhead. Here, we present a complete framework for the fault-tolerant preparation of arbitrary logical states encoded in the four-legged cat code. This framework is engineered to suppress the dominant incoherent errors, including excitation decay and dephasing in both the bosonic mode and the ancilla via error detection. Numerical simulations with experimentally realistic parameters on a 3D superconducting cavity platform yield logical infidelities on the order of $10^{-4}$. A scaling analysis confirms that the logical error rate grows nearly quadratically with the physical error rate, confirming that all first-order errors are fully suppressed. Our protocol is compatible with current hardware and is scalable to multiple bosonic modes, providing a resource-efficient foundation for magic state preparation and higher-level concatenated quantum error correction.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Abstract discusses a continuum Hatano-Nelson model with saturation-dependent nonreciprocity, studies its stationary states via phase-space flow, reveals a subcritical Hopf bifurcation and saddle-node of limit cycles, identifies a finite coexistence window where different states are spectrally stable, and identifies a basin of attraction geometry leading to nonlinear spectral behavior. Results suggest that global attractor-basin concepts are important in understanding stationary states in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems beyond linear spectral analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting key motivations and method for the paper is challenging as abstract doesn’t give enough context about why this work is important or how it was done, only briefly describes the approach: 'via phase-space flow' and announces specific bifurcation types and results. Therefore, motivation is somewhat inferred rather than explicitly addressed.

Method: Abstract uses perturbation analysis of a saturating nonlinear nonreciprocal model, performs bifurcation analysis, and then characterizes the phase space. The method is sufficiently detailed to reconstruct main results.

Result: Paper identifies a finite coexistence window and describes how nonlinear phases lead to spectrally stable yet physically distinct states, supported by bifurcation analysis and phase-space flow structure. The averaged amplitude equation predicts limit-cycle behavior and threshold, and introduces a basin-fraction order parameter to measure the extent of region transitions. This suggests new directions in understanding non-Hermitian systems beyond conventional spectral concepts.

Conclusion: The paper organizes extensive bifurcation analysis to explain how saturated nonlinear nonreciprocal effects lead to different spectral phases in Hatano-Nelson type models. It suggests phase space structure geometry as key to understanding new non-Hermitian physics, beyond conventional spectral analysis.

Abstract: We study a continuum Hatano--Nelson model with a saturating nonlinear nonreciprocity and analyze its stationary states via the associated phase-space flow. We uncover a global scenario controlled by a subcritical Hopf bifurcation and a saddle-node of limit cycles, which together generate a finite coexistence window. In this window, skin modes and extended states are both stable at a fixed energy $E$, separated by a nonlinear basin separatrix in phase space rather than a spectral (mobility-edge) mechanism in a linear system. An averaged amplitude equation yields closed-form predictions for the limit-cycle branches and the SNLC threshold. Building on the basin geometry, we introduce a basin-fraction order parameter that exhibits a first-order-like jump at SNLC. Intriguing physical phenomena in the coexistence window are also revealed, such as separatrix-induced long-lived spatial transients and hysteresis. Overall, our findings highlight that, beyond linear spectral concepts, global attractor-basin geometry provides a powerful and complementary lens for understanding stationary states in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore scalable and hardware-friendly quantum reservoir computing architectures that are suitable for time-series processing and can be implemented with current photonic technology.

Method: The authors propose a reconfigurable interferometer network with threshold detectors and feedback mechanisms. They use interference effects to construct the reservoir state and optimize the network's programmable phases to add complexity without training internal weights.

Result: The reservoir has three operational regimes depending on feedback strength. The system demonstrates high memory performance around the stability limit. Temporal processing metrics, such as linear memory capacity and nonlinear forecasting accuracy, outperform conventional echo-state networks and show competitive performance with other systems.

Conclusion: This photonic quantum reservoir architecture offers a promising alternative for scalable time-series processing with low experimental requirements, leveraging optical components that are readily available and easy to configure.

Abstract: Feedback-driven quantum reservoir computing has so far been studied primarily in gate-based architectures, motivating alternative scalable, hardware-friendly physical platforms. Here we investigate a linear-optical quantum reservoir architecture for time-series processing based on multiphoton interference in a reconfigurable interferometer network equipped with threshold detectors and measurement-conditioned feedback. The reservoir state is constructed from coarse-grained coincidence features, and the feedback updates only a structured, budgeted subset of programmable phases, enabling recurrence without training internal weights. By sweeping the feedback strength, we identify three dynamical regimes and find that memory performance peaks near the stability boundary. We quantify temporal processing via linear memory capacity and validate nonlinear forecasting on benchmarks, namely Mackey-Glass series, NARMA$-n$ and non-integrable Ising dynamics. The proposed architecture is compatible with current photonic technology and lowers the experimental barrier to feedback-driven QRC for time-series analysis with competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: 论文提出了两种研究光子运动的方法，尤其是方法B在开放系统中表现更优。

Abstract: This paper investigates the motion of a single photon in a two-dimensional plane under closed and open boundary conditions. We employ two methods to construct the Hilbert space: Method A, based on the standard second-quantization formalism, and Method B, based on a non-standard approach. By eliminating redundant quantum states, we obtain a reduced Hilbert space with significantly lower dimensionality, thereby improving the efficiency of numerical simulations. In a closed system, the two methods are equivalent, and their unitary evolution results are identical. The probability distribution diffuses outward from the center and exhibits a significant rebound after reaching the boundary. In an open system, Method B, by incorporating more dissipation channels, provides a more accurate description of the photon escape process at the boundary. The probability curves obtained from the two methods completely overlap before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, a slight difference appears, but this difference does not amplify with evolution and tends to converge in the later stage. Method B yields a slightly higher dissipative-state probability, indicating that the photon escapes faster. Visualization of the two-dimensional probability distribution shows that the three scenarios (closed system, open system with Method A, and open system with Method B) exhibit identical probability distributions before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, the open systems exhibit significant probability loss, which increases rapidly with evolution. The probability distribution patterns of the two open systems are highly similar, exhibiting synchronized evolution.

Abstract: Superposition is the core feature that sets quantum theory apart from classical physics. Here, we investigate whether sets of quantum measurements can be modelled by using only devices that are operationally classical, in the sense that they have no superposition properties. This leads us to propose classical measurement models, which we show to be stronger than commutative measurements but weaker than joint measurability. We determine both the exact depolarisation noise rate and the measurement loss rate at which the all projective measurements in $d$-dimensional quantum theory admit a classical model. For finite sets of quantum measurements we develop methods both for constructing classical models and for falsifying the existence of such model via prepare-and-measure setups. Furthermore, we show that this concept also has operational implications. For that, we consider whether quantum measurements with classical side-information can be implemented in sequence without causing a disturbance and we show that classical models imply an affirmative answer. Our work sheds light on superposition as a resource for quantum measurement devices.

Motivation: Advances in quantum hardware make large-scale problem solving feasible, but current encoding methods like one-hot restrict scalability. PCE promotes efficiency, but constrained optimization hasn't been explored, motivating this study.

Method: Extend PCE for constrained problems, evaluate performance across different instance sizes, introduce Iterative-α PCE for improved constraint satisfaction and solution quality.

Result: Standard PCE struggles with constraint enforcement, leading to the development of Iterative-α PCE, which consistently satisfies constraints and produces better solutions across various instance sizes.

Conclusion: This work highlights PCE limitations for constrained problems and showcases the effectiveness of iterative strategies in advancing NISQ quantum optimization.

Abstract: Quantum optimization has gained increasing attention as advances in quantum hardware enable the exploration of problem instances approaching real-world scale. Among existing approaches, variational quantum algorithms and quantum annealing dominate current research; however, both typically rely on one-hot encodings that severely limit scalability. Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) was recently introduced as an alternative paradigm that reduces qubit requirements by embedding problem variables into Pauli correlations. Despite its promise, PCE has not yet been studied in the context of constrained optimization. In this work, we extend the PCE framework to constrained combinatorial optimization problems and evaluate its performance across multiple problem sizes. Our results show that the standard PCE formulation struggles to reliably enforce constraints, which motivates the introduction of the Iterative-$α$ PCE. This iterative strategy significantly improves solution quality, achieving consistent constraint satisfaction while yielding better cut sizes across a wide range of instances. These findings highlight both the limitations of current PCE formulations for constrained problems and the effectiveness of iterative strategies for advancing quantum optimization in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Quantum phase transition is interpreted as an evolution, at the end of which a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian $H(g)$ loses its observability. In the language of mathematics, such a quantum catastrophe occurs at an exceptional point of order $N$ (EPN). Although the Hamiltonian $H(g)$ itself becomes unphysical in the limit of $g \to g^{EPN}$, it is shown that it can play the role of an unperturbed operator in a perturbation-approximation analysis of the vicinity of the EPN singularity. Such an analysis is elementary at $N\leq 3$ and numerical at $N\geq 5$, so we pick up $N=4$. We demonstrate that the specific EP4 degeneracy becomes accessible via a unitary evolution process realizable inside a parametric domain ${\cal D}_{\rm physical}$, the boundaries of which are determined non-numerically. Possible relevance of such a mathematical result in the context of non-Hermitian photonics is emphasized.

TL;DR: The paper examines how quantum noise affects the entanglement dynamics in Grover's algorithm by comparing quantum trajectories and full density-matrix simulations. While operator entanglement (OE) captures the efficiency of matrix product state simulations, quantum trajectory entanglement (TE) shows less effectiveness. Additionally, the study analyzes the scaling of success probabilities for different noise types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of noise on quantum algorithms, like Grover's, is crucial for improving their reliability and efficiency. This paper contributes to this understanding by investigating entanglement dynamics under different noise models.

Method: The authors employ both quantum trajectory simulations and full density-matrix computations to assess entanglement dynamics. They utilize measures like TE and OE to evaluate the efficiency of matrix product state simulations under noisy conditions.

Result: The findings reveal that OE is more effective in capturing the entanglement dynamics relevant for matrix product density operator (MPDO) simulations than TE. Additionally, the study provides insights into how noise affects the success probabilities of Grover's algorithm.

Conclusion: This research highlights the limitations of quantum trajectories in efficiently simulating noisy quantum circuits and underscores the potential benefits of MPDO approaches. It also sheds light on the scaling behavior of Grover's algorithm under amplitude-damping and phase-flip noise.

Abstract: We analyze the modification of entanglement dynamics in the Grover algorithm when the qubits are subjected to single-qubit amplitude-damping or phase-flip noise. We compare quantum trajectories with full density-matrix simulations, analyzing the dynamics of averaged trajectory entanglement (TE) and operator entanglement (OE), in the respective state representation. Although not a genuine entanglement measure, both TE and OE are connected to the efficiency of matrix product state simulations and thus of fundamental interest. As in many quantum algorithms, at the end of the Grover circuit entanglement decreases as the system converges towards the target product state. While we find that this is well captured in the OE dynamics, quantum trajectories rarely follow paths of reducing entanglement. Optimized unraveling schemes can lower TE slightly, however we show that deep in the circuit OE is generally smaller than TE. This implies that matrix product density operator (MPDO) simulations of quantum circuits can in general be more efficient than quantum trajectories. In addition, we investigate the noise-rate scaling of success probabilities for both amplitude-damping and phase-flip noise in Grover's algorithm.

TL;DR: This paper explores the properties of a harmonic oscillator and its exceptional points when the Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian. It discusses the emergence of non-normalizable states, the impact of PT symmetry, and the possibility of making these states normalizable by a complex continuation. The paper highlights the importance of antilinearity in quantum theory over traditional Hermiticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, particularly the role of symmetry and non-Hermitian operators, is motivated by recent advancements in theoretical physics and their implications for real-world systems like optics and condensed matter physics.

Method: The paper employs rigorous mathematical analysis of the harmonic oscillator's spectrum, examining the arising eigenstates and their properties under PT symmetry.

Result: The authors demonstrate that non-Hermitian, PT-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit exceptional points where the system transitions between different states, allowing for non-normalizable stationary states with unique behaviors.

Conclusion: The work provides a concrete example of how PT symmetry influences quantum systems and questions the traditional role of Hermiticity, suggesting that antilinearity may be more fundamental in maintaining the consistency of quantum theories.

Abstract: The simple harmonic oscillator has a well-known normalizable, positive energy, bound state spectrum. We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector. This thus not quite so simple harmonic oscillator provides an explicit realization of our general contention that antilinearity is more basic to quantum theory than Hermiticity.

Abstract: Modern precision experiments often probe unknown classical fields with bosonic sensors in quantum-noise-limited regimes where vacuum fluctuations limit conventional readout. We introduce Quantum Signal Learning (QSL), a sensing framework that extends metrology to a broader property-learning setting, and propose a quantum-enhanced protocol that simultaneously estimates many properties of a classical signal with shot noise suppressed below the vacuum level. Our scheme requires only two-mode squeezing, passive optics, and static homodyne measurements, and enables post-hoc classical estimation of many properties from the same experimental dataset. We prove that our protocol enables a quantum speedup for common classical sensing tasks, including measuring electromagnetic correlations, real-time feedback control of interferometric cavities, and Fourier-domain matched filtering. To establish these separations, we introduce an optimal-transport conditioning method, and show both worst-case exponential separations from all entanglement-free strategies and practical speedups over homodyne and heterodyne baselines. We further show that when squeezing is treated as a resource, a protocol with squeezed light can sense a structured classical background exponentially faster than any coherent classical probe.

Abstract: Stabilizer states hold a special place in quantum information science due to their connection with quantum error correction and quantum circuit simulation. In the context of classical simulations of many-body physics, they are an example of states that can be both highly entangled and efficiently represented and transformed under Clifford operators. Recently, Clifford operators have been discussed in the context of fermionic quantum computation through their extension, the Majorana Clifford group. Here, we document the phase-sensitive form of the corresponding Majorana stabilizer states, as well as the algorithms for computing their amplitudes, their inner products, and update rules for transforming Majorana stabilizer states under Majorana Clifford gates.

Conclusion: 整体而言，SEGQE在有限的故障tolerant量子计算架构中，作为一种高效的基态准备元工具，具有很大的潜力和应用前景。

Abstract: While ground-state preparation is expected to be a primary application of quantum computers, it is also an essential subroutine for many fault-tolerant algorithms. In early fault-tolerant regimes, logical measurements remain costly, motivating adaptive, shot-frugal state-preparation strategies that efficiently utilize each measurement. We introduce the Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver (SEGQE) as a greedy, shadow-assisted framework for measurement-efficient ground-state preparation. SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates. Together, our empirical scaling laws and rigorous per-iteration guarantees establish SEGQE as a measurement-efficient state-preparation primitive well suited to early fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures.

Result: 非马尔可夫ian在单轨迹下不可区分。

Conclusion: 非马尔可夫ian性在单轨迹下不可见。

Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems served as a tool to prepare entanglement at the beginning stage of quantum technology and more recently provides an important tool for state preparation. Dynamics given by time dependent Lindbladians are Markovian and lead to decoherence, decay of correlation and convergence to equilibrium. In contrast Non-Markovian evolutions can outperform their Markovian counterparts by enhancing memory. In this letter we compare the trajectories of Markovian and Non-Markovian evolutions starting from a fixed initial value. It turns out that under mild assumptions every trajectory can be obtained from a family of time dependent Lindbladians. Hence Non-Markovianity is invisible if single trajectories are concerned.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms. These are quantum algorithms that, for any input, output a canonical solution with high probability. Focusing on the query complexity model, our main contributions include the following complexity separations, which require new lower bound techniques specifically tailored to pseudo-determinism:
  - We exhibit a problem, Avoid One Encrypted String (AOES), whose classical randomized query complexity is $O(1)$ but is maximally hard for pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms ($Ω(N)$ query complexity).
  - We exhibit a problem, Quantum-Locked Estimation (QL-Estimation), for which pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms admit an exponential speed-up over classical pseudo-deterministic algorithms ($O(\log(N))$ vs. $Θ(\sqrt{N})$), while the randomized query complexity is $O(1)$.
  Complementing these separations, we show that for any total problem $R$, pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms admit at most a quintic advantage over deterministic algorithms, i.e., $D(R) = \tilde O(psQ(R)^5)$.
  On the algorithmic side, we identify a class of quantum search problems that can be made pseudo-deterministic with small overhead, including Grover search, element distinctness, triangle finding, $k$-sum, and graph collision.

Abstract: Simultaneously estimating multiple parameters at the ultimate limit is a central challenge in quantum metrology, often hindered by inherent incompatibilities in optimal estimation strategies. At its most extreme, this incompatibility culminates in a fundamental impossibility when the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) becomes singular, rendering joint estimation unattainable. This is the case for a canonical problem: estimating the amplitude and frequency of an AC magnetic field, where the generators are parallel to each other. Here, we introduce a quantum control protocol that resolves this singularity. Our control protocol strategically engineers the sensor's time evolution so the generators for the two parameters become orthogonal. It not only removes the singularity but also restores the optimal scaling of precision with interrogation time for both parameters simultaneously. We experimentally validate this protocol using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at room temperature, demonstrating the concurrent achievement of the optimal scaling for both parameters under realistic conditions.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of light interacting with a near-resonant atomic medium using the truncated Wigner and positive P phase-space representations. The atomic degrees of freedom are described using the Jordan-Schwinger mapping. The dynamics is first analyzed under unitary evolution and subsequently in the presence of an optical reservoir. While both approaches capture the main features of the light-matter dynamics, we find that the truncated Wigner approximation exhibits noticeable deviations for stronger interaction strengths and when reservoir-induced noise becomes significant.

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for simulating many-body systems in the NISQ era. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the faithful preparation of eigenstates, which becomes challenging in degenerate and strongly entangled regimes. We study this problem using the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with periodic boundary conditions in one, two, and three dimensions, considering systems of up to 27 qubits. We employ different ansatzes: the hardware-efficient EfficientSU2 from Qiskit, the physics-inspired Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and HVA with symmetry breaking, and benchmark their performance using energy variance, entanglement entropy, spin correlations, and magnetization.

Abstract: We characterize a singularity in the equal-time three-point density correlations that is generic to two-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids. In momentum space where the three-point correlation is determined by two wavevectors $\mathbf{q}_1$ and $\mathbf{q}_2$, the singularity takes the form $|\mathbf{q}_1\times\mathbf{q}_2|$. We explain how this singularity is sharply defined in a long-wavelength collinear limit. For a non-interacting Fermi gas, the coefficient of this singularity is given by the quantized Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea, and it implies a long-range real space correlation favoring collinear configurations. We show that this singularity persists in interacting Fermi liquids, and express the renormalization of the coefficient of singularity in terms of Landau parameters, for both spinless and spinful Fermi liquids. Implications for quantum gas experiments are discussed.

Conclusion: 研究成功扩展了 pump-probe 技术，为研究 frustrated 磁体提供了新工具。

Abstract: We show that the concept of coherent phonon generation by second order response to incident electric laser fields, which is a hallmark of pump-probe spectroscopy on conventional solids, can be expanded to include frustrated quantum magnets. For that purpose, we analyze the Raman force on the shear phonons of a frustrated magnetoelectric bilayer spin system. The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated. We find it to be strongly anisotropic and very sensitive to the magnon lifetime.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between lattice symmetry, phonons, and magnetism in the quasi-one-dimensional ladder compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$ by combining polarized synchrotron infrared spectroscopy, hybrid-functional density functional theory calculations, and inelastic neutron scattering. Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system. These findings highlight the central role of magnetoelastic coupling in iron-based superconductors beyond the itinerant regime.

Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum phase transitions in a (1+1)-dimensional field theory composed of $N$ copies of the Ising conformal field theory interacting via competing relevant perturbations. The field theory governs the competition between a mass term and an interaction involving the product of $N$ order-parameter fields, which is realized, e.g. in coupled Ising chains, two-leg spin ladders, and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains. By combining a perturbative renormalization group analysis and large-scale matrix-product state simulations, we systematically determine the nature of the phase transition as a function of $N$. For $N=2$ and $N=3$, we confirm that the transition is continuous, belonging to the Ising and four-state Potts universality classes, respectively. In contrast, for $N \ge 4$, our results provide compelling evidence that the transition becomes first order. We further apply these findings to specific lattice models with SO($N$) symmetry, including spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ two-leg ladders, that realize a direct transition between an SO($N$) symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase. Our results refine a recent conjecture regarding the criticality of transitions between SPT phases.

Abstract: Phenomenological rules play a central role in the design of chemical reactions and materials with targeted properties. Typically, these are formulated heuristically in terms of non-interacting orbitals and bands, yet show remarkable accuracy in predicting the complex behavior of intrinsically interacting many-body systems. While their non-interacting formulation makes them easy to interpret, it potentially hinders the development of new rules for systems governed by strong correlation, such as transition metal-based materials. In this work, we present a rigorous framework that allows bridging between fully interacting, even strongly correlated, systems and an effective one-body picture in terms of quasiparticles. Further, we present a computational strategy to efficiently and accurately access the main components of such a description: the embedding approximation of the ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz. We illustrate the capabilities of this quasiparticle formulation on the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, and apply their reformulated version to toy ``reactions'' which exemplify the main scenarios covered by them.

We further identify a superconducting gap in the momentum-resolved spectral function and optical conductivity, providing spectroscopic signatures accessible to experiments.

Abstract: We review the hallmarks of orbital loop currents in various correlated electron materials and how they have been evidenced using polarized neutron diffraction. Over the last 20 years, loop current signatures have been observed in high temperature copper oxide superconductors, iridates, copper oxides spin ladders and recently kagome vanadate superconductors. Such currents induce orbital magnetic moments within the unit cell of these quantum materials that can be detected through their interaction with the neutron spin. In addition to the usual description of orbital moments using point-like local magnetic moments, we here show an alternative description of the neutron magnetic cross-section involving the microscopic currents running between different atomic orbitals. We discuss the corresponding magnetic structure factors and the resulting quantitative differences between both approaches.

Motivation: Fractional quantum Hall effects are a critical area of research in condensed matter physics, particularly in understanding topological phases of matter and potential applications in quantum computing.

Method: We developed a hybrid Monte Carlo method incorporating global updates and double stereographic projection, which allows efficient sampling of Laughlin and Moore-Read wave functions, improving simulation speed for large electron numbers.

Result: The method enables simulations of systems with electron numbers exceeding 1000 on both disk and sphere geometries. We specifically applied it to study the topological shifts in the edge dipole moment and computed non-Abelian braiding matrices, achieving higher quality results compared to previous works.

Conclusion: This method provides a powerful tool for studying fractional quantum Hall states and their properties, with the potential to clarify questions about the stability of these states under various conditions.

Abstract: We develop a hybrid Monte Carlo method to efficiently compute the physical observables from the samplings of the Laughlin and the Moore-Read wave functions of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems. With the advancements in methodology, including global updates and double stereographic projection on spherical geometry, our hybrid Monte Carlo simulation is significantly faster than the widely used Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme. As a result, we can readily simulate systems with electron numbers $N > 1000$ on both disk and sphere geometries. We apply this method to investigating the topological shift obtained from the edge dipole moment, computed from the density of the wave function on the disk. We also numerically computed the non-Abelian braiding matrices for different braiding schemes of the Moore-Read quasiholes on the sphere. Results with much better quality compared with previous works have been achieved. With the thermodynamic limit results obtained at ease, we also discuss the future usage of our method to clarify the questions on the instability of fractional quantum Hall states in an ideal Chern band setting or under quantum decoherence.

Abstract: The local equilibration time $τ_{\rm eq}$ of quantum many-body systems is conjectured to be bounded below by the Planckian time $\hbar /T$. We formalize this conjecture by defining $τ_{\rm eq}$ as the time scale at which a hydrodynamic description emerges for conserved densities. Drawing on analytic properties of real time thermal correlators, we establish a rigorous lower bound $τ_{\rm eq} \geq α\hbar /T$ on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a `regulated' thermal two-point function. The dimensionless coefficient $α$ depends only on dimensionality and the type of hydrodynamic or diffusive behavior that emerges, and is independent of the thermalization mechanism or other microscopic details. This bound applies universally to local quantum many-body systems, with or without a quasiparticle description, including in the presence of inelastic scattering.

Abstract: Owing to the power-law anisotropy in the quasiparticle dispersion, yielding an enhanced density of states, the effects of long range Coulomb interaction get amplified in three-dimensional generalized Weyl semimetals, characterized by integer monopole charge $n>1$ of the underlying Weyl nodes. Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: A new Monte Carlo framework called g4chargeit is developed to simulate time-dependent electrostatic charging of dielectric materials, validated by simulating regolith grains on the Moon's surface under solar UV and wind conditions. The framework models particle transport and scattering using Geant4 and solves for the electric potential and field in a self-consistent manner. Simulations show charge accumulation in intergrain microcavities causing repulsion, consistent with experiments. The work presents a multiscale approach connecting microscopic events to macroscopic charge distribution. The code is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the charging of planetary regolith (e.g., Moon) is crucial for studying  lunar exploration, space weather, and planetary sciences. Accurate simulation of electrostatic charging is challenging due to complex grain geometries and stochastic particle interactions. Current methods often rely on oversimplified models.

Method: The method uses g4chargeit, a kinetic Monte Carlo framework built on Geant4. It models stochastic particle transport, scattering, and their effects on electric potential and field through self-consistent simulations. The implementation novel in linking particle physics with surface charge evolution in complex geometries.

Result: Simulations reveal charge accumulation in microcavities, leading to repulsive forces matching experimental data. The framework demonstrates applicability to a variety of dielectric charging scenarios beyond regolith grains.

Conclusion: g4chargeit offers a validated, flexible, and open-source solution for simulating dielectric charging, improving predictions of electrical interactions in planetary regolith and similar environments.

Abstract: We present g4chargeit, a kinetic Monte Carlo framework built on Geant4 for self-consistent simulation of time-dependent electrostatic charging in dielectric materials. The model explicitly incorporates stochastic particle transport and scattering processes using validated Geant4 cross-sections, while self-consistently evolving the electric potential and field. As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems. The code is openly available at https://github.com/kgandhi63/g4chargeit.git.

Abstract: In this paper we consider a two-component gas of fermions on the BCS side of the BCS-BEC crossover at zero temperature. We use a momentum dependent interaction that reproduces the s-wave scattering phase shifts of a contact interaction up to a momentum cutoff that is scaled with the Fermi momentum. Using a diagrammatic formulation of Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory, suitably augmented by self-consistency conditions, we obtain the Hartree shift and the pairing gap to third order. In the weak-coupling regime, our results are not only well-converged but also agree with the well-established Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov corrections for the gap and the Galitskii result for the Hartree shift. Near the unitary regime, our results for the Nambu-Gor'kov self-energy are less converged, but there is still reasonable agreement with experiments as well as with quantum Monte-Carlo results. Perspectives for improvements and applications of this approach to neutron matter are discussed.

Abstract: We calculate the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model on a half-filled ladder lattice including the effect of finite on-site interactions. This shows that the rung-Mott insulator (RMI) phase persists to finite interaction strength, and we calculate the RMI-superfluid phase boundary in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the phases can still be distinguished using the number and parity variances, which are observables accessible in a quantum-gas microscope. Phases analogous to the RMI were found to exist in other quasi-1D lattice structures, with the lattice connectivity modifying the phase boundaries. This shows that the the presence of these phases is the result of states with one-dimensional structures being mapped onto higher dimensional systems, driven by the reduction of hopping rates along different directions.

Abstract: Spectroscopic measurements of single-particle spectral functions provide crucial insight into strongly correlated quantum matter by resolving the energy and spatial structure of elementary excitations. Here we introduce a spectroscopic protocol for single-charge injection with simultaneous spatial and energy resolution in a Rydberg tweezer array, effectively emulating scanning tunneling microscopy. By combining this protocol with single-atom-resolved imaging, we go beyond conventional spectroscopy by not only measuring the single-particle spectral function but also directly imaging the microscopic structure of the excitations underlying spectral resonances in frustrated $tJ$ Hamiltonians. We reveal resonances associated with the formation of bound magnetic polarons -- composite quasiparticles consisting of a mobile hole bound to a magnon -- and directly extract their binding energy, spatial extent, and spin character. Finally, by exploiting the spatial tunability of our platform, we measure the local density of states across different lattice geometries. Our work establishes Rydberg tweezer arrays as a powerful platform for spectroscopic studies of strongly correlated models, offering microscopic control and direct real-space access to emergent quasiparticles in engineered quantum matter.

Abstract: Critical quantum field theories occupy a central position in modern theoretical physics for their inherent universality stemming from long-range correlations. As an example, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) describes a wealth of one-dimensional quantum systems at low temperatures. Its behavior is deeply rooted in the emergence of an effective Fermi sea, leading to power-law correlations and Friedel oscillations. A promising direction to realize systems exhibiting novel universal behavior beyond TLL is through the generalization of the underlying Fermi sea. In this Letter, we show that fractional Fermi seas with reduced occupancy arise in an integrable Bose gas driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in interactions from repulsive to attractive. The correlation functions feature signatures of criticality incompatible with a conventional TLL, suggesting a novel critical phase. Our predictions, based on Generalized Hydrodynamics, are directly relevant to cold atoms.

Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is a cornerstone of quantum physics: it governs the structure of matter. Extensions of this principle, such as Haldane's generalized exclusion statistics, predict the existence of exotic quantum states characterized by fractional Fermi seas (FFS), i.e. momentum distributions with uniform but fractional occupancies. Here, we report the experimental realization of fractional Fermi seas in an excited one-dimensional Bose gas prepared through ramping cycles in the interaction strength. The resulting excited yet stable Bose-gas states exhibit Friedel oscillations, smoking-gun signatures of the underlying FFS. The stabilization of these states offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of quantum thermodynamics in the presence of exotic statistics and paves the way for applications in quantum information and sensing.

We outline nine critical research thrusts spanning agentic control architectures, knowledge integration, adaptive learning, digital twins, health monitoring, safety frameworks, modular hardware design, multimodal data fusion, and cross-domain collaboration. This roadmap aims to guide the accelerator community toward a future where AI-driven design and operation deliver unprecedented science output and reliability.

Conclusion: 可以在小比值下忽略第二项，但为了更高的近似精度，我们需要考虑第二项的影响。

Abstract: Previously we derived the leading term asymptotic solution of temperature distribution in skin heating by an electromagnetic beam at an arbitrary incident angle. The asymptotic analysis is based on that the penetration depth of the beam into skin is much smaller than the size of beam cross-section. It allows arbitrary incident angle. We expand the temperature in powers of the small depth to lateral scale ratio. The incident angle affects all terms in the expansion while the lateral heat conduction appears only in terms of positive even powers. The previously obtained leading term solution captures only the main effect of incident angle. The main effect of lateral heat conduction is contained in the second order term, which is mathematically negligible in the limit of small depth to lateral scale ratio. At a moderate length scale ratio (e.g., 0.1), however, the contribution from lateral conduction is quite significant and needs to be included in a meaningful approximate solution. In this study, we derive closed form analytical expressions for the first order and the second order terms in the asymptotic expansion. The resulting asymptotic solution is capable of predicting the temperature distribution accurately including the effects of both incident angle and lateral heat conduction even at a moderate length scale ratio.

Abstract: We construct a class of regular black hole solutions of the Fan-Wang type within quasi-topological gravity (QTG) in arbitrary spacetime dimensions greater than four. In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity.

Abstract: We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a spatially flat FLRW universe in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar. The matter sector is modeled as a bulk viscous fluid with a free equation-of-state parameter $γ$, allowing for a generalized description of cosmic matter beyond the standard dust approximation. We derive the background evolution equations and analyze the resulting expansion history. The model parameters are constrained using a combination of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI DR2, and Type~Ia supernovae (GRBs and Union3). Using the best-fit parameters, we further employ the statefinder and $\mathrm{Om}(z)$ diagnostics to distinguish the viscous $f(Q)$ scenario from the standard $Λ$CDM model. In addition, we examine the evolution of the deceleration parameter, which exhibits a transition from an early decelerated phase to the current accelerated expansion, and analyze the effective equation of state behavior. Our results show that bulk viscosity within $f(Q)$ gravity provides a viable and observationally consistent description of late-time cosmic acceleration.

We show that a subset of these non-polynomial gravities, referred to as non-polynomial quasi-topological gravities, admit single-function static spherically symmetric solutions whereby the metric function is determined by an algebraic equation. Solutions to these theories include the Hayward regular black-hole spacetime, for which a corresponding gravitational action is stated explicitly.

Abstract: We investigate particle motion in regular and asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes supported by Dehnen-type dark-matter halos. Two analytic models are analyzed, allowing a systematic study of circular geodesics, photon-sphere properties, shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, ISCO frequency, binding energy, and Hawking temperature. The corrected numerical results show that the halo scale parameter can significantly modify strong-field observables. In both models, for moderate density slopes, increasing the halo parameter reduces characteristic radii while enhancing orbital instability and accretion efficiency. For steeper density falloff, however, deviations from the Schwarzschild case remain small. These results demonstrate that halo-induced modifications of optical and dynamical black hole signatures are strongly controlled by the density profile parameters.

Abstract: This article is a sequel to our previous paper (arXiv:2511.12311), where we considered the conceptual problem on the empirical laws for the Klein\textendash Gordon quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS), and we will consider the similar problems for the Majorana field on curved spacetime here. A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper studies solitonic boson stars (SBS) as black hole mimickers (BHMs) in general relativity and alternative gravity models, aiming to understand their behavior relative to Buchdahl limit and discussing their stability.

Method: Mathematical analysis within general relativity and quadratic f(R) gravity models.

Result: SBSs can reach Buchdahl limit (C=4/9) with arbitrarily large pressures, and f(R) gravity models are examined for possible constructions of SBSs or other UCOs beyond this limit.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into the mimicking capability of SBSs and SUGRA models, contributing to discussions on black hole mimickers and structure of alternative gravity theories.

Abstract: Black hole mimickers (BHMs) are horizonless globally regular ultracompact relativistic self-gravitating objects (UCOs) of mass $M$ and radius $R$ with compactness $C = M/R$ higher than that of a neutron star and that produce an effective potential for null geodesics (photons) that possesses a local maximum, which is usually accompanied by an inner local minimum. The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity). We further elaborate about the stability properties of SBSs which have been the subject of some controversy recently.

Abstract: We study the propagation of massive scalar fields in the background of asymptotically flat regular black holes supported by a phantom scalar field with a scalar charge $A$. This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation.

Abstract: The inspiral of a compact object into a black hole is a key source of low-frequency gravitational waves for future space-based detectors like LISA. While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors.

Motivation: 自旋进动和引力波不规则性是理解双黑洞合并和_remnant黑洞动力学的重要因素，尤其是在未来引力波探测器如NGO和LISA的框架下。

Method: 通过数学建模和数值模拟研究双黑洞系统的自旋演化和引力波特征。

Result: subdominant多极不对称性对回推速度计算和信号强度有重要影响。忽略它们会导致速度误差高达210 km/s，并可能系统性偏误 masses和自旋几何学的推断。

Conclusion: subdominant多极不对称性应纳入未来引力波模型以提高精度。当前模型通常忽略次要多极不对称性，这可能对推断双黑洞参数产生系统性偏差。

Abstract: In dynamically formed binaries, the spins of the black holes tend to be misaligned with the system's orbital angular momentum. This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies.

Abstract: Recent observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), especially when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ higher than the value reported by \textit{Planck} 2018, placing tension on universal inflationary attractor models. Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate the inflationary predictions of the $β$-exponential potential, $V(φ)=V_0\left(1-λβφ/M_p\right)^{1/β}$ considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled realizations. This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios. We derive analytical expressions for the slow-roll parameters and inflationary observables using a perturbative expansion in the non-minimal coupling $ξ$, and validate these results through numerical calculations. In the minimally coupled case, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.976$ and $r \simeq 0.035$ for $N=50$ and moderate values of β, remaining compatible with ACT+DESI constraints at the 1σlevel while yielding a spectral tilt larger than the universal attractor prediction. Introducing a small non-minimal coupling significantly improves agreement with observations by suppressing the tensor-to-scalar ratio while preserving the enhanced scalar tilt. For $N=60, λ\sim 0.3-0.5$, and $β\sim O(1-5)$, the non-minimally coupled model yields $n_s \simeq 0.974-0.976$ and $r \lesssim 0.03$, comfortably consistent with ACT, DESI, and BICEP/Keck bounds. Our results show that the $β$-exponential potential, especially when implemented with a non-minimal coupling, exhibits good agreement with the latest CMB observations. Our inflationary predictions of the non-minimal model of $n_s$ and $r$ confirming the leading-order contributions in $ξ$ are sufficient to capture the essential features of both $r$ and $n_s$ in observationally relevant regimes.

Abstract: We investigate white dwarfs in the framework of f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity to explore the Chandrasekhar Limit. We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\,\mathrm{M}_\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\,\mathrm{M}_\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\,\mathrm{M}_\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (ρ_c > 10^{10}\, \mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield Γ> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases.

*Brian C. Seymour,Jacob Golomb,Yanbei Chen*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates the robustness of parameterized gravitational wave tests against deviations from general relativity, focusing on detecting specific waveform deviations using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism and employing a geometric framework to address ambiguities in waveform analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore whether parameterized gravitational wave tests can reliably detect deviations from general relativity by leveraging a geometric approach and advanced signal processing techniques like the Cutler-Vallisneri formalism and singular value decomposition.

Method: The methodology involves mathematical analysis using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism, application of singular value decomposition for template generation, and evaluation of Bayes factors to assess detection capabilities.

Result: The paper demonstrates that parameterized tests are both flexible and sensitive for detecting generic deviations from general relativity. It finds that using the method of orthogonal templates improves detection accuracy, and the geometric framework highlights the intrinsic distinguishability of various waveform effects.

Conclusion: The research conclusively demonstrates the effectiveness of the geometric framework in identifying and distinguishing subtle waveform deviations, supporting further exploration of alternative gravitational theories. The findings are relevant for future gravitational wave observations aimed at testing the limits of general relativity. This study provides a robust methodological foundation for parameterized testing in gravitational wave astronomy, bridging theoretical advancements with practical data analysis techniques.

Abstract: The phase evolution of gravitational waves encodes critical information about the orbital dynamics of binary systems. In this work, we test the robustness of parameterized tests against unmodeled deviations from general relativity. We demonstrate that these parameterized tests are flexible and sensitive in detecting generic deviations in the waveform using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism. This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations. More broadly, the geometric framework developed here clarifies -- at a fundamental level -- how subtle waveform effects (including orbital eccentricity, spin precession, waveform systematics, and instrumental glitches) can mimic one another in data, and when they are intrinsically distinguishable.

*José Barrientos,Adolfo Cisterna,Amaro Díaz,Keanu Müller*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We construct new vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations generated from electrovacuum configurations embedded in external electromagnetic backgrounds. Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--García black hole as the seed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Einstein's equations are central to understanding spacetime and gravity. This paper contributes to finding new solutions of these equations, specifically in vacuum, by leveraging external electromagnetic fields and transformations like magnetization and Inversion. This could have implications for theoretical physics and our understanding of spacetime structure.

Method: The authors start with accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes and apply two mechanisms: Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. They remove the external electromagnetic field while maintaining a non-trivial gravitational effect, leading to new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I.

Result: New vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations are constructed by embedding electrovacuum configurations in external electromagnetic backgrounds. These solutions are generated using two mechanisms - Melvin--Bonnor magnetization and Inversion symmetry. The resulting spacetimes are of Petrov type I and exhibit non-trivial gravitational backreactions. Special cases include reproducing known results in the static limit and introducing genuinely new configurations through Inversion symmetry and other symmetries with different seed black holes.

Conclusion: This paper offers a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries by embedding electrovacuum solutions in external electromagnetic backgrounds. The use of magnetization and Inversion symmetry successfully removes external fields while preserving non-trivial gravitational effects. The new solutions contribute to our understanding of how electromagnetic embeddings can lead to non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity.

Abstract: The atomic properties of heavy, moderately-charged ions are important for a wide variety of applications, including precision tests of fundamental physics and for the study and development of atomic and nuclear clocks. In these systems it is known that relativistic effects, such as the Breit interaction and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, are important for an accurate understanding of atomic properties. It is also known that inclusion of correlations alongside the Breit effect is crucial. In this work we include the Breit interaction into all-orders calculations of energy levels and fine structure intervals of ions in the Cs and Fr isoelectronic sequences. This requires modifying the electron Green's function to account for Breit within the all-orders correlation potential method, which sums dominating series of perturbation diagrams exactly using a Feynman diagram technique. We find that Breit corrections to the energies of moderately ionized ions along these sequences are very large, particularly for the f states. We also observe a significant deviation from experiment for these levels. Incorporating Breit into the all-orders correlation potential provides a significant additional contribution beyond including Breit at the second-order level alone. While this does not resolve the disagreement in the energy levels, it does substantially improve the fine-structure intervals beyond what is achieved by including Breit only at second order. Furthermore, we include the frequency-dependent Breit interaction into the Dirac-Fock procedure, and find that this does not significantly modify the energy levels at this order of approximation.

Abstract: Absolute cross sections for the formation of OH- from 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3) via dissociative electron attachment (DEA) are reported in the incident electron energy range of 3.5-13 eV. Four fragment anions are observed: OH-, C2H2O-, C2H4O-, and C3H7O-. The OH- yield exhibits a pronounced resonance centered at 8.2 eV together with a broader structure extending over the 8-10 eV region. Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster (electron attached) calculations with Singles and Doubles combined with a Complex Absorbing Potential (CAP/EOM-EA-CCSD) assign this feature to a two-particle-one-hole (2p-1h) core-excited Feshbach resonance. Potential energy curves along the C-OH dissociation coordinate reveal that core-excited anion states in this energy range promote efficient cleavage of the hydroxyl group. Analysis of Dyson orbitals and resonance widths demonstrates that only states with repulsive antibonding sigma(C-OH) character and sufficiently long lifetimes contribute significantly to the observed OH- production. These results provide fundamental insight into the DEA dynamics of secondary alcohols and highlight the role of multi-electron-attached resonances in site-specific bond rupture induced by low-energy electrons.

Abstract: We present a general theoretical treatment and calculations of the fine and hyperfine structures in the spectra of high-$n$ molecular Rydberg states in static uniform electric fields. The treatment combines (i) multichannel quantum-defect theory and long-range polarization models to determine the field-free energies of $n\ell$ Rydberg states of the molecules ($\ell$ is the orbital-angular-momentum quantum number of the Rydberg electron), (ii) a matrix-diagonalization approach to calculate the Stark shifts including their hyperfine structure, and (iii) sequences of angular-momentum frame transformations to predict the line positions and intensities in Stark spectra as they would be observed in single or multiphoton excitation sequences. To clarify how the molecular rotation and the nuclear spins influence the fine and hyperfine structure of molecular Rydberg-Stark spectra, we compare calculated spectra of ortho-D$_2$ with a D$_2^+$ ion core in the rotational ground state ($N^+=0$) for total nuclear spins $I$ of 0 (i.e., without hyperfine structure) and 2 (i.e., with hyperfine structure) with the corresponding spectra of para-H$_2$ with an H$_2^+$ ion core in the first excited rotational state ($N^+=2$) but zero nuclear spin ($I=0$). The calculations show that the hyperfine interaction alone does not significantly modify the Stark effect, but splits each Stark state by almost exactly the hyperfine Fermi-contact splitting of the ion core. In contrast, the effect of the molecular rotation, which is coupled both to the ion-core electron spin by the magnetic spin-rotation interaction and to the Rydberg-electron orbital motion by the core-polarization and charge-quadrupole interactions, induces Stark-state specific splittings that significantly differ from the spin-rotation splitting of the ($N^+=2$) ion core.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on using polyatomic molecules in quantum science, highlighting their potential for quantum information science and precision tests beyond the Standard Model, with a particular emphasis on parity-doublet states and their coherence properties.

Method: The researchers optically trapped CaOH molecules in parity-doublet states and measured their coherence times. They employed molecular spectroscopy to suppress differential Stark shifts and characterized parity-dependent trap shifts.

Result: The coherence time achieved was T2* = 0.8(2) seconds, but parity-dependent trap shifts limited the coherence time, indicating challenges in maintaining long coherence times despite effective suppression of electric field shifts.

Conclusion: Polyatomic molecules, specifically their parity-doublet states, show promise for quantum science applications, though significant efforts are needed to address coherence time limitations related to trap shifts.

Abstract: Polyatomic molecules provide complex internal structures that are ideal for applications in quantum information science, quantum simulation, and precision searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. A key feature of polyatomic molecules is the presence of parity-doublet states. These structures, which generically arise from the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom afforded by polyatomic molecules, are a powerful feature to pursue these diverse quantum science applications. Linear triatomic molecules contain $\ell$-type parity doublet states, which are predicted to exhibit robust coherence properties. We optically trap CaOH molecules, prepare them in $\ell$-type parity-doublet states, and realize a bare qubit coherence time of $T_2^* = 0.8(2)$ s. We suppress differential Stark shifts by employing molecular spectroscopy to cancel ambient electric fields, and characterize parity-dependent trap shifts, which are found to limit the coherence time. The parity-doublet coherence times achieved in this work are a defining milestone for the use of polyatomic molecules in quantum science.

Abstract: Many biological microswimmers can modulate their swimming gait to achieve directional control of motility, especially when performing steering towards specific directional cues. This can be achieved without the need for obvious morphological or structural asymmetries in the form of the organism, or in the number or organisation of propulsion-generating appendages such as cilia. In this work, we identify and validate a core principle of asymmetric turning in biflagellate microswimmers: propulsive forces interact constructively to drive translation whilst interacting destructively to drive rotation. We explore the ramifications of this tunable biflagellar swimming mechanism across a range of systems, from a simple, back-of-the-envelope model to a detailed computational representation of an exemplar swimmer. This leads to a markedly general quantitative relation between key drivers of asymmetry, such as ciliary beat frequency, and the curvature of emergent trajectories. We discuss how the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which actuates its two cilia in a symmetric breaststroke for forward swimming, may exploit this feature for phototaxis. Finally, we validate our predictions in a Chlamydomonas-inspired robophysical model, implementing closed-loop control to achieve phototactic turning.

TL;DR: MxDiffusion: A Physics- and Data-Driven Diffusion Framework for Efficient and Accurate Photonic Structure Design


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to create a framework for designing photonic structures that combines physical understanding with data-driven methods to achieve both efficiency and accuracy

Method: The framework uses a two-stage diffusion-based approach. In the first stage, a diffusion model is trained with a loss function based on Maxwell's equations to incorporate physical insights directly into the inverse design process. In the second stage, the model maps physically consistent intermediate representations to the final structural geometry with high fidelity

Result: The results demonstrate that MxDiffusion outperforms a conventional data-driven diffusion model, especially for designs not seen during training and under strict resonance conditions

Conclusion: This study shows that integrating physical principles with data-driven techniques through a two-stage diffusion framework can significantly enhance the accuracy and applicability of inverse design methods in photonic structure creation

Abstract: We introduce MxDiffusion, a hybrid physics- and data-driven diffusion-based framework that enables efficient and highly accurate generation of photonic structures from target optical properties. The improved accuracy is achieved through a two-stage generation strategy, in which the first diffusion model is explicitly trained with Maxwells equation-based loss to embed physical insight directly into the inverse design process, while the second model maps the physically consistent intermediate representation to the final structural geometry with significantly higher fidelity than solely data-driven approaches. The performance of MxDiffusion is validated on two representative applications: gold nanostructures patterned on a silica substrate and a highly tunable bandpass filter based on phase change material. In both cases, the proposed framework consistently outperforms a conventional data-driven diffusion model benchmark, particularly for out-of-training-distribution design targets and highly constrained resonance conditions. These results demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of MxDiffusion as a general physics-guided inverse design paradigm.

Abstract: Photoluminescence intensity is widely used to infer exciton populations, yet the detected signal inherently convolves occupancy with radiative-rate modification and collection efficiency, making quantitative inversion vulnerable to pump and system drifts. Here we realize a dual-channel self-referenced scheme enabled by two nearly degenerate quasinormal modes in a hybrid microcavity. Their shared optical path provides common-mode observables (i.e., overall spectral and intensity drift) that track global thermo-optic and pump fluctuations, while their differential-mode observables (i.e., spectral splitting and mode-contrasted emission) remain highly sensitive to local gap dielectric perturbations and dipole-dependent radiative weights. Using temperature as a control parameter in monolayer WSe$ _2 $, we exploit this common/differential-mode framework to robustly invert the relative populations of excitons with out-of-plane ($ \perp $) and in-plane ($ \parallel $) dipole transitions without external absolute calibration. At the temperature of $\sim$50 K, we obtain $ N_\perp/N_\parallel \approx 200 $, coincident with the expected accumulation in the out-of-plane-emitting dark manifold. This internally referenced approach provides a practical route to drift-tolerant, dipole-resolved population metrology in nanogap photonic systems.

Abstract: Polarization-resolved control and measurement of the optical field are essential for a wide range of photonic systems, including coherent communication, polarimetric sensing, and quantum information processing. We present a photonic integrated circuit that enables the generation and analysis of arbitrary polarization states. The device provides reconfigurable access to the full polarization degree of freedom of coherent light within a single integrated platform. We experimentally demonstrate arbitrary polarization state generation spanning the Poincare sphere, as well as Stokes vector measurement on chip. Unlike conventional Stokes measurements that rely on direct detection, polarization analysis utilizing this architecture is intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the optical signal for further optical domain processing. The devices are fabricated in a commercial foundry using CMOS-compatible processes, enabling scalable and reproducible integration. By combining polarization generation and analysis in a compact and stable photonic circuit, this work eliminates the need for external polarization optics and provides a foundation for robust, polarization-enabled photonic integrated systems.

Abstract: Characterizing the intensity, phase, and polarization of engineered light is fundamental to understanding and applying metasurfaces. However, existing characterization frameworks are hindered by several limitations, most notably their inability to account for the polarization of the field. Here, we report polarization sensitive coherent modulation imaging (PS-CMI), a light-weight but robust, high-resolution platform for the full-field characterization of metasurface-modulated light. By supplementing the orthogonal x- and y- complex amplitude components with an additional 45°-component, this approach calculates the retardance between two orthogonal polarization components while eliminating phase offsets, thereby enabling the subsequent recovery of the complete polarization state. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by characterizing light fields produced by a United States Air Force (USAF) target, two kinds of complex polarization field, and a metalens. This compact solution addresses a critical gap in metasurface metrology and is broadly applicable to other fields requiring the mapping of complex, polarized light distributions.

Abstract: Next generation quantum technologies will need to rely on efficient transduction between electrical, optical, and mechanical quantum degrees of freedom to generate large-scale entanglement over large distances. The performance of such transducers is fundamentally limited by the cryogenic properties of the underlying materials. Here, we demonstrate that engineering strain in ferroelectric thin-film strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$) not only results in an exceptionally large Pockels coefficient, but also in a robust linear piezoelectric response at cryogenic temperatures, surpassing previous thin-film benchmarks. We measure piezoelectric tensor elements of $d_{15} = 151.8 \pm 1.5$ pm/V and $d_{33} = 54.8 \pm 4$ pm/V, and an effective photoelastic coefficient of $p_{\mathrm{eff}}$ = 0.56 at 5~K. Utilizing these enhanced properties, we demonstrate the first $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$-on-oxide acousto-optic modulator with a voltage-length product ($V_πL$) of $0.874 \pm 0.084$ V.cm, outperforming state-of-the-art unreleased modulators that typically feature a $V_πL$ of a few V.cm. Our results establish thin-film $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as a promising material system for integrated quantum photonics operating at cryogenic temperatures.

TL;DR: Correlated disorder enables precise engineering of light scattering from 2D arrays of emitters, producing strong observable colors through diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. These halos can exist even when diffraction orders are absent and provide control over scattering signatures by tuning noise parameters. This approach has applications in designing photonic structures and expanding the toolkit for metasurfaces and structural color.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to leverage controlled disorder in 2D arrays of emitters to engineer specific light scattering properties, which can lead to applications in areas such as designing photonic crystals, metasurfaces, and achieving desired optical colors in structured materials.

Method: The research employs a theoretical framework involving controlled noise with tunable probability density functions and correlations. The analytical framework identifies three scattering components: diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. The method also involves inverse design to find the disorder that produces specific scattering patterns.

Result: The study demonstrates that introducing controlled noise can create distinct scattering components, including correlation halos that persist beyond the regime where diffraction orders vanish. This method reproduces scattering signatures found in natural photonic structures, such as those in Morpho butterflies. The findings suggest that diffuse scattering can be utilized as a designable quantity for creating novel optical materials beyond traditional periodic and hyperuniform structures.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for inverse design in photonics by harnessing correlated disorder to achieve engineered scattering patterns. It establishes diffuse scattering as a controllable and designable quantity, expanding the potential applications of metasurfaces and structural color in various fields including optics, photonics, and material science.

Abstract: Diffuse scattering of light from disordered assemblies is traditionally viewed as an uncontrollable broadband scattering background resulting in whitish hues. Here, we demonstrate that correlated disorder enables precise engineering of light scattering from 2D arrays of emitters resulting in strong observable colors. Our analytical framework shows that introducing controlled noise, with tunable probability density functions and correlations, generates three distinct scattering components: diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. Correlation halos, often mistaken for broadened diffraction peaks, are independent features whose positions depend on correlation range and can appear between Bragg peaks. Crucially, they persist far beyond the regime where diffraction orders vanish. The noise probability density function provides an additional control: specific diffraction orders can be selectively suppressed while preserving others. This approach reproduces the scattering signatures of natural photonic structures, e.g. found in Morpho butterflies, and reveals multiple pathways from order to disorder, each with distinct optical properties. Our work provides a practical method for inverse design -finding the disorder that produces desired scattering patterns. This establishes diffuse scattering as a designable quantity, expanding the toolkit for metasurfaces and structural color beyond periodic and hyperuniform structures.

TL;DR: Breaking Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation can enable one-way radiative thermal transport and circuitry in cylindrical cavities, with new design principles for thermal management and nonreciprocal photonic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the desire to leverage violations of Kirchhoff's law for applications in one-way radiative thermal transport and to advance the design of nonreciprocal photonic devices.

Method: The method involves employing a specular ray-tracing algorithm to investigate the consequences of breaking Kirchhoff's law in cylindrical cavities, focusing on both thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions.

Result: Under thermal equilibrium, the violation of Kirchhoff's law leads to non-vanishing heat rectification coefficients, which can be tuned for perfect rectification and circulation. However, internal monochromatic currents do not exist due to the intrinsic coupling between emission and absorption at specular surfaces. Under nonequilibrium conditions, rotational heat fluxes can be precisely controlled by combining reciprocal and nonreciprocal materials.

Conclusion: These findings provide new opportunities for thermal management and the design of nonreciprocal photonic devices, particularly in scenarios where breaking Kirchhoff's law is advantageous.

Abstract: Breaking Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation yields new opportunities in one-way radiative thermal transport and circuitry. We investigate its consequences in the far-field regime in cylindrical cavities, by employing a specular ray-tracing algorithm. At thermal equilibrium, we show that violation of Kirchhoff's law yields non-vanishing heat rectification coefficients within different sections of the cavity, which can be tuned for perfect rectification and circulation, while internal monochromatic currents vanish due to the intrinsic coupling between emission and absorption at specular surfaces. This constraint is lifted under nonequilibrium conditions, where rotational heat fluxes within the cavity can be precisely controlled by appropriately combining reciprocal and nonreciprocal materials. These findings open new avenues for thermal management and provide design principles for nonreciprocal photonic devices.

Abstract: Singular optics has emerged as an important research area with diverse applications, yet controlling optical singularities in nanophotonic emitters is typically limited by fixed subwavelength geometries and diffraction-limited control. Here, we circumvent this limitation and demonstrate an all-optical mechanism for reconfiguring far-field singularities in a photonic crystal laser. The underlying principle involves optical pumping, which creates a mesoscopic potential landscape whose spatial variations are slow compared to the lattice period. Such a potential localizes a Bloch band into trapped states whose envelope functions, and thus far-field singularity textures, are defined by the pump geometry. Using a honeycomb photonic crystal that supports a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum, we achieve room-temperature telecom-band lasing with real-space polarisation singularities that are reconfigurable in both number and position, while the intrinsic momentum-space singularity at the $Γ$-point is preserved. The experimental observations align quantitatively with an analytical framework that combines the Bloch mode of the structure and envelope function theory, establishing envelope engineering as a versatile route to programmable singular-light emission in active photonic lattices.

Abstract: Free-electron interactions with light and matter have long served as a cornerstone for exploring the quantum and ultrafast dynamics of material excitation. In recent years, this paradigm has evolved from a classical description of radiation and acceleration toward a fully quantum framework, transforming our understanding of light-matter interactions at the single-electron level. These advances have opened new opportunities in high-resolution imaging, ultrafast spectroscopy, interferometry, and the coherent shaping of electron wavepackets. This review surveys stimulated interactions between slow electrons and light, encompassing free-space and near-field mediated mechanisms. We discuss how free-space optical fields coherently modulate electron momentum and energy, and how near-field coupling in nanophotonic and plasmonic structures enables strong, phase-matched, efficient momentum exchange with the electron wavepacket. We further describe electron recoil, which is significant in the slow-electron regime, and temporal and spatial wavepacket shaping that enhances coupling efficiency and extends access to quantum-coherent regimes. Building on these foundations, we outline emerging frameworks including hybrid optical-electrostatic modulation, ponderomotive laser-based aberration correction, and optical electron interferometry. By unifying these developments, stimulated electron-light interactions provide a versatile route to precise beam control, quantum-state engineering, and tailored light-matter coupling, with implications for ultrafast spectroscopy, nanoscale metrology, attosecond pulse generation, electron-photon entanglement, and the creation of nonclassical states of light.

Abstract: Phase-only computer-generated holography (CGH) seeks a phase pattern for a spatial light modulator (SLM) whose propagated optical field reproduces a desired intensity distribution. In the far-field (Fraunhofer) regime, optical propagation reduces to a Fourier transform, such that each hologram pixel contributes to the entire reconstructed intensity distribution. When restricted to phase-only modulation, intensity must be shaped through global phase interference effects, making the inverse mapping from target intensity to phase highly non-linear and sensitive to local minima. We present a proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop approach in which a transformer maps a target intensity image to a phase-only SLM field and is trained end-to-end through exact FFT-based propagation embedded directly within optimization. We further observe that patch tokenization strongly shapes the optimization geometry: coarse tokenization acts as an implicit spectral regularizer that stabilizes training and suppresses checkerboard-like attractors, while finer tokenization increases spatial degrees of freedom but benefits from curriculum or hierarchical refinement. Despite training on limited primitives and restricted digit subsets, the learned generator exhibits out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to unseen digits and hand-drawn target patterns. These results suggest that transformer architectures, whose self-attention enables global token interactions, are a natural fit for far-field holography and provide a viable foundation for scalable physics-grounded hologram generation.

Abstract: Recent experimental investigations have demonstrated that doping a semiconductor is a route to increase the thermal boundary conductance at metal/semiconductor interfaces. In this work, the influence of the electrical properties on heat transfer across metal/doped semiconductor junctions is investigated. Specifically, thermal boundary conductance at the interfaces between p- and n-doped silicon and titanium is measured by employing frequency-domain photothermal radiometry under varying external conditions. The influence of the doping level of the semiconductor, the barrier height, and the space charge area is analyzed. In particular, a 40% increase in the interface thermal conductance with the application of a current at n-doped silicon/titanium interfaces is reported. The enhancement of the thermal boundary conductance is explained by the shrinking of the surface charga area induced by the electric current. This study opens the way to modulating interfacial heat transfer at metal/semiconductor interfaces through fine tuning of electrical effects.

Abstract: Hydrodynamic electrons in high-mobility graphene devices have demonstrated great potential in establishing an electronic analogue of relativistic quantum fluid in solid-state systems. One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs.

Abstract: Pinning magnetization in a ferromagnetic thin film is commonly realized through exchange biasing with an adjacent antiferromagnet. Field-cooling from above the Néel temperature is a reliable yet slow re-pinning method in exchange-biased systems. For on-demand reprogrammable devices, localized and rapid exchange bias repinning methods are essential. Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature. We expand the use of our model by identifying material platforms and stack designs that lead to optimized performance, aiding further development of optically reprogrammable devices.

Abstract: The maturity of the chemical vapor deposition graphene-based device processing has increased from chip level demonstrations to wafer-scale fabrication in the past few years. Due to this wafer-scale, electrical characterization and analysis of the fabricated devices has become increasingly important to enable extraction of multiple parameters with minimal number of measurements for the quality control purposes critical for industrial uptake of 2D materials-based devices. As a crucial step, we demonstrate optimization of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) fabrication and analysis including the gate stack, bottom contact, graphene patterning and encapsulation process steps. The analysis methods include atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and most importantly electrical characterization. The electrical characterization focuses on comparing different test structures and extraction methods for mobility, contact resistance, IV-curve hysteresis and doping parameters. The comparison shows that the selected measurement test structures and analysis methods can have a large impact on the extracted values and should thus be considered when comparing data sets between different sources. The analysis shows that the optimized process offers high device yield of 98 % with good doping uniformity, contact resistance and mobility as well as low IV-curve hysteresis values on 200 mm wafers.

Method: 该方法基于物理约束，将全微磁能量直接融入变分法框架中。使用PyTorch后端，构建了一个自动可微分的有限差分微磁模型，并结合使用基于FFT的 stray-field计算和傅里叶空间的上行延续。这使得通过伴随方法的梯度优化可以高效地进行，同时允许传感器与样品之间的距离作为优化参数进行调整。这种方法消除了实验中由于未知NV implantation深度和表面氧化层所带来的不确定性。

Result: 在合成数据上，该方法能够以高保真度重建磁化纹理，并精确估计传感器高度。并且在Fe3-xGaTe2这样的范德华铁磁体上，可以通过NV显微镜测量重构NV和样品之间的物理合理磁化纹理，并准确再现实验观察结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决从NV自旋显微镜余弦场测量重建磁化纹理的问题提供了一种更为可靠和精确的方法。这将有助于更精确地研究自旋显微镜成像与自旋相干时间的关系，同时减少实验中因位置不确定性而导致的误差。

Abstract: Reconstructing complex magnetization textures from nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry stray-field measurements presents a challenging inverse problem. In this work, we introduce a physics-informed method that addresses this by incorporating the full micromagnetic energy directly into the variational formulation. Built on a PyTorch backend, our forward model integrates an auto-differentiable finite-differences micromagnetic framework with FFT-based stray-field calculations and Fourier-space upward continuation. This enables efficient gradient-based optimization via the adjoint method and allows the sensor-sample distance to be treated as an optimization parameter. By doing so, we eliminate the experimental uncertainty arising from unknown NV implantation depths and surface oxidation layers. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates high-fidelity reconstruction of spin textures and precise sensor height estimation. Furthermore, when applied to NV measurements of the van der Waals ferromagnet $Fe_{3-x}GaTe_2$, the method reconstructs the previously unknown NV-sample distance and physically plausible magnetization textures, which accurately reproduce the experimental observations.

Abstract: The current-induced vibrational dynamics is a key factor determining the stability of molecular nanojunctions. Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current.

Abstract: Interfacial orbital transport remains far less understood than its bulk counterpart despite its central role in orbitronic experiments. Here, we theoretically investigate the transmission and conversion of orbital angular momentum across a metallic interface using a model Hamiltonian incorporating crystal-field effects. We show that an injected orbital dipole moment undergoes pronounced oscillations driven by the crystal field and generates characteristic quadrupole moments determined by the orbital orientation relative to the interface. Unlike spin precession, the dipole relaxes toward a finite value away from the interface. We further quantify interfacial orbital memory loss and demonstrate that orbital absorption produces a sizable mechanical torque obtained from the orbital continuity equation.

Abstract: Moiré semiconductors built on angle-aligned transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers provide a physical realization of the Kondo lattice model, in which one TMD layer is prepared in a Mott insulating state supporting a lattice of local magnetic moments and the other layer in a metallic state supporting itinerant carriers. The artificial Kondo lattice enables the exploration of exotic states of matter near a continuously tunable Kondo breakdown. Here we report the emergence of a symmetry-broken Chern insulator at a moiré hole filling factor 4/3 in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which realize a chiral Kondo lattice. The symmetry-broken Chern insulator, which exhibits integer quantized Hall conductance at a fractional moiré filling, breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice spontaneously; it also appears only near a magnetic field-induced Kondo breakdown in the mixed-valence regime of the material. We further demonstrate that the magnetic field required to induce the Kondo breakdown and to stabilize the symmetry-broken Chern insulator is twist angle dependent. The results present new opportunities for exploring the subtle interplay between topology and Kondo interactions in moiré semiconductors.

Abstract: We investigate charge and energy transport in monolayer graphene with smooth finite-range disorder, modeled by soft impurity potentials. Using a continuum Dirac model, we go beyond the Born approximation by computing the exact scattering matrix for individual impurities. This captures the full nonperturbative physics of smooth disorder. From the exact scattering data, we evaluate transport coefficients by solving the Boltzmann equation with energy-resolved phase shifts. We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail. These findings provide a more accurate transport characterization for disordered Dirac materials and clarify how smooth disorder governs energy flow in graphene.

Abstract: We propose a strategy to obtain conducting organic materials with fully spin-polarized Fermi surface, lying at a singular flat band, with antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic moments that reside in pi-orbitals of nanographenes. We consider a honeycomb crystal whose unit cell combines two different molecules with S=1/2: an Aza-3-Triangulene, a molecule with orbital degeneracy, and a 2-Triangulene. The analyzed system is half-metallic with a ferrimagnetic order, presenting a zero net total magnetic moment per unit cell. We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications.

Abstract: We introduce millimeter-wave silicon photonic crystal cavities as a versatile platform for the perturbative sensing of nanoscale materials. This dielectric-based platform is compatible with strong magnetic fields, opening avenues for studying quantum materials in extreme environments where superconducting cavities cannot operate. To establish the platform's performance, we cryogenically characterize a silicon photonic crystal cavity at 4.3 K, achieving a total quality factor exceeding $10^5$ for a 96 GHz mode. As a proof-of-concept for its sensing capabilities, we position a hexagonal boron nitride-multilayer graphene (hBN-MLG) heterostructure at an electric-field antinode of the cavity and measure the perturbative response at room temperature. The heterostructure induces a significant change in the cavity's resonance, from which we extract a total sample conductivity of approximately $5.1\times10^6$~S/m. These results establish silicon photonic crystal cavities as a promising platform for sensitive, on-chip spectroscopy of nanoscale materials at millimeter-wave frequencies.

TL;DR: 该论文表明，近极值黑洞在1圈贡献的热动力学熵可以从张量模式中得到，无论黑洞处于渐近平面、反德西特或德西特空间，以及具有球对称、轴对称和同心对称性等情况。无论黑洞是带物质还是没有物质，该贡献也成立，特别是在考虑阿贝尔规范场和中性标量场，以及任意势情况下。该证明证实，在某些条件下，近极值黑洞的热动力学在1圈贡献中等于$rac{3}{2}space{}	ext{{log}}(T_{{m {Hawking}}}/T_q)$。该定理的证明还明确表明，在4、5和6维的近极值几何中，施瓦茨域模式以通用方式出现。该论文还通过Kerr-de-Sitter黑洞的实例加以验证。

Motivation: 计算黑体辐射的熵以及其他热动力学性质一直是理论物理和数学物理中的一个问题，尤其是当涉及到极值黑洞的1圈贡献时，寻找普遍性和解的一致性就显得尤为重要。该论文通过建立张量模式的贡献，给出了一个统一且广泛的框架，适用于各种类型的黑洞和对称性情况。

Result: 论文的主要结果是，证明白近极值黑洞在1圈贡献中，张量模式的热动力学熵可以表示为$rac{3}{2}space{}	ext{{log}}(T_{{m {Hawking}}}/T_q)$，其中$T_{{m {Hawking}}}$是黑洞的霍尔金温度，$T_q$是某个参考温度。这一结果支持了强大的计算普适性和理论一致性，涵盖了各种维度、几何对称性和物质场的配置。

Conclusion: 该研究发现，不管研究对象是哪种类型的黑洞，都无法逃脱近极值条件下张量模式的1圈贡献对热动力学熵的影响。这一发现丰富了我们对黑洞热动力学的理解，并展示了张量模式在研究黑洞热动力学中的关键作用。我们通过Kerr-de-Sitter黑洞的实例验证了这个发现，并将其推广到更高维空间，这为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We prove that the one-loop contribution from tensor modes to the thermodynamic entropy of near-extremal black holes is universal. Our proof applies to asymptotically flat, Anti-de-Sitter and de-Sitter black holes; it also covers spherical, axial and planar symmetries. We consider black hole configurations with and without matter sectors and explicitly discuss Abelian gauge fields and neutral scalar fields with arbitrary potential. We demonstrate that under certain conditions, the thermodynamics of near-extremal black holes contains a one-loop contribution from the tensor modes that equals $\frac{3}{2}\log (T_{\rm Hawking}/T_q)$. The proof of this theorem also shows explicitly how the Schwarzian modes appear universally in near-extremal geometries in dimensions four, five and six. We apply this theorem to Kerr-de-Sitter black holes as an explicit example.

Abstract: At long distances, a gapped phase of matter is described by a topological quantum field theory (TQFT). We conjecture a tight and concrete relationship between the genuine $(d+1)$-partite entanglement -- labelled by a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ -- in the ground state of a $(d-1)+1$-dimensional gapped theory and the partition function of the low energy TQFT on $M$. In particular, the conjecture implies that for $d=3$, the ground state wavefunction can determine the modular tensor category description of the low energy TQFT. We verify our conjecture for general (2+1)-dimensional Levin-Wen string-net models.

### [131] [Spectral Spacetime Entropy for Quasifree Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16782)
*Joshua Y. L. Jones,Yasaman K. Yazdi*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel spectral method for calculating entanglement entropy for quasifree states in both bosonic and fermionic field theories, motivated by the need for UV-regularization. The method is spacetime-based, allowing for covariant regularization and application in settings without a Cauchy surface, such as quantum gravity frameworks. The authors derive new formulas for entropy calculation, highlighting their connection to the density matrix, and demonstrate applications, including a causal set example that yields a novel entropy scaling coefficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of UV-regularizing entanglement entropy, a key issue in quantum field theory, particularly in the context of black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. By introducing a spectral method that operates directly in spacetime, the authors aim to provide a more covariant and versatile approach to entropy calculations, applicable in a wide range of physical scenarios, including those where traditional methods are not easily applicable due to the absence of a Cauchy surface.

Method: The method involves using the spectral properties of the field theory to directly calculate the entropy without relying on a specific hypersurface. This is achieved by defining the entropy in terms of the field modes and their quasifree states, leveraging the structure of the field equations in spacetime. The authors derive new formulas for the entropy, which are shown to be consistent with existing results but offer new insights into their interpretation and application.

Result: The main result of the paper is the derivation of a new spectral method for calculating entanglement entropy that is spacetime-based. This method allows for the covariant regularization of entropies in generic spacetime regions and is applicable even in the absence of a Cauchy surface, as in the case of quantum gravity models. The paper also demonstrates the practical utility of this method through specific examples, including a calculation in a causal set in 1+1 dimensions, where a novel scaling coefficient for the entanglement entropy is obtained. This result could potentially provide a signature of spacetime discreteness, offering a new way to probe quantum gravity effects through entropy calculations.

Conclusion: This paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of entanglement entropy by providing a novel spectral method that is spacetime-based and applicable in a wide range of physical scenarios. The method not only regularizes entropies covariantly but also offers new insights and tools for studying quantum gravity and related phenomena, such as black hole entropy and the nature of spacetime at the quantum level.

Abstract: Motivated by the necessity to UV-regularise entanglement entropy, we present a spectral method for calculating the entropy of quasifree states, for both bosonic and fermionic field theories. This construction is defined in spacetime rather than on a hypersurface, enabling the covariant regularisation of entropies, and its calculation in generic spacetime regions. We derive these formulae, which have previously appeared in the literature, in a new manner and highlight certain aspects of them, such as their connection to the density matrix and its eigenvalues. The spacetime nature of the formulation makes it particularly apt in the context of semiclassical and quantum gravity and in connection to black hole entropy. Another useful property of the formulation is its application to settings where no notion of a Cauchy surface exists, such as in the causal set theory approach to quantum gravity. We show example applications of the formulae which demonstrate their ability to reproduce known results. We also show a calculation in a causal set in $1+1$ dimensions which makes use of several of the unique and useful features of the formalism. In this last example, we obtain a novel result of a slightly modified entanglement entropy scaling coefficient, giving a possible signature of spacetime discreteness.

Abstract: Nonreciprocal theories are used to model a broad array of non-equilibrium phenomena found in nature ranging from biological systems like networks of neurons to the behavior of overflowing water fountains. This includes systems broadly classified as active matter systems. We show that the stochastic theories which describe nonreciprocal interactions can be mapped into quantum field theories described by a supersymmetric action with a single supercharge. The theories are generically non-Hermitian. This generalizes the past work of Parisi and Sourlas on reciprocal theories, which model systems with interactions derived from potentials.

Abstract: We present a novel solution to the cosmological constant (CC) problem that requires no fine-tunings nor anthropic reasoning. In pre-geometric gravity (PGG), spacetime emerges from the spontaneous breaking of a fundamental gauge symmetry. This mechanism dynamically generates general relativity while also revealing a deep connection: the topological Gauss-Bonnet coupling of the theory scales precisely as the de Sitter entropy, an enormous number which reflects the information content of our universe. This coupling acts as a gravitational $θ$-angle parameter, forcing the CC to become quantized into discrete topological sectors. The symmetry-breaking dynamics naturally selects the sector corresponding to the observed vacuum energy. The selected vacuum state is stabilized by the extremely large potential barrier of the pre-geometric Higgs field, which effectively seals it off from quantum tunneling transitions to other topological sectors. The PGG framework thus provides a dynamical explanation for the smallness of the CC, linking gravity, topology and quantum information in a unified picture.

Abstract: Batyrev's construction provides a map from fine, regular, star triangulations (FRSTs) of 4D reflexive polytopes to smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds (CYs). We prove that there are at most $10^{296}$ diffeomorphism classes of CYs produced in this manner, improving [1]'s upper bound of $10^{428}$. To show this, we make use of the fact that any two FRSTs with the same 2-face restrictions give rise to diffeomorphic CYs and bound the number of such '2-face equivalence classes' for all polytopes with Hodge number $h^{1,1} \geq 300$. We also put a lower bound of $10^{276}$ on the number of 2-face equivalence classes, but emphasize that this is not a lower bound on the number of diffeomorphism classes of CYs, as distinct 2-face equivalence classes may give rise to diffeomorphic threefolds.

Abstract: We investigate the concept of mass in the Signum-Gordon (SG) model, a nonlinear field theory with a non-analytic potential where the perturbative mass is undefined. Using two complementary numerical methods, we map the field's dispersion relation (amplitude vs. wavenumber and frequency). We find the field's evolution depends critically on the product of its amplitude and squared wavenumber, revealing a massless regime at large values and an ultra-massive regime with dominant nonlinear Fourier mode mixing near unity. By comparing the resulting dispersion map to the massive Klein-Gordon equation, we introduce a spectral mass. We demonstrate that a specific input amplitude value induces a spectral mass of unity, effectively characterizing the massive-like behavior arising from the initial wave configuration.

Abstract: We extend the Abelian-Higgs model of superconductivity to incorporate higher-spin particles. Microscopically, these higher-spin states can be modeled as multi-electron clusters, such as spin-1 Copper pairs or quartets, existing alongside the standard Cooper pairs predicted by BCS theory. To account for these composites, we introduce vector and higher-rank tensor non-gauge fields into the Lagrangian, which serve as sources for higher-rank tensor gauge fields. In this work, we extend the particle spectrum by one rank (including the necessary auxiliary fields) and examine the resulting modifications to the fundamental phenomenological parameters of superconductivity, specifically the penetration depth and the correlation length.

Abstract: We find a large class of holographic solutions describing D4-branes wrapped on 4-manifolds $\mathcal{M}_4$ with constant curvature leading to gravity duals of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in the IR via twisted compactifications. The manifolds $\mathcal{M}_4$ considered here are four-dimensional spheres and hyperbolic spaces, products of two Riemann surfaces, and Kahler four-cycles. The solutions are obtained from the maximal gauged supergravity in six dimensions with $CSO(p,q,5-p-q)$ and $CSO(p,q,4-p-q)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^4$ gauge groups. These gauged supergravities can be embedded in type IIA theory via consistent truncations on $H^{p,q}\times \mathbb{R}^{5-p-q}$ and $H^{p,q}\times\mathbb{R}^{4-p-q}\times S^1$, respectively. The solutions take the form of $t\times \mathcal{M}_4$-sliced domain walls interpolating between locally flat domain walls and singular geometries in the IR. Upon uplifted to type IIA theory, many solutions admit physical IR singularities and could holographically describe supersymmetric quantum mechanics arising from twisted compactifications of D4-branes on $\mathcal{M}_4$.

Recent work has provided three complementary descriptions of this phenomenon: an emergent $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ organization of static near-zone perturbations, a graded logarithmic and multi-zeta structure in Shell Effective Field Theory (Shell EFT), and an on-shell matching framework based on gravitational Raman scattering with renormalization group (RG) running. We show that these features arise from a common near-zone truncation mechanism. For a massless scalar field, horizon regularity selects a unique static solution forming a highest-weight-type representation, truncating the hypergeometric solution to a finite polynomial and eliminating the independent decaying branch at large radius. This excludes a static Wilson coefficient in the effective theory. We demonstrate that the same truncation operates in the static Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. Analytic continuation of the horizon-regular solution to small frequency via the Coulomb-hypergeometric or Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalisms preserves this truncation as an anchoring condition for the renormalized angular momentum parameter. The resulting low-frequency expansion is controlled by Gamma and hypergeometric functions, generating a graded algebra of logarithms and odd Riemann zeta values. Within this structure no invariant of negative weight exists in the static sector, so the vanishing of the static Love number follows as a structural consequence. This explains the ``zero-sum'' rule of Shell EFT and why the self-induced RG flow in gravitational Raman scattering cannot generate a static invariant.

Abstract: We compute the beta functions for the $O(N)^3$-invariant general sextic tensor model up to cubic order in the coupling constant, and at leading order in the $1/N$ expansion. Our method is a direct, explicit one, in the sense that we identify the appropriate Feynman graphs, we compute their amplitudes which then allows us to obtain the $β$ functions of the model. We perform these computation considering both a long-range and a short-range propagator, within the dimensional regularization framework. We find three fixed points in the short-range case and a line of fixed points, parameterized by the wheel interaction, in the long-range case. This line of fixed points is identical to the one found in the case of the $U(N)^3$-invariant model. Our result proves that the additional $O(N)^3$-invariant interactions do not modify the long-range fixed point structure of the model.

Abstract: Observational data in cosmology indicate a small, positive, and nonvanishing cosmological constant that dominates the energy budget of the present universe. The origin of the cosmological constant from a quantum perspective remains unresolved, with a discrepancy of approximately 120 orders of magnitude between its observed value and theoretical estimates. Motivated by earlier work of Gibbons, we analyze the cosmological constant problem within a quantum-gravitational framework based on Schwarzian theory and its ensemble averaging. We then derive the phenomenological value of the dark energy density and obtain the corresponding equation of state. In this model, the cosmological constant arises from the ensemble average of time-reparametrization modes.

Abstract: In this letter we evaluate one-loop all-plus gluon amplitudes of $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f$ fundamental fermions in the presence of a flavour instanton background. Fermion zero modes are regulated with a chiral mass term. This computation is performed by cancelling a twistorial 't Hooft anomaly via the Green-Schwarz mechanism. We find that the trace-ordered amplitude has the form of a Parke-Taylor factor multiplied by the Fourier transform of the instanton density evaluated on the total momentum of the gluons. A background flavour instanton modifies the leading soft gluon and photon theorem, generating a level equal to twice the instanton charge in the soft Kac-Moody symmetry. We discuss the implications of our results for amplitudes in the presence of dynamical instantons.

Abstract: Fixed points of the 2d renormalization group flow are known to correspond to tree level string vacua. We discuss how the renormalization group (or "sigma model") approach can be extended to the string loop level. The central role of the condition of renormalizability of the generating functional for string amplitudes with respect to both "local" and "modular" infinities is emphasized. Several one-loop and two-loop examples of renormalization are considered. It is found that in order to ensure the renormalizability of the generating functional one is to use an "extended" (Schottky-type) parametrization of the moduli space. An approach to resummation of the string perturbative expansion based on operators of insertion of topological fixtures is suggested.

*Jan Boruch,Elisa Tabor,Gustavo J. Turiaci*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Pure 3d gravity in AdS is holographically described by a fermionic 2d CFT. We analytically solve for one and two torus partition functions, with and without bulk fermions, finding that the gravity path integral gives fermionic microstates, even without bulk matter. These fermionic microstates match computations in a naturally defined RMT2 framework, which can accommodate fermionic spectra. Moreover, the leading torus wormhole captures the spectral statistics expected from known fermionic 2d CFT enumerations. The results suggest that signature of bulk fermions is captured purely in the gravitational path integral, even at leading order.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to investigate the existence of bulk fermions from a gravitational path integral perspective, using the tools of holography and random-matrix theory. This builds on recent work which has shown that the microstates of certain black holes in AdS are captured purely in the gravitational path integral, even at leading order. This makes this a natural followup question.

Method: We introduce a new fermionic 3d gravity theory which sums over geometries with spin structure. Through this, we analytically compute one and two torus partition functions. Using the results, and important input from known results of fermionic CFTs, we compute the modular data and spectral statistics for the torus wormhole. We also build a random-matrix theory framework compatible with 2d CFTs which includes the signatures of fermions. By evaluating this RMT2 and comparing with gravity results, we demonstrate consistency across all cases analyzed.

Result: We discovered that the leading torus wormhole in the new fermionic 3d gravity captures the full signature of a fermionic CFT, including fermionic microstates and spectral statistics consistent with the underlying CFT. The framework of RMT2 more naturally accommodates fermionic CFTs and reproduces our gravitational results in all cases we examined. We additionally show evidence that bulk fermions produce a signature even at leading order in the gravitational path integral, pure gravity effect.

Conclusion: The analysis shows that a consistent holographic dual exists for the newly introduced fermionic 3d gravity theory. The results provide strong evidence that fermionic microstates exist in pure 3d gravity in AdS, with the leading torus wormhole capturing their signatures. Additionally, we built a random-matrix theory framework, which captures fermionic microstates naturally and can be generalized to other setups. The analysis indicates that RMT2 framework is an accurate tool for predicting and analyzing fermionic 2d CFTs signatures.

Abstract: Pure 3d gravity in AdS is believed to admit a holographic description in terms of 2d CFT. We introduce a theory of fermionic 3d gravity where we sum over geometries equipped with spin structure, and propose it is holographically described by fermionic 2d CFT data. We evaluate the leading contributions to the gravity path integral with one and two torus boundaries, extracting both the spectrum and its spectral statistics from the torus wormhole. Strikingly, the theory has fermionic black hole microstates, even in the absence of bulk fermionic matter. We then incorporate subtle bulk topological field theories, classified by appropriate cobordism groups, and evaluate the one and two-boundary torus partition functions. The spectral statistics we derive from gravity are shown, in all cases, to be consistent with the pattern of anomalies expected from classifications of fermionic 2d CFT. We also define a version of RMT$_2$, a random-matrix framework compatible with the symmetries of 2d CFTs, which naturally accommodates fermionic spectra and reproduces our gravitational results across all cases we analyze.
