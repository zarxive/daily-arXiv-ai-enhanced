Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography with fully integrated microfluidics and
electronics is presented for the first time in a CMOS chip. Chambers and
electrodes are fabricated in the interconnect layers of a 65 nm CMOS chip
through post-processing, enabling picoliter-volumes to be processed and imaged.
Tomography maps are reconstructed by reading out voltages from a 16-element
electrode array and processing the data off-chip, and sources of variation in
reconstruction are discussed. The EIT system presented in this work serves as a
proof-of-concept towards using CMOS as a platform for co-integrated
microfluidics and electronics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract expresses the interest in neutrino detection and dark matter research through mineral detectors, suggesting potential for exciting discoveries beyond particle physics.

Method: The research method involves organizing meetings, compiling contributions, and collaborating across various scientific disciplines to study mineral detector applications in neutrino and dark matter detection.

Result: The meeting updated the progress in mineral detector research, demonstrating advancements in detection methods and imaging techniques, and highlighted potential applications in both reactor neutrino monitoring and long-term natural mineral studies.

Conclusion: The abstract concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued research in mineral detectors as a promising area for future scientific breakthroughs in particle physics and cosmology.

Abstract: The third ``Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter'' (MD$\nu$DM'25)
meeting was held May 20-23, 2025 in Yokohama, Japan, hosted by the Yokohama
Institute for Earth Sciences, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and
Technology (JAMSTEC). These proceedings compile contributions from the workshop
and update the progress of mineral detector research. MD$\nu$DM'25 was the
third such meeting, following the first in October of 2022 held at the IFPU in
Trieste, Italy and the second in January of 2024 hosted by the Center for
Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Arlington, USA. Mineral detectors record
and retain damage induced by nuclear recoils in synthetic or natural mineral
samples. The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and
micro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales
relevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and
dark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as
the energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors
which record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small
mineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by
astrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A
series of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution
of these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system
and the Milky Way. Mineral detector research is highly multidisciplinary,
incorporating aspects of high energy physics, condensed matter physics,
materials science, geoscience, and AI/ML for data analysis. Although realizing
the scientific potential of mineral detectors poses many challenges, the
MD$\nu$DM community looks forward to the continued development of mineral
detector experiments and the possible discoveries that mineral detectors could
reveal.

Abstract: Multispectral imaging (MSI) captures data across multiple spectral bands,
offering enhanced informational depth compared to standard RGB imaging and
benefiting diverse fields such as agriculture, medical diagnostics, and
industrial inspection. Conventional MSI systems, however, suffer from high
cost, complexity, and limited performance in low-light conditions. Moreover,
data-driven MSI methods depend heavily on large, labeled training datasets and
struggle with generalization. In this work, we present a portable multispectral
single-pixel imaging (MS-SPI) method that integrates a chip-sized multispectral
sensor for system miniaturization and leverages an untrained physics-informed
neural network (PINN) to reconstruct high-quality spectral images without the
need for labeled training data. The physics-informed structure of the network
enables the self-corrected reconstruction of multispectral images directly with
the input of raw measurements from the multispectral sensor. Our
proof-of-concept prototype achieves the reconstruction of 12-channel
high-quality spectral images at the sampling rate of 10%. We also
experimentally validate its performance under varying sampling rate conditions,
by comparing it with conventional compressive sensing algorithms. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the application of this technique to an MSI-based image
segmentation task, in which spatial regions are discriminated according to
their characteristic spectral signatures. This compact, high-fidelity, and
portable approach offers promising pathways to lightweight and cost-effective
spectral imaging on mobile platforms.

Abstract: Photon identification in calorimeters represents a crucial challenge in
particle physics experiments, especially in high-density environments where
shower overlap probabilities become significant. We present an
energy-core-based photon identification method that exploits the distinct
compact energy core feature of electromagnetic showers through Hough transform
pattern recognition in imaging calorimeters. The method, validated through
simulations of the CEPC crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, demonstrates
outstanding performance. It achieves a high identification efficiency of nearly
100% for photons with energies exceeding 2 GeV and a separation efficiency
approaching 100% for two 5 GeV photons when the distance between them reaches
the granularity limit of the calorimeter. This advanced energy-core-based
photon identification method integrated with an energy splitting technique
enhances the performance of photon measurement and provides a promising tool
for imaging calorimeters, particularly those requiring high precision in photon
detection in complex event topologies with high multiplicity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) is
widely used at large laboratories for slow controls and instrumentation, the
deployment of a full EPICS installation can be difficult, with a steep learning
curve to new users. Taking advantage of the pythonSoftIOC module, we developed
an EPICS slow controls implementation for Jefferson Lab's Hall B cryotarget
written entirely in Python and based on software IOCs that communicate with
instruments over Ethernet. This system ran successfully, interfacing with
Jefferson Lab's full EPICS network, and we offer it as an example of the
capabilities of pythonSoftIOC to build lightweight, yet robust and flexible
instrumentation platforms that would be easily adapted for use at a small-scale
laboratory. University groups can use these examples to build complete slow
controls systems, from device communication to data archiving and display,
using open-source, mature EPICS tools and student-friendly Python as an
alternative to expensive and proprietary systems such as LabView.

*Ayse Marasli,Thomas Kornack,Casey Oware,Karen L. Sauer*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper describes a novel methodology using four optically-pumped atomic magnetometers to locate three-dimensional radio frequency (RF) sources by measuring a magnetic dipole at two different positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing advanced sensors for precise RF source localization in unshielded environments, particularly for low-field NMR detection.

Method: Using four magnetometers to make measurements of a magnetic dipole, leveraging their advantages over coils (2D plane measurements, no inductive coupling).

Result: The proposed method successfully localizes nearby RF sources with high accuracy, validated by experimental results.

Conclusion: This innovative sensor setup offers a portable, reliable solution for RF source localization, opening new applications in fieldwork.

Abstract: Optically-pumped atomic magnetometers have previously been used in arrays to
reject interference from far away sources and enable the sensitive detection of
local sources of radio frequency (RF) signals, useful, for instance, in the
detection of low field NMR signals in an unshielded environment. We now
demonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are
used to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The
methodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two
different positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known
orientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of
measuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their
environment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of
hidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer
to make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it
is to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working
simultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of
a fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are
safely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections. The
portable, as well as safe, nature of the sensor make it quite valuable for in
the field work.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rare-event search experiments require construction materials with high
radiopurity to minimise background contributions. Thanks to its high mechanical
strength, low density, machinability, and commercial availability in relatively
radio-pure forms, titanium is a suitable material for structural elements in
rare event searches. To remove surface deposits on materials used, a chemical
etching stage is usually performed. However, the chemical resistance of
titanium means that, conventionally, such etching is done with hydrofluoric
acid. Hydrofluoric acid presents serious health risks to users, and such
hazards are compounded in the case of construction in deep underground
laboratories. An alternative chemical etching using sulphuric acid is
presented. This is demonstrated to etch titanium, removing 3.7 $\mu$m of
material from the surface over the course of 20 hours. Scanning electron
microscopy with back-scattered electron spectroscopy was used to study the
surface and contamination of the titanium, demonstrating the removal of surface
contaminants after etching. The proposed method is a potential alternative to
those currently employed.

### [9] [Symmetry enforces entanglement at high temperatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20166)
*Amir-Reza Negari,Leonardo A. Lessa,Subhayan Sahu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether symmetry constraints can prevent sudden death of entanglement in many-body quantum systems at high temperatures. It proves that strongly symmetric thermal states with generic Hamiltonians and on-site Abelian symmetries retain entanglement with non-zero entanglement negativity, even under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and charge sector. The result extends to weakly symmetric thermal states under superselection rules, and fermionic Gibbs states do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement. These findings suggest that global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between symmetry, quantum entanglement, and thermal decoherence is crucial for advancing quantum information theory and the study of quantum many-body systems. This paper provides new insights into how symmetry can protect quantum entanglement in thermal environments.

Method: The authors use analytical methods to prove their claims about symmetric thermal states, considering both canonical and Gibbs ensembles under different symmetry conditions. They rely on properties of entanglement measures, such as entanglement negativity, and symmetry actions in many-body systems.

Result: The paper shows that certain symmetric thermal states maintain entanglement at arbitrarily high temperatures, both for canonical and Gibbs ensembles. Notably, fermionic Gibbs states do not experience sudden death of entanglement, which suggests that fermionic systems are more resilient to losing quantum entanglement under thermal conditions.

Conclusion: This study highlights the role of symmetry in preserving quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence. The findings contribute to the understanding of how symmetry constraints can influence the behavior of many-body quantum systems at high temperatures, offering new perspectives on quantum information in thermal equilibrium.

Abstract: Many-body quantum systems with local interactions undergo "sudden death of
entanglement" at high temperatures, whereby thermal states become classical
mixtures of product states. We investigate whether symmetry constraints can
prevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states
(canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries
remain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high
temperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge
sector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal
states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state
decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs
states do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement and have persistent
fermionic negativity at high temperatures. These findings demonstrate that
global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal
decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and
quantum information in thermal equilibrium.

Motivation: 近量子计算机的错误率和可扩展性限制使得其难以在实用任务中超越经典计算机，如何有效消除量子计算中的噪声和错误变得至关重要。

Result: 通过数值模拟验证，该错误消除方案在保持门路和QEC码的大规模的同时显著提高了量子计算资源的效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为实现高效的量子计算提供了一种新方法，克服了现有量子计算的障碍。

Abstract: The potential of quantum computers to outperform classical ones in
practically useful tasks remains challenging in the near term due to scaling
limitations and high error rates of current quantum hardware. While quantum
error correction (QEC) offers a clear path towards fault tolerance, overcoming
the scalability issues will take time. Early applications will likely rely on
QEC combined with quantum error mitigation (QEM). We introduce a QEM scheme
against both compilation errors and logical-gate noise that is circuit-, QEC
code-, and compiler-agnostic. The scheme builds on quasi-probability
distribution methods and uses information about the circuit's gates'
compilations to attain an unbiased estimation of noiseless expectation values
incurring a constant sample-complexity overhead. Moreover, it features maximal
circuit size and QEC code-distance both independent of the target precision, in
contrast to strategies based on QEC alone. We formulate the mitigation
procedure as a linear program, demonstrate its efficacy through numerical
simulations, and illustrate it for estimating the Jones polynomials of knots.
Our method significantly reduces quantum resource requirements for
high-precision estimations, offering a practical route towards fault-tolerant
quantum computation with precision-independent overheads.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Device-independent (DI) certification allows the verification of quantum
systems based solely on observed statistics, without assumptions about their
internal structure. While self-testing, the strongest DI certification, of a
wide range of quantum states and measurements is done, the self-testing of
quantum operations remains underdeveloped. Here, we show in a
proof-of-principle way that any quantum unitary can be self-tested within the
DI paradigm. For our purpose, we utilise the framework of quantum networks with
multiple independent sources. Our work provides a fundamental step toward
certifying quantum interactions directly from data, without detailed modelling
assumptions. Moreover, the result also serves as a crucial ingredient for
quantum computation, where verifying that quantum gates perform as intended is
essential for building secure and reliable quantum processors.

Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a central tool for
quantifying decoherence across wide-ranging physical platforms. Here we
demonstrate its direct measurement in a classical ensemble using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) with a modulated gradient spin echo (MGSE) sequence
and extend the method into a multidimensional correlation to track exchange
phenomena. Position is encoded through magnetic field gradients and momentum
through the velocity autocorrelation function, enabling experimental access to
OTOCs for proton motion confined within the self-similar lattice of the
metal-organic framework MOF-808. Here, water confined to specified geometries
within the MOF pores gives rise to spatially distinct diffusive eigenmodes with
characteristic relative entropies. We demonstrate that periodic radiofrequency
(rf) driving combined with gradient modulation yields entropy evolution through
the selection of distinct diffusion modes. Frequency-resolved diffusion spectra
connect these entropy dynamics to classical heat-exchange laws, revealing how
operational features of quantum systems are mirrored in confined, macroscopic
spin ensembles.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for classically simulating adaptive quantum circuits with low magic states and high entanglement, developed with Pauli measurements, particularly for quantum error correction and monitored quantum systems. Our analysis shows that the algorithms enable systematic truncation and scaling up of previously inaccessible circuit sizes and depths, and identify phase transitions influenced by measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and simulating the behavior of quantum systems with low magic states is crucial for advancing quantum computing and error correction techniques. This paper addresses a gap in developing efficient classical simulation methods for such systems.

Method: The paper introduces adaptive classical simulation algorithms designed for quantum circuits that undergo measurements after each non-Clifford operation. These algorithms leverage the sparsity of non-stabilizerness (magic) induced by noise or gates, allowing for precise control over the buildup of quantum resources. The approach also includes adaptive truncation techniques to approximate the simulation while maintaining accuracy.

Result: The results demonstrate that the developed algorithms can simulate quantum circuits with high circuit depths and larger system sizes, achieving significant parameter scaling improvements over previous methods. The algorithms enabled the study of measurement-induced phase transitions, especially in entanglement and magic states for moderately large circuits, which were previously computationally infeasible.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundational framework for simulating generic quantum computations with low magic states, enabling comparisons with quantum resource-theoretic lower bounds. This work opens up new possibilities for exploring noisy quantum systems, verifying quantum advantage claims, and developing optimized quantum circuits tailored for error correction and other applications.

Abstract: We develop classical simulation algorithms for adaptive quantum circuits that
produce states with low levels of ``magic'' (i.e., non-stabilizerness). These
algorithms are particularly well-suited to circuits with high rates of Pauli
measurements, such as those encountered in quantum error correction and
monitored quantum circuits. The measurements serve to limit the buildup of
magic induced by non-Clifford operations arising from generic noise processes
or unitary gates, respectively. Our algorithms also allow a systematic
truncation procedure to achieve approximate simulation. To benchmark our
approach, we study the dynamics of all-to-all monitored quantum circuits with a
sub-extensive rate of $T$-gates per unit of circuit depth, where we can
simulate previously inaccessible system sizes and depths. We characterize
measurement-induced phase transitions in the output wavefunction, including in
the entanglement, purification, and magic. We outline the utility of our
algorithms to simulate dynamics with low magic and high entanglement,
complementary to the leading matrix-product state approaches.

### [14] [Engineering Non-Gaussian Bosonic Gates through Quantum Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20261)
*Pak-Tik Fong,Hoi-Kwan Lau*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Non-Gaussian operations are essential but difficult in bosonic quantum technologies, and while Gaussian operations are abundant, achieving good trade-offs between accuracy and time is not so straightforward. In this work, a scheme using quantum signal processing (QSP) is proposed that enables non-Gaussian gate engineering for hybrid qubit and qumode systems, specifically benefiting from dispersive coupling. This new quantum gate can implement phases dependent on boson number, reproducing SNAP gates but with improved accuracy and shorter interaction times. Additionally, the QSP framework is versatile, allowing for non-unitary operations like noiseless amplification and generalized parity measurements, and can be adapted for other coupling systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving efficient and accurate non-Gaussian operations is crucial for advancing bosonic quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication, where Gaussian operations alone are insufficient. There is a need for more practical and high-accuracy non-Gaussian operations that do not rely on precise timing or are too prone to errors.

Method: Hybrid qubit-qumode systems with dispersive coupling are leveraged, employing quantum signal processing techniques to design a new non-Gaussian gate. The gate’s phase dependency is based on the modulus of the boson number, offering a scalable and versatile approach. The design is optimized for shorter and more reliable operation times compared to traditional methods, ensuring better accuracy without significant increases in complexity.

Result: The proposed scheme successfully implements a non-Gaussian gate that outperforms SNAP gates in accuracy and interaction time under certain parameter conditions. The gate enables novel applications such as logical qudits entanglement and precise multi-component cat state generation. Moreover, the QSP framework demonstrates adaptability by extending it to other coupling systems and performing non-unitary operations.

Conclusion: This research opens up new possibilities for bosonic quantum technology by providing a robust, high-accuracy non-Gaussian gate and suggesting extensions for various quantum applications. The improved efficiency and reliability of these operations could lead to significant advancements in quantum communication and computation. The framework’s versatility enhances its potential for practical implementations across different quantum coupling scenarios.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian operations are essential for most bosonic quantum technologies.
Yet, realizable non-Gaussian gates are rather limited in type and generally
suffer from accuracy-duration trade-offs. In this work, we propose to use
quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques to engineer non-Gaussian gates on
hybrid qumode-qubit systems. For systems with dispersive coupling, our scheme
can generate a new non-Gaussian gate that produces a phase shift depending on
the modulus of the boson number. This gate reproduces the selective
number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates under certain parameter choices,
but with higher accuracy within a short, fixed and excitation-independent
interaction time. The gate unlocks new applications, for example, in entangling
logical qudits and deterministically generating multi-component cat states.
Additionally, our versatile QSP formalism can be extended to systems with other
interactions, and also engineer non-unitary operations, such as noiseless
linear amplification and generalized-parity measurement.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum
machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw
data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where
shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In
the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question
arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential
privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication?
This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to
safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance
through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach
achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between
differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off
between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the
framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise
model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on
critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores
for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable
trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for
secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum
computing applications.

### [16] [Crosstalk Insensitive Trapped-Ion Entanglement through Coupling Matrix Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20329)
*Vikram Kashyap,Caleb Walton,Sara Mouradian*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper addresses control crosstalk in trapped-ion entangling gates, proposing a method to design gates insensitive to optical crosstalk by controlling ion motional modes, achieving a gate unaffected by crosstalk, without modifying the optical setup or gate operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: /weather as a major issue in current research, especially in quantum computing and quantum information processing, additional efforts are required to correct and mitigate the effects of unwanted errors caused by crosstalk.

Method: The method involves engineering control over the excitation of ions' motional modes to craft an effective qubit-qubit coupling matrix, effectively excluding crosstalk-affected qubits. The method requires only the optimization of laser pulses for gate operations, eliminating the need for changes to the optical setup or additional gate operations.

Result: The proposed method was successfully implemented in the paper, demonstrating its feasibility to create a completely crosstalk-insensitive entangling gate in a three-ion system.

Conclusion: In summary, this study presents a promising approach to managing crosstalk issues in trapped-ion gates, offering a valuable contribution to the development of more reliable quantum computing hardware and protocols.

Abstract: Control crosstalk due to imperfect optical addressing in trapped-ion
entangling gates results in unwanted entanglement between the target ions and
their neighbors. These errors are highly non-local, making them particularly
difficult to correct using error correcting codes. We introduce a method to
design entangling gates that are insensitive to optical crosstalk by
controlling the excitation of the ions' motional modes to engineer an effective
qubit-qubit coupling matrix that entirely excludes crosstalk-affected ions from
the entangling operation. This method requires no knowledge of the crosstalk
level and relies only on optimization of the laser pulse, avoiding the need to
modify the optical setup or use additional gate operations. We experimentally
demonstrate the method on a three-ion string by performing an entangling gate
that is completely insensitive to optical crosstalk.

Abstract: High-precision quantum control is essential for quantum computing and quantum
information processing. However, its practical implementation is challenged by
environmental noise, which affects the stability and accuracy of quantum
systems. In this paper, using machine learning techniques we propose a quantum
control approach that incorporates environmental factors into the design of
control schemes, improving the control fidelity in noisy environments.
Specifically, we investigate arbitrary quantum state preparation in a two-level
system coupled to a bosonic bath. We use both Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
and Supervised Learning (SL) algorithms to design specific control pulses that
mitigate the noise. These two neural network (NN) based algorithm both have the
advantage that the well trained NN can output the optimal pulse sequence for
any environmental parameters. Comparing the performance of these two
algorithms, our results show that DRL is more effective in low-noise
environments due to its strong optimization capabilities, while SL provides
greater stability and performs better in high-noise conditions. These findings
highlight the potential of machine learning techniques to enhance the quantum
control fidelity in practical applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Nonlinear spectroscopy is a powerful approach to extracting information, in
particular higher-order correlations of physical quantities. Quantum nonlinear
spectroscopy (QNS) can access exponentially more types of correlations than its
classical counterpart, since the responses to ``classical forces'' correspond
to contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) that involve only commutators,
while in QNS ``quantum forces'' from a quantum sensor induce responses
corresponding to CTOCs that involve both commutators and anti-commutators.
Symmetries are important for constraining and analyzing nonlinear spectroscopy.
Quantum and classical nonlinear spectroscopy have similar spatial symmetry
properties. QNS, however, is expected to have its characteristic non-spatial
symmetry properties since commutators and anti-commutators of physical
quantities can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as
exchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations
extracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including
particle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), and their combination, i.e., chiral (S)
symmetry. We find that the generalized C-symmetry imposes special selection
rules on QNS, and the generalized T- and S-symmetry relate CTOCs to
out-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs). This work discloses deep structures in
higher-order quantum correlations due to non-spatial symmetries and provides
access to certain types of OTOCs that are not directly observable.

Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) microring resonators, characterized by an exceptionally
high second-order nonlinear coefficient and superior electro-optic tunability,
serve as an outstanding platform for the precise control of integrated quantum
frequency combs (QFCs). In this study, we introduce a bipartite entanglement
criterion to investigate the pairwise entanglement characteristics of QFCs
generated via the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process in
lithium niobate microring resonators operating below threshold. Furthermore, we
propose a universal framework for analyzing multimode squeezing in quadratic
frequency combs, enabling the realization of ultrabroadband and high-degree
multimode squeezing. We further reveal the underlying physical mechanism:
modulation instability (MI), regulated by temporal walk-off control, not only
enables the formation of frequency combs but also induces multimode squeezing
in the corresponding resonant modes. This study uncovers the previously
unexplored role of on-chip multimode squeezing in quadratic frequency combs
while facilitating collective noise suppression across multiple modes, thus
holding substantial potential for advancing quantum precision measurement and
quantum information processing.

Abstract: Extracting useful work from quantum systems is a fundamental problem in
quantum thermodynamics. In scenarios where rapid protocols are desired --
whether due to practical constraints or deliberate design choices -- a
fundamental trade-off between power and efficiency emerges as a key concern.
Here, we investigate the problem of finite-time optimal work extraction from
closed quantum systems, subject to a constraint on the magnitude of the control
Hamiltonian. We first establish the trade-off relation between power and work
under a general setup, stating that these fundamental performance metrics
cannot be maximized simultaneously. Next, we introduce a framework of
Lie-algebraic control, which involves a wide range of control problems
including many-body control of the Heisenberg model and the SU(n)-Hubbard
model. Within this framework, the optimal work extraction protocol becomes
remarkably simple: it suffices to use a time-independent Hamiltonian, which is
determined by a nonlinear self-consistent equation. We obtain an analytical
solution for su(2) control, and a numerical solution for more complex cases
like su(n) control using the steepest gradient descent method. Moreover, by
exploiting the Lie-algebraic structure of the controllable terms, our approach
is applicable to quantum many-body systems, enabling an efficient numerical
computation. Our results highlight the necessity of rapid protocols to achieve
the maximum power and establish a theoretical framework for designing optimal
work extraction protocols under realistic time constraints.

Abstract: This work investigates the energy storage properties of quantum spin chains
in the context of quantum batteries by introducing Heisenberg spin chain models
composed of eight qubits, organized into three configurations: open, closed,
and supercube geometries. The charging dynamics of the mentioned systems are
examined using Hamiltonians that include contributions from the battery,
spin-spin interactions, and a transverse magnetic field. The inclusion of the
Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI) within the charging Hamiltonian is
found to improve the ergotropy in the XXZ model, particularly for the supercube
configuration, leading to enhanced quantum battery performance. We further
study the effects of varying neighboring coupling strengths and system size (8

supercube configuration, under specific interaction strengths, as achieving
near-optimal charging and discharging efficiency. In the case of a 12-qubit
icosahedral structure, the superior results and ergotropy are obtained,
comparable to the supercube.

Abstract: As a branch of quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning (QRL)
aims to solve complex sequential decision-making problems more efficiently and
effectively than its classical counterpart by exploiting quantum resources.
However, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, its realization is
challenged by the ubiquitous noise-induced decoherence. Here, we propose a
noise-resilient QRL scheme for a quantum eigensolver. By investigating the
non-Markovian decoherence effect on the QRL for solving the eigen states of a
two-level system as an agent, we find that the formation of a bound state in
the energy spectrum of the total agent-noise system restores the QRL
performance to that in the noiseless case. Providing a universal physical
mechanism to suppress the decoherence effect in quantum machine learning, our
result lays the foundation for designing the NISQ algorithms and offers a
guideline for their practical implementation.

Abstract: We introduce a new family of multi-mode, rotationally symmetric bosonic codes
inspired by the group-theoretic framework of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240603
(2024)]. Such a construction inverts the traditional paradigm of code design by
identifying codes from the requirement that a group of chosen logical gates
should be implemented by means of physically simple logical operations, such as
linear optics. Leveraging previously unexplored degrees of freedom within this
framework, our construction preserves rotational symmetry across multiple
modes, enabling linear-optics implementation of the full Pauli group. These
codes exhibit improved protection against dephasing noise, outperforming both
single-mode analogues and earlier multi-mode constructions. Notably, they allow
exact correction of correlated dephasing and support qudit encoding in
arbitrary dimensions. We analytically construct and numerically benchmark
two-mode binomial codes instances, and demonstrate that, unlike single-mode
rotationally symmetric bosonic codes, these exhibit no trade-off between
protection against dephasing and photon loss.

Motivation: Understanding non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in interacting systems is crucial for various applications, particularly in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics.

Method: The authors analyze the formalism of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, their Green's functions, and propose an alternative approach using pseudo-Hermitian mechanics.

Result: It is shown that incorporating the anti-Hermitian part directly into Green's functions does not work for interacting systems and that pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics provides a consistent description.

Conclusion: Pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics is a suitable framework for describing non-Hermitian interacting systems, offering a viable alternative to standard methods.

Abstract: Interacting and open quantum systems can be formulated in terms of an
effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), however, there are important
constraints that must be satisfied by the effective action and the associated
Green's functions. One common approach to many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems
is to incorporate the anti-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian directly in the
Matsubara Green's function. Here, we show that such an approach is incompatible
with the standard framework for systems with interactions. Furthermore, we
furnish a consistent physical description for such systems by determining their
distinction from conventional interacting physics, and find that they are
described by pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we characterize
the zero-temperature distribution functions within several frameworks for NH
systems. As an application of our results, we consider the electromagnetic
response of a NH quasiparticle Hamiltonian based on the (1+1)-dimensional NH
Dirac model subject to various physical descriptions.

Abstract: This work investigates a relativistic quantum Otto engine with a harmonic
oscillator as its working medium, analyzing how relativistic motion and
nonadiabatic driving affect its performance and efficiency bounds. In the
adiabatic regime, a closed-form analytical expression is derived for the
generalized Carnot efficiency, which incorporates the effects of relativistic
motion and reduces to the standard Carnot efficiency in the nonrelativistic
limit. For nonadiabatic driving, we consider sudden compression and expansion
work strokes and show that the maximum efficiency achievable by the engine is
limited to 1/2, even in the ultra-relativistic limit. Going one step further,
we also derive an analytical expression for the efficiency bound in the
sudden-switch protocol, which can be regarded as the nonadiabatic counterpart
of the generalized Carnot efficiency. Together, these results provide
analytical bounds for the efficiency of relativistic quantum heat engines and
constitute the first systematic study of the interplay between relativistic
motion and frictional effects arising from nonadiabatic driving.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: When scaling up quantum processors in a cryogenic environment, it is
desirable to limit the number of qubit drive lines going into the cryostat,
since fewer lines makes cooling of the system more manageable and the need for
complicated electronics setups is reduced. However, although time-multiplexing
of qubit control enables using just a few drive line to steer many qubits, it
comes with a trade-off: fewer drive lines means fewer qubits can be controlled
in parallel, which leads to an overhead in the execution time for quantum
algorithms. In this article, we quantify this trade-off through numerical and
analytical investigations. For standard quantum processor layouts and typical
gate times, we show that the trade-off is favorable for many common quantum
algorithms $\unicode{x2014}$ the number of drive lines can be significantly
reduced without introducing much overhead. Specifically, we show that couplers
for two-qubit gates can be grouped on common drive lines without any overhead
up to a limit set by the connectivity of the qubits. For single-qubit gates, we
find that the serialization overhead generally scales only logarithmically in
the number of qubits sharing a drive line. These results are promising for the
continued progress towards large-scale quantum computers.

Conclusion: Digital quantum simulators are effective for studying confined particle dynamics, with potential applications in understanding gauge theories.

Abstract: Lattice gauge theories provide a non-perturbative framework for understanding
confinement and hadronic physics, but their real-time dynamics remain
challenging for classical computations. However, quantum simulators offer a
promising alternative for exploring such dynamics beyond classical
capabilities. Here, we experimentally investigate meson scattering using a
superconducting quantum processor. Employing a digital protocol, we realize a
Floquet spin chain equivalent to a one-dimensional Floquet $\mathbb{Z}_2$
lattice gauge theory. We observe Bloch oscillations of single kinks and strong
binding between adjacent kinks, signaling confinement and the formation of
stable mesons in this Floquet system. Using full-system joint readout, we
resolve meson populations by string length, enabling identification of meson
scattering channels. Our results reveal the fragmentation of a long-string
meson into multiple short-string mesons, which is also an experimental
signature of string breaking. Moreover, we directly observe inelastic meson
scattering, where two short-string mesons can merge into a longer one. Our
results pave the way for studying interacting gauge particles and composite

Motivation: The work is motivated by the challenge of generating symmetric entangled states on quantum computers with restricted qubit connectivity, which is a common limitation in state-of-the-art hardware platforms. The motivation stems from the need for efficient protocols to create such states for use in quantum algorithms and quantum error correction.

Method: The approach adapts the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithm for linear connectivity to achieve translational invariance in entanglement. The protocol is modified to reveal periodicity of entanglement in nearest-neighbor qubits.

Result: The protocol demonstrates that it can generate translationally invariant pairwise entangled states with star and linear connectivity. It is shown to be independent of the number of qubits, and a slight modification reveals periodicity of entanglement among nearest-neighbor qubits. The configurations and protocols are well-suited for near-term quantum devices.

Conclusion: This work provides a feasible route for the experimental realization of symmetric entangled states on quantum computers with restricted qubit connectivity. The protocol's independence from the number of qubits and its ability to reveal periodicity of entanglement make it a promising method for near-term quantum applications.

Abstract: We present a protocol for generating multiqubit quantum states with

digital quantum computers with restricted qubit connectivity, a common
limitation in state-of-the-art hardware platforms. We examine two

entanglement. For the linear configuration, we use a variant of the
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithm to
demonstrate that our protocol is independent of the qubits' number. A slight

Abstract: In this work an incorrect argument in EPR's paper is corrected. A predictive
approach to further confirm the validity of quantum theory is also proposed.
The essence of the detail that EPR missed is that in a state of given total
momentum (in their example the total momentum is zero), since the total
momentum operator $\hat{\bp}=\hat{\bp}_1+\hat{\bp}_2$ does not commute with any
of the position operators $\hat{\bx}_1$ and $\hat{\bx}_2,$ then in an
eigenstate of the total momentum operator, the standard deviation on the
measurement of the position of any of the two particles has to be infinite.
Below we compute the (quantum) conditional expectation of the momentum of any
of the particles (say, the first) given the value of a measurement of the total
momentum. Since the predictor of the momentum of the particle depends on the
total momentum, and the total momentum does not commute with the position
operator of any of the particles, the uncertainty principle is not violated,
and no contradiction appears. We also prove, using the basic tenets of quantum
measurement theory, that after measurement of the total momentum, the
probability density (computed as the absolute square of the wave function),
coincides with the (quantum) conditional density given the total momentum.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that a simple model of continuous weak measurement gives rise to the
telegraph switching behavior seen in experiments with single qubits. This lends
support to a continuous collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics, but can
also be viewed as a model of continuous detection of a steady-state process in
the incoherent limit. We show explicitly that such a system obeys the Born rule
for particle counting statistics, even though no particle behavior has been
invoked.

### [32] [Louvre: Relaxing Hardware Requirements of Quantum LDPC Codes by Routing with Expanded Quantum Instruction Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20858)
*Runshi Zhou,Fang Zhang,Hui-Hai Zhao,Feng Wu,Linghang Kong,Jianxin Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: GB codes are promising quantum LDPC codes with high rates and local qubit connectivity; BB codes (a subclass of GB codes) have good compatibility with certain quantum processors but require a high qubit connectivity degree (degree 6), which complicates noise resilience. This paper introduces Louvre, a routing-based framework that reduces qubit connectivity requirements in GB codes. For BB codes, Louvre-7 reduces the average degree to 4.5 while maintaining logical error rates comparable to standard circuits. Louvre-8 further reduces connectivity to 4 with a slight error rate penalty. Louvre also allows for minimizing coupler lengths without degrading performance, and it can be applied to different boundary conditions, expanding its practicality for quantum error correction architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the practicality of quantum error correction by reducing qubit connectivity is a key area of research, as high connectivity can lead to increased error rates and complexity.

Method: The paper introduces Louvre, a routing-based framework for GB codes. For BB codes, schemes Louvre-7 and Louvre-8 are implemented, withLouvre-7 achieving minimal degree reduction while preserving logical error rates, and Louvre-8 slightly increasing circuit depth for further connectivity reduction. Numerical simulations compare the performance and error rates of Louvre-7 and Louvre-8 with standard circuits. Some gate reordering is used to reduce coupler lengths without affecting performance. The paper also discusses the framework's applicability to open-boundary lattices and defect-containing grids.

Result: Louvre successfully reduces qubit connectivity requirements for GB codes. For BB codes, Louvre-7 achieves an average degree reduction to 4.5 with unchanged logical error rates, while Louvre-8 further reduces connectivity to 4 with a slight error rate penalty. The framework introduces minor circuit depth increases (0.27 times the reference syndrome extraction circuit), allows for shrinking coupler lengths, and is adaptable to varying boundary conditions.

Conclusion: Louvre offers an effective approach to reducing qubit connectivity in GB codes, particularly for BB codes, by utilizing routing strategies. The framework supports practical quantum error correction implementations while managing noise and hardware limitations, with evidence from numerical simulations demonstrating its efficacy and adaptability to different system configurations.

Abstract: Generalized bicycle codes (GB codes) represent a promising family of quantum
low-density parity-check codes, characterized by high code rates and relatively
local qubit connectivity. A subclass of the GB code called bivariate bicycle
codes (BB codes) has garnered significant interest due to their compatibility
with two-layer connectivity architectures on superconducting quantum
processors. However, one key limitation of BB codes is their high qubit
connectivity degree requirements (degree 6), which exacerbates the noise
susceptibility of the system. Building on the recent progress in implementing
multiple two-qubit gates on a single chip, this work introduces Louvre -- a
routing-based framework designed to reduce qubit connectivity requirements in
GB codes. Specifically, Louvre-7 achieves degree reduction while preserving the
depth of the syndrome extraction circuit, whereas Louvre-8 further minimizes
the connectivity by slightly increasing the circuit depth. When applied to BB
codes, these two schemes could reduce the average degree to 4.5 and 4,
respectively. Crucially, Louvre eliminates some of the long-range, error-prone
connections, which is a distinct advantage over prior approaches. Numerical
simulations demonstrate that Louvre-7 has an indistinguishable logical error
rate as the standard syndrome extraction circuits of GB codes, while Louvre-8
only incurs a slight error rate penalty. Furthermore, by reordering some of the
gates in the circuit, we can reduce the coupler length without degrading the
performance. Though most of our analysis focuses on GB codes defined on
periodic boundary conditions, we further discuss the adaptability of Louvre to
open-boundary lattices and defect-containing grids, underscoring its broader
applicability in practical quantum error correction architectures.

Abstract: Typical schemes to encode classical data in variational quantum machine
learning (QML) lead to quantum Fourier models with $\mathcal{O}(\exp(n))$
Fourier basis functions in the number of qubits. Despite this, in order for the
model to be efficiently trainable, the number of parameters must scale as
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. This imbalance implies the existence of
correlations between the Fourier modes, which depend on the structure of the
circuit. In this work, we demonstrate that this phenomenon exists and show
cases where these correlations can be used to predict ansatz performance. For
several popular ansatzes, we numerically compute the Fourier coefficient
correlations (FCCs) and construct the Fourier fingerprint, a visual
representation of the correlation structure. We subsequently show how, for the
problem of learning random Fourier series, the FCC correctly predicts relative
performance of ansatzes whilst the widely-used expressibility metric does not.
Finally, we demonstrate how our framework applies to the more challenging
problem of jet reconstruction in high-energy physics. Overall, our results
demonstrate how the Fourier fingerprint is a powerful new tool in the problem
of optimal ansatz choice for QML.

TL;DR: Quantum computing may enhance specific chemical computations in the short term but classical methods still hold dominance for larger molecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper contrasts quantum and classical approaches in computational chemistry to determine the future of quantum computing in the field.

Method: The authors extend Choi, Moses, and Thompson's framework, comparing algorithms on current and projected hardware metrics.

Result: Classical methods are likely superior for larger molecules, while quantum benefits emerge in small molecules with high accuracy.

Conclusion: Quantum computing's impact is limited by qubit constraints but may benefit specific, smaller-scale chemical problems.

Abstract: For decades, computational chemistry has been posited as one of the areas in
which quantum computing would revolutionize. However, the algorithmic
advantages that fault-tolerant quantum computers have for chemistry can be
overwhelmed by other disadvantages, such as error correction, processor speed,
etc. To assess when quantum computing will be disruptive to computational
chemistry, we compare a wide range of classical methods to quantum
computational methods by extending the framework proposed by Choi, Moses, and
Thompson. Our approach accounts for the characteristics of classical and
quantum algorithms, and hardware, both today and as they improve.
  We find that in many cases, classical computational chemistry methods will
likely remain superior to quantum algorithms for at least the next couple of
decades. Nevertheless, quantum computers are likely to make important
contributions in two important areas. First, for simulations with tens or
hundreds of atoms, highly accurate methods such as Full Configuration
Interaction are likely to be surpassed by quantum phase estimation in the
coming decade. Secondly, in cases where quantum phase estimation is most
efficient less accurate methods like Couple Cluster and Moller-Plesset, could
be surpassed in fifteen to twenty years if the technical advancements for
quantum computers are favorable. Overall, we find that in the next decade or
so, quantum computing will be most impactful for highly accurate computations
with small to medium-sized molecules, whereas classical computers will likely
remain the typical choice for calculations of larger molecules.

Conclusion: 揭示了量子基态的对称性如何影响生成过程的统计特性，为理解量子与经典系统的交叉提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Entangled quantum mechanical states in one dimension can be used to represent
and simulate classical stochastic processes with nontrivial statistical
properties. Long-range quantum correlations translate into fractional processes
with their asymptotic Hurst exponents characterizing roughness and persistence.
We explore this analogy in the case of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain and investigate
properties of four different classical two-state processes that this quantum
system can generate. These processes show fractional characteristics with
varying Hurst exponents. We argue that the continuous quantum symmetries such
as U(1) or SU(2) of the XXZ chain give rise to $H=0$ with logarithmic scaling.
Processes generated without these symmetries can produce $H \geq0.5$ but likely
not $H < 0.5$ unless the dominant term responsible for $H=0.5$ gets canceled.
This does not seem to happen for the XXZ model. We use standard quantum
methods, including MERA and TEBD, to numerically substantiate our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The paper aims to leverage quantum computing to enhance machine learning models, specifically in high-dimensional datasets relevant to drug discovery and medical diagnostics.

Method:  The method involves encoding datasets into disordered quantum spin-glass problems, performing a nonadiabatic evolution, and extracting features from expectation values.

Result:  Quantum feature maps enhance classical models by up to 210% performance metrics, demonstrating quantum advantage in selected applications.

Conclusion:  The work highlights the potential of quantum computing in bridging quantum supremacy with practical applications in ML.

Abstract: We propose a quantum feature mapping technique that leverages the quench
dynamics of a quantum spin glass to extract complex data patterns at the
quantum-advantage level for academic and industrial applications. We
demonstrate that encoding a dataset information into disordered quantum
many-body spin-glass problems, followed by a nonadiabatic evolution and feature
extraction via measurements of expectation values, significantly enhances
machine learning (ML) models. By analyzing the performance of our protocol over
a range of evolution times, we empirically show that ML models benefit most
from feature representations obtained in the fast coherent regime of a quantum
annealer, particularly near the critical point of the quantum dynamics. We
demonstrate the generalization of our technique by benchmarking on multiple
high-dimensional datasets, involving over a hundred features, in applications
including drug discovery and medical diagnostics. Moreover, we compare against
a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art classical ML models and show that our
quantum feature maps can enhance the performance metrics of the baseline
classical models up to 210%. Our work presents the first quantum ML
demonstrations at the quantum-advantage level, bridging the gap between quantum
supremacy and useful real-world academic and industrial applications.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that bit-bit encoding enables efficient universal approximation in variational quantum machine learning, concluding that medium datasets need ~20 qubits, but very large ones might require more, even more features could reduce qubit needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study likely wanted to evaluate the efficiency of bit-encoded models in QML for practical applications, especially with large datasets.

Method: Analyzing quantum circuit complexity in variational models specifically with bit encoding, evaluating resource requirements for classical simulation.

Result: Bit encoding allows resource estimation for VQA tasks, with medium datasets using ~20 qubits, but scaling up suggests higher qubit needs. Very large datasets may push classical limits but could sometimes use fewer qubits despite more features.

Conclusion: Bit encoding makes VQA practical for datasets up to certain sizes, implying future applications across ML with quantum resources.

Abstract: For a machine learning paradigm to be generally applicable, it should have
the property of universal approximation, that is, it should be able to
approximate any target function to any desired degree of accuracy. In
variational quantum machine learning, the class of functions that can be
learned depend on both the data encoding scheme as well as the architecture of
the optimizable part of the model. Here, we show that the property of universal
approximation is constructively and efficiently realized by the recently
proposed bit-bit encoding scheme. Further, we show that this construction
allows us to calculate the number of qubits required to solve a learning
problem on a dataset to a target accuracy, giving rise to the first resource
estimation framework for variational quantum machine learning. We apply bit-bit
encoding to a number of medium-sized datasets from OpenML and find that they
require only $20$ qubits on average for encoding. Further, we extend the basic
bit-bit encoding scheme to one that can handle batching very large datasets. As
a demonstration, we apply this new scheme to the giga-scale transcriptomic
Tahoe-100M dataset, concluding that the number of qubits required for encoding
it lies beyond classical simulation capabilities. Remarkably, we find that the
number of qubits does not necessarily increase with the number of features of a
dataset, but may sometimes even decrease.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的快速发展，高效计算矩阵的谱性质在科学和工程领域具有重要意义，该研究提供了新的量子算法以解决这一问题。

Method: 研究采用了量子计算框架，基于QRAM模型，提出了一个计算矩阵谱间距和中点的算法，该算法的总复杂度为多项式复杂度。

Result: 该量子算法的总复杂度为$Oig(N^2/(eta	au)^2 	ext{polylog}(N,1/	au,1/eta,1/	heta)ig)$，其中$eta$是精度参数，$	au$是谱间距，$	heta$是成功概率。该复杂度在量子计算模型中是高度高效的。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了量子算法在解决矩阵谱问题方面的优势，尤其是在谱间距较大的情况下，该算法显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Approximating the $k$-th spectral gap $\Delta_k=|\lambda_k-\lambda_{k+1}|$
and the corresponding midpoint $\mu_k=\frac{\lambda_k+\lambda_{k+1}}{2}$ of an
$N\times N$ Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues
$\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\ldots\geq\lambda_N$, is an important special case
of the eigenproblem with numerous applications in science and engineering. In
this work, we present a quantum algorithm which approximates these values up to
additive error $\epsilon\Delta_k$ using a logarithmic number of qubits.
Notably, in the QRAM model, its total complexity (queries and gates) is bounded
by $O\left( \frac{N^2}{\epsilon^{2}\Delta_k^2}\mathrm{polylog}\left(
N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon},\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$, where
$\epsilon,\delta\in(0,1)$ are the accuracy and the success probability,
respectively. For large gaps $\Delta_k$, this provides a speed-up against the
best-known complexities of classical algorithms, namely, $O \left(
N^{\omega}\mathrm{polylog} \left(
N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$, where $\omega\lesssim
2.371$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. A key technical step in the
analysis is the preparation of a suitable random initial state, which
ultimately allows us to efficiently count the number of eigenvalues that are
smaller than a threshold, while maintaining a quadratic complexity in $N$. In
the black-box access model, we also report an $\Omega(N^2)$ query lower bound
for deciding the existence of a spectral gap in a binary (albeit non-symmetric)
matrix.

Motivation: 随着量子密钥分发（QKD）在现实世界中的应用，特别是在不依赖光纤的自由空间通信中，如何提高QKD的安全性和效率变得尤为重要。自适应光学（AO）是一种常见的方法来解决光子态在传输中引入的失真问题。

Method: 研究者在高维光子态（如轨道角动量（OAM），互不偏振基（MUB），对称信息完全正交测量（SIC-POVM））的自由空间信道中引入自适应光学，并通过实验评估其效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，自适应光学在处理光子态失真方面表现出色，尤其是对称信息完全正交测量（SIC-POVM）在湍流信道中表现出最鲁棒的性能。然而，MUB和SIC-POVM的校正精度较低，但其性能仍然在协议允许的范围内。

Conclusion: 自适应光学是一种关键的工具，用于实现安全的高维QKD，特别是在 turbulent free-space 信道中。同时，选择合适的基（如SIC-POVM）可以优化QKD的安全性和抗失真能力。

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows secure key exchange based on the
principles of quantum mechanics, with higher-dimensional photonic states
offering enhanced channel capacity and resilience to noise. Free-space QKD is
crucial for global networks where fibres are impractical, but atmospheric
turbulence introduces severe states distortions, particularly for spatial
modes. Adaptive optics (AO) provides a pathway to correct these errors, though
its effectiveness depends on the encoding basis. Here, we experimentally
evaluate a high-speed AO system for orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes,
mutually unbiased bases (MUB), and symmetric, informationally complete,
positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVM) up to dimension $d=8$ in a
turbulent free-space channel. While OAM states are strongly distorted, their
cylindrical symmetry makes them optimally corrected by AO, yielding error rates
below QKD security thresholds. MUB and SIC-POVM exhibit greater intrinsic
robustness to turbulence but are less precisely corrected, though their
performance remains within protocol tolerances. These results establish AO as a
key enabler of secure, high-dimensional QKD and highlight the role of basis
choice in optimizing resilience and correction.

Motivation: This research contributes to the understanding of computational complexity by exploring the relationship between interactive proof systems, particularly quantum ones, and the PSPACE class, which represents problems solvable by classical computers using polynomial space.

Method: The authors utilize Arthur-Merlin proof systems with verifiers as two-way finite automata that can have quantum and classical states. They employ rational-valued quantum transitions and achieve perfect completeness by ensuring member strings are accepted with probability 1.

Result: The key result is that PSPACE (and thus QIP) is contained within AM(2QCFA), indicating a significant equivalence in computational power between these classes under the described protocols.

Conclusion: The paper advances our understanding of quantum interactive proof systems and their relationship to PSPACE, suggesting potential implications for quantum computing and computational complexity theory.

Abstract: The class of languages having polynomial-time classical or quantum
interactive proof systems ($\mathsf{IP}$ or $\mathsf{QIP}$, respectively) is
identical to $\mathsf{PSPACE}$. We show that $\mathsf{PSPACE}$ (and so
$\mathsf{QIP}$) is subset of $\mathsf{AM(2QCFA)}$, the class of languages
having Arthur-Merlin proof systems where the verifiers are two-way finite
automata with quantum and classical states (2QCFAs) communicating with the
provers classically. Our protocols use only rational-valued quantum transitions
and run in double-exponential expected time. Moreover, the member strings are
accepted with probability 1 (i.e., perfect-completeness).

Abstract: Developing a systematic view of where quantum computers will outperform
classical ones is important for researchers, policy makers and business
leaders. But developing such a view is challenging because quantum advantage
analyses depend not only on algorithm properties, but also on a host of
technical characteristics (error correction, gate speeds, etc.). Because
various analyses make different assumptions about these technical
characteristics, it can be challenging to make comparisons across them. In this
paper, we introduce an open-access web-tool designed to make such comparisons
easy. Built on the framework introduced by Choi, Moses, and Thompson (2023), it
calculates when quantum systems will outperform classical computers for a given
algorithmic problem. These estimates can be easily updated based on various
assumptions for error correction, overhead, and connectivity. Different
hardware roadmaps can also be used and algorithm running times can be
customized to particular applications. It can currently be accessed at
https://futuretech.mit.edu/quantum-economic-advantage-calculator.
  This integrated prediction tool also allows us to explore which technical
factors are most important for quantum ``economic" advantage (outperforming on
a cost-equivalent basis). Overall, we find that for some algorithms (e.g.
Shor's) the timing of advantage is quite robust, whereas for others (e.g.
Grover's) it is contingent, with numerous technical characteristics
substantially impacting these dates. In the paper, we discuss both why this
occurs and what we can learn from it.

Motivation: Understanding generalized gauges in electromagnetics and their relationships to standard gauges is important for advancing vector potential methods and solving Maxwell's equations.

Method: The authors derive Green's functions in both time and frequency domains for generalized gauges by solving Maxwell's equations under specific gauge conditions.

Result: The derived Green's functions for generalized gauges include those of Lorenz, Coulomb, and Kirchhoff gauges as special cases.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive framework for generalized vector potential gauge conditions in electromagnetics, enhancing the solution of Maxwell's equations.

Abstract: We derive the dyadic Green's function for the generalized velocity gauge in

that it reduces to the results of the Coulomb and the temporal gauges as
special cases. Together the generalized velocity and Kirchhoff gauges encompass

### [44] [Towards Balanced Description of Ground and Excited States with Transcorrelated F12 Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20233)
*Conner Masteran,Bimal Gaudel,Edward F. Valeev*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper improves the F12 correlator design for explicitly correlated methods, making them more balanced for ground and excited states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the accuracy of explicitly correlated methods for both ground and excited states by improving the F12 correlator design.

Method: The method involves extending the F12 correlator to include both occupied and virtual/valence 1-particle states, improving the correlation lengthscale dependency.

Result: The new design reduces basis set requirements for excited states compared to the conventional approach.

Conclusion: The improved F12 correlator provides a better balance for ground and low-energy excited states.$$}

Abstract: By correlating only the 1-particle states occupied in the reference
determinant the conventional design for the single-reference R12/F12
explicitly-correlated methods biases them towards the ground state description
thereby making treatment of response properties of the ground state, and
energies and other properties of excited states less robust. While the use of
multireference methods and/or extensions of the standard SP projected geminals
can achieve a more balanced description of ground and excited states, here we
show that the same goals can be achieved by extending the action of F12
correlators to the occupied and valence unoccupied 1-particle states only. This
design choice reflects the strong dependence of the optimal correlation
lengthscale of the F12 ansatz on the orbital energies/structure, and helps to
avoid the unphysical raising of the ground state energy if the F12 geminals are
used to correlate pairs of all 1-particle states. The improved F12 geminal
design is incorporated into the unitary transcorrelation framework to produce a
unitary 2-body Hamiltonian that incorporates the short-range dynamical
correlation physics for ground and low-energy excited states in a balanced
manner. This explicitly-correlated effective Hamiltonian reduces the basis set
requirement on the correlation-consistent basis cardinal number by 1 or more
over the uncorrelated counterpart for the description of the ground state
coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) energies, the vertical excitation
energies and harmonic vibrational frequencies of equation-of-motion CCSD
low-energy excited states.

Abstract: We present a perspective on molecular machine learning (ML) in the field of
chemical process engineering. Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great
potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure
components and their mixtures, and (ii) exploring the chemical space for new
molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models
and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This
includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can
be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a
hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML
at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored.
We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and
optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel
molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule
and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates,
possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.

### [46] [Radial asymmetry in quadrupole mass filters: stability, multipole fields and resolution enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20574)
*Sukanya Jana,Snigdha Bose,Sayel Chakraborty,Pintu Mandal,Nabanita Deb*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper studies the effects of radial asymmetry in a linear quadrupole mass filter and finds that while asymmetry can improve resolution in certain cases, it generally reduces resolution by broadening transmission contours. The results are explained using modified stability diagrams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass spectrometry has become a critical tool in various fields of study, and optimizing the performance of mass filters is essential for obtaining high-resolution and accurate data.

Method: The researchers developed a radial potential model to analyze the geometric deviations caused by radial asymmetry and systematically examined the transmission characteristics of asymmetric configurations.

Result: The study found that increased asymmetry broadened the transmission peaks, reducing resolution. However, a specific value of the asymmetry parameter (-0.02) yielded enhanced resolution compared to the symmetric case.

Conclusion: While radial asymmetry can provide benefits in specific cases, it generally reduces the resolution of linear quadrupole mass filters and should not be a common approach for improving mass filter performance.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of radial asymmetry in a linear quadrupole
mass filter with circular rods, introduced either by a change in electrode
radii or by displacement of a diametrically opposite pair. A radial potential
model is developed to account for the resulting geometric deviations, enabling
analysis of the first stability region specific to the quadrupole component.
The transmission characteristics of such asymmetric configurations are
systematically examined, revealing a linear shift in the transmission peak
along the q-axis as a function of the asymmetry parameter. This behavior is
interpreted through modifications observed in the stability diagram.
Furthermore, increased asymmetry is shown to broaden the transmission contours
and generally reduce resolution. Notably, a `magic' asymmetry parameter of
-0.02 corresponding to electrode displacement, yields enhanced resolution
compared to the symmetric case for a fixed rod-to-field radius ratio. An
empirical relationship is established between the resolution and the combined
contribution of the coefficients of octupole and dodecapole potential
components, highlighting the critical role of higher-order field effects in
performance optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机主要在于解决当前化学空间研究中的大数据问题。化学空间的数量庞大，无法通过枚举法进行全面探索，导致很多分子被遗漏。因此，需要一种有效的统计方法来描述和分析化学空间，以克服现状下的偏见和局限性。

Result: 研究得到了几个重要结论：首先，所提出的方法能够无偏地生成随机样本，并且能够估算化学空间中分子的数量；其次，该方法能够评估现有数据库对化学空间的代表性；最后，该方法为确定数据库的最小规模提供了必要的标准，从而确保了数据库的代表性。这些结论对于推动化学空间研究的发展具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 通过该研究，我们能够更高效、更准确地分析和理解化学空间。这不仅有助于解决当前的化学数据问题，还为未来的大规模化学研究提供了重要的工具和方法。该研究为化学空间的统计分析奠定了坚实的基础，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The overwhelming majority of molecules remains unexplored. This is mostly due
to the sheer number of them, which prohibits any enumeration of chemical space,
the set of all such molecules. In practice, only subsets of chemical space are
considered, but those subsets exhibit substantial bias, prohibiting data-driven
characterization of chemical space itself. In this work, we provide a method
produce unbiased representative random samples of chemical space without
enumeration of constituent molecules and to estimate the number of molecules in
any custom chemical space. The approach is applicable to molecules which can be
represented as graph and runs efficiently even for molecules of 30 atoms. We
use it to estimate the representativeness of current databases with respect to
their underlying chemical space and to establish a necessary criterion for a
lower bound of database sizes to be representative of an underlying chemical
space.

Conclusion: 在聚乙烯中，所选的稳定剂和增滑剂均表现出良好的表面作用。其中，聚乙炔可能表现出好的抗静电性能，聚己炔可能作为滑动性能>'。

Abstract: Additives are essential to enhance or modify the properties of plastics for
target applications. However, finding appropriate additives may be challenging,
since we lack knowledge on their interactions with the plastics and with
moisture, and the interplay between them. In this work, we study a commercial
additive as well as two new potential additives for their antistatic and slip
properties in polyethylene by means of atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations. We reveal the most favorable interactions between polyethylene,
each of these molecules and water, along with providing a microscopic picture
of their interfacial structure. All additives interact with water mainly by
their polar heads, with water acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor
depending on the additive. As expected, water does not enter the polyethylene
matrix; it accumulates at its surface instead, without any preferencial
orientation. The additives studied exhibit remarkably different structures when
they are mixed with the polymer: two of them enter the polymer matrix to
various degrees, either by intercalating their chains with the polyethylene
ones or by forming miscellar-like structures, while the third one stays at the
surface. When water is incorporated into the system, the structure of some of
the additive/polyethylene systems changes. The magnitude and nature of these
changes depend on the relative concentrations of all species. If the additives
are in low concentrations, water stays at the surface of the material, in a
drop-like shape. The additives penetrate and organize the polymer more or less
depending on whether water is present or not. We predict that one of our two
proposed molecules has promising antistatic properties while the other one
could be applied as a slip agent. We hope that our predictions will spark
interest in testing these molecules in the laboratory as polyethylene
additives.

### [49] [Arbitrary mechanical memory encoding via nonlinear waves in bistable metamaterials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20321)
*Audrey A. Watkins,Giovanni Bordiga,Mingxing Mu,Vincent Tournat,Katia Bertoldi*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: Mechanical metamaterials with bistable elements show promise for mechanical memory. Traditional actuation methods are labor-intensive and inflexible. This paper introduces a one-dimensional metamaterial made of mass-in-mass bistable units that can be actuated statically and dynamically to encode mechanical information through nonlinear waves. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that input signals can selectively trigger state transitions remotely and programmatically, enabling bit writing. This approach leverages bistable elements for robustness and nonlinear wave actuation for tunability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for reliable and adaptable methods for storing and transmitting mechanical information in metamaterial systems. With conventional actuation techniques being labor-intensive and inflexible, the development of a new framework becomes essential.

Method: The method involves constructing a one-dimensional mechanical metamaterial comprising mass-in-mass bistable units. These units are statically decoupled but dynamically switchable. The system is actuated using nonlinear waves applied at the boundary. Experiments and computer simulations are conducted to test the system's ability to encode and decode mechanical information by selectively triggering state transitions.

Result: The research successfully demonstrates that tailored input signals can selectively trigger state transitions deep within the structure, enabling remote and programmable bit writing. The system's reliance on nonlinear wave-driven actuation allows for tunability, and the static decoupling of bistable units provides a foundation for mechanical memory applications. This approach opens new possibilities for designing systems with mechanical memory where bistability and tunability can be effectively combined.

Conclusion: This work presents a breakthrough in the field of mechanical memory by introducing a system that combines the robustness of bistable elements with the tunability of nonlinear wave actuation. The demonstrated ability to encode and decode mechanical information through controlled state transitions shows the potential for advancing memory devices in mechanical systems.

Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials composed of bistable elements have recently emerged
as promising platforms for mechanical memory. Traditional approaches to writing
information in these systems typically rely on localized actuation or
predefined coupling schemes, which are often labor-intensive or lack
adaptability. In this work, we introduce a one-dimensional metamaterial
consisting of mass-in-mass bistable units that are statically decoupled yet
dynamically switchable, allowing arbitrary mechanical information to be encoded
through nonlinear waves applied at the boundary of the system. Through a
combination of experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that tailored input
signals can selectively trigger state transitions deep within the structure,
enabling remote and programmable bit writing. This approach opens a new avenue
for mechanical memory, harnessing the robustness of bistable elements and the
tunability of nonlinear wave-driven actuation.

Method: 研究者使用了AdS半径$m{AdS}$和粒子间距离$m{l}_{m{AdS}} m{l}og J$之间的尺度分离，基于AdS中复标量场$mphi$和$m{l} |mphi|^4$耦合，到$O(m{l^2})$，构造了一个有效哈密顿量。具体步骤包括：1. 分割Interaction为长距离非局域势项和短距离局域项；2. 使用$t$通道交换低自旋状态来计算长距离势项；3. 匹配低自旋CFT数据来确定短距离项；4. 描述了这些贡献的评估过程与它们如何与CFT数据相关联。

Conclusion: 该研究为在一般类QFT中应用AdS/CFT对偶提供了方法论，特别是对于不具有大中心荷或稀谱的模型，成功构造了有效哈密顿量，并展示了如何通过匹配CFT数据来理解高自旋系统的动态。这种方法为探索非holographic的类QFT提供了新的途径。

Abstract: We describe how to construct an effective Hamiltonian for leading twist
states in $d\ge 3$ CFTs based on the separation of scales that emerges at large
spin $J$ between the AdS radius $\ell_{\rm AdS}$ and the characteristic
distance $\sim \ell_{\rm AdS} \log J$ between particles rotating in AdS with
angular momentum $J$. As a controlled example, we work specifically with the
toy model of a bulk complex scalar field $\phi$ with a $\lambda |\phi|^4$
coupling in AdS, up to $O(\lambda^2)$. For a given choice of twist cutoff
$\Lambda_\tau$ in the effective theory, interactions are separated into
long-distance nonlocal potential terms, arising from $t$-channel exchange of
states with twist $\le \Lambda_\tau$, and short-distance local terms fixed by
matching to low spin CFT data. At $O(\lambda^2)$, the effective Hamiltonian for
the toy model has two-body nonlocal potential terms from one-loop bulk diagrams
as well as three-body nonlocal potential terms from tree-level exchange of
$\phi$. We describe in detail how these contributions are evaluated and how
they are related to the CFT data entering in the large spin expansion. We
discuss how to apply the construction of such effective Hamiltonians for models
which do not have a large central charge or a sparse spectrum and are not
typically considered holographic.

Abstract: We show how to construct a holographic effective theory for the leading-twist
operators in the $O(2)$ model in the $4-d=\epsilon$ expansion up to
$O(\epsilon^2)$, based on the separation of short-distance and long-distance
effects that arises as a function of spin $J$. We obtain the Hamiltonian of the
theory and show that it correctly reproduces all the dimensions at
$O(\epsilon^2)$ of the leading twist operators for all values of the charge $Q$
and spin $J$. The holographic Hamiltonian is given by the bulk exchange of a
charged scalar $\phi$, neutral scalar $s \sim \phi \phi^*$, and a `ghost' field
$c$, as well as a single local bulk interaction $(\phi \phi^*)^2$. We analyze
various aspects of the spectrum and discuss their interpretation in light of
the bulk description.

Abstract: We introduce a new positive geometry, the associahedral grid, which provides
a geometric realization of the inverse string theory KLT kernel. It captures
the full $\alpha'$-dependence of stringified amplitudes for bi-adjoint scalar
$\phi^3$ theory, pions in the NLSM, and their mixed $\phi$/$\pi$ amplitudes,
reducing to the corresponding field theory amplitudes in the $\alpha'\to 0$
limit. Our results demonstrate how positive geometries can be utilized beyond
rational functions to capture stringy features of amplitudes, such as an
infinite resonance structure. The kinematic $\delta$-shift, recently proposed
to relate field theory $\text{Tr}(\phi^3)$ and NLSM pion amplitudes, naturally
emerges as the leading contribution to the stringy geometry. We show how the
connection between $\text{Tr}(\phi^3)$ and NLSM can be geometrized using the
associahedral grid.

Abstract: It was recently shown that a black hole (or any Killing horizon) will

but equivalent arguments that illustrate how this phenomenon arises: (1)
entanglement with "degrees of freedom" in the interior (2) the absorption of
soft, entangling radiation emitted by the superposition and (3) interactions

ultra low frequency Hawking quanta. The relationship between "soft hair" and

### [55] [$F$-term Multi-Field Inflation in Supergravity without Stabiliser Superfields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20194)
*Jinn-Ouk Gong,Sergei V. Ketov,Takahiro Terada*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Realizing F-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is challenging due to the η-problem. A prevalent approach is to introduce a shift symmetry in the Kähler potential, though this often leads to negative potentials in the large-field regime. To circumvent this, an additional stabilizer superfield with the right interaction is typically incorporated. An alternative method, utilizing a single chiral superfield with inflaton and goldstino components, was previously suggested. This paper extends that approach to multi-superfield inflation models, offering a generic framework for embedding single- and multi-field inflation models in supergravity. Specific multi-field inflation examples are discussed, along with the conditions necessary to prevent tachyonic instabilities during evolution. This work significantly expands the theoretical framework for F-term inflation models in supergravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research tackles the complex challenge of implementing F-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity, which is inherently difficult due to the η-problem. By proposing innovative methods and broadening the theoretical framework, this work contributes to advancing inflationary cosmology within string theory.

Method: The authors employ a method that extends the alternative single-superfield mechanism to multi-superfield models. Employing concrete examples, they clarify the necessary conditions to prevent tachyonic instabilities, effectively avoiding the pitfalls of previous approaches.

Result: The paper successfully extends the single-superfield approach to multi-superfield inflation models, refuting the universality of the negative potential issue. By illustrating the framework with concrete examples, it provides new insights into constructing viable inflationary models in supergravity.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances the field of F-term inflation in supergravity by providing a comprehensive framework for constructing multi-superfield inflation models without the aforementioned issues, opening new avenues for theoretical exploration.

Abstract: Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to
the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to
impose a shift symmetry on the K\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a
negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an
additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired
interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a
stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a
single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field
components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to
multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for
embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into
supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of
multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic
instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens
the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.

TL;DR: 研究否定QCD中$	ext{η}'$态的势函数，发现对大$N$


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究关于$	ext{η}'$态势函数的重要进展，特别是在$N$ 和 $N_f$ 的整除性问题上。

Method: 通过研究$N_f$与$N$的关系，在$N_f = N$时出现相变点而$N_f = N ias 1$时不出现。

Result: 当$N_f$与$N$互质时，$	ext{η}'$态势函数光滑；当$n_f$和$N$不互质时，势函数出现孤立点。

Conclusion: 这表明强相互作用中存在介导相变的可能，支持由相变点和无相变点两种不同情况来区分不同参数区域。

Abstract: The large $N$ analysis of QCD states that the potential for the $\eta'$ meson
develops cusps at $\eta' = \pi / N_f$, $3 \pi /N_f$, $\cdots$, with $N_f$ the
number of flavors. Furthermore, the recent discussion of generalized anomalies
tells us that even for finite $N$ there should be cusps if $N$ and $N_f$ are
not coprime, as one can show that the domain wall configuration of $\eta'$
should support a Chern-Simons theory on it, i.e., domains are not smoothly
connected. On the other hand, there is a supporting argument for
instanton-like, smooth potentials of $\eta'$ from the analyses of softly-broken
supersymmetric QCD for $N_f= N-1$, $N$, and $N+1$. We argue that the analysis
of the $N_f = N$ case should be subject to the above anomaly argument, and thus
there should be a cusp; while the $N_f = N \pm 1$ cases are consistent, as
$N_f$ and $N$ are coprime. We discuss how this cuspy/smooth transition can be
understood. For $N_f< N$, we find that the number of branches of the $\eta'$
potential is $\operatorname{gcd}(N,N_f)$, which is the minimum number allowed
by the anomaly. We also discuss the condition for s-confinement in QCD-like
theories, and find that in general the anomaly matching of the $\theta$
periodicity indicates that s-confinement can only be possible when $N_f$ and
$N$ are coprime. The s-confinement in supersymmetric QCD at $N_f = N+1$ is a
famous example, and the argument generalizes for any number of fermions in the

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the general formalism and properties of the
spacetime density matrix, which captures correlations among different Cauchy
surfaces and can be regarded as a natural generalization of the standard
density matrix defined on a single Cauchy surface. We present the construction
of the spacetime density matrix in general quantum systems and its
representation via the Schwinger Keldysh path integral. We further introduce a
super-operator framework, within which the spacetime density matrix appears as
a special case, and discuss possible generalizations from this perspective. We
also show that the spacetime density matrix satisfies a Liouville von Neumann
type equation of motion. When considering subsystems, a reduced spacetime
density matrix can be defined by tracing over complementary degrees of freedom.
We study the general properties of its moments and, in particular, derive
universal short time behavior of the second moment. We find that coupling
between subsystems plays a crucial role in obtaining nontrivial results.
Assuming weak coupling, we develop a perturbative method to compute the moments
systematically.

Abstract: We examine the giant graviton expansions of the Higgs indices for the 3d

indices for the M5-brane giant gravitons of wrapping number $m$ appearing in
the expansions consist of the contributions that generalize the characters of

characters of the affine Kac-Moody algebras of type $A_{l-1}$. Also we confirm
that the inverse giant graviton expansions of the resulting M5-brane indices
consistently reproduce the Higgs indices.

Abstract: We study the ODE/IM correspondence for two-dimensional conformal field
theories with Virasoro and $\mathcal{W}_N$ symmetry. Building on earlier work
establishing the correspondence, we develop a systematic algorithm for
calculating the eigenvalues of local integrals of motion in terms of the Bethe
roots using formal WKB expansions of wave functions associated to the
differential operators. The method is demonstrated explicitly for Virasoro,
$\mathcal{W}_3$, and $\mathcal{W}_4$ algebras, yielding closed expressions for
the eigenvalues of the first few local quantum KdV Hamiltonians. A key
geometric structure emerging from our analysis is the mirror curve, a
three-punctured sphere that is naturally covered by the WKB curve. We show how
the algebraic properties of the $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry algebras are reflected
in the geometry of these curves, and how period integrals on these curves
reproduce the spectral data of the integrable system. Applications to
Argyres-Douglas minimal models allow us to test the prescription both
analytically and numerically and we find complete agreement between the
calculations in different triality frames. Finally, we examine large rank
limits of ground state eigenvalues and show that they match the genus expansion
of the topological string partition function on $\mathbb{C}^3$.

Result: 结果表明，该方法在精确预测 bulk 和边界行为方面非常有效。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在复杂量子场论问题中应用η最小化方法的潜力，尤其是对于非正定的 bootstrap 问题。

Abstract: The three-dimensional classical O($N$) model with a boundary has received
renewed interest due to the discovery of the extraordinary-log boundary
university class for $2\leq N< N_\text{c}$. The exponent of the spin correlator
and the critical value $N_c$ are related to certain universal amplitudes in the
normal universality class. To determine their precise values, we revisit the 3d
O($N$) boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) for $N=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. After
substantially improving the accuracy of the boundary bootstrap, our
determinations are in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo results,
resolving the previous discrepancies due to low truncation orders. We also use
the recent bulk bootstrap results to derive highly accurate Ising data. Many
bulk and boundary predictions are obtained for the first time. Our results
demonstrate the great potential of the $\eta$ minimization method for many
unexplored non-positive bootstrap problems.

TL;DR: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the classical and quantum 1D sigma model with a flag manifold target space, using a general invariant metric. The authors explicitly describe geodesics using elliptic functions and determine the Laplace-Beltrami spectrum through polynomial Bethe equations, establishing a connection to the Gaudin model which they extend to U(n) cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of sigma models on flag manifolds is crucial for understanding integrable systems and their applications in high-energy physics and condensed matter theory.

Method: The authors employ the use of elliptic functions and a novel mapping to the Gaudin model, alongside algebraic Bethe ansatz techniques to solve the quantum problem.

Result: The paper provides a detailed characterization of geodesics and successfully determines the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, advancing the understanding of integrable sigma models and their associated Gaudin systems.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between classical and quantum integrable systems, offering new insights and tools for future research in sigma models and integrable systems more broadly.

Abstract: We solve the classical and quantum problems for the 1D sigma model with
target space the flag manifold $\mathrm{U}(3)\over \mathrm{U}(1)^3$, equipped
with the most general invariant metric. In particular, we explicitly describe
all geodesics in terms of elliptic functions and demonstrate that the spectrum
of the Laplace-Beltrami operator may be found by solving polynomial (Bethe)
equations. The main technical tool that we use is a mapping between the sigma
model and a Gaudin model, which is also shown to hold in the $\mathrm{U}(n)$
case.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了观测量结构的潜在组合学根源，为深入理解理论物理系统和相关组合结构提供新的视角。

Abstract: We study a class of observables in four-dimensional superconformal
Yang--Mills theories which, in the planar limit at finite 't Hooft coupling,
can be expressed as determinants of semi-infinite matrices built from Bessel
functions. This determinant representation points to an underlying integrable
structure, which we make explicit by showing that the observables satisfy a
nonlinear differential-difference equation. We argue that the solution to this
equation admits an expansion in terms of iterated Chen integrals of uniform
transcendental weight. Remarkably, the coefficients in this expansion are
universal positive integers, independent of the particular observable,
suggesting a hidden combinatorial origin. Building on this observation, we show
that the resulting expressions possess a natural interpretation in enumerative
combinatorics: they coincide with the partition function (or generating
function) of an ensemble of lattice paths constrained to a nontrivial domain.
This correspondence extends and generalizes the classical Dyck paths to a
richer family of path ensembles relevant in gauge theory.

Result: 结果是得到了一系列双线性恒等式，并为高阶代数Uq(sl_n)的情况提供了分析。

Conclusion: 这项研究成功扩展了τ函数的定义域，扩展了其在q变形李代数中的应用。

Abstract: Non-perturbative partition functions of quantum theories constitute a class
of $\tau-$functions, which are distinguished satisfying Hirota's bilinear
identities(BI). To make this statement general, there must be a proper
definition of $\tau-$function that gives rise to a set of bilinear identities.
In the classical definition of $\tau-$function for integrable Toda or KP
hierarchies, there is a restriction on matrix elements to be based on
group-like elements with the comultiplication $\Delta(g)=g \otimes g$. This
restriction can not be straightforwardly transferred to the q-deformed case,
because there are no group-like elements in q-deformed universal enveloping
algebra (UEA), except for its Cartan subalgebra. The new approach to the
$\tau-$function is to remove the restriction on g to be obligatory the
group-like element. The main result of this work is a derivation of the set of
bilinear identities and $\tau-$functions for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_3)$ in the
fundamental representations for non-group-like elements. We consider difference
operators which lead to the basic bilinear identities. Also, we provide an
analysis of the ways of obtaining BI for higher rank algebras $U_q(sl_n)$.

Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the fermion-rotor system, a simple impurity model
in d=1+1 dimensions that consists of a collection of purely right-moving
fermions interacting with a quantum mechanical rotor localised at the origin.
This was first introduced by Polchinski as a toy model for monopole-fermion
scattering and is surprisingly subtle, with ingoing and outgoing fermions
carrying different quantum numbers. We show that the rotor acts as a twist
operator in the low-energy theory, changing the quantum numbers of excitations
that have previously passed through the origin to ensure scattering consistent
with all symmetries.
  We further show how generalisations of this model with multiple rotors and
unequal charges can be viewed as a UV-completion of boundary states for chiral
theories, including the well-studied 3450 model. We compute correlation
functions between ingoing and outgoing fermions and show that fermions dressed
with the rotor degree of freedom act as local operators and create
single-particle states, generalising an earlier result obtained in a theory
with a single rotor and equal charges. Finally, we point out a mod 2 anomaly in
these models that descends from the Witten anomaly in 4d

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the quantization of a single unstable mode in a real scalar
field subject to a Robin boundary condition in (1+1)-dimensional half-Minkowski
spacetime. The instability arises from an imaginary frequency mode - analogous
to that of the inverted harmonic oscillator - requiring the rigged Hilbert
space formalism for consistent quantization. Within this framework, the
unstable mode is naturally described as a well-defined decaying (or growing)
quantum state with a characteristic mean lifetime. We investigate its physical
consequences via the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector along static,
inertial, and uniformly accelerated trajectories. For static and inertial
observers, the detector response exhibits a Breit-Wigner resonance profile,
with a decay width determined by the unstable frequency and a Doppler factor.
In the Neumann limit, infrared divergences emerge from arbitrarily
low-frequency modes. Interestingly, for accelerated detectors, the response
acquires a nontrivial dependence on acceleration, and the Neumann limit yields
a finite, oscillatory signal rather than a divergence, suggesting that
acceleration can act as an effective infrared regulator.

Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic framework to describe gravitational scrambling,
including the semiclassical limit of any out-of-time-order correlation function
that is built out of operator insertions separated by approximately the
scrambling time. In two dimensions, the scrambling algebra, which we call a
modular-twisted product, is defined in terms of two copies of the
Leutheusser-Liu half-sided modular inclusion of von Neumann algebras; these
describe early- and late-time operators respectively. In limits where the
separation between insertions is taken to be either significantly greater or
smaller than the scrambling time, the modular-twisted product reduces,
respectively, to free- and tensor-product algebras that were previously studied
in [arXiv:2209.10454]. In a sense, the modular-twisted product interpolates
between these two products. Including the Hamiltonian in the scrambling algebra
leads to a Type II$_\infty$ von Neumann algebra with finite renormalized
entropies that interpolate between single-QES and multi-QES phases. We also
describe how to generalize the modular-twisted product algebra to higher
dimensions, including spatially localized boundary excitations.

Conclusion: 框架在支撑流形中的作用可以通过其对算子和流的影响来理解，这些发现不仅丰富了框架在流形中的性质，还为强耦合下的弦理论提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We investigate the role of framing in a family of 1/24 BPS Wilson loops in
ABJ(M) theory, which define flows of supersymmetric defect field theories,
interpolating between the 1/6 BPS and the 1/2 BPS superconformal fixed points.
We analyze in perturbation theory how framing affects both the expectation
values of these operators and the correlation functions of local insertions on
the defect, as well as its interplay with RG flow and the g-theorem. We obtain
a non-trivial identity between the one-point function of the defect stress
tensor and a Q-exact correlator, which establishes a direct link between scale
invariance, superconformal invariance and framing, and clarifies the deep
connection between scale and cohomological anomalies. Finally, we propose a
holographic interpretation of framing at strong coupling, identifying it with a
coupling to the background B-field in the dual string theory.

Abstract: We study weakly-coupled descriptions/channel decompositions of the 4d
$\mathcal{N}=2$ theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ of type $\mathfrak{su}(N)$,
from the perspective of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror duals of their circle
compactifications. This is a delicate problem when the channel decomposition
produces pathological, or bad, 4d configurations that correspond to spheres
with non-maximal punctures. The star-shaped quivers, describing the 3d mirrors
associated with such bad 4d configurations, are bad 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$
theories. Leveraging recent results regarding 3d bad theories, we identify a
new and interesting family of bad theories, which we coin \textit{broken}
theories, that naturally arise in this context. Using these broken theories, we
develop a systematic and analytic method that determines the generically
non-Lagrangian matter sectors and the weakly-coupled gauge groups in such
channel decompositions. We understand these weakly-coupled descriptions as
emerging dynamically via Higgs mechanisms triggered by operators acquiring
vacuum expectation values.

Motivation: 研究者进一步发展了 VDAT 在多轨道 Hubbard 模型中的应用，特别是当包含密度密度相互作用时，适合考虑将 Hubbard 物理和 Mott 物理融入计算。

Method: 通过针对 N=3 VDAT 的 qubit 参数化方法，研究者详细描述了这是一个有效的计算工具，适合处理从 N=2 到较大的 N 的情况，尤其适用于研究 Hubbard 物理问题。

Result: 研究者在多轨道 Hubbard 模型中成功应用了 qubit 参数化方法，并通过泰勒展开优化了试能量，揭示了 Hubbard 耦合如何影响 Mott 转变。对于 SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard 模型，他们提供了计算 Mott 转变临界值 U_c 的显式方法，尤其是在轨道数较大时，U_c 可以表示为解析表达式。

Conclusion: 这项研究不仅为理解 Hubbard 物理和 Mott 转换提供了新的计算框架，还为构建能够捕捉这两种物理现象的约简密度矩阵功能奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: The variational discrete action theory (VDAT) at \mathcal{N}=3 is a potent
tool for accurately capturing Mott and Hund physics at zero temperature in
d=\infty at a cost comparable to the Gutzwiller approximation, which is
recovered by VDAT at \mathcal{N}=2. Here we develop a qubit parametrization of
the gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3 for the multiorbital
Hubbard model with general density-density interactions. The qubit
parametrization yields an explicit variational trial energy, and the
variational parameters consist of the momentum density distribution, the shape
of a reference fermi surface, and the pure state of a qubit system with
dimension of the local Hilbert space. To illustrate the power of the qubit
parametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital
Hubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor
series expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how
the Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition. For the case of
the SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard model, an explicit approach for computing the critical
U_{c} for the Mott transition is provided, yielding an analytical expression
for U_{c} in the large N_{orb} limit. Additionally, we provide an analytical
solution for the ground state properties of the single band Hubbard model with
a special density of states. Finally, we demonstrate that the qubit
parametrization can also be applied to \mathcal{N}=2, for both G-type and
B-type variants, where the G-type yields an identical expression to the slave
spin mean-field theory. The qubit parametrization not only improves the
efficiency and transparency of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3, but also provides the key
advances for the construction of a one-body reduced density matrix functional
capable of capturing Mott and Hund physics.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in
a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature
pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of
fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a
spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport
observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.
  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of
ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area
$p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region
of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of
a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of
the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One
route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor
via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal
Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices
surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a
charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement
with experimental data.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional
Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal
regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge'
liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an
extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the
regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum
phase transitions in disordered metals.

Result: 研究者成功推广了这一映射到高维并提出了一种新的bosonization框架。

Conclusion: 新的bosonization方法为研究 Majorana 与spin系统的高维对偶性提供了工具。

Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the
one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner
transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the
minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated
Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped
to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and
higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the
parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary
polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the
gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged)
fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence
of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the
discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying
this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally
invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities
in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW
(self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of
higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization
framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other
known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish
new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.

Abstract: The ideal Weyl 'Hydrogen-atom' semi-metal exhibits only a single pair of Weyl
nodes and no other trivial states at the Fermi energy. Such a material would be
a panacea in the study of Weyl quasi particles allowing direct unambiguous
observation of their topological properties. The alluaudite-like
K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ compound was recently proposed as such a material.
Here we use comprehensive experimental work and first principle calculations to
assess this prediction. We find K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ crystallizes in the
$C2/c$ symmetry with a quasi-1D Mn sublattice, growing as small needle-like
crystals. Bulk properties measurements reveal magnetic transitions at $\approx$
8 and $\approx$ 4 K which neutron scattering experiments show correspond to two
distinct magnetic orders, first a partially ordered ferrimagnetic
$\mathbf{k_1}$= (0, 0, 0) structure at 8 K and a second transition of
$\mathbf{k_2}$= (1, 0, 0) at 4 K to a fully ordered state. Below the second
transition, both ordering vectors are necessary to describe the complex
magnetic structure with modulated spin magnitudes. Both of the best-fit
magnetic structures in this work are found to break the symmetry necessary for
the generation of the Weyl nodes, though one of the magnetic structures allowed
by $\mathbf{k_1}$ does preserve this symmetry. However, the crystals are
optically transparent and ellipsometry measurements reveal a large band-gap,
undermining expectations of semi-metallic behavior. Density functional theory
calculations predict an insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, in contrast
to previous reports, and suggest potential frustration on the magnetic
sublattice. Given the wide tunability of the alluaudite structure we consider
ways to push the system closer to semi-metallic state.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解新型量子统计体提供了新的视角，并为相关物理实现提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles
in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's
parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined
as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example
of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is
presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The
interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization.
Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature
and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional
$R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not
always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further
show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the
bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we
discuss a potential realization of parafermion signatures in one-dimensional
systems.

Abstract: Muon spin relaxation is a powerful technique for probing static and dynamic
local magnetic fields. The strong collision model, based on a
Gaussian-Markovian process, is commonly used to account for dynamical effects.
Yet, it remains limited in describing systems where the local field undergoes
discrete state changes. To address this, I introduce a generalized two-state
strong collision model that explicitly incorporates transitions between
distinct local field environments during fluctuations. This extension allows
for a more accurate representation of dynamical effects, particularly in
systems where each collision alters the underlying static polarisation
function. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented, and the model's
applicability is demonstrated {\color{black}and discussed} across relevant
physical systems -- including low-dimensional magnets, systems with dynamic
disorder and ion and muon diffusion. These results offer an enhanced framework
for interpreting data in complex materials and extend the method's reach to a
broader class of dynamical phenomena in condensed matter physics.

TL;DR: An efficient configuration interaction solver for dynamical mean field theory is developed and applied to cerium in its γ, α, and ε phases, demonstrating its capability to study the evolution of the 4f shell's electronic structure and its transitions between localized and itinerant states, including a Mott transition and an intercepted α-phase Kondo singlet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding correlated electron systems, particularly in transition metals and lanthanides, is crucial for advancing condensed matter physics and materials science. The development of efficient computational methods is essential to tackle the complexity of these systems.

Method: A configuration interaction (CI) solver for dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) is presented. This method improves upon traditional exact diagonalization approaches by enhancing computational efficiency.

Result: The CI-based DMFT solver successfully analyzes the electronic structure of cerium in various phases (γ, α, ε), revealing the transition of the 4f shell's electronic nature and identifying a Mott transition, with the α-phase acting as an intermediary Kondo singlet state.

Conclusion: This work provides a valuable tool for studying strongly correlated electron systems and offers insights into the electronic structure and phase transitions in lanthanide metals like cerium.

Abstract: Accurate calculations of strongly correlated materials remain a formidable
challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly due to the computational
demand of conventional methods. This paper presents an efficient solver for
dynamical mean field theory using configuration interaction (CI). The method is
shown to have improved efficiency compared to traditional, exact
diagonalization approaches. Hence, it provides an accessible, open-source
alternative that can be executed on standard laptop computers or on
supercomputers. The solver is demonstrated on cerium in the $\gamma$-,
$\alpha$- and $\epsilon$-phases. An analysis of how the electronic structure of
Ce evolves as function of lattice compression is made. It is argued that the
electronic structure evolves from a localized nature of the 4f shell in
$\gamma$-Ce to an essentially itinerant nature of the 4f shell of
$\epsilon$-Ce. The transition between these two phases, as function of
compression, can hence be seen as a Mott transition. However, this transition
is intercepted by the strongly correlated $\alpha$-phase of elemental Ce, for
which the 4f shell forms a Kondo singlet.

Abstract: We study the behaviour of edge states in Rice-Mele model with Hubbard
interaction, U , at half-filling using density matrix renormalization group,
exact diagonalization and effective charge dynamics in Kumar representation.
For a fixed dimerization, $\delta$, and staggered potential, V , we find by
increasing U the quasiparticle edge states in the charge gap to come down in
energy from V in the absence of Hubbard interaction to zero energy for U
$\approx$ 2V . This presents an uncommon case where repulsion leads to
zero-energy edge states. Upon increasing U further, the edge state energy
starts increasing again until they are lost in the bulk. However, upon
increasing U even further, these edge states reappear in the high energy gap.
So, with Hubbard interaction, the edge states in Rice-Mele chain transmigrate
from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the spin structures and phase diagram of Na₂BaMn(PO₄)₂ using neutron diffraction and Monte Carlo simulations, considering magnetic fields in different directions.

Motivation: Understanding the spin behavior of triangular-lattice antiferromagnets under magnetic fields is crucial for advancing our knowledge of frustrated magnetism and phase transitions.

Method: The study combines experimental techniques (neutron diffraction) with theoretical simulations (Monte Carlo) to analyze the spin structures and phase diagram of the material.

Result: The experimental and simulation results demonstrate that frustrated interlayer exchange plays a central role in organizing the field-induced phases of Na₂BaMn(PO₄)₂, showing an unexpectedly rich phase diagram.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the spin physics in Na₂BaMn(PO₄)₂ under magnetic fields, emphasizing the importance of interlayer interactions in frustrated systems.

Abstract: We combine single-crystal neutron diffraction studies and Monte Carlo
simulations to determine the spin structures and finite-temperature phase
diagram of the spin-5/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet
Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ in magnetic field. With the application of a magnetic
field in two different directions, namely along the $c$-axis and in the
$ab$-plane of the trigonal symmetry, we track the evolution of the spin
structure through changes of the magnetic propagation vector. We account for
these results with a minimal Heisenberg Hamiltonian that includes easy-axis
anisotropy and weak, frustrated interlayer couplings in addition to intralayer
exchange. Guided by representation analysis, we refine symmetry-allowed modes
to the measured intensities and obtain the spin structures for all
field-induced phases, which we compare quantitatively with simulated
configurations. Taken together, our measurements and simulations show that
frustrated interlayer exchange -- rather than purely 2D physics -- organizes
the unexpectedly rich field-induced phases of Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Collinear laser spectroscopy experiments on fast, neutral beams have been
extensively used for studies on short-lived radioactive nuclei, taking
advantage of its high sensitivity. The resulting resonance line-shape is known
to show significant distortion, due to the energy exchange during the
charge-exchange neutralization process, which can cause large systematic
uncertainty in the determined centroid. A model for the line shape was
constructed and simulated to be compared to measured Al, Si, and Ni hyperfine
spectra. It is shown that the distortion is caused mainly by the transfer of
electron into many different energy levels in the projectile atom and
subsequent decays, rather than secondary inelastic collisions, which were often
assumed in the line shape analysis before. The model can also be applied to
other projectile-alkali pairs, providing a reliable line-shape with less
fitting parameters than conventional phenomenological models.

TL;DR: Helium atoms in a Rydberg state are resonantly coupled to a superconducting microwave resonator, achieving strong coupling in the single-photon regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work aims to demonstrate strong coupling between Rydberg atoms and superconducting circuits, which is essential for quantum information processing and fundamental physics experiments.

Method: Atoms in the 1s50s ^3S₁ state are coupled to a chip-based superconducting coplanar waveguide microwave resonator. A single-photon electric-dipole transition to 1s50p ^3P_J is used, tuned with a second dressing field creating a secondary π-wave. Floquet calculations model the energy level shifts and field effects. Pulsed microwaves are used to drive the interaction, and photon population is monitored through resonance.

Result: The single-photon Rabi frequency is estimated at ~2π×100 Hz, enabling observation of 100% efficient population transfer within 1 microsecond. This represents the first demonstration of strong coupling between Rydberg atoms and superconducting circuits.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens opportunities for quantum photonics, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and hybrid quantum metrology platforms based on superconducting circuits and Rydberg atoms.

Abstract: Helium atoms in the 1s50s $^3$S$_1$ Rydberg level have been resonantly
coupled to the $2\pi\times11.721$ GHz second harmonic mode of a chip-based
superconducting coplanar waveguide microwave resonator. To achieve this, the
single-photon electric-dipole-allowed 1s50s $^3$S$_1\rightarrow$ 1s50p
$^3$P$_J$ transition was tuned into resonance with the resonator mode through
the ac Stark shift induced by a second strong $2\pi\times3.350$ GHz microwave
dressing field. The effects of this dressing field, and residual uncanceled dc
electric fields at the location of the atoms close to the superconducting chip
surface were interpreted with support from Floquet calculations of the energy
level structure of the Rydberg states. To observe appreciable population
transfer in the $1~\mu$s atom-resonator interaction time using this transition,
which had an electric dipole moment of $1500 e a_0$, pulsed microwave fields
were injected into the resonator. From the photon occupation number in the
resonator mode under these conditions, the single-photon Rabi frequency
associated with the coupling of the atoms to the resonator was estimated to be
$\sim2\pi\times100$ Hz. These results represent an important step toward
operation of this Rydberg-atom-superconducting-circuit interface in the
single-photon strong coupling regime.

Abstract: Superradiant laser, which exploits the clock transition of
alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms to generate ultrastable light in the bad-cavity
limit, has garnered much attention in the past few decades. Unlike their odd
counterpart, the even isotopes of alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms possess
simpler structures and longer-lived transitions, which would relax the field
control requirements and enhance the frequency stability of the output light.
However, due to the absence of hyper-fine interaction in even isotopes, the
transition from the state $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{0}$ to $^{1}$S$_{0}$ is strictly
forbidden, leading to a vanishing coupling strength between the cavity mode and
the atoms (the state $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{0}$ as a dark state). In this work, we
suggest a superradiant laser scheme by dressing this dark state with a small
bright component by virtue of a static magnetic field. In contrast to other
proposals utilizing natural atomic transitions, our dressed-state protocol can
work from the crossover regime (coherence in both atoms and photons) to the
superradiant lasing regime (coherence solely in atoms). Specially, by operating
deep into the superradiant lasing regime, our scheme witnesses a dramatic
line-narrowing feature (mHz level) while maintaining its power. Furthermore,
compared to the crossover regime, the laser frequency in the superradiant
lasing regime is more robust against the fluctuations of the cavity length and
magnetic field strength. Our proposal demonstrates the potential for extracting
ultranarrow light from even isotopes of the alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms and
may find its role in frequency stabilization and related precision measurement
scenarios.

the three-dimensional characteristics of the potential well for some benchmark
values of the CRA principal quantum number and beam parameters such as the
frequency, the opening angle and topological charge of the vortex. We
investigate how we can achieve similar trapping effects for different principal
quantum numbers by varying beam parameters. The potential provides a lattice
structure in the beam axis where one CRA could be trapped at each lattice site.

low-frequencies, Thomson scattering -- at the laser frequencies, and radiative
recombination via the three-step process -- at high-order harmonics. The
under-the-barrier dynamics is shown to enhance the Brunel radiation for
near-zero-frequencies in asymmetric laser pulses for spontaneous as well as for

Abstract: We present a high-resolution magnetic imaging system based on a

Abstract: Five-dimensional (5D) optical data storage has emerged as a promising

practical realization is hindered by noise and interference during data
readout. In this work, we develop a high-precision mathematical model for
multi-layer 5D optical storage, grounded in the Jones matrix framework, to
accurately capture polarization transformations induced by stacked birefringent
nanostructures. Building on this model, we propose a 20-frame FiLM-conditioned
U-Net algorithm to reconstruct birefringence parameters--specifically,
slow-axis orientation and retardance magnitude-directly from measured intensity
patterns. Trained on both ideal and noisy datasets, the network demonstrates
robust reconstruction performance under challenging measurement conditions.
Compared with conventional frame-based retrieval approaches, our method
achieves over an order-of-magnitude improvement in reconstruction accuracy. The
proposed model and algorithm can be readily integrated into existing 5D optical
readout systems, offering both a solid theoretical foundation and practical
tools for precise data recovery.

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.

Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright,
ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies.
When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses
with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving
system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in
nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are
orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap
in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis
methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a
diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample
from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental
diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets,
imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the
detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of
the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot.
The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to
data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct
silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a
new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast
phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray
free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.

TL;DR: A new metasurface architecture using stacked spatially uniform metasurfaces with periodic temporal modulation enables compact, versatile, and scalable spacetime solutions for advanced photonic and microwave systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatiotemporal metasurfaces have potential for wave manipulation, but their practicality is limited by in-plane modulation, which requires numerous time-varying elements. This work introduces an alternative architecture to overcome these limitations.

Method: The proposed architecture involves a cascade of spatially uniform metasurfaces subjected to periodic temporal modulation. Each metasurface independently modulates its function to achieve the desired electromagnetic response. The theoretical framework includes dense arrays of cylindrical meta-atoms with time-varying plasma and collision frequencies to design and optimize the stacked metasurface systems.

Result: The approach effectively enables magnet-free isolation at the fundamental frequency and a temporal analogue of circulators. Additionally, it demonstrates that a metasurface stack can be implemented using a few time-modulated elements within a parallel-plate waveguide, leading to compact and scalable systems.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel architecture for spatiotemporal metasurfaces that addresses the limitations of traditional approaches, offering a promising solution for next-generation photonic and microwave systems.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal metasurfaces offer unique opportunities for wave manipulation,
however, their practical realization is often constrained by the requirement
for in-plane spatial modulation, which necessitates a large number of
time-varying elements. In this work, we introduce an alternative architecture
based on a cascade of spatially uniform metasurfaces subjected to periodic
temporal modulation. Although all metasurfaces share the same modulation
frequency, their individual modulation functions are independently engineered
to achieve a desired complex electromagnetic response. We develop a general
theoretical framework for the design and optimization of such stacked
metasurface systems, composed of dense arrays of cylindrical meta-atoms with
time-varying plasma and/or collision frequencies. The effectiveness of the
approach is demonstrated through the optimization of metasurface designs that
enable magnet-free isolation at the fundamental frequency and a temporal
analogue of circulators. Furthermore, we show that a metasurface stack can be
implemented using only a few time-modulated elements embedded within a
parallel-plate waveguide, opening new avenues for extremely compact, versatile,

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving low propagation loss in AlN waveguides, which is crucial for quantum information applications.

Method: Systematic process optimization involving high-resolution lithography, ALD of Al2O3, and RTA.

Result: Record-low loss of 2–3 dB/cm at 850 nm achieved on sapphire substrates.

Conclusion: Successful demonstration of ALD and RTA techniques for AlN waveguide passivation, significantly advancing ultra-sensitivity in photonics research.

Abstract: Aluminum nitride (AlN) has emerged as a leading platform for integrated
photonics in the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges, particularly for
quantum information applications involving trapped atoms. However, achieving
low propagation loss in tightly confining single-mode AlN waveguides remains a
challenge, especially at sub-micron wavelengths where scattering losses scale
unfavorably. In this work, we present a reproducible and detailed fabrication
process for low-loss AlN waveguides on sapphire, achieving a record loss of
2~dB/cm at 852~nm. Our results are enabled by systematic process optimization
including high-resolution electron beam lithography with shape-based proximity
effect correction, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of \ce{Al2O3} for waveguide
surface passivation, and post-fabrication rapid thermal annealing (RTA). We
provide a study of the contributions of each technique to propagation loss
reduction and support our findings with quantitative loss measurements and
comparison with an exhaustive literature review. This work represents the first
detailed report of ALD passivation and post-cladding RTA applied to AlN
waveguides.

Abstract: Programming photonic integrated hardware often reveals as a challenging task
because of the presence of non-idealities in the photonic chip. These include
fabrication imper- fections and parasitic effects such as thermal crosstalk,
which cause unwanted coupling between control signals. Traditional control
methods based on idealized models often fail to account for these phenomana,
leading to significant discrepancies between the desired and actual circuit
behaviour. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach for control- ling
meshes of thermally tuneable Mach Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), which
exploits a machine learning (ML) model trained to compensate for these
non-idealities by pre- adjusting the electrical power given to integrated phase
shifters. The proposed ML system is assessed using synthetic datasets and
experimentally validated on a 3 x 3 triangular MZI mesh. Results demonstrate
that the data-driven controller significantly improves program- ming accuracy,
offering a robust solution for accurate programming of photonic integrated

TL;DR: The paper discusses the extension of topological analysis to nanophotonics, specifically addressing how to incorporate nanophotonic intrinsic effects like nonlocality, strong field confinement, and far-field radiation into the classification of topological states, emphasizing the role of polarization singularities in defining topological invariants.


<details>

Motivation: This paper is intriguing because while topology has proven powerful for controlling light, most topological photonic systems are inspired by condensed-matter analogs. The paper introduces new ideas in nanophotonics, which could lead to significant advancements in both fundamental physics and technology.

Method: The paper reviews the current understanding of topological photonic systems and identifies the Need for a More Comprehensive Theoretical Framework that Accounts for Nanophotonic Effects Such as Nonlocality, Strong Field Confinement, and Far-Field Radiation. It then Discusses How Polarization Singularities May Play a Role in Defining Topological Invariants in the Far Field, Highlighting the Limitations of Bulk Observables Alone.

Result: The paper suggests that traditional approaches to topological band theory for photonic crystals are incomplete when considering nanophotonic effects. By incorporating Polarization Singularities and Far-Field Radiation, a more accurate classification of Topological States can be achieved. This Approach May Lead to the Discovery of New Topological Materials in Photonic Crystals and Advancements in Metamaterials and Plasmonics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the extension of Topological Band Theory to include Polarization Singularities and Far-Field Radiation Effects is Crucial for Understanding and Controlling Topological Photonic States at the Nanoscale. It Outlines a Roadmap for Future Research, Including the Classification of Existing and Emerging Systems that May Leverage these Topological Principles, with Potential Applications in Quantum Computing, Spintronics, Metamaterials, and Plasmonic Technologies.

Abstract: Topology is a powerful framework for controlling and manipulating light,
minimizing detrimental perturbations on the photonic properties. Combining
nanophotonics with topological concepts presents opportunities for both
fundamental physics and technological applications. Although most topological
photonic realizations have been inspired by condensed-matter analogue models,
new topological ideas have just begun to be realized at the nanoscale.
Nanophotonics is characterized by subtle phenomena that are not usually
considered in other topological models' realizations, such as nonlocality,
strong field confinement, and light radiating to the far-field continuum. In
this perspective, we will discuss how standard topological band theory for
photonic crystals needs to be extended by a more comprehensive approach that
properly treats such nanophotonic intrinsic effects and, in particular, the
interplay of polarization and far-field radiation. We highlight the emerging
role that polarization singularities might play in defining the topological
invariants in the far field, which are not fully captured by bulk observables
alone. We conclude by outlining a set of open questions and promising
directions for exploring novel concepts in topological nanophotonics and
shaping next-generation photonic devices.

Abstract: Compact, non-volatile optical switches on silicon platforms are essential for
reconfigurable photonics, but the strong anisotropy of silicon waveguides leads
to polarization-dependent performance. In this paper, we propose a
polarization-independent, non-volatile optical switch utilizing low-loss phase
change material (PCM) Sb2S3. By incorporating Sb2S3 into a multimode slot
waveguide, multimode interference can be efficiently tuned for both TE and TM
polarizations, owing to enhanced light-PCM interaction.
Polarization-independent switching is achieved through the optimal design of
the multimode slot waveguide region. The proposed non-volatile switch
demonstrates a crosstalk (CT) < -21.9 dB and insertion loss (IL) < 0.12 dB at
1550 nm with a multimode section length of 9.67 {\mu}m, which may find
promising applications in reconfigurable photonic circuits for on-chip optical

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scheme for manipulating topological states in fractional optical systems using spiral modulation of the local refraction index. The authors use an analytical approximation and direct simulations to show how spiral modulation enables mutual conversion between eigenmodes with topological charge differences of 1 (Δm=1) and 2 (Δm=2). The conversion between Δm=2 eigenmodes requires an intermediary mode and precise resonance tuning. Additionally, the paper explores the conversion of degenerate modes under azimuthal modulation, finding that modulated degenerate modes exhibit incomplete conversion, evolving into states with odd parity symmetry. The authors also investigate nonlinear effects on mode conversion, revealing a critical nonlinearity-induced resonance-frequency shift that affects conversion efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research stems from the growing interest in topological states and their manipulation in optical systems, which has potential applications in areas such as optical computing and quantum information processing.

Method: The authors employ a combination of analytical approximation using a truncated finite-mode system and direct numerical simulations to study mode conversion in fractional optical systems under spiral modulation.

Result: The key findings of the study include the successful demonstration of mode conversion between eigenmodes with Δm=1 and the requirements for converting Δm=2 eigenmodes, the role of intermediary modes, and the impact of nonlinear effects on conversion efficiency.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how spiral modulation can be used to manipulate topological states in fractional optical systems, with implications for advanced optical devices and technologies.

Abstract: We propose a scheme for manipulations of a variety of topological states in
fractional optical systems through spiral modulation of the local refraction
index. An analytical approximation, based on a truncated finite-mode system,
and direct simulations reveal that the spiral modulation supports direct mutual
conversion between eigenmodes with topological-charge difference \Delta m=1,
driven by the resonant coupling between the modes and the underlying spiral
modulation. The conversion between eigenmodes with \Delta m=2 requires
involvement of an intermediary mode and precise tuning of the resonance
condition. We further explore the conversion of degenerate modes under the
action of azimuthal modulation. Modulated degenerate modes exhibit incomplete
conversion, evolving into intermediate states with odd parity symmetry.
Finally, we examine nonlinear effects on the spiral-modulation-induced mode
conversion, identifying an essential nonlinearity-induced resonance-frequency
shift that critically affects the conversion efficiency.

TL;DR: Terahertz (THz) radiation has growing applications, but efficient generation and detection are still challenges. This paper introduces a single-photon detector using Rydberg atoms to detect and calibrate THz signals across an octave with MHz-level selectivity. The detector achieves intensity sensitivity down to 35.9 fW cm⁻² Hz⁻⁰·⁵ (1.46 fW Hz⁻⁰·⁵) in a single mode operating at room temperature, advancing THz spectroscopy by enabling quantum regime transitions and leveraging optical comb techniques.

Motivation: Terahertz technology is crucial for various applications, yet detection limitations hinder progress. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by developing a novel single-photon detector.

Method: The authors employed a single-photon detector based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate THz signals. The setup spans an octave and features MHz-level selectivity. The detector operates at room temperature, relying on electric field intensity calibration and achieving the stated sensitivity levels.

Result: The detector achieves record-low sensitivity of 35.9 fW cm⁻² Hz⁻⁰·⁵ (1.46 fW Hz⁻⁰·⁵) within a single comb mode, enabling precise and sensitive THz spectroscopy by transitioning into the quantum regime.

Conclusion: This breakthrough brings THz technology closer to mainstream applications by reducing detection limitations and integrating advanced quantum techniques from optical comb research.

Abstract: Terahertz radiation finds an increasing number of applications, yet efficient
generation and detection remain a challenge and an active area of research. In
particular, the precise detection of weak and narrowband terahertz signals is
notoriously difficult. Here, we employ a novel type of single-photon detector
based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate a terahertz frequency comb
over an octave-spanning range, yet with a MHz-level selectivity. We calibrate
the intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic
properties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 35.9
$\mathrm{fW\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.46 $\mathrm{fW\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a
single mode of the frequency comb, all in a room-temperature operated setup.
Our results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the

TL;DR: Nearsighted summary: Bismuth-based 2D transition metal dichalcogenide with high single photon purity and distinguishability for quantum photonics applications - good.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the restriction of telecom band for optical quantum communication and information processing, there is a need for high-quality single photon sources with good emission characteristics in the near-infrared range.

Method: Strain and defect engineering in bilayer MoTe2, combined with electrostatic biasing, enables high-quality single photon sources.

Result: Bilayer MoTe2, after deterministic strain and defect engineering, produces near-infrared quantum emitters with strong linear polarization (>70%), sub-nanosecond lifetimes (<450ps), and high single-photon purity (<0.1 g^{(2)}(0)). Additionally, they exhibit poor resolution-limitation (200 μeV), efficient Stark tunability (3meV), reduced photon bunching, and transform-limited linewidth ratios (R~55). Most notably, they demonstrated the highest reported Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility (10%-40% with post-selection) for TMD quantum emitters, which is the best in near-infrared.

Conclusion: Bilayer MoTe2 is now viable for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources suitable for quantum photonic applications in the telecom band.

Abstract: Single-photon sources operating in the telecom band are fundamental
components for long-distance optical quantum communication and information
processing. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer
a promising platform for such sources, but their development has been hindered
by limited spectral range and poor single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we
demonstrate a reproducible and systematic approach for generating near-infrared
(1090-1200 nm) quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe$_2$ using deterministic strain
and defect engineering. These emitters exhibit strong linear polarization (DOLP
$>70\%$), sub-nanosecond lifetimes ($\tau \leqslant$ ~450 ps), high
single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0)<0.1$), and resolution-limited emission
($\sim$200 $\mu$eV). Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\sim$3
meV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative
lifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to
transform-limited linewidths as low as $R\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon
interference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of
$V_\text{HOM}\sim $10$\%$, and up to $V_\text{HOM}\sim$ 40$\%$ with
post-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported
indistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such
demonstration in the near-infrared regime. These results establish MoTe$_2$ as
a viable platform for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources
with promising indistinguishability, paving the way for their integration into
telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.

Abstract: Efficiently coupling light from optical fibers into photonic integrated
circuits is a key step toward practical photonic devices. While a notable
coupling can be achieved by out of plane couplers such as grating couplers,
their basic planar geometry typically tends to be sensitive to the polarization
of light. This is partly due to the fact that the design spaces of such grating
structures typically fabricated with techniques such as electron beam
lithography are only two dimensional with a simple extrusion into the vertical
dimension. This makes it challenging to optimize for both polarizations
simultaneously, as performance typically degrades when trying to achieve high
efficiency in both. As a result, conventional approaches either suffer from
increased losses or require additional filtering components to account for
different polarizations. In this work, we present a fully three dimensional,
polarization insensitive grating coupler which has a highly efficient simulated
coupling efficiency of over 80% in both polarizations. This performance matches
that of state of the art couplers that are performant for one polarization
only. This comes at the cost of a moderately larger size due to the lower
refractive index materials typically available in 3D nanoprinting. Our design
method uses density based topology optimization with a multi objective approach
that combines electromagnetic simulations with a fictitious heat conduction
model acting as a soft constraint to promote structural integrity. This ensures
that the designed structures are feasible for fabrication. Our work opens new
possibilities for robust 3D photonic devices, enabling advanced integration,
fabrication, and applications across next generation photonics and electronics.

Abstract: Cherenkov radiation enables high-energy particle identification through its
velocity-dependent emission angle, yet conventional detectors fail to detect
momenta beyond tens of GeV/c owing to the absence of natural materials with
near-unity refractive indices. We overcome this limitation by demonstrating
directional Cherenkov radiation from transverse-electric (TE) graphene
plasmons, excited by a swift charged particle travelling above suspended
monolayer graphene. Crucially, TE graphene plasmons exhibit a near-unity mode
index, sustaining high sensitivity of the Cherenkov angle to relativistic
velocities up to the TeV/c regime. The radiation further maintains exceptional
robustness against particle-graphene separation changes, enabled by the TE
mode's low transverse decay rate. This ultracompact platform is electrically
tunable, allowing on-chip, reconfigurable detection of ultrahigh-energy
particles and extending measurable momenta by two orders of magnitude beyond
existing detectors.

Conclusion: 该研究通过重构光阻塞机制，扩展了 q-BIC 在斜入射下的应用，为光子设备开发开辟新途径

Abstract: Chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) have recently emerged in
metaphotonics as resonances that combine ultrahigh quality factors with
near-unity circular polarization. However, these states are typically confined
to the Gamma-point (normal incidence) due to their symmetry-protected origins.
We propose a new mechanism for realizing light-cone-proximal chiral q-BICs at
large oblique angles, enabled by the divergence of the radiative local density
of states near the light cone. Using dielectric metasurfaces with a monoclinic
lattice and broken in-plane mirror symmetry, we demonstrate that tuning the
lattice angle allows for robust control of these resonances. The resulting
chiral q-BICs exhibit near-unity circular dichroism in transmission and fully
circularly polarized emission at angles exceeding 50 degrees from normal. This
approach paves the way for directional chiral lasing at grazing angles and for
photonic devices operating efficiently in off-normal geometries.

Abstract: The tension between measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ locally and the
value inferred from Planck satellite have provided a strong motivation to
explore theoretical frameworks beyond the standard cosmological model
($\Lambda$CDM). To this aim, we investigate the $H_0$ tension in the Rastall
$\Lambda$CDM model (R-$\Lambda$CDM), formulated within the Rastall gravity
framework as a phenomenological extension of General Relativity featuring a
non-conserved energy-momentum tensor. To constrain the cosmological parameters,
we employ a comprehensive combined dataset including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, and the
growth rate of cosmic structures $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$. The estimation of model
parameters is performed via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling within a
Bayesian statistical framework. Our results show that the R-$\Lambda$CDM model,
especially in closed geometry, reduces the $H_0$ tension, bringing the
discrepancy with the local SH0ES measurements down to $1.97\sigma$ to
$2.18\sigma$. However, the tension related to the $\sigma_8$ parameter remains
unresolved.

### [101] [Nonlinear diffusion in relativistic kinetic theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20147)
*Simone Calogero*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper introduces a nonlinear Lorentz-invariant kinetic diffusion equation that aligns with conservation laws for particle number, energy, and momentum. The equilibrium solution converges to the Maxwellian density in the Newtonian limit but doesn't match the Jüttnar distribution typically used in relativistic kinetic theory. The equation is consistent with contracted Bianchi identities and can be coupled with Einstein's equations of general relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to be focusing on developing a kinetic diffusion equation that respects certain physical principles, possibly within the framework of general relativity.

Method: The abstract doesn't provide specific details on how the equation was derived or tested.

Result: The paper presents a new kinetic diffusion equation that is Lorentz-invariant and is consistent with conservation laws. The equilibrium solution is shown to converge to the Maxwellian density in the Newtonian limit. The equation is also consistent with contracted Bianchi identities, indicating it can be integrated with Einstein's equations.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel kinetic diffusion equation that satisfies important physical constraints and is compatible with general relativity.

Abstract: A nonlinear Lorentz invariant kinetic diffusion equation is introduced, which
is consistent with the conservation laws of particles number, energy and
momentum. The equilibrium solution converges to the Maxwellian density in the
Newtonian limit, but it is not given by the J\"uttner distribution commonly
employed in relativistic kinetic theory. The nonlinear kinetic diffusion
equation on a general Lorentzian manifold is consistent with the contracted
Bianchi identities and therefore can be coupled to the Einstein equations of
general relativity.

*Sumanta Chakraborty,Pierre Heidmann,Paolo Pani*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Fermionic Love numbers for Kerr black holes are nonzero for generic spin, unlike bosonic Love numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The purpose of the study is to explore the Love numbers of Kerr black holes perturbed by fermionic fields and compare them to those of bosonic fields.

Method: The researchers derived a closed-form expression for the fermionic Love numbers by analyzing the perturbations of a Kerr black hole with arbitrary angular momentum.

Result: The main finding is that the Love numbers of a black hole perturbed by a fermionic field are nonzero for generic spin, whereas the Love numbers for bosonic perturbations are zero.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate a fundamental difference between fermionic and bosonic perturbations of Kerr black holes, breaking the symmetry that makes Love numbers zero for bosonic fields.

Abstract: Black holes in General Relativity exhibit a remarkable feature: their
response to static scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations --
as quantified by the so-called tidal Love numbers -- vanishes identically. We
present the first exception to this rule: the Love numbers of a black hole
perturbed by a fermionic field are nonzero. We derive a closed-form expression
of these fermionic Love numbers for generic spin in the background of a Kerr
black hole with arbitrary angular momentum. In contrast, we show that the
fermionic dissipation numbers vanish for static perturbations, reflecting the
absence of superradiance for fermions. These results highlight a fundamental
distinction between bosonic and fermionic perturbations, which can be
interpreted as a breaking of the hidden symmetries that underlie the vanishing
of Love numbers in the bosonic sector.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We derive an exact solution representing a Bondi-type stationary accretion of
a kinetic (Vlasov) gas onto the Kerr black hole. The solution is exact in the
sense that relevant physical quantities, such as the particle current density
or the accretion rates, are expressed as explicit integrals, which can be
evaluated numerically. Whereas the angular momentum accretion rate is shown to
vanish exactly, we provide an analytic approximation which allows us to obtain
simple formulas for the mass and energy accretion rates. These formulas are
used to derive characteristic time scales of the black hole mass growth and the
associated spin-down in two different scenarios: assuming that the ambient
energy density is either constant or decreases on a cosmological scale.

Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, where a stellar-mass object orbits a
supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves
for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum
backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in
astrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark
matter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital
dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions
describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time,
and map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of
vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a
Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of
chaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations
around transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise
completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are
extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit
points. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant
point is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing
the lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions. Therefore, they can
subject distinct imprint on gravitational-wave signals, with significant
consequences for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of
astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.

Method: 通过数学模型模拟不同天体环境对引力波尾部和记忆效应的影响，特别是在不同密度和结构环境下的行为变化。

Result: 本研究模拟表明，引力波尾部和记忆效应在经历不同天体环境时会发生短暂的振幅变化。这种变化在密度较高的环境中更为显著。

Conclusion: 引力波的低频尾部和记忆效应受到其运动环境的影响，能够提供有价值的信息，特别是在高密度天体周围发生合并时。

Abstract: Gravitational waves from the coalescence of compact objects carry information
about their dynamics and the spacetime in regions where they are evolving. In
particular, late-time tails and memory effects after the merger are two
low-frequency phenomena, not detectable by current instruments, but which can
be observed by future detectors. Their low-frequency nature could, in
principle, make them more sensitive to larger-scale structures at galactic
length scales. We show that indeed there are transient features, such as
amplitude changes, in both tails and (linear) memory when the merger occurs
while immersed in an astrophysical environment. For realistic galaxies, the
environment's compactness is small enough that the effect is strongly
suppressed, but these effects could become relevant for mergers occurring in
regions with matter overdensities, like the ones recently observed numerically
for wave dark matter. On the other hand, the memory (the difference between the
amplitude asymptotically early and late) and asymptotically late decay are
independent on the properties of the environment.

Abstract: The (degenerate) geometry of event horizons is linked to Carrollian fluids.
We investigate the behavior of event horizons via a perturbative coupling to a
massless scalar field, making connections to Carrollian hydrodynamics with a
driving source, and discuss the fluid equilibration in tandem with the
horizon's relaxation to equilibrium. We observe that after the perturbation
dies off, the Carrollian fluid energy and momentum densities approach
equilibrium as the horizon asymptotically becomes non-expanding. We connect the
equilibration of the Carrollian fluid dual to the black hole horizon through
the expansion of its background geometry.

TL;DR: NGR models inevitably diverge at local horizons, complicating black hole interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding if teleparallel theories can describe black holes is crucial for modeling gravitational phenomena.

Method: Analyzed NGR models by identifying divergence points in torsion scalars near horizons.

Result: All viable NGR models exhibit torsional divergences, complicating black hole models.

Conclusion: NGR lacks a viable black hole framework due to torsional issues.

Abstract: New General Relativity (NGR) is a class of teleparallel theories defined by
three free parameters, effectively reduced to two after appropriate
normalization, which are subject to experimental constraints. In this
framework, matter couples minimally to the metric, ensuring that test particles
follow geodesics and that null congruence expansions can be employed to detect
local horizons. Assuming such horizons exist, we demonstrate that all
physically viable NGR models--including the Teleparallel Equivalent of General
Relativity (TEGR) and the one-parameter Hayashi and Shirafuji model
(1P-H&S)--inevitably exhibit divergences in torsion scalars at the local
horizon. This singular behavior obstructs the interpretation of these models
and their associated teleparallel geometries as black hole configurations.

Abstract: In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed that the well-known special relativistic
limitation that particles cannot travel with velocities higher than light speed
can be bypassed when such trips are considered globally within specific general
relativistic frameworks, using a warped region of spacetime in the shape of a
bubble that transports particles with mass traveling through spacetime with
superluminal speed. Although initial results indicated this scenario as
nonphysical, since it would seem to require negative mass-energy density,
recent theoretical analyses suggest that such a nonphysical situation may not
always be true. This thesis presents newfound solutions for the Einstein field
equations, considering the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime metrics. The central
premise is to study the fluid matter as the gravity source, rather than the
more common vacuum or negative energy sources, to explore the potential for
generating superluminal velocities, or \textit{warp speeds}, through a warped
region in the spacetime. Such solutions have various matter-energy sources:
dust particles, perfect fluid, quasi-perfect fluid with anisotropic pressures,
charged dust, and a perfect fluid within a cosmological constant spacetime.
  A connection between some of these solutions featuring shock waves described
by a Burgers-type equation with a term on the right-hand side of the equation
purely dependent on time is also shown. This could mean warp drives are closely
related to vacuum energy and possibly have topological effects such as shock
waves.

Abstract: High-fidelity gravitational waveform models are essential for realizing the
scientific potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. While
highly accurate, state-of-the-art models often rely on extensive
phenomenological calibrations to numerical relativity (NR) simulations for the
late-inspiral and merger phases, which can limit physical insight and
extrapolation to regions where NR data is sparse. To address this, we introduce
the Spinning Effective-to-Backwards One Body (SEBOB) formalism, a hybrid
approach that combines the well-established Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework
with the analytically-driven Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model, which describes
the merger-ringdown from first principles as a perturbation of the final
remnant black hole. We present two variants building on the state-of-the-art
$\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model: $\texttt{seobnrv5_nrnqc_bob}$, which retains
standard NR-calibrated non-quasi-circular (NQC) corrections and attaches a
BOB-based merger-ringdown; and a more ambitious variant,
$\texttt{seobnrv5_bob}$, which uses BOB to also inform the NQC corrections,
thereby reducing reliance on NR fitting and enabling higher-order
($\mathcal{C}^2$) continuity by construction. Implemented in the open-source
$\texttt{NRPy}$ framework for optimized C-code generation, the SEBOB model is
transparent, extensible, and computationally efficient. By comparing our
waveforms to a large catalog of NR simulations, we demonstrate that SEBOB
yields accuracies comparable to the highly-calibrated $\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$
model, providing a viable pathway towards more physically motivated and robust
waveform models

*Hong-Er Gong,Junlin Qin,Yusen Wang,Bofeng Wu,Zhan-Feng Mai,Sen Guo,Enwei Liang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the optical characteristics of two black hole models under various accretion scenarios and uses the Event Horizon Telescope data to constrain their parameters. The key findings include how quantum effects and magnetic charges alter the black hole shadows' sizes and intensities, as well as how the brightness and photon distributions vary between the two models. Shadows of the Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are narrower and brighter compared to the Ghosh-Kumar model under thin accretion disks, while the photon rings' widths and contributions differ significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the optical properties of black holes is crucial for testing theoretical models and detecting them using interferometric observations like the Event Horizon Telescope.

Method: The authors analyze event horizons, photon spheres, and apply quantum corrections under spherical and thin accretion disks to study shadow properties and integrative intensity.

Result: The quantum-corrected Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole exhibits larger shadows and higher brightness, while the- Ghosh-Kumar black hole shows smaller shadows and lower brightness under certain conditions. The photon ring and lensed ring sizes and intensities vary significantly between the two models.

Conclusion: This paper provides a methodology to distinguish between different black hole models based on their optical characteristics, particularly in thin accretion disks, leveraging interferometric data like that from the Event Horizon Telescope.

Abstract: This paper primarily investigates the optical characteristics of two minimal
Schwarzschild black hole deformations - the Kazakov-Solodukhin and Ghosh-Kumar
black holes - under different accretion models. The event horizon, photon
sphere, and critical impact parameter of the former increase compared with the
Schwarzschild black hole, but those of the latter decrease. The data from the
Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration are used to constrain the parameter
ranges of the two black holes. In the case of spherical accretion, the quantum
correction of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole leads to the increase of black hole
shadow size and the decrease of integrated intensity, while the shadow size of
magnetically charged Ghosh-Kumar black hole decreases and the integrated
intensity increases. The shadow radius of the black hole is independent of the
spherical accretion models. For an optically and geometrically thin accretion
disk, the integrated intensity is mainly contributed by direct emission, and
the contributions of photon rings and lensed rings are very small. In addition,
the photon rings and lensed rings of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are
narrower, while those of Ghosh-Kumar black hole are wider. Whereas the
Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole exhibits higher brightness, the Ghosh-Kumar black
hole shows lower brightness. Additionally, a disk closer to the black hole
correlates with a smaller shadow radius. This paper proposes a method to
distinguish different black holes in a specific thin disk model.

Result: 通过将可Quadrupole变形的黑洞视界Quasi-normal模态纳入计算，我们发现，在Newtonian效应作用下，视界附近会形成稳定的耗散模式。这表明该方法可以在无需平滑函数或其他调整的情况下彻底消除极端状态（infinitely divergent）的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅通过可Quadrupole形就能够消除视界附近的极端状态，还得出该效应可以直接为LISA等未来的大型观测天线提供理论依据。

Abstract: We compute the canonical (brick wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a
quantum black hole whose exterior is described, to first order in a small
quadrupole parameter, by the static $q$-metric, which is an exact vacuum
solution of the Einstein equations. Counting near horizon quasinormal modes
shows that a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet
divergence: the entropy of Hawking radiation is finite for any non-vanishing
quadrupole, without an ad hoc cutoff. Matching this canonical entropy to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy leads to no-hair violating multipoles, at
percent-to-tens-of-percent level, and provides concrete observational targets
for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

Abstract: The curvature singularity problem in $f(R)$ dark energy models poses a
significant challenge to their viability as alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm. In this work, we investigate the possibility of resolving this issue

inflationary phase. We analyze the effects of adding $R^2$,
$R^{\frac{m+2}{m+1}}$ and $\alpha$-attractor representation in $f(R)$ gravity
terms to types of dark energy $f(R)$ models, focusing on their ability to
prevent singularities in high-density environments. Our results demonstrate
that these corrections can effectively stabilize the models, ensuring their
consistency across both inflationary and late-time cosmological scales.

Motivation: To understand the nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole ringdown, we solve the inhomogeneous Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky equation numerically.

Method: Numerically solve the inhomogeneous Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky equation to find second-order gravitational tails induced by an electromagnetic source.

Result: Second-order tails of curvature perturbations with $l

Conclusion: These findings suggest the potential importance of nonlinear electromagnetic effects in black hole ringdown processes, which may be detectable through multi-messenger observations.

Abstract: Amazingly, recent studies indicate that nonlinear effects are of great
significance for modelling black hole ringdown. Transient electromagnetic
events in the astrophysical environment are typically high-energetic,
potentially responsible for some nonlinearities in ringdown. Motivated by the
desire to understand these nonlinearities, we solve the inhomogeneous
Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky equation numerically, and find second-order
gravitational tails induced by an electromagnetic source. Our results suggest
that the second-order tails of curvature perturbations with multipole numbers
$l\geq4$ decay as $t^{-2l-2}$ at fixed spatial position and $u^{-l-3}$ in
retarded-time $u$ at null infinity, slower than their linear counterparts,
which can play a role in multi-messenger observations.

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational memory effect in the full Generalized Proca
gravity, the most general metric theory including a gravitational Proca field
with derivative self-interactions that still maintains second-order equations
of motion. Building on our previous works on memory in other massless and
massive metric theories, we extend a unified framework for computing
displacement memory and apply it to Generalized Proca gravity. We identify two
non-trivial physically distinct classes of background conditions of Generalized
Proca theory within the assumption of asymptotic flatness: a Lorentz-invariant
but massive case, and a Lorentz-violating, massless case. The former exhibits
dispersive scalar and vector modes and allows a Horndeski-like treatment of
memory, while the latter resembles the asymptotic dynamics of
Einstein-{\AE}ther theory including the same Lorentz-breaking effects on
displacement memory. In both cases, we derive the fully gauge invariant and
dynamical second order action, derive the effective stress-energy tensor and
study its contribution to the memory integral. We highlight the distinction
between phase and group velocity in the tensor memory formula sourced by
dispersive propagating modes. Finally, we re-emphasize how observational
constraints on Lorentz violation may be imposed by the structure of the memory
signal.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we investigate bound periodic orbits of timelike particles in
the spacetime of dyonic black holes arising from quasi-topological
electromagnetic theory. By varying the coupling parameter $\alpha_1$, the
corresponding black hole solutions exhibit diverse horizon structures,
including naked singularities and black holes with one to four horizons. We
find that for sufficiently small $\alpha_1$, the metric function $f(r)$ becomes
non-monotonic outside the event horizon in spacetimes with one or two horizons,
while in all other cases, $f(r)$ remains strictly monotonic. In the
non-monotonic regime, the radial effective potential develops a double-barrier
structure, allowing the emergence of multiple marginally bound orbits and
multiple branches of periodic orbits associated with the same rational number
$l$. Although differing in radial structure, these orbit branches are
topologically equivalent. Remarkably, when the outer potential barrier exceeds
unity, bound orbits with energy $E>1$ become possible, in addition to the
standard $E<1$ branches. When the peak reaches $E=1$, up to three distinct
bound orbit branches may coexist. We also identify a novel eccentricity
behavior, the innermost branch becomes increasingly circular with increasing
energy or angular momentum, while outer branches exhibit greater eccentricity
and a larger apastron-periastron separation. These features, absent in previous
studies, are unique signatures of non-monotonic metric functions. In contrast,
monotonic cases yield a single-well potential, a unique marginally bound orbit,
and a single periodic orbit branch per $q$, consistent with earlier findings.
Our results highlight the critical role of the metric function's shape in

Abstract: We analyze gravitational lensing, in particular the shadow and photon rings,
in the Ernst spacetime, also known as the Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime, which
describes a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a homogenous magnetic field.
Although the geodesic equation in this spacetime is chaotic, there are some
relevant features that can be determined analytically. Among other things, we
give analytic formulas for the vertical diameter of the shadow for an observer
at arbitrary inclination and for the horizontal diameter of the shadow for an
observer in the equatorial plane. Moreover, we use the strong-deflection
formalism for analytically calculating the so-called photon rings of order $\ge
2$ and we use the recently introduced gap parameter $\Delta _2$ for
distinguishing lensing of an Ernst black hole from that of a Schwarzschild
black hole.

Abstract: TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational wave detector mission that
employs inter-satellite laser interferometry. Suppressing measurement noise and
achieving high sensitivity require accurate alignment of multiple onboard
interferometers after laser link acquisition. However, due to huge armlengths
and varying point-ahead angles, the fine alignment of the transmitted beams can
be particularly challenging, which needs to take into account both received
laser power and far-field wavefront errors. To tackle this issue for TianQin
which has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment
strategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the
transmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated
through a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding
intensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value
compensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the
proposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad
from the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length
coupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement
given a transmitted beam aberration of $\lambda/40$ RMS.

Abstract: Spatial curvature is one of the fundamental cosmological parameters that is
routinely constrained from observations. The forward modelling of observations,
in particular of large-scale structure, often relies on large cosmological
simulations. While the so-called separate universe approach allows one to
account for the effect of curvature on the expansion rate in small sub-volumes,
the non-Euclidean geometry is harder to accommodate. It becomes important when
observables are computed over large distances, e.g. when photons travel to us
from high redshift. Here we present a fully relativistic framework to run
cosmological simulations for curved spatial geometry. The issue of consistent
boundary conditions is solved by embedding a spherical cap of the curved
spacetime into a hole within a flat exterior, where it can undergo free
expansion. The geometric nature of gravity is made explicit in our framework,
allowing for a consistent forward modelling of observables inside the curved
patch. Our methodology would also work with any Newtonian code to a good
approximation, requiring changes only to the initial conditions and
post-processing.

Abstract: In this investigation, we present a singularity free interior solution of the
Einstein field equation for a class of anisotropic compact objects in
dimensions $D\geq4$. In accordance with the concept of Vaidya and Tikekar, the
geometry of the physical $(D-1)$-space of a star corresponding to $t=constant$
hypersurface is assumed to be of a $(D-1)$ spheroid. For the fulfilment of
causality condition, a limit of the spheroidal parameter ($\lambda$) is noted
depending on the values of amount of anisotropy ($\alpha$) and space-time
dimensions ($D$). We note that by switching off the extra parameters ($\alpha$
and $D$), previously obtained limit of $\lambda$ can be generated. To validate
our findings, we compare the results obtained from our model with observational
data of PSR J1614-2230 (mass=$1.908^{+0.016}_{-0.016}M_{\odot}$,
radius=$11.93^{+0.50}_{-0.50}km$). It is noted that the best fit equation of
state corresponds to polynomial equation of state of the order of five. We use
this finding to develop a density dependent MIT bag model which seems to be
useful for the correct description of compact object in our model. The mass
radius relation shows that our model mimics a wide range of recently observed
pulsars in four and higher dimensions. Furthermore, we also found that our
model exhibits stability according to Generalised TOV equation, Herrera
cracking condition, and the adiabatic index.

Conclusion: 通过引入更高阶的通用不确定性原理，研究了ΛCDM模型的量子修正，所得结果与ΛCDM相当，并支撑了负变形参数的 phantom 阶段描述。

Abstract: We study quantum corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM model model arising from a
minimum measurable length in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We focus on a
higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This
generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified
Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model
that naturally reduces to $\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the
deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario,
analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism
for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ
Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2
release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our
analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive
with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to
some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation
parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative,
which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy
description.

*Erasmo Caponio*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: this paper extends static spherically symmetric spacetimes by considering a Finslerian angular sector, exploring kinematic and dynamical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: elucidating spacetime structure with modified geometry for potential gravitational wave or cosmological applications.

Method: utilizes Killing symmetries and null constraint to derive kinematic relations; applies to Finsler metrics of constant flag curvature; revisits field equations for black hole solutions.

Result: derive model-independent expressions for photon orbits and Sagnac effect; show that standard black hole solutions remain under equatorial restriction.

Conclusion: Finsler correction introduces specific geometric effects, but their imprint on black hole solutions is limited when only equatorial dynamics are considered.

Abstract: We consider static spacetimes in spherical coordinates whose angular sector
is described by a Finsler metric rather than the standard round metric on
$S^2$. Our first contribution is kinematical: keeping the lapse and radial
factors $e^{\nu(r)}$, $e^{\vartheta(r)}$ arbitrary and using only Killing
symmetries and the null constraint, we derive model--independent relations for
circular photon orbits and the effective dynamics. Specializing the Finsler
metric to a positive constant flag curvature Randers sphere we derive exact
expressions for the conserved angular charge and the critical impact parameter,
and we quantify a Finslerian Sagnac--type effect. Our second contribution is
dynamical: we consider the field equations used in the literature to fix
$(e^{\nu},e^{\vartheta})$. We revisit the hairy black hole family in a recent
paper by Nekouee et al. demonstrating that the equatorial restriction employed
in such a work eliminates the genuinely Finslerian features and showing that
the claimed new solutions reproduce previously known results obtained by Ovalle
et al.

TL;DR: The paper's findings: Most compact binary coalescence backgrounds have negligible energy density at 25Hz, with constraints around 2e-9 for 2/3-spectrum and 2.8e-9 for scale-invariant. also limits on various gravity theories and GWTC-4 favorability were set


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the isotropic gravitational wave background is crucial for studying cosmic history, compact binary mergers, and early universe physics

Method: Used advanced LIGO and Virgo data from O1-O4a; cross-correlation analysis for background signals; considered compact binaries, scale-invariant models, and non-standard polarization modes

Result: No significant background found, constraining energy density and other physics

Conclusion: The isotropic gravitational wave background is weak, supporting certain theories while guiding future research directions

Abstract: We present results from the search for an isotropic gravitational-wave
background using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data from O1 through O4a, the
first part of the fourth observing run. This background is the accumulated
signal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes
information about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the
Universe, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from
the early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically
significant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical
scenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3
power-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\Omega_{\rm
GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.0\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement
over previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to
$\Omega_{\rm GW}(25{\rm Hz})\leq 2.8\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x
sensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting
non-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise
sources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with
population models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we
find our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are
approaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits
shown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary
black hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference
results and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background
arising from compact binary coalescences is $\Omega_{\rm CBC}(25{\rm
Hz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest
contribution is due to binary black holes only, $\Omega_{\rm BBH}(25{\rm
Hz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\times 10^{-9}$.

Abstract: The singularities present at the centre of black holes signal a break down of
the classical theory. In this paper, we demonstrate a resolution of the
Schwarzschild-(Anti-)de Sitter singularity by imposing unitary evolution with
respect to unimodular time. Employing the Henneaux-Teitelboim formulation of
unimodular gravity, we perform a canonical quantization on a symmetry-reduced
Schwarzschild-(Anti-) de Sitter model. This leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation
that effectively becomes a Schr\"odinger equation in unimodular time. By
imposing unitarity, we discover a family of quantum theories in which the
classical singularity is resolved. These theories each allow only semiclassical
states corresponding to one mass sign: either positive, negative, or zero.
Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the quantum-corrected
Schwarzschild metric, which is modified by a new length scale $r_{min}$ that
governs the black hole's transition to a white hole.

Abstract: In this paper we obtain and study images of accretion disks around static
spherically symmetric black holes in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity.
Semi-analytic ray-tracing methods in curved spacetime are employed to generate
the images of the disk for different scalar field configurations, including
both Higgs-type potentials and cases without a potential. The resulting images,
including both redshift and intensity maps, are analyzed. The results show that
the scalar field parameters play a significant role in shaping both the direct
and secondary images of the disk, while the inclination angle primarily affects
the asymmetry and brightness distribution. In particular, configurations with
extreme scalar field values lead to cooler and dimmer disk compared to General
Relativity. Furthermore, the structure and angular size of the secondary ring
exhibit noticeable deviations from General Relativity, offering a potential
observational signature. Through direct comparison between hybrid
metric-Palatini gravity and General Relativity images, we conclude that future
high-resolution observations of black hole shadows could effectively
distinguish this modified gravitational theory and constrain underlying scalar
field parameters.

Abstract: The scalar perturbations of thick braneworld models provide critical insights
into their matter-geometry relationship, distinct from tensor modes. This work
systematically investigates quasinormal modes and gravitational echoes from
scalar perturbations in a thick brane model exhibiting internal structure and
brane splitting. Using the WKB method, direct integration, and Bernstein
spectral techniques, we compute quasinormal frequencies across different
parameter regimes, addressing both single and double-barrier effective
potentials. Time-domain evolution of wave packets reveals clear echo signals
for split brane configurations ($s > 1, \delta > 1$), produced by successive
reflections between sub-branes. A key finding is the position-dependence of
echo modes within the extra dimension: observers located on a sub-brane detect
clean periodic signals, whereas those situated between sub-branes observe more
complex, modulated waveforms. This effect offers a distinct signature of the
brane's internal structure. The observed echoes, along with consistent
frequency- and time-domain results, advance the understanding of thick brane
dynamics and open an observational window into warped extra dimensions.
Moreover, the similarity between the effective potential in thick brane
scenarios and those of black holes and wormholes offers valuable perspectives
for studying echo-related phenomena in these gravitational systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A few years ago, Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) formulated the
first causal, stable, strongly hyperbolic, and locally well-posed theory of
first-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics. Since their inception, there
have been several numerical and analytic studies of the BDNK equations which
have revealed their promise in modeling relativistic flows when viscous,
first-order corrections to ideal hydrodynamics are important. In this paper, we
present numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in
Minkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We
numerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite
difference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid
structure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We
present three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of
equilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy
density, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case
with sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though
initialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the
regime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in
the solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This
behavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs
at much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D
conformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities
in solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial
data. The numerical methods we employ on the two-sphere can be readily extended
to include variations in the radial direction, allowing for full ($3+1$)D
simulations of the BDNK equations in astrophysical applications.

### [128] [Distinct weak asymmetric interactions shape human brain functions as probability fluxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20961)
*Yoshiaki Horiike,Shin Fujishiro*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The human brain performs functional computations by subtly modifying asymmetric interactions between brain regions, which allows it to maintain energy efficiency while performing diverse computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The brain's functional computations consume significant energy, but the body as a whole doesn't proportionally increase its energy use with function. This suggests a need to understand how the brain maintains efficiency while performing various tasks.

Method: The study uses empirical data from spontaneous and task-induced brain activity, analyzes probability fluxes, and models the brain using Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions.

Result: The model shows that the human brain's functional computation relies on modifications to asymmetric interactions between brain areas, which allows energy-efficient computation of various functions.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a mechanism by which the brain achieves energy-efficient functional computation through subtle adjustments to brain network interactions.

Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective
behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the
recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks
is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data.
Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by
the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high
energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy
consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not
involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide
repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy
consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by
subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We
first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced
whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the
microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns
depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function
is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the
parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal
that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and
task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and
task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed
probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs
its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction
among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.

Abstract: We compute the second-harmonic response of two-dimensional topological Dirac
semimetals subjected to an external in-plane magnetic field. The quantum
kinetic equation for the Wigner distribution function is derived and then
solved to evaluate the second-order electric-field contributions to the current
density. Both the Berry curvature dipole and the field-induced terms in the
current are analyzed across a broad range of model parameters. We propose that
our theory can be tested experimentally by measuring the dependence of the
anomalous Hall resistivity on the in-plane magnetic field in the surface states
of the topological insulator SnTe, in WTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, as well
as in the Kondo lattice material Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ at very low temperatures.

Abstract: Narrow lines in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of excitons are characteristic
of low-dimensional semiconductors. These lines correspond to the emission of
exciton states in local minima of a potential energy landscape formed by
fluctuations of the local exciton environment in the heterostructure. The
spatial extension of such states was in the nanometer range. In this work, we
present studies of narrow lines in PL spectra of spatially indirect excitons
(IXs) in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure. The narrow lines
vanish with increasing IX density. The disappearance of narrow lines correlates
with the onset of IX transport, indicating that the narrow lines correspond to
localized exciton states. The narrow lines extend over distances reaching
several micrometers and over areas reaching ca. ten percent of the sample area.
This macroscopic spatial extension of the exciton states, corresponding to the
narrow lines, indicates a deviation of the exciton energy landscape from random
potential and shows that the excitons are confined in moir\'e potential with a
weak disorder.

TL;DR: The VP and VTP models for decoherence in quantum transport are not equivalent, only VTP is thermodynamically consistent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding decoherence in quantum systems is key for quantum technology advancements.

Method: The study uses asymmetric coupling and thermal bias conditions to compare VP and VTP models through simulations of a benzene-based molecular junction.

Result: VTP correctly enforces thermodynamic constraints, while VP fails to model decoherence in heat transport even with strong probe coupling.

Conclusion: VTP is essential for accurate quantum transport modeling under asymmetric conditions.

Abstract: Understanding how decoherence influences heat and information flow is
essential for realizing the promise of quantum technologies. Two widely used
models for incorporating decoherence in quantum transport are the voltage probe
(VP), which imposes local charge current conservation, and the
voltage-temperature probe (VTP), which also conserves heat current. Although
these models are often treated as functionally equivalent, we demonstrate that
this equivalence actually exists only under highly symmetric conditions, which
may be challenging to achieve experimentally Under asymmetric coupling or
thermal bias, the VTP respects thermodynamic constraints and enforces
decoherence in both charge and heat channels, while the VP instead acts as a
source or sink of heat. Strikingly, the VP can fail to model decoherence in the
heat transport entirely, even with large probe coupling strengths. Using a
benzene-based molecular junction as a realistic example, we show that these
effects significantly impact the predicted heat transport. These results
establish that the VP and VTP models are not interchangeable: only the VTP
provides a thermodynamically consistent framework for modeling decoherence in
quantum transport.

TL;DR: 量子干涉（QI）可以显著增强热电响应，预测出更高阶的“超级节点”可能带来可扩展的热电导率和效率提升。然而，一个中心问题是，这些特征是否在易损性方面存在固有的脆弱性。通过使用Buttiker电压-温度探头，我们建立了选择有效近节位的规则：有效的近节点阶数由相干和探针辅助通道中最小的决定。因此，超级节点在绝对意义上是易损的，因为它们的传输随阶数呈参数性抑制。但是，一旦出现杂散底部，热电导率、效率和形变因子的抑制分数变得通用且阶数无关。通过苯和双苯基键合计算实例，我们表明环境耦合的几何——通过一个或多个轨道——决定了相干是通过阶数减少还是通过底部构建而丢失。这些结果为 interference 节点的热电响应在易损性下的尺度法则提供了普适性指导。

Abstract: Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with
higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and
efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are
intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $B\"uttiker$ voltage-temperature
probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is
set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are
therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is
parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor
dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of
merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles
with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the
geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many
-- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building.
These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of
interference nodes under dephasing.

Abstract: The topological invariant responsible for the stability of Fermi point/Fermi
surface in homogeneous systems is expressed through the one particle Green
function, which depends on momentum. It is given by an integral over the 3D
hypersurface in momentum space surrounding the Fermi surface. Notion of Fermi
surface may be extended to the non - homogeneous systems using Wigner - Weyl
calculus. The Fermi surface becomes coordinate dependent, it may be defined as
the position of the singularity in momentum space of the Wigner transformed
Green function. Then the topological invariant responsible for the stability of
this Fermi surface is given by the same expression as for the homogeneous case,
in which the Green function is replaced by its Wigner transformation while the
ordinary products are replaced by the Moyal products. We illustrate the
proposed construction by the examples of the systems, in which the given
topological invariant is nontrivial and may be calculated explicitly.

Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological

yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in
free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables
us to define new topological invariants. They result in peculiar topological

zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases.
We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in
subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the
subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose
possible platforms possessing the subspace property.

device exhibits strong electrical control over both refrigeration and
thermoelectric power generation via side gates. We exploit the interplay

nonreciprocal transport, asymmetric cooling and tunable diode-like behavior. To
demonstrate experimental feasibility, we further analyze refrigeration
efficiency and phonon-limited performance in realistic material settings.

quantum oscillations in the liquid's ground state energy, which develops
downward cusps at integer filling factors due to incompressibility. Our

Abstract: The temporal modulation of material parameters enables optical amplification
within linear media. Here we consider the fundamental building block of
plasmonics, a subwavelength metal nanoparticle, and study how temporal
modulation alters the optical response of the frequency-dispersive scatterers.
We show that modulating in time leads to Floquet replicas of the localized
surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle, which can result in light
amplification. We propose a model based on a point-like dipole description of
the time-varying frequency-dispersive nanoparticle that fully captures the
radiative and amplifying properties of the system in the subwavelength regime.
By comparing our simplified model to full Floquet-Mie scattering calculations,
we demonstrate that the optical scattering by the nanoparticle is accurately
described by an analytical two-band model. This allows us to introduce a
two-frequency effective polarizability that fully incorporates the properties
of the localized surface plasmon and its amplifying replica, as well as their
interaction. In addition, we analyze the emergence of the parametric
amplification condition for the modulated nanoparticle, showing that
amplification can be obtained in a broad range of parameters.

Abstract: Femtosecond relativistic electron bunches and micro-bunch trains synchronised
with femtosecond precision to external laser sources are widely sought for
next-generation accelerator and photonic technologies, from extreme UV and
X-ray light sources for materials science, to ultrafast electron diffraction
and future high-energy physics colliders. While few-femtosecond bunches have
been demonstrated, achieving the control, stability and femtosecond-level laser
synchronisation remains critically out of reach. Here we demonstrate a concept
for laser-driven compression of high-energy (35.5 MeV) electron bunches with
temporal synchronisation to a high-power (few-TW) laser system. Laser-generated
multi-cycle terahertz (THz) pulses drive periodic electron energy modulation,
enabling subsequent magnetic compression capable of generating tuneable
picosecond-spaced bunch trains with 30 pC total charge and 50 A peak currents,
or to compress a single bunch by a factor of 27 down to 15 fs duration. The
THz-driven compression simultaneously drives temporal-locking of the bunch to
the THz drive laser, providing a route to femtosecond-level synchronisation,
overcoming the timing jitter inherent to radio-frequency accelerators and
high-power laser systems. This THz technique offers compact and flexible bunch
control with unprecedented temporal synchronisation, opening a pathway to
unlock new capabilities for free electron lasers, ultrafast electron
diffraction and novel plasma accelerators.

Abstract: The study of phase transitions and critical phenomena arising in quantum
driven-dissipative systems, and whether a correspondence can be drawn to their
equilibrium counterparts, is a pressing question in contemporary physics. The
development of large-scale superconducting circuits provides an experimental
platform for these theoretical models. We report an experimental study of a
multi-mode dissipative first-order phase transition in a 1D Bose-Hubbard chain
consisting of 21 superconducting resonators. This phase transition manifests
itself as a simultaneous frequency jump in all resonator modes as the frequency
or power of a pump tone is swept. By measuring the system's emission spectrum
through the transition, we characterize the dim-to-bright phase transition and
construct the full phase diagram. We further perform time-dependent
measurements of the switching between the two phases in the transition region,
from which we corroborate the transition line and extract transition times
ranging from a few ms up to 143~s. Our model, based on single-mode mean-field
theory and cross-Kerr interactions, captures the features at moderate pump
powers and quantitatively reproduces the transition line. Our results open a
new window into non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and mark a step
toward realizing and understanding dissipative phase transitions in the
thermodynamic limit using superconducting quantum circuits.

Abstract: One of the most fascinating properties of topological phases of matter is
their robustness to disorder and imperfections. Although several experimental
techniques have been developed to probe the geometric properties of engineered
topological Bloch bands with cold atoms, they almost exclusively rely on the
translational invariance of the underlying lattice. This prevents direct
studies of topology in the presence of disorder, further hindering an extension
to disordered interacting topological phases. Here, we identify disorder-driven
phase transitions between two distinct Floquet topological phases using the
characteristic properties of topological edge modes with ultracold atoms in
periodically-driven two-dimensional (2D) optical lattices. Our results
constitute an important step towards studying the rich interplay between
topology and disorder with cold atoms. Moreover, our measurements confirm that
disorder indeed favors the anomalous Floquet topological regime over
conventional Hall systems, indicating an enhanced robustness and paving the way
towards observing exotic out-of-equilibrium phases such as the anomalous
Floquet Anderson insulator.

Abstract: Flat-band systems are highly sensitive to external perturbations, providing a
route to study unconventional localization, transport, and spin physics. Lieb
lattice, a two-dimensional geometry with an inherent flat band, exemplifies
this behavior and is experimentally realizable in ultracold atoms, photonic
arrays, and superconducting circuits. In this work, we present a comprehensive
study of magnetic field induced band deformation in the Lieb lattice by jointly
considering orbital Peierls phases and Zeeman spin splitting. A perpendicular
magnetic flux generates Aharonov Bohm caging, confining particles into
localized flat-band states, while Zeeman coupling lifts spin degeneracy and
induces spin-resolved energy shifts. The competition between these two
mechanisms gives rise to rich band restructuring and tunable spin-selective
flat-band phenomena. These results establish the Lieb lattice as a controllable
setting for spin-selective transport and magneticfield engineering in synthetic
quantum platforms such as ultracold atoms, photonic lattices, and
superconducting circuits, offering guiding principles for quantum simulation
and the corresponding experiments, which opens the avenue for controlled
engineering of spin-resolved localization and flat-band physics in synthetic

The suppression of collisional losses and the tunability of dipolar interactions open new possibilities for studying quantum matter and simulating complex many-body systems.

Abstract: Realizing Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules is a long-standing

two-body collisional losses. Here, we report the production of a Bose-Einstein
condensate of ground-state sodium-rubidium molecules via high efficiency
evaporative cooling, with losses suppressed using the dual microwave shielding

polar molecules is crucial for producing the condensate and enables exciting
prospects for future applications. We explore different regimes of dipolar

Abstract: Quantum entanglement exists in nature but is absent in classical physics,
hence it fundamentally distinguishes quantum from classical theories. While
entanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly
more challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we
theoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In
particular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate
two experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite
temperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically
calculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below
which the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is
accessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we
investigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the
vicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with
mutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by
the coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain
generalized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization.
Moreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale
extensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement
between coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is
largely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of
entanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium
regimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive
entanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.

Result: 随系统大小增加，无序增强的Mott局域态混合物转变点递增;在准周期无序下，无明显系统大小依赖性。

Conclusion: 二维系统可能在准周期无序下保持较强的局域态稳定性，而增加系统大小可能进一步增强整体局域性。

Abstract: Disordered quantum many-body systems pose one of the central challenges in
condensed matter physics and quantum information science, as their dynamics are
generally intractable for classical computation. Many-body localization (MBL),
hypothesized to evade thermalization indefinitely under strong disorder,
exemplifies this difficulty. Here, we study the stability of MBL in two
dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices with variable system sizes
up to $24\times 24$ sites, well beyond the classically simulable regime. Using
the imbalance as a probe, we trace the long-time dynamics under two distinctive
disorder potentials: quasiperiodic and random disorder. For random disorder,
the MBL crossover point shifts to higher disorder strength with increasing
system size, consistent with the avalanche scenario. In contrast, with
quasiperiodic disorder, we observe no clear system size dependence, suggesting
possible stability of MBL in two dimensions.

Abstract: Experiments with ultracold quantum gases are a rapidly advancing research
field with many applications in fundamental physics and quantum technology.
Here, we report on a high-flux generation of Bose-Einstein condensate mixtures
of $^{41}$K and $^{87}$Rb, using a fully integrated sounding rocket setup. We
investigate the release and the free expansion of the quantum mixtures for
different orientations to gravity. The release dynamics are governed by the
mixture interactions as well as the decaying magnetic field during the release.
The latter can be minimized by a dedicated switch-off protocol of the trap
generating currents where an exact model enabled us to characterize the
interaction effects. Our results establish a new benchmark for generating
ultracold mixtures on mobile platforms, with direct relevance for future
experiments on interacting quantum gases and tests of the equivalence principle
in space.
