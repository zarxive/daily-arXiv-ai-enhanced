Beyond critical\nstrain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator\noccurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we\nidentify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and\nCr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the\ntopological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic\nWeyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism\nand higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling\ntopological spintronics with cornertronics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u81ea\u65cb\u9501\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e8c\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u76f8\u53d8\u4e34\u754c\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599CrO\u548cCr\u2082Se\u2082O\u2082\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e8c\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u5355\u8f74\u5e94\u53d8\u6253\u7834\u4e86S_x y\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u65cb\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u89d2\u843d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u5165\u89d2\u843d\u534a\u6781\u5316\u4e8c\u6b21\u62d3\u6251\u4f53\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u81ea\u65cb\u591a\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u94ec\u6c27\u548c\u94ec\u998f\u77f3\u6c27\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u80fd electronically polarized\u4e8c\u7ef4\u81ea\u65cb\u4f53\u548c\u89d2\u8d28\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5668\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f55\u65f6\u6750\u6599\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u81ea\u65cb\u4f53\u3002"}}

While previous studies have\nfocused primarily on dipolar and contact-interacting systems, quadrupolar\ncondensates remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we explore the\nformation, structural properties, and dynamical behaviors of quantum droplets\nin a two-component quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a\nquasi-two-dimensional geometry. Analytical results obtained via the\nThomas-Fermi approximation predict flat-topped density profiles and linear\nscaling between effective area and particle number.

Furthermore, vortex quantum\ndroplets exhibit anisotropic elliptical morphologies due to the directional\nnature of QQIs, with their aspect ratios significantly tunable by varying the\nparticle number and quadrupolar interaction strength.

Here we establish the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By\ncombining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic\nT-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a\nDirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter\ninteraction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge\ncurrents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even\nbright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder;\nand (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit\na universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution\nsimulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be\nconverted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains\ncoherent over long time scales.

High harmonic generation (HHG) has long\nbeen a successful and widely used technique in producing extreme ultraviolet\nAPTs. While in the soft X-ray regime, HHG suffers from low conversion\nefficiency and lacking flexibility in the waveform and spectrum control. Here\nin this study, based on the waveform synthesis of the echo-enabled harmonic\ngeneration (EEHG) free-electron laser (FEL), we propose a novel method that can\ngenerate soft X-ray APTs with high temporal and spectral tunability. EEHG\nscheme is well-known in forming phase-locked high harmonic bunching combs down\nto the soft X-ray regime. And We can facilitate successive FEL lasing in\nseveral different harmonic numbers and then perform the coherent waveform\nsynthesis to generate soft X-ray APTs.

While in certain scenarios with a finite\nnumber of inputs the answer is yes, we prove that if a model must reproduce all\nprojective measurements, then for any qubit-qudit state the answer is no. In\nfact, a qubit-qudit under projective measurements admits an LHV model with\noutcome communication if and only if it already admits an LHV model without\ncommunication. On the other hand, we also show that when restricted sets of\nmeasurements are considered (for instance, when the qubit measurements are in\nthe upper hemisphere of the Bloch ball), outcome communication does offer an\nadvantage. This exemplifies that trivial properties in standard LHV scenarios,\nsuch as deterministic measurements and outcome-relabelling, play a crucial role\nin the outcome communication scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72\u6bd4\u7279\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u51ed\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u6240\u6709\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u9020\u7279\u5b9a\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684LHV\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5141\u8bb8\u4e24\u6bd4\u7279\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u6240\u6709\u67d0\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u51ed\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u9650\u5236\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We derive the spectral self-energy and\nimplement the framework directly on the real-frequency axis within the Keldysh\nnonequilibrium Green's function formalism, enabling the treatment of both\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states without relying on numerical\nanalytic continuation. As an application, we demonstrate that a pseudogap can\nemerge in the bilayer Hubbard model when spin, charge, or excitonic\nfluctuations become sufficiently strong. Instabilities in different channels\nare also evaluated in an unbiased manner across the parameter space.\nRemarkably, we find that the excitonic susceptibility grows with increasing\ninterlayer bias, before it gets suppressed at large biases by the charge\nimbalance between the layers.

We further provide\noperational criteria for witnessing temporal correlations due to quantum memory\nthrough RB experiments. Importantly, while classical correlations may remain\nundetectable in the ASF data, they can nonetheless significantly affect\nworst-case errors quantified by the diamond norm, a metric central to fault\ntolerant quantum computing.

Before\nreaching equilibrium, however, they can transiently exhibit long-lived\nprethermal states that host exotic nonequilibrium phenomena, such as discrete\ntime crystals (DTCs). In this study, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of\nperiodically driven product states in a kicked Ising model implemented on the\nIBM Quantum Eagle and Heron processors. By using ancilla qubits to mediate\ninteractions, we construct Kagome and Lieb lattices on superconducting qubits\nwith heavy-hex connectivity. We identify two distinct types of noise-induced\nDTCs on Kagome and Lieb lattices, both arising from quantum noise in ancilla\nqubits. Type-I DTCs originate from robust boundary-mode period-doubling\noscillations, stabilized by symmetry charge pumping, that are redistributed\ninto the bulk due to ancilla noise. Type-II DTCs, in contrast, emerge in\nsystems without charge-pumped qubits, where quantum noise unexpectedly\nstabilizes period-doubling oscillations that would otherwise rapidly decay. On\nthe noisier Eagle device (ibm_kyiv), we observe both type-I and type-II DTCs on\n53-qubit Kagome lattices with and without charge-pumped qubits, respectively.\nIn contrast, on the lower-noise Heron device (ibm_marrakesh), period-doubling\noscillations are confined to boundary-localized oscillations on 82-qubit Kagome\nand 40-qubit Lieb lattices, as redistribution into the bulk is suppressed.\nThese experimental findings are supported by noisy matrix-product-state\nsimulations, in which ancilla noise is modeled as random sign flips in the\ntwo-qubit gate rotation angles.

However,\nlike most QKD protocols, their performance is limited when experimental\nparameters, such as modulation variance, are optimised based on stationary\nchannel assumptions. In fluctuating environments, such as free-space links,\nthis can result in sub-optimal key rates and reduced transmission distances. In\nthis work, we introduce Gaussian post-selection into the SQCC framework,\nenabling a software-based optimisation of the modulation variance after channel\nestimation. This passive approach enhances key rates in both asymptotic and\nfinite-size regimes without requiring hardware modifications and remains\neffective even when receiver imperfections are taken into account.

Experimental results demonstrate that NCF achieves an average\nreduction of 57.4%, 49.1%, and 49.0% in T-gate count, T-gate depth, and\nClifford count, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6NCF\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e2dHamiltonian\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684T\u95e8\u8ba1\u6570\u548cT\u95e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cHamiltonian\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6548\u7387\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5212\u5206Pauli\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7ec4\u7684\u65b0\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6NCF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Pauli\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5206\u7ec4\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5171\u8f6d\u53d8\u6362\u5230\u53d7\u9650\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u7efc\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11T\u95e8\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cNCF\u5728T\u95e8\u8ba1\u6570\u3001T\u95e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u548cClifford\u8ba1\u6570\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8657.4%\u300149.1%\u548c49.0%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6NCF\u5728\u51cf\u5c11Hamiltonian\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684T\u95e8\u8ba1\u6570\u548cT\u95e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Perfect state transfer (PST)\nand remote entanglement generation are notable examples, as they serve as key\nprimitives in quantum information processing.

Assisted by\ninverse engineering, we begin with a noise-resilient energy spectrum and\nconstruct a class of Hamiltonians, referred to as the dome model, that\nsignificantly improves the system's robustness against noise, as confirmed by\nnumerical simulations. This model introduces a tunable parameter $m$ that\nmodifies the energy-level spacing and gives rise to a well-structured\nHamiltonian. It reduces to the conventional PST model at $m=0$ and simplifies\nto a SWAP model involving only two end qubits in the large-$m$ regime.
