In this work, a field-material couple neural network (FMCNN) is proposed to retrieve the complex dielectric constant directly from THz measurements. The FMCNN consists of a field neural network and a material neural network that are strongly coupled through the frequency-domain Maxwell equations in the form of a Helmholtz equation, with the governing physics enforced by partial differential equation (PDE) and boundary condition constraints. This formulation enables prior-free and data-free inversion, requiring only measured test data as input. The extracted dielectric constants are validated by comparison with results from a one-dimensional normal-incidence model and the Drude-Lorentz model, showing good agreement over a broad frequency range, particularly above 0.2 THz. These results demonstrate that the FMCNN provides a physics-consistent and data-efficient approach for material parameter extraction in the THz band, offering an alternative to conventional model-based methods."}

A fully standardized and centralized workflow is demonstrated, from sample production and delivery, to metadata and data handling, generating seventy-five concatenated datasets shared among all partners. Their integrated analysis shows that scientific conclusions depend critically on both the observable chosen to describe electrode properties, and the measurement technique employed. Individual experiments provide detailed information into specific aspects, such as crystal structures, redox activity, surface processes, morphology, etc., but can also function as binary diagnostic tool. Two-dimensional observable-technique patterns are introduced, in which each pixel encodes a yes, no or uncertain answer to a given scientific question. These patterns serve as multi-property metaviews, e.g. visual genotypes, enabling to classify material behavior and technique suitability according to predefined user demand and criteria, highlighting the interdependencies between measurement choices, extracted parameters and scientific interpretation.

We applied this framework to several cavity families composed of smooth, edge-free components, including globally twisted cavities with control-point-defined cross-sections realised in both linear and ring configurations, cavities defined by the intersection of orthogonal prisms, sphere-subtracted cylindrical cavities, and parametrised surface resonators. Two gradient-free optimisation strategies, a genetic algorithm and Bayesian optimisation, were independently employed to explore compact sets of design parameters for these geometries and to optimise a scaled-helicity figure of merit for the dominant helical mode, evaluated via finite-element eigenmode analysis.

For a UV/IR-regularised classical scalar field, we address this question directly at the level of phase-space dynamics by identifying the minimal symplectic dimension required to reproduce a single trajectory by an autonomous Hamiltonian system. Using symplectic model order reduction as a structure-preserving diagnostic, we show that for the free scalar field this minimal dimension is controlled not by the volume-extensive number of discretised field variables, but by the much smaller number of distinct normal-mode frequencies below the ultraviolet cutoff. In flat space, this leads to an area-type scaling with the size of the region, up to slowly varying corrections. On geodesic balls in maximally symmetric curved spaces, positive curvature induces mild super-area growth, while negative curvature suppresses the scaling, with the flat result recovered smoothly in the small-curvature limit. Numerical experiments further indicate that this behaviour persists in weakly interacting $λφ^4$ theory over quasi-integrable time scales. Beyond counting, the reduced dynamics exhibits a distinctive internal structure: it decomposes into independent oscillator blocks, while linear combinations of these blocks generate a larger family of apparent field modes whose Poisson brackets are governed by a projector rather than the identity. This reveals a purely classical and dynamical mechanism by which overlapping degrees of freedom arise, without modifying canonical structures by hand. Our results provide a controlled field-theoretic setting in which area-type scaling and overlap phenomena can be studied prior to quantisation, helping to identify which aspects of such structures--often discussed in holographic contexts--can already arise from classical Hamiltonian dynamics."}

Stable stationary solutions for multipole QDs with different values of the topological charge (vorticity $S$) are shaped as necklace-like modes, with the number of \\textquotedblleft beads\" (multipole's order) $n=2S$, up to $S=6$. The stability area of the multipoles shrinks with the increase of $S$.

For these very massive systems, there can be regions of parameter space in which the $(\\ell, |m|)=(2,\\,2)$ modes are no longer dominant with respect to higher-order ones.

We model an 88-variable portfolio optimization involving carbon sequestration, biodiversity connectivity, and social impact metrics, executed on intermediate-scale IBM Quantum hardware (ibm_torino and ibm_fez). The results of seven independent hardware runs demonstrate that the QAOA+ZNE workflow consistently outperforms a classical greedy baseline. The quantum method achieves a mean portfolio score of 58.47 +/- 6.98, corresponding to a 31.6% improvement over the classical heuristic (44.42), with high statistical significance (p = 0.0009) and a large effect size (Cohen's d = 2.01), where ZNE yields extrapolated expectation values of the portfolio objective rather than a discrete portfolio solution without noise. A validation run conducted after a 13-day interval confirms the temporal stability of the methodology against hardware calibration drifts. These findings establish empirical quantum utility in an environmental science context, showing that current NISQ-era devices, when coupled with rigorous error mitigation, can identify complex territorial synergies that myopic classical approaches overlook.

Applying this technique to transition metal dichalcogenide moiré semicondutors, we predict itinerant ferromagnetism in WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ and an antiferromagnetic insulator in twisted $Γ$-valley homobilayer, using the same neural network without any physics input beyond the microscopic Hamiltonian. Crucially, both types of magnetic states are obtained from a single calculation within the $S_z=0$ sector, removing the need to compute and compare multiple $S_z$ sectors.

In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications."}

Optical frequency standards are attractive for their improved stability over their microwave counterparts; however, increased complexities have anchored them in the laboratory. Sacrificing sensitivity of the most stable optical clocks has led to the recent development of deployable and portable optical frequency standards, leveraging hot atomic or molecular vapor. The short term limit for a majority of previous reports on two-photon rubidium standards is either the shot-noise or intermodulation limit hindering the one second fractional frequency stability to around $1\\times10^{-13}/\\sqrtτ$. The answer for the shot-noise limit is to increase optical power and collected fluorescence, while the intermodulation limit solution requires improvements in laser linewidth, stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) lasers are known to reduce frequency noise, suppressing noise of the pump laser at high ofset frequencies. We investigate an optical frequency standard based on the two-photon transition in $^{87}$Rb probed with a narrow linewidth photonic integrated circuit SBS laser with a quality factor over 130 million and instantaneous linewidth $<$ 10 Hz. The use of a narrow linewidth clock laser coupled with operating at higher optical intensities yields clock instabilities of $2\\times10^{-14}$ at one second, currently the best reported short-term stability for a two-photon rubidium optical frequency standard."}

The result exhibits a threshold; any remaining subsystem larger than $N/2$ recovers the full QFI, while smaller subsystems contain negligible information. We link this threshold to the scrambling-induced transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement and the associated growth of the Schmidt rank.

The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary.

While polaritonic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures have been extensively explored in the mid-infrared frequency range, their behaviour at the visible frequencies remains largely unexplored, in part due to the lack of knowledge on natural materials supporting anisotropic and highly confined visible-range polaritons. In this context, MoOCl$_2$, an anisotropic van der Waals metal, is particularly interesting, since it supports hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (PPs) that enable directional propagation and subwavelength light compression. Here, we investigate the strategy for launching anisotropic PPs in MoOCl$_2$ in the visible frequency range using gold rod nanoantennas. The nanoantennas, placed on top of the MoOCl$_2$ crystal, excite in-plane anisotropic PP modes, effectively overcoming the momentum mismatch between waves in free-space and nanoscale PPs. We demonstrate a strong electromagnetic field confinement, angle-dependent absorption, and controlled anisotropic PP launching enabled by gold nanoantennas, highlighting the potential of MoOCl$_2$ as a compact platform for nanoscale waveguiding and optical signal processing. By providing a practical antenna-based strategy for exciting visible-range PPs, this work addresses the lack of compact elements for optical signal manipulation and opens new opportunities for optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals polaritonics."}

Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry.

We define a general information-backflow functional N_I associated with an information quantity I(t) and derive sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow (N_I = 0) in terms of divisibility properties of the instantaneous TCL generator. We further introduce a decomposition of backflow into classical and intrinsic thermo-field entanglement contributions, leading to a classification of transient overshoot and revival phenomena in a model-independent manner. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are discussed as analytically tractable examples, recovering Mittag-Leffler fractional relaxation as a universal envelope.

It is demonstrated that the interaction-induced Hartree dispersion plays a decisive role in determining the momentum sector of low-energy spin polarons.

Hyperbolic polaritons (HPs) $-$ hybrid light-matter excitations in materials with opposite-signed dielectric permittivity tensor components $-$ offer a solution through their ability to support deep sub-wavelength confinement and unique optical phenomena such as canalization and negative refraction. To date, however, the most widely studied hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) crystals, including hBN and $α$-MoO$_3$, operate mainly in the mid-infrared, leaving the telecommunication bands (1260$-$1675 nm) largely uncovered. Here, we predict HPs operating directly in the telecommunication window in the vdW crystal molybdenum oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Building on recent evidence that MoOCl$_2$ can support plasmon polaritons in the visible, we theoretically investigate its optical response at telecom wavelengths and identify the conditions under which strongly confined, canalized HPs modes emerge. Beyond establishing a telecom platform, we outline device-level opportunities enabled by these modes, including diffraction-free waveguides based on canalization, tunable polaritonic crystals, and high-efficiency spontaneous emission-enhancement platforms.

This remarkable result was first shown by Hawking for a non-spinning black hole using general relativity to describe the black hole gravitational field and quantum field theory to describe the radiation. Since then the temperature of a spinning Kerr black hole has been calculated. There have also been many heuristic derivations for the temperature. In this work we derive the temperature of a Kerr spinning black hole using only classical general relativity and thermodynamics. It is very similar to Ref. 11 but is mathematically simpler and more self-contained. Our purpose is mainly pedagogical, to be more accessible to students and non-specialists with a knowledge of general relativity. We also call further attention to the expected explosive evaporation of small black holes, not yet observed, which would be an almost unique window into Planck scale physics. Finally, we discuss the idea that the cosmological dark matter, whose nature is currently unknown, may be composed of small primordial black hole remnants."}

Starting from a topological generalization of generalized probabilistic theories, we consider probability assignments defined as functions of an operational transition probability between pure states. We show that under three operationally motivated requirements: no superluminal signaling, availability of normal steering via purification in a sigma additive sense, and sigma affinity of probabilities under countable preparation mixtures, any admissible rule within this class must reduce to the identity. In particular, nonlinear deviations generically enable operational signaling distinctions in steering scenarios, while continuity combined with sigma affinity excludes non affine alternatives. This identifies a unique causal fixed point. Within this class of probability rules, the Born rule emerges as the only assignment compatible with no signaling in operational theories admitting normal steering. We connect the operational result to standard infinite-dimensional quantum mechanics through the normal state space of von Neumann algebras and the GNS representation, recovering the conventional Born rule for projective and generalized measurements. We discuss the scope of the assumptions and implications for proposed post quantum modifications in continuous variable and quantum field theoretic regimes."}

While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question.

First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\\,μ\\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\\,μ\\text{s}$.

In optics, customized spatiotemporally structured optical fields, especially spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV), offer the potential to tailor light via coupled space-time degrees of freedom. However, the interaction mechanisms between multiple transverse orbital angular momentum singularities within a single wave packet remain elusive. This study explores the intrinsic dynamics of a STOV with three phase singularities, observing a pronounced vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning the temporal dispersion. We show that these phenomena originate from the counterintuitive spatiotemporal attractive effect between vortices, which is closely related to the singularity distance. Furthermore, the stretching into filaments and annihilation behaviors is observed by introducing antivortex in the center of the wavepacket. Experimentally, we propose a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method that enables the complete, single-shot capture of wave packets, with excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of transverse spatiotemporal singularities within a single wave packet are reported here for the first time. These findings confirm the existence of interesting interactions between STOV singularities, deepen our understanding of photonics and open a new direction for investigating the complex dynamics of vortex singularities in the spatiotemporal domain."}

Here, we demonstrate a passive and reconfigurable approach for generating trajectory-engineered THz curved beams using inverse-designed bilayer diffractive optical elements (DOEs). Two phase-only diffractive layers are optimized using gradient-based inverse design to produce predetermined curved propagation paths. Reconfiguration is achieved by a 180° rotation of the second layer, which modifies the effective phase profile of the cascaded structure without altering the incident wave or individual layer designs. The proposed system can produce distinct curved trajectories with controlled transverse displacement and beam confinement, as confirmed by scalar diffraction simulations and experimental measurements. Overall, this work establishes inverse-designed cascaded DOEs as a compact and scalable platform for reconfigurable trajectory control of THz beams, providing a flexible alternative to analytic self-accelerating beams for radiative near-field THz communications."}

We present a geometric model that captures this competition, together with an algorithm to solve the equations numerically. Our algorithm introduces a new extension of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellation in space. We extract the parameters for the model from experimental data on the enzymatic depolymerization by hydrolase LCC-ICCG of PET bottle flakes and textile waste, in order to make a prediction of the observed degradation yield as a function of time. Both the final yield and the degradation kinetics are correctly predicted. Most importantly, the model clarifies how and to which extent nucleating agents, impurities, additives, and/or rapid crystal growth present in the waste can undermine pretreatment efforts aiming to initiate depolymerisation from a material with a low initial crystallinity."}

A physical continuum limit of dynamical triangulations requires a suitable generalization of the double-scaling limit of random matrices.

We search for corresponding fixed points in order-4 random tensor models associated to dynamical triangulations in 4 dimensions. In a $O(N)^{\\otimes 4}$ symmetric setting, we discuss the resulting phase portrait as a function of the regulator parameters. We optimize our results, identifying parameter values for which the results are minimally sensitive to parameter changes. We find three fixed-point candidates: only one of them is real across the entire parameter range, but only has two relevant directions. This should be contrasted with the university class of the Reuter fixed point in continuum quantum gravity, very likely characterized by three relevant directions. We conclude that simple combinatorial models of Euclidean triangulations and the Reuter fixed point most likely lie in different universality classes."}

Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers a generic quadratic reduction in sample complexity 1/sqrt(p) vs 1/p, but applying it to steady-state queueing networks in challenging: classical simulations involve unbounded state spaces and random regeneration cycles, whereas quantum circuits have fixed depth and finite registers.\n  In this paper, we develop a framework for quantum simulation of delay tail probabilities based on truncated regenerative simulation. We show that regenerative rare-event estimators can be reformulated as deterministic, reversible functions of finite random seeds by truncating regeneration cycles. To control the resulting bias, we use Lyapunov drift and concentration arguments to derive exponential tail bounds on regeneration times. This allows the truncation horizon--and hence the quantum circuit depth--to be chosen such that the bias is provably negligible compared to the statistical error. The proposed framework enables quantum estimation in models with countably infinite state spaces, avoiding the challenge of determining the sufficient mixing time required for direct finite-horizon simulation. We provide bounds on qubit and circuit complexity for a GI-GI-1 queue, a wireless network under MaxWeight scheduling, and a multi-server system with Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) routing."}

We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings.

A sufficiently large positive cosmological constant, $Λ$, sets the future asymptotic horizon scale of the observable Universe, $\\sim$$Λ^{-1/2}$, thereby implying that the observable Universe may simply be a minute patch of a far larger pre-existing one, hereafter a Small Patch Hypothesis. Importantly, this observational bound is purely geometric; regardless of when the Universe is observed, the maximum accessible scale is finite and fixed by $Λ$, independent of inflationary dynamics, anthropic arguments, or assumptions about the global hosting spacetime. In this sense, inflation becomes one viable realization of the proposed Small Patch Hypothesis. Here, one particular non-inflationary alternative is considered for illustrative purposes in which a primordial spectrum grows logarithmically toward large scales, and in fact diverges at some finite $k_{c}$. If $k_{c}\\ll Λ^{-1/2}$, then our local cosmic patch probes only the linear regime and appears exceptionally smooth. Over the comparatively narrow observable window, this power spectrum mimics a slightly red-tilted, inflation-like spectrum. Rather than introducing high-energy new fields, this perspective frames large-scale homogeneity, isotropy, Gaussianity, adiabaticity, and the observed thermodynamic Arrow of Time as possible consequences of restricted observational access to a much larger Universe in equilibrium, rather than signatures of a unique early-Universe mechanism.

This formulation identifies the appropriate thermodynamic entropy in nonequilibrium quantum processes as the energy entropy associated with energy measurements, demonstrating that the von Neumann entropy does not, in general, represent thermodynamic entropy away from equilibrium. Within this framework, dynamical temperature, free energy, work, and heat are consistently defined, and both the first and second laws are shown to hold far from equilibrium.

These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits.

Specific-heat data show a broadened Curie anomaly in the $α$-UH$3$ rich hydride samples, consistent with a distribution of $T\\mathrm{C}$ values arising from ferromagnetic inhomogeneities. Specific heat also reveals a monotonic decrease in the Sommerfeld coefficient with increasing Hf concentration, reflecting a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, especially in (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$. The resistivity of (UH$3$)${0.60}$Hf${0.40}$ is very large, exhibits a robust negative temperature coefficient over 2--300 K, and shows only weak magnetoresistance, placing transport in a strongly incoherent, disorder-dominated regime."}

Conventional plasmonic approaches typically enhance chirality at the cost of amplifying achiral attraction and heating. Here, we overcome this trade-off by exploiting longitudinal Mie resonances in silicon nanodisks. By employing an Azimuthally-Radially Polarized Beam (ARPB) illumination, we selectively excite longitudinal Mie resonances, with strong optical chirality gradients and comparatively uniform electric field intensities. Specifically, magnetic quadrupole (MQ) resonances, effectively decouple enantioselective forces from the achiral background, providing uniquely favorable conditions for enantioselective optical trapping. Combining full-wave simulations with Kramers' escape-rate theory, we demonstrate a robust trapping system that is both thermally stable and highly selective. We predict trapping selectivity ratios above 100 for particles with Pasteur parameters $|κ| \\geq$ 0.03 and maintain selectivities above 2 even for weakly chiral analytes ($|κ| \\approx$ 0.006). These results establish longitudinal Mie resonances in high-index dielectric nanostructures as a promising, non-invasive platform for all-optical chiral analysis and enantiomer separation."}

The key mechanism is the introduction of moiré potentials for the band-edge carriers induced by the lateral modulation of interlayer interactions. This trapping potential results in the formation of flat bands, which enhances the strong correlation effect. However, a full understanding of the origin of this intriguing potential remains elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the origin of moiré potentials in both R-type and H-type moiré patterns formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. We show that both lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer contribute significantly to the formation of moiré potentials. In particular, the lattice reconstruction induces a nonuniform local strain, which creates an energy modulation of 200 meV for the conduction band-edge state located at WS$_2$ layer and 20 meV for the valence band-edge state located at WSe$_2$ layer. In addition, the lattice reconstruction also introduces a piezopotential energy, whose amplitude ranges from 40 meV to 90 meV depending on the stacking and band-edge carrier. The interlayer charge transfer induces a built-in electric field, resulting in an energy modulation of 80 meV for an R-type moiré and 40 meV for an H-type moiré. Taking into account both effects from lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer, the formation of moiré potential is well understood for both R-type and H-type moirés. This trapping potential localizes the wavefunctions of conduction and valence bands around the same moiré site for an R-type moiré, while around different moiré site for an H-type one."}

In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications."}

Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in α-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high.

Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed."}

Here, we propose generalized CRIT via a spinor representation with dual-channel gauge fields, enabling fully programmable CRIT featuring dynamical spectral engineering. We generalize the traditional EIT framework by introducing a spinor representation of bright- and dark-mode resonances, yielding a unified description of design parameters through universal unitary operations. Implementing a coupled-resonator building block that accesses the entire design space through dual-channel gauge fields, we demonstrate a programmable slow-light band in a one-dimensional CRIT lattice.

The traditional approach uses N-shaped and Z-shaped schedules, selecting the orientation in each plaquette to avoid hook errors aligned with logical operators. However, this becomes increasingly complex within lattice surgery primitives with varied boundary geometries, and requires a 7-step schedule to avoid gate collisions. We propose the diagonal schedule, which orients hook errors along the diagonal of each plaquette. These diagonal errors crucially never align with logical operators regardless of boundary orientation, achieving full code distance. The diagonal schedule is globally uniform: all X-type plaquettes use one schedule and all Z-type plaquettes use another, eliminating geometry-dependent planning. On hardware supporting parallel measurement, reset, and gate operations, the schedule achieves a minimal period of 6 time steps, compared to 7 for the traditional approach. We demonstrate effectiveness for memory experiments, spatial junctions, spatial Hadamard gates, and patch rotation, showing equivalent or improved logical error rates while simplifying circuit construction."}

Our simulations reveal the emission of hundreds of harmonics under realistic conditions, with amplitudes far exceeding those obtained in light-driven schemes.

First, we compute corrections to the strong coupling (i.e., double-exchange) spin wave dispersion of itinerant ferromagnets. We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction. We show that in the case of the Kane-Mele honeycomb lattice Kondo ferromagnet this leads to topological magnon bands, and discuss the implications of this result for itinerant ferromagnets more broadly."}

Theoretically, half of the observed value can be attributed to the exchange enhancement of SOS in a finite-density electron gas, but explaining the rest requires refining the DFT approach. As the conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$ is set by a delicate balance between the contribution of sulphur $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals and $d_{z^2}-d_{xz}$ and $d_{z^2}-d_{yz}$ mixing in molybdenum, we use a DFT+U+V framework for fine-tuning the orbital composition of the relevant band-edge states. An optimised choice of Hubbard U/V parameters produces close agreement with the experimentally observed conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$, simultaneously resulting in the valence-band SOS and the quasi-particle band gap which are closer to their values established in the earlier-published experiments."}

For a UV/IR-regularised classical scalar field, we address this question directly at the level of phase-space dynamics by identifying the minimal symplectic dimension required to reproduce a single trajectory by an autonomous Hamiltonian system. Using symplectic model order reduction as a structure-preserving diagnostic, we show that for the free scalar field this minimal dimension is controlled not by the volume-extensive number of discretised field variables, but by the much smaller number of distinct normal-mode frequencies below the ultraviolet cutoff. In flat space, this leads to an area-type scaling with the size of the region, up to slowly varying corrections. On geodesic balls in maximally symmetric curved spaces, positive curvature induces mild super-area growth, while negative curvature suppresses the scaling, with the flat result recovered smoothly in the small-curvature limit. Numerical experiments further indicate that this behaviour persists in weakly interacting $λφ^4$ theory over quasi-integrable time scales. Beyond counting, the reduced dynamics exhibits a distinctive internal structure: it decomposes into independent oscillator blocks, while linear combinations of these blocks generate a larger family of apparent field modes whose Poisson brackets are governed by a projector rather than the identity. This reveals a purely classical and dynamical mechanism by which overlapping degrees of freedom arise, without modifying canonical structures by hand. Our results provide a controlled field-theoretic setting in which area-type scaling and overlap phenomena can be studied prior to quantisation, helping to identify which aspects of such structures--often discussed in holographic contexts--can already arise from classical Hamiltonian dynamics."}

We study a squeezed-photon model with single- and two-photon losses, realizing weak and strong symmetries in the simplest possible setting.

Our one-loop Keldysh analysis, together with cumulant-expansion numerics, reveals sharply different critical scaling with respect to the thermodynamic scaling parameter. This establishes that weak and strong symmetries lead to distinct dynamical universality classes despite originating from the same symmetry group in the closed system. Our results provide a clear quantitative demonstration that strong symmetries fundamentally reshape dissipative criticality."}

In addition, we study the source-induced emission of gravitational waves from a binary black-hole system. We show that the gravitational waveform preserves the standard quadrupolar amplitude and polarization structure, while Lorentz-violating effects enter exclusively through a modification of the retarded time. As a result, the spatial components of the metric perturbation $h_{ij}(t,r)$ acquire a phase shift determined by the SME coefficients.

We show that graviton detection probabilities enable the discrimination between squeezed, coherent, and thermal radiation.

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms."}

We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced."}

Using Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) and lensless digital holographic microscopy with pixel super-resolution (LDHM-PSR), we demonstrate markedly improved high-throughput visualization of microstructural features after GTS immersion compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

A physical continuum limit of dynamical triangulations requires a suitable generalization of the double-scaling limit of random matrices.

We search for corresponding fixed points in order-4 random tensor models associated to dynamical triangulations in 4 dimensions. In a $O(N)^{\\otimes 4}$ symmetric setting, we discuss the resulting phase portrait as a function of the regulator parameters. We optimize our results, identifying parameter values for which the results are minimally sensitive to parameter changes. We find three fixed-point candidates: only one of them is real across the entire parameter range, but only has two relevant directions. This should be contrasted with the university class of the Reuter fixed point in continuum quantum gravity, very likely characterized by three relevant directions. We conclude that simple combinatorial models of Euclidean triangulations and the Reuter fixed point most likely lie in different universality classes."}

In quantum systems, numerous works have demonstrated this phenomenon under both non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindblad evolution. However, despite considerable progress, the physical mechanism behind it has been a subject of debate. In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points."}

We test our formulas using numerical results from direct calculations in black hole perturbation theory. The central idea of our approach is to utilize as a strong-field diagnostic the known form of divergence in the radiated energy along geodesics near the parameter-space separatrix between scattering and plunge. The dominant, logarithmic term of this divergence can be expressed in terms of instantaneous energy fluxes calculated along the unstable circular geodesics that form the separatrix, fluxes that we obtain using interpolation of highly accurate numerical data.

In optics, customized spatiotemporally structured optical fields, especially spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV), offer the potential to tailor light via coupled space-time degrees of freedom.

This study explores the intrinsic dynamics of a STOV with three phase singularities, observing a pronounced vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning the temporal dispersion. We show that these phenomena originate from the counterintuitive spatiotemporal attractive effect between vortices, which is closely related to the singularity distance. Furthermore, the stretching into filaments and annihilation behaviors is observed by introducing antivortex in the center of the wavepacket. Experimentally, we propose a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method that enables the complete, single-shot capture of wave packets, with excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of transverse spatiotemporal singularities within a single wave packet are reported here for the first time.

In this work, we study embedding strategies for trainable embedding quantum physics-informed neural networks (TE-QPINNs) in the context of nonlinear reaction-diffusion (RD) systems. We introduce an extended TE-QPINN (x-TE-QPINN) architecture that supports both classical and fully quantum embeddings, enabling a controlled comparison between feedforward neural network-based feature maps and parameterized quantum circuit embeddings. The first architecture is the classical embedding feed-forward neural network-based TE-QPINN (FNN-TE-QPINN), while the latter variant is a purely quantum one, referred to as quantum embedding neural network-based TE-QPINN (QNN-TE-QPINN). The proposed framework employs hardware-efficient variational quantum circuits and species-specific readout operators to approximate coupled multi-field dynamics while enforcing governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions through a physics-informed loss function. By isolating the embedding mechanism while keeping the variational ansatz, loss formulation, and optimization procedure fixed, we analyze the impact of embedding design on gradient structure, parameter scaling, and quantum resource requirements. Numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional RD equations demonstrate that quantum embeddings can replace classical embeddings without degradation in solution accuracy and, in certain regimes, exhibit improved optimization behavior compared to classical PINNs and hybrid quantum models with fixed embeddings.

Their high energy cost in electronic processors motivate scalable photonic computing approaches that reduce the energy required per operation. Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) is a dominant photonic platform due to its large electro-optic effect. However, it lacks nonvolatile index tuning mechanisms, which promise to pave the way for energy-efficient photonic computing. Here, we explore electrochemical lithiation as a route to nonvolatile matrix-vector multiplications in TFLN. The LiNbO3 phase is stable at room temperature over a 2% Li composition window with an associated composition-dependent refractive index. We computationally demonstrate this as a programmable, low-loss approach to perform matrix-vector multiplications by using composition to control matrix weights. We design Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform image processing tasks under realistic material loss constraints. We also design microring resonators for iterative weight updates, using gradient descent training to program target matrix operations with matrix-vector multiplication accuracy validated at 1.5% average relative error. These demonstrations show a facile route towards nonvolatile photonic computing in TFLN, addressing a critical requirement for energy-efficient photonic matrix operations at scale."}

We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced."}

Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery."}

We show that in quantum illumination, the achievable advantage is determined by an interplay between initial entanglement and discord. First, we rigorously show that the quantum advantage for a given state equals the amount of discord consumed for illumination. Subsequently, we find that states with identical initial discord can lead to varying advantages, indicating that the usable portion of discord for illumination depends on additional structural features of the state. Then, we consider the relation between the advantage and both entanglement and discord by performing a conditional extremal analysis. To this end, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial discord, we compute the maximum and minimum initial entanglement within each cluster. We demonstrate that, for states with fixed initial discord, the maximum (and not minimum) entanglement increases by increment of the advantage. We conclude that for any given initial discord, higher entanglement is a sufficient (but not necessary) resource for higher advantage. On the other hand, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial entanglement, we compute the maximum and minimum initial discord in each group. Here, the minimum (and not always maximum) discord scales monotonically with advantage. It shows that, for fixed initial entanglement, higher discord is a necessary (but not always sufficient) resource for higher advantage. This result provides a refined, operational perspective on how different forms of quantum correlations govern the performance of the illumination protocol. We finally find a persistent linear dependence of the advantage on initial discord in the high-noise regime, highlighting discord as the key resource for resilience to noise in the protocol."}

Fundamentally, this challenge arises from the lack of strong non-linearities on the single-photon level, meaning that photonic state preparation based on linear optics cannot benefit from the deterministic gate-based approach available to other physical platforms. Instead, the preparation of quantum states can be probabilistically implemented using single photons, linear-optical networks, and photon detection. However, determining whether an input state can be transformed into a target state using a specific measurement pattern - a problem that can be mapped to deciding the feasibility of a system of polynomial equations - is a complex problem in general. To solve it, we apply the Nullstellensatz Linear Algebra algorithm from algebraic geometry to quantum state generation; this can provide definitive no-go results by proving infeasibility when the state preparation task in question has no solution. We demonstrate this capability to validate and establish lower bounds on the physical resource requirements for the realization of several ubiquitous optical states and gates."}

Rather than replacing classical kernels, the quantum subroutine functions as a cooperative accelerator that selectively suppresses low-energy spectral components responsible for slow classical convergence. We analyze the total runtime and resource requirements of this integrated quantum-HPC platform for the 3D Poisson equation. A central feature of QACG is a controllable decomposition of the condition number between the quantum and the classical solver, enabling flexible allocation of computational effort across quantum and classical resources. Under explicit architectural assumptions, we identify regimes in which this cooperative strategy yields a runtime advantage over purely classical approaches while requiring substantially fewer quantum resources than end-to-end quantum linear solvers.

This work proposes a sample- and gate-efficient fidelity estimation algorithm that is affordable within feasible quantum devices. We show that the fidelity estimation with pure states close to the structure of phase states, for which sample-efficient DFE is limited by their strong entanglement and magic, can be done by using $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ sampling copies, with a single $n$-qubit fan-out gate.

Such a drastic improvement stems from a crucial step in our scheme, the so-called phase stripping, which can significantly reduce the target-state magic. Furthermore, we convert a complex diagonal gate resource, which is needed to design a phase-stripping-adapted algorithm, into nonlinear classical post-processing of Pauli measurements so that we only require a single fan-out gate. Additionally, as another variant using the nonlinear post-processing, we propose a nonlinear extension of the conventional DFE scheme. Here, the sampling reduction compared to DFE is also guaranteed, while preserving the Pauli measurement as the only circuit resource. We expect our work to contribute to establishing noise-resilient quantum algorithms by enabling a significant reduction in sampling overhead for fidelity estimation under the restricted gate resources, and ultimately to clarifying a fundamental gap between the resource overhead required to understand complex physical properties and that required to generate them."}

In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories.

The classical multinomial is recovered when all photons enter through a single port, the coherent sum degenerating to a single term with no interference; the quantum family is not a generalization in the Askey sense but a parallel family that departs from classical statistics through the coherence of the amplitude summation. The $r$-th factorial moment carries a squared multinomial coefficient in place of the classical single one, the extra factor arising from the two copies of the amplitude expansion whose indices the Fock state forces to agree; for the beam splitter, the third cumulant is invariant under bosonic interference and the quantum departure first appears in the fourth cumulant as negative excess kurtosis; for multiport interferometers, however, three-body interference breaks this invariance and the departure enters already at the third cumulant. Cross-mode covariances involve the phases of the scattering matrix through coherence terms that strengthen output anti-correlations beyond the classical value; together with the squared-coefficient signature in the single-mode moments, these provide low-order statistical witnesses for boson sampling verification without requiring the full permanent computation."}

Our results clarify the underlying mechanism and establish gravity as a coherence-to-entanglement conversion channel, offering a refined interpretive basis for forthcoming experimental tests.

Here, by investigating how local dissipative environments coupled separately to each qubit affect the steering properties geometrized by the QSE within an exact non-Markovian framework, we find that the geometry of each party's QSE is closely tied to whether a bound state forms in the energy spectrum of the total qubit-environment system. We systematically examine the characteristics of QSEs under three distinct scenarios: two-sided bound states, one-sided bound states, and no bound state, revealing a diverse range of steering types.

This bistable phase is characterized by the coexistence of superradiant and antiferromagnetic orders, and it converts a ground-state triple point into a tetracritical point, at which the boundaries of the first- and second-order transitions intersect.

We show that this indistinguishability, together with probability normalization and action additivity, selects complex amplitudes and unitary evolution as the minimal continuous representation compatible with action additivity, probability normalization, and inference under finite resolution. Quantum interference and unitarity therefore emerge as consequences of these assumptions rather than independent postulates. From the resulting propagator, the Lagrangian, Hilbert-space structure, and Schrödinger equation follow as derived consequences.

The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes.

For a UV/IR-regularised classical scalar field, we address this question directly at the level of phase-space dynamics by identifying the minimal symplectic dimension required to reproduce a single trajectory by an autonomous Hamiltonian system. Using symplectic model order reduction as a structure-preserving diagnostic, we show that for the free scalar field this minimal dimension is controlled not by the volume-extensive number of discretised field variables, but by the much smaller number of distinct normal-mode frequencies below the ultraviolet cutoff. In flat space, this leads to an area-type scaling with the size of the region, up to slowly varying corrections. On geodesic balls in maximally symmetric curved spaces, positive curvature induces mild super-area growth, while negative curvature suppresses the scaling, with the flat result recovered smoothly in the small-curvature limit. Numerical experiments further indicate that this behaviour persists in weakly interacting $λφ^4$ theory over quasi-integrable time scales. Beyond counting, the reduced dynamics exhibits a distinctive internal structure: it decomposes into independent oscillator blocks, while linear combinations of these blocks generate a larger family of apparent field modes whose Poisson brackets are governed by a projector rather than the identity. This reveals a purely classical and dynamical mechanism by which overlapping degrees of freedom arise, without modifying canonical structures by hand. Our results provide a controlled field-theoretic setting in which area-type scaling and overlap phenomena can be studied prior to quantisation, helping to identify which aspects of such structures--often discussed in holographic contexts--can already arise from classical Hamiltonian dynamics."}

However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation.

This distinction clarifies discrepancies between $g$-factors extracted with the two methods, for different orbital states and different hole numbers. Furthermore, we find gate-tunability of $g$-factors at the level of 15%, highlighting its relevance for all-electric qubit manipulation."}
