This detector prototypes a new modular\ndesign for a liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC), comprised of a\ntwo-by-two array of four modules, each further segmented into two\noptically-isolated LArTPCs. The 2x2 Demonstrator features a number of\npioneering technologies, including a low-profile resistive field shell to\nestablish drift fields, native 3D ionization pixelated imaging, and a\nhigh-coverage dielectric light readout system. The 2.4 tonne active mass\ndetector is flanked upstream and downstream by supplemental solid-scintillator\ntracking planes, repurposed from the MINERvA experiment, which track ionizing\nparticles exiting the argon volume. The antineutrino beam data collected by the\ndetector over a 4.5 day period in 2024 include over 30,000 neutrino\ninteractions in the LAr active volume-the first neutrino interactions reported\nby a DUNE detector prototype.

Here we consider the\nanalytic continuation of real solutions of KdV and investigate the role that\ncomplex-plane singularities play in early-time solutions on the real line. We\napply techniques of exponential asymptotics to derive the small-time behaviour\nfor dispersive waves that propagate in one direction, and demonstrate how the\namplitude, wavelength and speed of these waves depend on the strength and\nlocation of double-pole singularities of the initial condition in the complex\nplane. Using matched asymptotic expansions in the limit $t\\rightarrow 0^+$, we\nshow how complex singularities of the time-dependent solution of the KdV\nequation emerge from these double-pole singularities. Generically, their speed\nas they move from their initial position is of $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-2/3})$, while\nthe direction in which these singularities propagate initially is dictated by a\nPainlev\\'{e} II (P$_{\\mathrm{II}}$) problem with decreasing tritronqu\\'{e}e\nsolutions.

In the self-organized phase the\ncavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation\nin the density.

These systems, dubbed altermagnets,\nhave been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from\nARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year.\nInelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of\nmagnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in\nMnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of\nthe splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of\nneutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to\nmeasure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct\ncharacterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In\nthis article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal\nantiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material\nis, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in\nthis material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar\ncoupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the\ndipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased\nsample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross\nsection that reverses sign between the two magnon modes.

By\nbenchmarking across materials, we find that the quasiparticle density in\n{\\alpha}-Ta is approximately one-third that of NbN at equivalent normalised\ntemperatures (T/Tc), directly correlating with reduced microwave loss.

The method was introduced\n(in 2016) to improve on the simple additivity rule according to which\nscattering cross sections for a molecular target can be obtained by summing up\nthe cross sections of the constituent atoms. The key idea of the IAM-PCM is the\ninclusion of weight factors in the summation, to be determined from a\ngeometrical interpretation of the resultant cross section as a combined area of\noverlapping atomic contributions, which is calculated via a pixelization\ntechnique. We argue here that the IAM-PCM can be conceptualized in a different\nbut equivalent way by associating each pixel in the area decomposition with a\nscattering event. The calculation of net and charge-state correlated capture\nand ionization cross sections is explained, and results for 10 keV to 10 MeV\nproton impact are discussed for a number of targets ranging from compact\nten-electron systems to large biomolecules. A previously observed scaling\nbehaviour of the net ionization cross sections is revisited and shown to be\ncaptured by a simple parametrization with remarkable accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to\nfew parameters, which are known only at the leading order in the perturbative\nexpansions. The major challenges are from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with\nthree external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to\ncompute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point\ncorrelators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs\ngenerates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and it\nclosely relates to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify\nthe subgraph expansions of the conserved current 3-point correlators using the\nexact results in 3D. We demonstrate that the multi-loop 3-point Feynman\nintegrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions.\nDue to the constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep the first\nfew terms of the subgraphs to completely fix the subleading order corrections.\nWe apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to the current\ncorrelators $\\langle JJJ\\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the\nGross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the\ncoefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\\langle\nJJ\\sigma_{T}\\rangle$ and $\\langle JJ\\sigma\\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$\nvector model.

We welcome all comments", "summary": "Field theories of the composite-fermion (CF) metal model it as a Fermi sea of\ncomposite fermions coupled to an emergent gauge field. Within a random phase\napproximation, these theories predict that the Landau damping of the gauge\nfield resulting from its coupling to the low-energy, long-wavelength CF\nparticle-hole excitations modifies the electrons' density-density correlation\nfunction related to the static structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q$. This\nproduces a non-analytic correction $\\propto q^{3}\\ln q$ to $S(q)$ (with the\nmagnetic length $\\ell_{B}=1$). Thanks to the recently developed quaternion\nformulation for Jain-Kamilla projection of CF wave functions, the evaluation of\n$S(q)$ from the accurate microscopic theory of composite fermions has now\nbecome possible for systems containing as many as $N=900$ CFs, which enables a\nreliable determination of the small-$q$ behavior of $S(q)$.

Generative machine learning methods could\noffer much faster calorimeter shower simulations by directly emulating detector\nresponses. In this work, we present CaloDiT-2, a diffusion model which uses\ntransformer blocks. As is the case for other models explored for this task, it\ncan be applied to specific geometries, however its true strength lies in its\ngeneralisation capabilities. Our approach allows pre-training on multiple\ndetectors and rapid adaptation to new ones, which we demonstrate on the LEMURS\ndataset. It reduces the effort required to develop accurate models for novel\ndetectors or detectors which are under development and have geometries that are\nchanged frequently, requiring up to 25x less data and 20x less training time.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first pre-trained model to be\npublished that allows adaptation in the context of particle shower simulations,\nwith the model also included in the Geant4 toolkit. We also present results on\nbenchmarks on Dataset-2 from the community-hosted CaloChallenge, showing that\nour models provide one of the best tradeoffs between accuracy and speed from\nthe published models.

Charged black holes (BHs) in Einstein-Maxwell theory provide an\nexcellent example of a beyond-Kerr solution with direct astrophysical and\nfundamental physics applications. In this work, we extract the ringdown mode\namplitudes and phases for charged BBH mergers based on fully general\nrelativistic simulations with charge-to-mass ratio up to 0.3. Our results\nsuggest that even though the inspiral phase of charged BBHs can be\nsignificantly accelerated or decelerated, the ringdown mode excitation only\nchanges mildly. We further explore the charge detectability with the\nringdown-only signal for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We find\nthat previous studies may have overestimated the charge detectability and\nincluding higher modes in charged waveforms is necessary for future ringdown\nanalysis.

Studying the impact of inhomogeneous frequency\nbroadening and variations in atom-cavity coupling on the superradiant emission,\nwe find the laser properties robust with respect to such perturbations, also\nthanks to the occurrence of synchronization of the atomic dipoles.

We consider a 3+1D (resp.\\ 2+1D) system\nof two infinite parallel plates (resp.\\ wires) at a fixed distance from each\nother, with either perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) or perfect electric\nconductor (PEC) boundary conditions. Imposing the boundary conditions directly\nin the functional integral by the introduction of suitable auxiliary fields\nthat act as Lagrange multipliers, we obtain a boundary effective action that\ncaptures the dynamics of this system.

In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators\n(FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium\nquantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures\ntemporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of\ntime. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary\nlearning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting\nexpectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information\nspreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while\nattaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover,\nFNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different\ntemporal discretizations and system driving frequencies.

One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,\nwhich have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as\nwell as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to\npossess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and\ncritical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In\nthis work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study\nself-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show\nthat including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,\nwhich we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value\nproblem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,\nbut also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid\ncase, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the\naddition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\\mathrm{s}$ or\ndecreasing the Poisson ratio $\\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and\ncan yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the\nelastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible\ntransverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid\ncase can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not\nseem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters\nof the material.

Yet how these signatures relate\nto each other and the microscopic ground states-and how twist angle and band\nstructure reshape them-remains poorly understood. Here we study this interplay\nby correlating local thermodynamic and transport measurements in a twisted\ntrilayer graphene (TTG) sample with unequal angles and flat electronic bands.\nWe use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the impact of\nelectron-electron interactions in a region of the sample where the local twist\nangle evolves smoothly. We observe gapped correlated insulators and a sawtooth\nin electronic compressibility, both exhibiting pronounced electron-hole (e-h)\nasymmetry with distinct magic angles for conduction and valence bands.\nSubsequent transport measurements in the same region reveal robust\nsuperconductivity with a similar e-h asymmetry.

Our\nanalysis opens up potentially new directions for quantum cryptanalysis of other\nmultivariate systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf92-\u72ec\u7acb\u548c\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5728\u89e3\u51b3NP\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Yamakawa-Zhandry\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6c42\u89e3\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e38\u6570d>=2\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b3. \u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u4e3a3\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u968f\u673aoracle\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5b9aNP\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

A common\napproach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches\nbased on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are\nindeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread\napplication of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by\naccuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases,\nsuch as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is\nstructured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes\nof the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation\nof information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real\nproblems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as\nit is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be\npractical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of\ntechniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the\nnotion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process\ntensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door\nto the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a\nwide range of open quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Taken together, this frames\nthe model as a plausible setting for exploring how such devices may maintain\nmultiple alternatives in parallel, providing a formal framework for\ninvestigating internally coherent decision processes through coherent\nbranching, entanglement, and self-modifying unitary dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u90e8\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u3001\u5206\u652f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u5185\u7f6e\u4e8e\u81ea\u8eab\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u76f8\u514b\u9686\u5b9a\u7406\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u884c\u591a\u9009\u9879\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u6d3d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u8bbe\u5907\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Comments welcome", "summary": "In finite-dimensional systems, circuit knitting can be used to simulate\nnon-classical quantum operations using a limited set of resources. In this\nwork, we extend circuit knitting techniques to infinite-dimensional quantum\nsystems. We develop a general theoretical framework for simulating non-Gaussian\nstates from the given set of available states. Also, we establish fundamental\nconstraints with the no-go theorem on the circuit knitting of multi-mode\nGaussian operations, by showing that the exact knitting with separable\noperations requires infinite sampling overhead. We further explore several\napplications of our theory, including simulation of approximate Fock states,\nGKP state generation, and cat-state amplification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
